The concept proceeds from recognition of the fact that the economy of the Republic of Crimea is in a transitional phase both from the viewpoint of the formation of a market mechanism of operation and from the viewpoint of the creation of the conditions for an escape from the crisis. The main features of this transitional stage (transformational recession, according to Kornai) in Crimea are: transition from a supply economy to a demand economy; a drastic slump in production; inflation and hyperinflation; decline in real personal income; an investment crisis; change in the structure of foreign economic relations. The first proposition is reflected in the incapacity of the majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises of Crimea for independently undertaking marketing, drawing up business plans, and actively seeking solvent consumers of their products in Ukraine and abroad. Another expression of the proposition is the incapacity of state-owned enterprises to rationally distribute income in consumption and accumulation. Combined with Ukraine's official policy of limiting the supply of money (in addition to money and credit issue), this is causing a most acute reciprocal arrears crisis. The slump in production in Crimea could be characterized by the following figures. Production in industry as a whole in 1993 declined 11.5 percent compared with the 1992 level. In 1994 the decline in industrial production has accelerated appreciably. In January-April of this year the decline constituted 33.1 percent compared with the corresponding period of 1993. The greatest decline in production was observed at enterprises oriented toward imported raw material and intermediate products and sale of the finished product to countries of the CIS. This applies primarily to enterprises of chemical industry, light industry, and building materials industry. The slump has affected consumer goods production also. In terms of the most important item--food--production in 1993 declined 12.6 percent compared with 1992, and in four months of this year, 35.9 percent. Agricultural production has been slumping since 1990. At the present time Crimea's agriculture has been thrown back to the 1965-1970 level. The inflationary processes characteristic of all the postcommunist countries have in the past two years been developing rapidly in Ukraine and, particularly, in Crimea. In 1993 the wholesale prices of industrial products grew by a factor of 43. Prices of the products of fuel industry grew by a factor of 283 here, food industry, by a factor of 50, and fish industry, by a factor of 80. The retail price of foodstuffs in 1993 grew by a factor of 113, and of nonfood commodities, by a factor of 89. On account of the tightening of monetary policy in Ukraine, the increase in prices in Crimea has slowed considerably in 1994. In the first four months of the current year the prices of foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 1.5, of nonfood commodities, by a factor of 2.3. A consequence of the general economic crisis and hyperinflation in Crimea has been a sharp decline in society's living standard. Despite a growth in personal income in Crimea in 1993 by a factor of 28, including a growth in wages by a factor of 23, the price of goods and services grew by a factor of 60. Thus the personal living standard declined in one year by a factor of 2.5 approximately. Hyperinflation has hit employees of the publicly funded sphere and retirees particularly hard. Over 75 percent of the population of Crimea (according to official figures) has an income below the minimum consumer budget. The differentiation of society in terms of income has increased, but has not yet assumed Russian proportions. A most important ingredient of the general economic crisis in Ukraine and in Crimea has been the investment crisis. It is manifested primarily in the fact that the amount of capital investments is declining more rapidly than the volume of production. In 1993 capital investments declined 34 percent compared with the 1992 level and 51 percent compared with the 1991 level. Capital investments in production have been falling at a preferential rate here. Hyperinflation devalues funds allocated for investments within two or three months and makes it impossible to recharge them. The corrosion of the production potential that has been created and the postponement of the period of the movement of the economy of Crimea onto a production growth trajectory are the consequences of the investment crisis. The vast majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises of Crimea was created by ministries and departments of the former Union and functioned as part of the so-called national economic complex. Following the disintegration of the USSR, there was a severance of business ties, which exerted a particularly strong influence on the enterprises of Crimea oriented toward exports and the rendering of services chiefly to Russian structures. In 1993 Ukraine's share of Crimea's commodity turnover grew to 80 percent. Russia's share of the total commodity exchange of industrial engineering products declined more than threefold compared with 1991. A sharply negative balance of trade arose in Crimea in consequence. Some 2 trillion karbovantsy of industrial engineering products were imported into Crimea in 1993, some 432 billion karbovantsy were exported, that is, imports exceeded exports by a factor of 4.2, including consumer goods by a factor of 2.8. Considering the analysis that has been offered, the goals and tasks of economic policy of the Republic of Crimea should incorporate: stabilization of the socioeconomic situation in the Republic of Crimea and the creation of the base conditions for the emergence of the main sectors of the economy from crisis; the creation of the conditions for the progressive and stable development of the economy of the Republic of Crimea by way of the formation of stable and effective components of the market infrastructure. Basic Tasks of Economic Policy Considering the specifics of the socioeconomic and political situation in the Republic of Crimea, the concept proceeds from the fact that the set goals of economic policy may be realized if only in their essentials within a period of no fewer than four or five years. But the situation in the economy and the social sphere at the present time is such that the fundamental tasks must be tackled as quickly as possible--within a year. It is this that dictates the need for the implementation of transformations in two stages. At the first stage, which, it is surmised, will extend to mid-1995, it is contemplated securing a stabilization of the socioeconomic situation in the Republic of Crimea and accomplishing the following tasks: First, halting the decline in production at state-owned enterprises and stabilizing product manufacture at the maximum possible level corresponding to the level of demand and not requiring appreciable expenditures from the state budget. Second, stimulating a growth of production in the priority sectors of the economy with the aid of a system of targeted soft government loans or on the basis of interstate (between states of the CIS and the Baltic) commodity exchange agreements. Third, alleviating the negative socioeconomic consequences of the transitional period by way of the introduction of targeted subsidies for individual categories of the populace (thanks to a reduction in budget subsidies for the manufacturers of individual types of product). Fourth, beginning wide-ranging privatization in Crimea and creating the conditions for the development of private initiative. At the second stage it is contemplated ensuring the conditions for the progressive and stable development of the economy of the Republic of Crimea. The accomplishment of the following tasks is envisaged in the course of this stage: First, evolutionary structural changes in the economy and the laying of the foundations for the formation of the optimum structure of production thanks to an improvement in the system of the allocation of credit and the taxation of private investments and the creation of economic legislation conforming to market conditions. Second, completing privatization in Crimea, in the main. Third, introducing the conditions of "smooth" bankruptcy and providing for the privatization of state-owned enterprises not capable of functioning without budget subsidies. Fourth, overcoming the investment crisis and attracting private, including foreign, investments to the priority spheres of the economy on the basis of the political and economic stability that has been established in Crimea. Fifth, providing for the formation of a stable and efficient system of foreign economic relations of the Republic of Crimea. Means of Realization of the Set Goals The achievement of the set goals presupposes the pursuit of a consistent and balanced socioeconomic, structural, investment, and foreign trade policy that should be built on the basis of the optimum combination of state regulation of base economic processes and the development of market relations. The main means of realization of economic policy is law-making activity bolstered by measures of organizational and political support for the reforms. It is essential to take into consideration here the fact that the measures implemented at the first stage geared primarily to a stabilization of the socioeconomic situation of the country cannot be regarded as a final version of the reforms. At the same time they must not conflict with the strategic goals of economic policy. Proceeding from this, the proposed measures pertain chiefly to the first stage of the reforms and will be adjusted subsequently or continued, depending on the results that have been achieved and the revision (preservation) of the main reference points of economic policy. The implementation of the reforms will affect chiefly the currency-finance and budget sphere, investment activity, and the banking system and also foreign economic activity and the sphere of customs regulation. At the same time, on the other hand, it would be expedient, particularly at the first stage, to concentrate efforts on two basic problems: stabilization of the production sphere and the adoption to this end of emergency measures in the sphere of industrial and agricultural policy; the adoption of programs of social support for the populace. Measures To Stabilize the Production Sphere The main directions of industrial and agricultural policy are dictated by the need to halt the slump in production and to alleviate the negative consequences of structural reorganization in sectors of the production sphere. These tasks, while essentially local, will determine, nonetheless, the success of all the strategic designs of the Government of the Republic of Crimea. Despite the diversity of causes of the crisis in the production sphere, it is proposed putting the emphasis in industrial and agricultural policy on a resolution of the following problems: an improvement in financial and tax legislation and the conditions of foreign economic activity; the establishment of business relations between enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and the suppliers of material and technical resources from other countries of the CIS and the Baltic; an improvement in the system of centralized and commercial lending; the replenishment of enterprises' financial resources. An improvement in financial and tax legislation and also the conditions of foreign economic activity is an essential condition of the stabilization in Crimea of sectors of industry and the national economy. It is planned in the sphere of taxation to implement a set of measures for easing the tax burden. These measures will include a gradual lowering of the tax rate (this applies primarily to value-added tax and profits tax), a limitation of the number of levyable types of tax, a simplification of the taxation procedure, and the establishment of preferential tax rates for individual subjects of economic activity. The government intends simultaneously implementing measures to reinforce the tax system. Currency legislation requires a certain liberalization. The first steps in this direction have already been taken. Nonetheless, the general approach to the problem of expansion of the circulation of foreign currencies in cash and noncash form should be balanced and cautious. It is essential to consider that substantial numbers of the population of Crimea are employed in the publicly funded sphere and that retirees have income that is almost exclusively in the national currency of Ukraine. In the sphere of regulation of foreign economic activity it is essential to switch to a more simplified procedure of the issue of licenses for export-import transactions and to shorten the list of commodities subject to export restrictions. The system of accounting for the results of economic activity of enterprises of all types of ownership, specifically, the current procedure of attribution of outlays to production costs, requires improvement. It is impossible to restore the business ties of enterprises without serious state support, the sense of which amounts to the creation of a guaranteed market of goods and services. As already observed, the balance of production and consumption in the republic is shaping up such that a substantial part of the gross product passes through foreign trade channels. Negotiations and the conclusion of agreements at government level with other states of the CIS and the Baltic on reciprocal supplies of commodities in accordance with an agreed product list could be a principal step, therefore, in the creation of a stable market for the products manufactured and consumed by enterprises of Crimea. The government should contribute to the creation at state-owned enterprises of a modern service for marketing and the compilation of business plans and systems of determination of the economic efficiency of investment projects. This also should contribute to the establishment of business ties between enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and suppliers and consumers of their products in countries of the CIS, the Baltic, and the far abroad. Reciprocal supplies in accordance with intergovernmental agreements could be undertaken not only by state-owned but also private enterprises, and enterprises and firms could be enlisted in the fulfillment of supplies on a competitive basis, what is more. At the same time it would be expedient for the Government of the Republic of Crimea, when negotiating, to proceed from the commodity flows that had been established prior to the crisis and in whose preservation both the governments and the local authorities of other states are interested. This would predetermine the enlistment in the fulfillment of the said supplies chiefly of state-owned enterprises that have an established list of manufactured products. It is essential in parallel to stimulate the establishment of direct business ties between enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and their partners in other states. The officially approved formats of the supply of vegetables and fruit to the northern parts of Russia and the sale of passes for health center-resort treatment directly at enterprises of other republics could constitute a basis for such mutual relations. An improvement in the system of centralized and commercial lending presupposes primarily the organization of a negotiating process between the Government of Ukraine and the National Bank of Ukraine for the normalization of the allocation to Crimea of credit resources at the effective discount rate. At the present time the National Bank makes resources available to the ministries and departments, which then channel them to the enterprises. Under these conditions an acute shortage of credit resources has come about in Crimea, and there is a large gap between the discount and commercial lending rate. As a result of the negotiating process Crimea, as a region, should obtain a certain quota of centralized credit resources of Ukraine. These resources should be distributed by the Republic Bank of Crimea in the priority directions determined by the Government of Crimea. The commercial banks, via which the credit resources would be channeled to the consumers, must not raise the National Bank of Ukraine rate above the margin established by the Republic Bank of Crimea. The shortage of financial resources of the enterprises may be overcome by use of the system of the preferential financing and stimulation of commodity-exchange transactions. The system of preferential financing should differ fundamentally from that employed earlier in Ukraine and in Russia, in accordance with which financial resources were allocated from the state budget via the central banks at an artificially low rate. It is proposed putting the main emphasis on the attraction of the financial resources of the commercial banks, not only Crimean but also those of Ukraine, Russia, and other states of the CIS, what is more, at the market interest rate with compensation for the difference between the current and preferential credit rate from resources of the state budget. The recipient enterprise must guarantee here repayment of the credit subsidies from an increase in taxes paid to the treasury. The level of the preferential rate will be established at the time of the adoption of the budget of the Republic of Crimea with regard to the priority nature of the sectors of the national economy. Considering the limited possibilities of the republic budget, the agro-industrial complex should remain a most important sphere of soft loans. The stimulation of commodity-exchange transactions is a forced step partially compensating for Crimean enterprises' lack of financial resources. The system of stimulation should be structured predominantly on the basis of the granting of commodity-exchange tax privileges if the "product for raw material components" or "product for production engineering equipment" exchange format is observed. In this case the losses of the state budget in the granting of these privileges would be partially or even fully compensated thanks to the increased taxes from the growth of the production of the enterprises in receipt of these privileges. The broad-based privatization of enterprises of state and municipal ownership should begin in Crimea at the first stage. It would be expedient beginning the privatization with small and medium-sized enterprises. It is essential in the organization of the privatization process to take account of the interests both of the work force and of persons employed in the publicly funded sphere and retirees with registered privatization accounts (vatsily). It would be expedient in the privatization of large-scale properties to organize investment bids to attract additional funds for their reconstruction and development. Privatization should lend new impetus to the development of Crimea's enterprises, increase the interest of the work force in the results of their activity, stimulate the more rational distribution of the newly created value, and increase the rate of savings in profits. The broad-based privatization of the land and also properties of the recreational sphere is not contemplated at the first stage of implementation of the reforms in Crimea. The anticipated result of the proposed measures is the restoration of business ties of the enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and a partial resolution of the problem of arrears and the lack of financial resources. The expenditure of the state budget on implementation of the said measures would be negligible and would not exceed the current level of subsidies for the public sector. Time of implementation--within the first stage of the reforms, with subsequent adjustment.
