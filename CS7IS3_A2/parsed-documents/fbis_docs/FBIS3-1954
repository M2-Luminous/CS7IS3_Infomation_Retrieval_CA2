Going down to grass-roots units to conduct investigations and studies is a regular task to which the Central Military Commission has asked all high-ranking military cadres to attach importance. High-ranking cadres of the Army have visited islands, companies, and border areas to discover problems, analyze problems, solve problems, attain a thorough understanding of construction at basic-level units, and guide reform and construction there under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought on Army building in the new period. To meet the objective needs of establishing a socialist market economic structure and the objective needs of Army building in China, in the past year the leadership of the three general departments of the Army and the various services under the major military regions have begun to carry out systematic comprehensive investigations and studies aimed at increasing the Army's combat capability: The General Staff Department has focused on investigations in connection with the training reform and administration of the Army in the new period, the General Political Department has organized cadres to stay at selected units to conduct studies on how to improve ideological work and political work in organizational construction and military training under the conditions of a market economy, and the General Logistics Department has sent out seven investigation and study groups. They have traveled 75,000 km to carry out a thorough investigation of the basic living conditions and the planning and administration of budgets and materials in military units; the Air Force, the Navy, the Secondary Artillery Corps; the National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission, and the major military regions have carried out investigations into the conditions of special projects involving 100 company leaders, 100 commanders, and soldiers who are only sons or daughters. Their investigation and study achievements have served as the basis for high-level, accurate, and scientific decision-making by Army authorities. Being approved by the Central Military Commission and revised by the three general departments, the "Outline for Army Building in Grass-Roots Units" was promulgated last year for trial implementation by the whole Army. This programmatic document for guiding grass-roots Army building for now and in the days to come was produced on the basis of extensive investigations and studies and of pooling the wisdom of the whole Army. Taking the mass line, high-ranking cadres of the Army have listened to the suggestions of officers and men and have helped grass-roots units solve practical problems as if these were their own problems. The General Logistics Department has adopted measures such as giving preferential treatment to basic-level units, especially those in remote, frontier, and difficult areas; ensuring that their expenses are met and that they are provided with work guidance; and making overall plans and comprehensive efforts to focus on solving the problems of drinking water, housing, heating, electricity, and medical care for these areas. By the end of last year, more than 1 million officers and men of the Army had moved into new, modern barracks. Housing conditions for over 60 percent of the officers and men of basic-level military units have improved. From May to July last year, under the leadership of the General Logistics Department, a medical team was sent to Xinjiang to provide physical examinations to officers and men of companies guarding the first line of defense in the border areas. The Lanzhou and Jinan Military Regions have also sent office cadres to companies to ensure that basic-level cadres can take liberty on schedule. The Guangzhou Military Region has set up "military baby stations" and "military baby schools" in Haikou and Nanning to provide jobs for the children of cadres of units stationed on islands and in border areas. By going down to basic-level units to carry out investigations and studies, high-ranking Army cadres have laid down the foundation for overcoming subjectivism in work, improving leadership style and office work style, and consolidating and strengthening the Army. To cope with the problems of too many emulation campaigns, registers, and forms for statistical reports in the Army, the General Staff, General Political, and General Logistics Departments recently issued a joint circular on further streamlining the number of activities, registers, and report forms in the Army. The circular clearly states that in the future, leading organs at all levels should not, in principle, convene on-the-spot meetings at military units and that leading organs must reduce to the minimum the number of forms for statistical reports used for the purpose of keeping track of the situation. When such report forms are needed, in general the basic- level units should not be required to fill in the form themselves.
