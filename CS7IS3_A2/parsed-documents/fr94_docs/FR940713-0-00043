FR940713-0-00043 FR940713-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 070694A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category in the Aleutian Islands subarea (AI) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the sharpchin/northern rockfish total allowable catch (TAC) in the AI. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Sloan, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii) the sharpchin/northern TAC for the AI was established by the final groundfish specifications (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) as 4,820 metric tons (mt). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), that the sharpchin/northern rockfish TAC in the AI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 4,320 mt, with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the AI. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category in the AI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., July 7, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 7, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
