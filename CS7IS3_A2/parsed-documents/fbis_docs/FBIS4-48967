The people on both sides of the strait feel the same pain for the unfortunate deaths of the compatriots; they are happy that the case has been solved; and compatriots on both sides of the strait are similarly indignant at the crime perpetrated by the suspects. The feelings of our fraternal compatriots cannot be separated. None of the compatriots on both sides of the strait wanted this unfortunate incident to happen. However, the unfortunate incident has happened. After the grief, the first important thing to do should be to try every means to quickly crack the case and to punish the criminals in order to calm the people's indignation. In fact, the public security departments and other relevant organs in Zhejiang have acted in this way. Under the concern of the Central Committee and the State Council and with the vigorous assistance of the masses, the public security cadres and police worked very hard and cracked the case in 17 days. The people on both sides of the strait felt some relief after hearing this. However, people have also noticed that after the incident occurred, excitement lingered for quite a while on the island of Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities and the "Taiwan independence" movement seized the opportunity to exaggerate matters and create incidents. Before the case was investigated, they spread all kinds of rumors, created public opinion, and unscrupulously fanned resentment among the people, and after exploiting the incident again and again, they turned a criminal case into a political matter, thus whipping up quite a big upsurge in undermining cross-strait relations. People have noticed that a person of high standing in Taiwan shouted abuse at the Communist Party by employing remarks that have not been used in decades. This was clearly an incident committed by bad people, but some people slandered the mainland authorities as "treating human life as if it were not worth a straw and ignoring human rights." This was followed by calls for the temporary suspension of the tourism trade, of commerce, of exchanges, and of cross-strait talks on routine matters, as well as calls for "a boycott" and "sanctions." A small number of "Taiwan independence" elements, thinking that there was an opportunity to exploit, once again openly called for "Taiwan independence." People cannot but ask: What do they want? The answer is clear: They want to undermine the good relations between the two sides of the strait. Developing cross-strait relations to realize peaceful reunification is the common desire of the people on both sides of the strait. In the past few years, it was the common efforts of the people of both sides that have enabled cross-strait relations to develop rapidly. However, it should also be noted that there are some people who go against the desire of the masses. These people do not want to see cross-strait relations continue to develop. They invariably try to find some pretext to stop the relations from developing. After the "Qiandao Lake incident" occurred, they thought that they had found an opportunity to exaggerate matters. Therefore, they brought all their skill into play and staged a vivid performance. However, their performance has thoroughly exposed their true features of undermining the relations between the two sides of the strait. It should be pointed that some people on the island who did not know the truth acted too excitedly or made excessively improper remarks because of their indignation over the criminals. This is normal human nature. Their frame of mind is understandable. However, there are a small number of people with ulterior motives who vainly attempted to exploit the incited sentiments to realize their despicable purpose of undermining cross-strait relations. The people on both sides of the strait should heighten their vigilance against their scheme. It is the trend of the times and the desire of the people to realize the peaceful reunification between both sides of the strait. No force can obstruct historical currents. To accomplish the great cause of the reunification of the motherland, the compatriots on both sides of the strait have made unremitting efforts; they have done a great deal of work to promote fruitful interaction through cross-strait relations. Indeed, it has not been easy for cross-strait relations to expand to the present level. All people who hope to see China reunified should cherish cross-strait relations even more and should never allow them to be undermined. A saying goes, "Green hills cannot be hidden, and rivers will flow into the sea." The relations between both sides of the strait were established by hard work by the fraternal compatriots on both sides. Any scheme to undermine the relations will be unpopular.
