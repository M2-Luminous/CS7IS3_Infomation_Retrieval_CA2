Chamorro B., director of BARRICADA] [Text] Both before and after the FSLN's [Sandinist National Liberation Front] Special Congress took place, secret discussions on BARRICADA's future were held in political circles. It is wrongly believed that there is an automatic correlation between the results of that public event and the fate of the program already started by this newspaper. I think this is a mistaken premise and propose an alternative viewpoint to the reader. BARRICADA was born as the official mouthpiece of a political party, the FSLN, and functioned as as partisan institution until January 1991. After that time, when the FSLN National Directorate approved its revamping, it became an autonomous journalistic institution with democratic principles, committed to serve professional journalism so as to strengthen its influence on and credibility with society. It autonomy as a newspaper company is regulated by its Board of Directors and Editorial Council. All proposals for change, therefore, must proceed from the recognition that BARRICADA is not the extension of a partisan apparatus subject to redefinition along party line's but a newspaper that is becoming institutionalized and whose own dynamics constitute the main reference point for its strategy. The newspaper that has promoted modernization of the press in Nicaragua is obligated to be in constant self-review in order to improve. It is not afraid of changes but rather promotes them, although it feels they must not be dictated behind the people's backs or exclude protagonists who make up the newspaper: its journalists, workers, assistants, etc. An open, participatory, and public discussion of the contribution BARRICADA has been making to the overall democratization of our country is in order. Nicaraguan society as a whole, and not just one or another faction within the FSLN, has something to gain or lose, depending on the kind of changes that are introduced in this newspaper. Based on experience, I am saying that the option to undo what has been done lacks all viability. Without meaning to exhaust the topic, for the time being I only want to focus on two points that are indispensable for BARRICADA's continued advance. a) Sealing a commitment to the reader. In jest and in earnest, I often tell the newspaper staff that our mission is to "not get on anyone's good side except the reader's." That commitment to the reader, summarized in the rigorous effort to report the truth regardless of whether it helps or harms us politically, is the only thing that can ensure that BARRICADA will last as an long-term news instituiton. A newspaper perceived as mirroring the interests of a pressure group or a faction within that group that establishes its agenda and the black holes of that agenda has no future in a democratic society, in a competitive system. It will never go beyond being a medium for the faithful. It may be formally combative but will have little effect in its mission of persuading others. That is why we must stress with the quality of our daily work that our most important commitment -- I repeat, regardless of our preferences and interests -- is to the reader. It does not matter what pressures must be faced; we must defend the reader's right to be well-informed and hear independent opinions. BARRICADA has made a lot of progress in this field. Its professional prestige and credibility constitute its greatest political asset. We are not subject to personal loyalties but to professional and ethical principles, and that should out of necessity draw us closer to the reader, producing journalism that does more good and service to the people each day. b) National interests and democracy. BARRICADA's basic commitment to the defense of national interests entails adopting a clear position in the face of reality, never a passive or neutral attitude. That means placing on the national agenda serious problems like poverty, socioeconomic exclusion, ownership, and the safety of citizens, and taking sides in solving them from a standpoint that benefits the low-income majority and makes the viability of the country possible. Real scrutiny of public and private powers demands good journalism that will marshal opinions and actions against public corruption and also oversee the proper functioning of private forces, political parties, unions, and social movements in line with the goals they have announced to society. Nobody should escape the scrutiny of the press. Defending the common citizen and his individual rights is part of a crusade to give voice to those who have no other means of expressing themselves and does not grant concessions to the powerful and the state. Supporting just social and mass struggles is inherent to our principles. The exercise of journalism from a democratic conviction entails as an obligation the promotion of a pluralist debate that helps eradicate the culture of violence and slurs. We cannnot fall prey to sectarian journalism. To sow and practice dialogue, tolerance, and respect for the opinion of minorities constitutes one of the consubstantial values of democracy. But if we do not acknowledge the rise of new voices and social protagonists we will engender a debate limited to the elites. In addition, we have an unequivocal commitment to face the lack of participation of this society without which representative democracy will always be ineffectual in finding a solution to the major national problems. These are some of the current editorial challenges facing BARRICADA that may be summarized in a strong conviction: a profound transformation in the nation's political culture is imperative so that democracy can be truly irreversible.
