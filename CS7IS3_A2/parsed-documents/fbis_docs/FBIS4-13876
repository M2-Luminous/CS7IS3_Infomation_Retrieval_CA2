Corruption in Egypt LABOR PARTY CRITICIZES EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B carries a 350-word report on a statement issued by the Labor Party Political Bureau commenting on the People's Assembly's extension of the Emergency Law for another three years effective 1 June 1994. The statement says that "the only justification which the government has made for extending the emergency law is fighting terrorism." The statement notes, however, that acts of terrorism have actually increased and escalated under the emergency law, which goes to prove "that this law is one of the reasons for the growth of the phenomenon of terrorism in Egypt." The statement adds that one of the aims of the Emergency Law is to "weaken the opposition forces" in the coming People's Assembly and local councils elections. The statement further notes that this law "conflicts" with the government's call for a national dialogue. AL-AHRAM BANS PUBLICATION OF FAHMI HUWAYDI'S COLUMN AL-SHA'B carries a front-page 50-word report that "a column by Fahmi Huwaydi that the newspaper AL-AHRAM publishes regularly every Tuesday has been banned." The reports adds that the banning of the column "Dialogue on the Application of the Shar'iah" comes in the wake of the recent campaign against this writer, a campaign that has culminated in the publication of two articles in Al-ARAM by two of Huwaydi's colleages. CONFERENCE ON MINORITIES IN THE ARAB WORLD A 250-word report on pages 1 and 7 says Sudan has officially asked Egypt to prevent the holding of a conference on "Minorities in the Arab World" due to be held in Cairo in May. The conference has been called at the urging of the rebel leaders in Southern Sudan. A letter reportedly sent by Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu Salih to Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa expresses concern over the aims of the conference "in light of the foreign plots and designs aimed partitioning Sudan." WRITER BLAMES GOVERNMENT FOR VIOLENCE A 2,000-word article on page 3 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im says the Egyptian government has resorted to "crude repression" of its political opponents while opting for peace in dealing with the "criminal Jews." The writer says "Egypt is living through the most critical phase of its history," and adds that "for the first time we see Egyptians fighting each other and blood being spilled everywhere." The writer notes that like all the states of the region, Egypt is witnessing "an overwhelming Islamic awakening" affecting all aspects of life and that "society is gradually turning toward Islam." The writer says the Islamic movement in Egypt is the strongest in the region in view of its history and long experience. The Islamic movement "aims to establish an Islamic state." The writer adds that "despite the propaganda campaign against it, the Islamic Group [al-jama'ah al-islamiyah] enjoys widespread support in the quarters where it is active." 'ADIL HUSAYN ARTICLE COMMENTS ON EMERGENCY LAW EXTENSION A 2,000-word article on page 7 by Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn deals mainly with the People's Assembly's extension of the Emergency Law for another three years. Husayn wonders why the People's Assembly hurriedly approved this extension, given that the current law expires in two months. Acknowledging that the extension is a reality and that nothing can be done about it, he asks the Government to adhere to the provisions of this "black law which, despite its ugliness, does not permit the torture of detainees." After noting that torture has become widespread and systematic in Egyptian prisons, he says "this fascistic torture is not allowed by the Emergency Law" and "this continuing detention of the thousands--despite court release orders--is a blatant violation of the emergency law." Rebutting as "misleading" the government's argument that the emergency law is solely intended for use against terrorists and does not target ordinary citizens or political opponents, Husayn cites the "indiscriminate" arrest of citizens and the months-long siege of entire cities. He also cites the arrest and intimidation of citizens who attend opposition party congresses and rallies. Husayn concludes that the continuation of the emergency law since 1981 is not intended to confront "armed violence" but to spread "general fear" and "muzzle" the opposition. CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE A 500-word report by Khalid Yunis on AL-SHA'B's page 4 says "The Egyptian Committee in Support of the Palestinian People's Struggle" held its second conference at the Lawyers Association on 12 April. Addressing the conference, Labor Party's Ibrahim Shukri said "Israel was planted in the region" to break the Arab and Islamic ranks. He reviewed Israel's "belligerent" practices from its destruction of the Iraqi nuclear reactor to its attacks on southern Lebanon, noting that Israel enjoys the "absolute support" of the United States, which supplies it with the most sophisticated weapons. Shukri denounced the Arab governments' harassment of the Palestinians regarding their movement and work. Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called "for the need to adopt practical steps to support the struggling Palestinian people." He noted that the PLO-Israeli Government agreement aims at "ending the intifadah at the hands of the Palestinian force which will replace the occupation forces." Al-Hudaybi noted that Egyptian television played down the Hebron massacre while it highlighted the interview with former al-Shawqiyun terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, whom he describes as an "intelligence agent." RISE OF ISLAMIC INFLUENCE IN TURKEY A 250-word report on page 8 says the Islamic Welfare Party in Turkey has organized a huge demonstration in Istanbul to protest the "massacre" of Muslims in Bosnia. The 5,000 demonstrators called on the Turkish Government and the Islamic states to sever relations with the Yugoslav Federation. They also marched to the U.S. Consulate and pelted it with stones. The report notes the Welfare Party's victory in the recent municipal elections in Ankara, Istanbul, and other Turkish towns. IRAN SUPPORTS PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR EFFORTS A 500-word report on page 8 by Ayman 'Ali cites a speech that Iranian Consultative Assembly Speaker 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri delivered to the Pakistani Parliament recently. Nateq-Nuri said that "the West is trying to put pressure on the Islamic states so that they will remain at its mercy." He affirmed "Iran's support for Pakistan's nuclear efforts," denounced the pressure on Islamabad to abandon its nuclear program, and asked "why is Israel not coming under the same pressure?" CORRUPTION IN EGYPT AL-SHA'B carries a 1250-word report on page 9 which says that on 12 April the Youth Committee of the Lawyers Association discussed a paper submitted to it by AL-SHA'B Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn on corruption in Egypt. In his paper, Husayn says "political corruption" is the most serious because it directly affects society and becomes an example to others and a way of life. He adds that "when the higher leadership entrusted with fighting corruption itself becomes corrupt, society enters a vicious circle." As for social corruption, it is manifested by the spread of financial and administrative corruption in society, which makes it difficult for citizens to earn an honest living. Hence, breaking the law becomes a rule of survival. As for moral corruption, it is similar to political corruption. The state-owned media encourage this corruption, which is apparent in the legalizing of alcohol, gambling, houses of prostitution, and pornographic films. Husayn attributes the spread of political corruption to several factors, the most important of which is the absence of real democracy since 1981. Consequently, a ruling class has emerged that has no clear message and whose only concern is to remain in power. On the ways of stopping the wheel of corruption, Husayn calls for the passing of a law on prosecuting ministers and strengthening the independence of the courts. Muslim Brotherhood Representative Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud then spoke about the importance of education as a way to reform. This includes training the "soul to fight vice through hand, mouth, and heart." However, he added, it seems that "fighting vice by word of mouth" has become every difficult now that the press has been muzzled and in view of the restrictions on the printing of magazines and publications. Husayn Jabir Muhammad and Muntasir al-Zayyat spoke on behalf of the Islamic Group. Muhammad noted that the root cause of corruption is the "separation between state and religion and the non-application of the Islamic shari'ah." Al-Zayyat referred to the importance of upholding morals in addition to legal measures to prevent the spread of corruption. Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi called on the various parties and trends to put aside their differences and concentrate on fighting corruption.
