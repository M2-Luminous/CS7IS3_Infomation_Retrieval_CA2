In those letters, the signatories express the wish that the respective parties should participate in the talks initiated by President Ion Iliescu, within a joint delegation of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. On the same issue, Romania's president also received a letter signed by Mr. Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic Convention of Romania, in which he announces the composition of the delegation. In connection with these letters, the communique notes the following: Since the invitations for participation in talks were sent out, Romania's president showed readiness to meet with the political parties represented in the parliament in the way the respective parties decide to choose. Initially the president of Romania intended to arrange a meeting with all these parties. Considering that the political parties that are included in the CDR expressed their wish to come individually to the talks, the president agreed to organize the talks in this way, proposing that the talks should take place before 1 January 1994. However, most parties that are CDR members preferred to come to talks after New Year's eve. In the past days a false fuss has been created about the participation of parties included in the CDR to the talks, the invoked pretext was the declaration of the president's spokesman made on 7 January 1994. The respective statements referred to the bantering declarations made by Mr. Constantinescu about the talks initiated by the president -- the CDR president anticipating the sure failure of those talks -- blended with offending statements about the head of the state. Such declarations are even more difficult to understand since they come from a person who aspires to play a certain role in the country's political life and considering that they show disregard for an elementary rule of democracy, namely the respect due to the institutions of the state. As a mater of fact, those assessments lack any politeness and are rude even to the parties that are included in the convention and had already accepted talks with Romania's president. The received letters indicate a change of position of the parliamentary parties that are included in the convention, as far as the formula of participation in talks is concerned. The president does accept the new formula but does not accept the pretext invoked for this change of position. The exact date of the meeting will be convened by the Presidency's adequate department, reads, in conclusion, the press communique received by the Radio from the Romanian Presidency's spokesman.
