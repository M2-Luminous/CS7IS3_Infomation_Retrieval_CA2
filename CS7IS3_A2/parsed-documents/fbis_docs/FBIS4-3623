[passage omitted] Chen Xitong listened attentively to the speeches given by the deputies and took notes. He said: The deputies have given many good opinions and suggestions. To promote Beijing's work, the wisdom and concerted efforts of the deputies and the people of Beijing are indispensable. This year, Beijing should put stability in the first place. Stability is the prerequisite. We should resolutely safeguard the political and social stability of the capital. Without a stable and united situation, reform cannot be conducted, nor can development be achieved. Speaking on the medical system, Chen Xitong said: The reform of the medical system should be coordinated with the endeavor to accelerate establishment of the social security system. The principle of the reform is to actively protect people's health and change the past practice of eating form the common big pot and letting the state take care of everything into the practice that burdens are shared by various fields of society together. Chen Xitong emphasized: We should earnestly address the specific problems in people's live, ensure the steady improvement of their living standard, and, in particular, improve the conditions of difficult plants, difficult shops, difficult schools, difficult households, and poverty-stricken households in mountainous areas. We should help them reduce deficits and increase profits. Speaking on improvement of literary and art organizations, Chen Xitong said: Municipal leaders should go deep into literary and art organizations to conduct investigation and study, find out problems, and work out ways to address them. Literary and art organizations should, on the one hand, conduct reform and, on the other, continuously improve their artistic quality and create the literary and art works that are loved by the masses so that the literary and art stages of the capital can be made more flourish.
