President Ramiro de Leon Carpio threatened today to turn over the transportation routes to new companies if the strike is not lifted, but the strikers insist on maintaining it until the government agrees to approve a new regulation for the sector that would enable it to increase its profits. More than 40 percent of gas stations have been left without fuel in the capital and the interior, according to estimates of the National Transportation Coordinating Board (CNT), which organized the strike. This means the country might be at a standstill before the weekend. Urban transportation, which is not participating in the movement, has, nevertheless, had to reduce services to maintain fuel reserves. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Industries and other business organizations have urged the parties to resume the dialogue. The transporters are asking for an increase in rates and greater profit margins as well as new regulations for their sector. The government has not officially replied to the demands, though Finance Minister Ana Molina has said "five points have already been accepted." She did not specify the points. Meanwhile, government workers have begun a staggered strike to demand higher salaries, increasing the pressure on President de Leon Carpio. Local observers believe the government suffered a political setback on 30 January with the results of a referendum that approved a series of reforms promoted by the government but that registered an 85-percent rate of abstention, which has cast doubt on the legitimacy of the changes.
