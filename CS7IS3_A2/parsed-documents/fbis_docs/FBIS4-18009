[Saburov] As for the government, there is one big difficulty here. We may differ in our attitude to the "empire" but it needs to be said that it had one very unpleasant quality: The center worked like a vacuum cleaner. If an intelligent specialist appeared somewhere in the provinces, he soon ended up in Moscow. Therefore I have been confronted with the task of attracting good cadres. For instance, Economy Minister Andrey Vasilyevich Chernyavskiy is one of the best forecasters in Russia. The economic analysis he has provided throughout the entire course of reform is valued very highly. Lyudmila Mikhaylovna Zaytseva -- a fairly prominent Russian economist, who has dealt with public finances -- in other words, what in socialist jargon was called the social sphere -- has agreed to become finance minister. [passage omitted] [Pasyakin] How do you relate to the fact that the Ukrainian president's representative has been sent to Crimea? After all, his emergence means effectively the formation of a third branch of power. [Saburov] The current situation in Crimea is absolutely fantastic. Elections have been held; a legitimate head of the executive branch has been elected; and after all this a Ukrainian presidential representative is appointed.... This is legal nonsense. If he is the executive branch, then apparently the results of the elections in Crimea are not recognized. [Pasyakin] What is the situation in Crimea at present? What is your action program for the near future? [Saburov] Crimea is currently reminiscent of a sinking ship. The economic reform program provides for improving financial relations with Russia, promoting banking, elaborating an optimal privatization program, revising the tax system, attracting foreign investors, and so forth. But for economic reform to be successful, a minimum favorable political climate is needed. The complicated situation in Crimea is a serious obstacle to reform. [Pasyakin] Presumably, pursuing unorthodox economic reform in Crimea calls for certain boldness? [Saburov] We shall have to resort to unpopular measures to lead the economy out of the deadlock. This will naturally cause discontent. Yet they cannot be rejected for this reason only. It is enough to recall Ludwig Erhard, the classic example of brilliant reform in post-war Germany. Everybody criticized him but he did not turn off his path.
