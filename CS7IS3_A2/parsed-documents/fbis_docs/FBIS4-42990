That must be the starting point. Our security and prosperity depend on what happens on our own continent. Withdrawal from its leading institution -- the European Union [EU] -- is the stuff of an entertaining polemic, but unreal. The real question, and a vital one for Conservatives, is how to achieve the kind of Europe we can feel at ease with. We want it to deliver tangible benefits for the citizen, while respecting the identity and legitimacy of the nation state. Few people in Britain would dissent from that. On June 9 there is a choice between two different ideas of Europe. The Conservative Party believes in closer European cooperation. We seek it in order to deliver specific benefits which are beyond the reach of individual nation states. Unlike our opponents, we believe that the EU already has the competences it needs. We are saying that the areas of policy which go to the heart of the nation state -- like taxes, the currency, immigration, and foreign policy -- must remain governed by the national veto. We are clear that Europe is strengthened by bringing the nation states to work together rather than by fusing them into a federal European state. We have had a rough argument inside the Conservative Party over Maastricht. We differed on whether the Treaty, as signed by Britain with the opt-outs, was a help or a hindrance to our idea of Europe. That argument is in the past. I have found in this campaign, from Aberdeen to Surrey, that when we discuss the future, the overwhelming majority of Conservatives come together. For months I have been hopefully predicting this -- so it is a relief to find it coming true! The Labour and Liberal vision of Europe is different. They see no objection in principle to further transfers of power to the centre. Their equivocation over the national veto testifies to that. The Liberals even reject the Maastricht idea of flexible cooperation between governments outside the scope of the European Commission and the European Court of Justice. The divide over economic policy is also clear. Conservatives are working for budgetary discipline, deregulation, labour market flexibility and the lightening of costs on business. Labour and Liberals are committed to a Social Chapter whose only certain effect would be to destroy British jobs, along with a raft of extra spending on proposals which would punish Europe's taxpayers. The arguments here are familiar from our own domestic politics -- a choice between jobs and enterprise on the one hand and socialism on the other. That is what we mean by Europe -- Right or Left? One of the odd things about politics is the way an argument suddenly reaches a wide audience some time after it is first stated. It is good news that the Prime Minister regained the initiative for Conservatives with his speech last Tuesday [31 May] about a multi-track Europe. It is a thought which he and others of us have expounded before. It was a main theme of my speech at the Scottish Party conference on May 11. It is a statement of reality. Britain has troops in Bosnia alongside the French, Spaniards Dutch and some, but not all, other Europeans. We belong to the Western European Union -- others don't. Britain is among the pioneers of a common European foreign policy based on unanimity and cooperation between governments. Where we can agree, it makes sense to act together. We do not belong to the Schengen arrangement on frontiers. We do not belong to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. We are not committed to a single bank or a single currency. But we are not alone in any of these positions. This flexibility is already part of the Europe of nations working together -- and will be even more so as the European Union slowly expands to the East. The next question is: Does the European Parliament matter enough to vote for? The answer is yes. The Parliament has important powers to amend EC laws, along with a new blocking power in certain areas. It has new powers to scrutinise EC spending, to deal with fraud, to call the European Commission to account, and to approve its appointment. It must also give its assent to the admission of new members. We need it to work with us for the next five years -- not against us, as it does now with its Left-wing majority. That means that we need more Conservative MEPs [member of European Parliament] in Strasbourg. To increase the influence of the Centre-Right, they are allied -- not joined -- to the Parliamentary group of the European Peoples Party with which we see eye-to-eye on such issues as free enterprise, budgetary restraint, law and order, and the Atlantic alliance. The arrangement makes good practical sense. But Conservative MEPs are standing exclusively on our British Conservative manifesto which explicitly rejects the idea of a federal European state. There are now unmistakable signs of a shift away from the centralising consensus which has hitherto underpinned the Community. This change of climate is becoming apparent across Europe. There are several reasons. The influence of the Commission looks set to wane as Jacques Delors steps down and the member states reclaim the political initiative. In France and Germany we are seeing a more assertive mood from national politicians in response to real public concern about Europe. Chancellor Kohl explains why it is a mistake to follow the American analogy and talk of a United States of Europe. The new Italian government brings a different international pedigree to its attitude to Europe. We are already seeing some real change in the way the European Union works. The number of legislative proposals has been more than halved -- between 1991 and 1993. The Commission estimates that 25 per cent of all existing law can now be simplified or scrapped. Meanwhile, Europe's economic script is being rewritten around our theme of deregulation and competitiveness, with Germany eager to claim co-authorship. So we have everything to gain by arguing from centre-stage. There is plenty of tough argument ahead. The Commission is still inserting itself into too many of the nooks and crannies. The old-fashioned notion that the good European is one who believes in the constant transfer of power to the centre in Brussels still holds sway in some political establishments -- as it does with the Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties here. But we should not underestimate our influence. We did not win the battles for the Single Market, budgetary discipline, subsidiarity, intergovernmental co-operation and EU enlargement by sulking on the sidelines. For the next intergovernmental conference in 1996 we need to work out a coherent framework for an enlarged union -- one which paves the way for a flexible, multi-speed Europe formed around a solid core of common policies and rules. This is the only model which will enable us to build the new democracies of Central and East Europe into our enterprise. If Conservatives vote Liberal Democrat or abstain on Thursday. they may find themselves represented at Strasbourg by someone working hard for the kind of Europe they most dislike. Little has ever been achieved for Britain by staying at home. If, as Conservatives and as a country, we take a robust, positive and distinctive stand on June 9, that will be an important advance towards the kind of Europe we want.
