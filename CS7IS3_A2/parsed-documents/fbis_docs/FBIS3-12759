The deputies, about 30 of them, believe that the Turkish Army is waging an undeclared war on the Kurdish people by burning and destroying their towns and villages. In a memorandum, a copy of which was obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the deputies said that the Turkish special forces were "hunting, persecuting, and killing Kurdish patriots," and that "successive Turkish governments since the Ottoman reign have continuously ignored the existence of the Kurdish people in a foolish policy that has failed to obliterate the Kurdish national identity." The Syrian deputies also called on the Turkish Government to work for a just and peaceful solution to the issue of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples and establish links of coexistence between them. The Syrian parliamentarians accused the Turkish Government of imposing a terrorist fait accompli in the Kurdish areas. The Syrian deputies addressed their memorandum to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, National Assembly Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. It was handed to the Turkish ambassador in Damascus at the embassy premises. In that memorandum, the deputies said that reports carried by news agencies and the Turkish media about the military operations carried out by the Turkish Army in the east and southeast of Turkey (Kurdistan) confirm that "what the Army is doing is tantamount to an undeclared war against the Kurdish people and that the police and gendarmerie forces are imposing an unbearable situation of terror in the Kurdish areas where patriotic and social figures are liquidated in broad daylight in public." The memorandum added that "this chauvinistic military and political campaign by the Turkish Government is producing terrifying results for the Kurdish population, a matter which arouses extreme concern among members of the Syrian People's Assembly and all peace- and justice-loving people. It runs contrary to the principles of democracy and human rights which Turkish officials claim to respect and abide by." The memorandum urged Turkey to stop the military operations and work for a peaceful solution because that would save it money and blood and would enhance the links of coexistence between the two peoples, and it would also place Turkey among the civilized states and strengthen its role and position in the eyes of the world public opinion. The deputies added: "The only way to resolve peoples' issues is dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of recognition of the national rights of the oppressed people." It is worth noting that Syrian-Turkish relations often passed through political crises because of the position of the Kurdish fighters and the water issue which is still pending between the two countries. Turkey has always hinted at using the water weapon because of what Turkey claims to be Syrian support for the fighters of the Kurkish Workers Party, but Syria has repeatedly and categorically denied these charges. In their official statements, however, the two countries reaffirm their satisfaction with the rapid and positive development of their relations and their intention to further expand these relations in all fields. The two sides have also expressed satisfaction with the positive developments over the past months regarding security issues pertaining to the long borders between them, as a result of the spirit of cooperation which has been confirmed and enhanced by the exchange of visits between the interior and foreign ministers of the two countries during which it was reaffirmed that any activity on the territory of either of them harmful to the security of that country would not be allowed.
