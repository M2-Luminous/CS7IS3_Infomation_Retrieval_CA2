[Selami] I would say yes, because from a procedural point of view, a further step was made -- namely, this session defined which correspondents will come here to draft a final report at the end of March. The commission will then discuss this and finally decide on Albania's full membership in the Council of Europe. Apart from Albania, the dispatching of correspondents was not granted to any other country, due to their own problems. Even in the meeting with Martinez, as well as with Atkinson and other group chairmen, all of them confirmed that there is no problem concerning Albania's membership. It is a procedural process for Albania to be admitted, which is why they sent correspondents. If there had been problems, then of course the contrary would have been felt -- we would have said the answer is positive, but there is a problem and for this reason Albania will not be accepted. [Tepelena] Meanwhile, foreign news agencies have been broadcasting a report concerning a Council of Europe resolution on compensation for our country's losses due to the embargo, which amount to $80 million. What do you think about this aid, and is it sufficient, especially after your discussion there, in which you once again confirmed that Albania favors the continuation of the embargo? [Selami] I do not think it is sufficient. Our losses are greater, and this was one of the goals of the discussion. I addressed the Council of Europe session in the name of the delegation. I think this is a good beginning. The other aspect that you mentioned, which was something special and was welcomed by some of the delegations, was the fact that despite the economic losses we are experiencing, we consider the embargo and its observation as an indispensable condition not only to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina but to also prevent it from spreading to other parts, which would be very problematic. This was the message we transmitted there. [Tepelena] Parliamentary group Chairmen Ali Spahia and Namik Dokle were also members of your delegation. Some newspapers have reported that in the discussion on human rights, the Nano question was particularly focused upon. What is your reaction? [Selami] Of course, it was discussed. It is a problem that cannot be avoided because he is the opposition leader. Despite the fact that he is imprisoned on charges from the time when he was prime minister, it is understood that when the delegation and the commission of non-member countries arrived here, this problem was put forward. Even now, this has become the main focus of the opposition. We regret that a consensus to enter the Council of Europe has not been reached because the Nano question is always popping up. I think that such a personalization is not fair. However, this is a problem that belongs to the opposition. I would also like to say that this was not the main problem and that it was not treated in a special way, because if it had been, the correspondents would not have come. We have discussed this question, and we think that this is a problem that justice needs to deal with. Justice will have its final say. Thus, we feel that there is nothing more that we, as a political force, can do in this direction. [Tepelena] Thank you. [Selami] Thank you.
