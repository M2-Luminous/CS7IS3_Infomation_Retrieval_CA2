The department will have special groups for combating poaching, which, together with internal affairs and procuracy organs, will track all violations involving rare and endangered species of animals and plants. Together with customs and border control, they will also have the task of intercepting all attempts to smuggle rare animals out of the country. This measure was necessitated by growing poaching in the Far East, the object of which, unfortunately, are rare and endangered animals and plants: Amur tiger, white-chested bear, East-Siberian leopard, as well as rare birds and reptiles. They are smuggled abroad--to China and Korea. For instance, according to estimates of ministry for protection of environment and natural resources specialists, over the past two years about 150 tigers have been killed in the Far East forests--and that keeping in mind that at the end of 1980's the total population of this species was about 350. International organizations also are joining in the fight to save the Amur tiger.
