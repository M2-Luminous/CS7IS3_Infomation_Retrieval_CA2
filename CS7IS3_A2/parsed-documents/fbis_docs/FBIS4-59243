In a message received by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali today, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said two enemy warplanes, flying from Saudi and Kuwait territories, violated Iraqi airspace on 3 May. They overflew al-Najaf and al-Muthanna Governorates and dropped large quantities of provocative leaflets, the message says. The message adds U.S. and other warplanes carried out similar aggressive acts over the Ninawa, Salah al-Din, and al-Ta'mim Governorates. The foreign minister stressed that the imposition of the no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq is an illegitimate and illegal act which has nothing to do with the United Nations. Addressing the UN secretary general, the minister said: Your excellency, you have stressed this point more than once, and so did your spokesman, Mr. Gosles [name as transliterated]. The entire world knows that these illegitimate and illegal acts constitute a glaring aggression against Iraq and a serious violation of its sovereignty, security, and the safety of its people. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said Iraq strongly protests and denounces these provocative practices which contravene the rules of international law and the UN Charter. He added: On behalf of the Iraqi Government, I officially ask you to assume your responsibilities toward halting those provocative practices and putting an end to the embargo imposed on Iraq in observance of the UN Charter and in accordance with the international body's responsibilities toward respecting nations' sovereignty.
