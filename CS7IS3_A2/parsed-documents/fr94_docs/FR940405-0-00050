App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13_[Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;07&hyph;06 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8864. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;150&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes having line numbers 641 through 708, inclusive, excluding Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent severe structural damage to the airplane due to failure of attachment bolts, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 4 years total time-in-service, or within 15 months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a visual inspection, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, dated January 14, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994, to verify if bolts made of H&hyph;11 steel have been installed at the following locations: Note 1: Not all airplanes need to be inspected at each critical location. Operators should refer to the Boeing service bulletin to determine which specific locations are to be inspected on which airplanes. (1) Body landing gear inboard and outboard trunnion vertical support attachment. (2) Wing landing gear beam upper chord to longeron attachment. (3) Wing landing gear beam lower chord to crease beam attachment. (4) Body Station (BS) 2598 horizontal stabilizer hinge attachment. (5) BS 2598 longeron splice fitting attachment at stringers 11 and 23. (6) Fin to body attachment. (7) Horizontal stabilizer front spar jack screw attachment. (b) If no bolt made of H&hyph;11 steel is detected, no further action is required by this AD. (c) If any bolt made of H&hyph;11 steel is detected, prior to further flight, visually inspect the bolt to detect cracking or fracture, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, dated January 14, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994. Note 2: A bolt made of H&hyph;11 steel is considered to be fractured if the sealant around the nut or bolthead is broken, or if there are gaps between the bolthead or nut and the adjacent structure. (1) If no cracking or fracture of the bolt is detected, repeat the inspection of that bolt thereafter at intervals not to exceed 18 months. (2) If any cracking or fracture is detected during this inspection or during any inspection required by paragraph (c)(1) of this AD, prior to further flight, replace the discrepant bolt with a bolt made of Inconel 718 material in accordance with the service bulletin. (d) Within 48 months after the effective date of this AD, replace all bolts made of H&hyph;11 steel installed at the locations specified in paragraph (a) of this AD with bolts made of Inconel 718 material, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, dated January 14, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994. Such replacement constitutes terminating action for the inspection requirements of this AD. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO). Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note 3: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (g) The inspection and replacement shall be done in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, dated January 14, 1993, or Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994.
