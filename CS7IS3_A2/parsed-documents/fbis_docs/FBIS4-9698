The proposal has been considered by some supporters of President Caldera, in case the present Parliament might make a regular practice of blocking government policies. The opinions expressed by some legislators from different political groups suggest that a hypothetical dissolution of the legislative chambers, through a constitutional reform, will be rejected. The views expressed agree that a decision like the one proposed should not be considered in terms of its application to the present Congress, but rather as a general standard applicable in specific circumstances of Venezuela's national life. One of those holding this view is Segundo Melendez, head of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] parliamentary group. In his opinion, a circumstance of the kind proposed should be established in the Constitution in a very clear and precise manner. In addition, it should respond to a structural situation related to the state's operation, so that political situations that might arise during a parliamentary term could be resolved by constitutional means. But calling for such a step because this Congress or any other Congress might be in a crisis situation that requires the application of a constitutional regulation which does not exist, but which needs to be discussed at that time, is a mistake. He cited the need to debate the reform of the Constitution--if this long-awaited debate actually takes place--"in the abstract," on the basis of major general problems in order to develop a response to those general problems. If later they are applicable to this or to any other Parliament, in specific circumstances, that is a different matter. But there already exists a mechanism to deal with the situation that has now arisen. A Detailed Analysis Pablo Medina, deputy and secretary general of Causa R, though, using an "innovative interpretation" of the Constitution, invokes Article 4 of the Constitution, which states that sovereignty resides in the people and is exercised through the ballot. He believes that the people, through a referendum, can dissolve the present Congress which he calls "worthless" because, in his view, many of the people in Congress got there through electoral fraud. However, in his proposal, Deputy Medina seems not to [correctly] interpret the general spirit of this clause which, while it does indeed state that sovereignty resides in the people, makes it very clear that the people exercise this sovereignty by voting for the organs of public authority, one of which is the legislative branch. Therefore, any dissolution must be made through a constitutional reform or by the use of force. [passage omitted]
