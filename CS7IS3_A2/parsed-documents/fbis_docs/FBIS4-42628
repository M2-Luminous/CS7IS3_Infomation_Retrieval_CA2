First a Bundeswehr music corps will solemnly play Ludwig van Beethoven's "Opferlied" before Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen welcomes the invited guests. And then: the speech. Roman Herzog, the newly elected federal president, wanted to show the Germans who their new head of state is on 20 July. With an outstanding speech at the Berlin German Resistance Memorial, the constitutional law expert was hoping to present himself as a worthy successor to Richard von Weizsaecker. The appropriate setting: The central commemorative event for the Hitler attackers of 20 July 1944. The ideal first appearance he had dreamt of, the "first major test" (Herzog), has become a pitiful false start. Somebody else will speak instead of Herzog: Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman said: "It is the 50th anniversary, and I would like to do it myself this time." Period. Herzog gave in. He does not want to strain the commemorative day with a "row over prestige" and so he submitted to the inevitable. On "second thought," he has realized that he made a "mistake:" "I had not given it enough thought." After the unlucky term of the "easygoing" nation he used on the day he was elected, this has now been his second blunder. In modest defiance, Herzog said that he had now "decided" to invite those who participated in the aborted attack against Hitler, and their descendants, to Bellevue Palace. Can he live with the impression that he is a president by the grace of Kohl? "Yes, in the first three weeks of my term I can." Herzog knows to whom he owes his high office. Now his patron has made him painfully aware of who has the say in the state: not he who is the first man in the state according to protocol, but Kohl himself, the third man. The chancellor did not even think it necessary to react to Herzog's intention, which he voiced in public -- he simply let Herzog run his head into a wall. "Herzog did not even mention this desire in our office," one aide from the Chancellor's Office said hypocritically. This is how the great ruler likes it: Any wishes, and even those of the future president, have to be reported to him, particularly when there is an election campaign going on. Moreover, Kohl seems to be worrying greatly that, through meaningful speeches on the occasion of historic days, this federal president might also acquire excessive respect and become an example to the citizens. Ten years of Richard von Weizsaecker have taught him enough. Weizsaecker talked himself into the Germans' hearts on 8 May 1985: In an internationally acclaimed address on the 40th anniversary of the capitulation, which also meant liberation, in which Weizsaecker bowed in the Bundestag to all victims of fascism, expressing his respect to all resistance fighters without exception. Pressed on vinyl, the speech became a bestselling record and Weizsaecker became the chancellor's private enemy. Kohl suffered because he could not come anywhere near to speaking as eloquently as Weizsaecker. Kohl was foresighted and took precautions that the future president would not disturb his parade on 20 July. As early as October -- when Saxon Steffen Heitmann was still his favorite candidate -- the chancellor told the organizers who would hold the speech at the commemorative event at the Bendlerblock on Stauffenberg Street. "He indicated that he would like to do it," Dieter Thomas, member of the board of directors of the 20 July Relief Foundation, said. Everything was clear to Thomas: "Nobody can say no if the chancellor wants something." In February, the 18 members of the preparatory committee for the commemorative day met in the Senat building in Berlin. There were representatives of three resistance organizations, the Federal Government, the memorial in Stauffenbergstrasse, and of the Senate. The proposal that Chancellor Kohl should deliver a speech as he did 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40th anniversary, was accepted without any discussion. "There were not the slightest signs of opposition," Volker Kaehne, head of the Senat office, said. The chance to adequately face the victims of Nazi terrorism and their descendants at this anniversary, was forfeited -- because it did not occur to anyone to contradict the chancellor. Anybody could anticipate that, in the middle of the election campaign, it would have been more suitable for the federal president, who is nonpartisan by the very nature of his office, to head the celebrations on the commemorative day, rather than the CDU chairman. This means making 20 July "an incredibly political date," Peter Steinbach, head of the Berlin memorial, complained. After Kohl's solitary decision, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] also realized that it had left the chancellor an excellent opportunity to present himself in a solemn way. Fully tied up with the search for a profile of its own and a program, Rudolf Scharping's team missed the importance of the 50th anniversary, the first major historic commemorative day in united Germany. Bernd Faulenbach, head of the SPD Executive Committee's History Commission, admits that "this issue was probably not given the necessary importance." In March, the SPD Presidium approved the concept for the celebrations, including the speaker. Now the SPD chairman has voiced his criticism, in the same unfortunate way that he did after his party friend, Johannes Rau, failed to become federal president. Scharping complained that he would have regarded it as appropriate "if the chairman of a party that particularly suffered under the dictatorship of the Third Reich would have been asked to participate in the central commemorative celebration." This idea came rather late. Friedrich Bohl (CDU), head of the Chancellor's Office, assures that, officially, the SPD had not even asked to be put on the list of speakers. Now even the Greens have presented the ideal person to speak at the commemorative celebrations -- an election campaign is an election campaign. It was suggested that Jens Reich, GDR civil rights activist and presidential candidate, address the central commemorative event. A federal president -- even if only just elected -- who knows his job, could have given the event commemorating the resistance against the Nazis the right direction and setting. Yet, now narrow-minded people and busybodies have taken possession of this day. All of a sudden, a longstanding controversy has flared up over exhibits on show in the German Resistance Memorial. The son of Hitler's attacker, Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, Franz Ludwig, has criticized the involvement of the "Free Germany National Committee," which, under communist guidance, recruited resistance fighters against Hitler in the Soviet prisoner-of-war camp Krasnogorsk. The head of the memorial has threatened to resign if exhibits were indeed removed. Steinbach: "Resistance is indivisible." In defiance of Steinbach, the Berlin celebrations are to be fashioned as a traditional opportunity for the military -- because Stauffenberg and many of his coconspirators were nationalist German officers. The Bundeswehr will provide an honorary formation. For the chancellor it will be perfect. For him, 20 July will fit into a series of appearances with publicity appeal and a military background. On 31 August, he is planning to walk through the Brandenburg Gate together with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. On 8 September, he will celebrate the withdrawal of the allied forces in a pompous act in Berlin. This is more than ample compensation for the head of the German Government for not having been permitted to participate in the D-Day celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the allied invasion in Normandy, which he would have wanted so much. Now there would still be time enough for Herzog to show the chancellor who is the first man in the state: A clarifying word with the chancellor should not be so difficult for the head of state. Yet Weizsaecker's successor has not exchanged a single word with the chancellor since the day after his election. He has already set his mind on his next test. On 8 May 1995 it will be 50 years since World War II ended. Who will speak on that day? Roman Herzog believes that it will be the president. Herzog has already told the public that he would hold his speech "with unrelenting truth and frank words." This man has learned quickly from the chancellor.
