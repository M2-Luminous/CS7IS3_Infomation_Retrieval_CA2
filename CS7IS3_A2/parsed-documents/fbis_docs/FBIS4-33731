"The states must solve their security problems in accordance with the law, fully respecting human rights, and following legally established procedures," he said. All of these situations are irregular, are even an offense classified by Venezuelan law as a crime, that of taking justice into one's own hands. One single person should not determine who is guilty or innocent, or apply the sentence that best suits him as judge. That would be terrible for society, he added. Regarding the Catia Prison, he said the idea is to close it down but that it has been impossible because there is no available room in other prisons to transfer the inmates. The solution of this problem will take some time because new prisons have to be built. The Catia Prison cannot be repaired because of its dilapidated condition. In addition, it is not normal these days to have prisons in the center of cities. "Prisons must be on the outskirts. When Catia was built, it met this requirement but now it has been engulfed by the city." Nevertheless, he admitted that society is desperate for a degree of insecurity, although the crime rate has experienced a remarkable reduction. Asked about the "Lights Against Criminals" organization, the minister said he does not know its members but is of the opinion that this is a civilian movement legally pressuring the government to find a solution to the insecurity problem while contributing commonsense ideas that should be taken into consideration. Regarding the possibility of this being a rightist movement, he said it would be necessary to investigate but added that not everyone who declares himself against crime is a Fascist or a rightist. It will have to be looked into because I do not have sufficient information to express an opinion on the personal, philosophical, or ideological features of the members of this organization. I am under the impression that they are a group of worried persons who contribute ideas, sometimes extreme ideas. I do not think, however, that they are seeking violent solutions or taking justice into their own hands. If this is the case, it should be strongly rejected because we believe in a de jure state and an established administration of justice, he said. As for the interior minister's proposal to reactivate Isla del Burro, Creixems recalled that, once the Executive Branch has decided to open a prison, his office must update and manage it. He explained that the money for carrying out Minister Escovar Salom's proposal are not included in the budget, but that if the proposal is accepted, the money could be secured. Anyway, he pointed out that it is up to the Urban Development Ministry to secure the money for any renovations. Consulted over the resignation of some magistrates because of their low salaries, Creixems said the situation is dramatic and admitted that the public officials are underpaid. He regretted that competent and efficient magistrates resign because of low salaries and leave their posts to officials who are not overly concerned with salary. "I do not mean that those who do not resign are scoundrels. But we are in a situation in which high-level officials, with very great responsibilities, are pressured by the economic crisis and the scant money they earn, which prevents them from leading a decent life consistent with their profession," he said. The minister said that a Security Council will meet next Thursday where everything related to the matter and the solutions proposed by the Executive Branch will be discussed. Once measures are decided on, they will be announced as political measures.
