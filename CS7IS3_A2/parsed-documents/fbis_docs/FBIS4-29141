FBIS4-29141 "dreas116_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Thailand Comments on Setting Up of Ammendment Body Comments on Setting Up of Ammendment Body BK1606110194 BK1606110194 BFN [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok vernacular dailies -- KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT and SIAM POST -- carry editorials commenting on the political situation following the submission to the House by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's a motion to set up a new constitution redrafting committee, in a bid to ease up political tension following a hunger strike by activist Chalat Worachat. KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT's 400-word editorial, on page 2, entitled: "For the Sake of Democracy, Do Not Stop Phalang Tham's Motion," notes that the setting up of the "Democracy Development Committee" proposed by House Speaker Marut Bunnak has, to a certain extent, alleviated the "severity" of the political tension caused by the hunger strike. "We are satisfied with the attitude of the government and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in this regard. However, it is necessary for all parties concerned to prove their sincerity with action." The editorial says: "We regard as the right step the motion submitted by 21 Phalang Tham Party MP's for the deliberation of the house, the setting up of an extraordinary committee to compile, rewrite, and draft a constitution. "The Phalang Tham MP's have done their job in the legislative branch. Such a move will not affect the image of the government or create any rift within the coalition. The Phalang Tham party's endorsement of the motion will prove that it truly adheres to the principles of democracy, and not the political etiquette of being a partner of the coalition government. We feel that the Democrat Party, as the leading core of the coalition, should be broad minded enough not to oppose the decision of the Phalang Tham Party." In conclusion, the editorial says: "The government should generously allow the house speaker to place the motion on the house agenda as soon as possible. All political parties, both in the coalition and opposition bloc, must allow their MP's to vote freely with the sense of responsibility toward democratic development and the country." SIAM POST's 350-word editorial, on page 4, entitled: "Democracy," notes: "Many political observers believe that the current political conflict will not lead to the violence of the 'May 1992' incident because all concerned parties abide by the laws and are aware of their rights and freedom." "The problem that may arise now is the effect of the Phalang Tham Party motion after it is passed into law on the now-functioning parliament constitutional amendment commission and the parliamentary mechanism. "This is a new political phenomenon worth everybody's keen attention. Meanwhile, the New Aspiration Party is planning to submit a motion to the house to amend Article 211 of the Constitution to pave way for the formation of the constitution drafting council." The editorial points out that the people are confused by political parties and politicians. "What is happening now indicates that our political parties and politicians lack unity and discipline. Hence, the cabinet cannot function smoothly and the parliamentary mechanism might eventually fall apart."
