Inaugurating a JSS convention here, she said the new party had adopted a red flag with three white stars as its official ensign. The JSS, she said, was receiving all-out support from the people because of their frustration and agony due to the prevailing degeneration of moral values among political parties in Kerala and the rampant corruption among political leaders and officialdom. Referring to the Dunkel proposals and the new economic policy of the Centre, she said these issues marked the establishment of a new "East India Company" in the country. She, however, said this was her personal opinion and the party's official assessment would be made known only after a detailed study of the Dunkel proposals. The three-day convention is being attended by over 700 delegates from all over the State besides a large number of Mrs Gowri's supporters.
