FR940602-2-00156 FR940602-2-00094 1. Validity of the Recreation Residence Use . The proposed direction at FSM 2347.1 set forth the basic policy on recreation residence use and continuance. The beginning paragraph of that section established that recreation residences were a valid use of National Forest System land and an important component of the overall National Forest recreation program. A clear statement of policy followed stating that the use could continue to occupy the Federal lands. The purpose of this revision was to place the recreation residence use on an equal footing with other uses when decisions involving allocation of the land were being made. Comments. There were 738 comments received on this proposed policy. Most supported the policy statement and suggested it be strengthened. For example, several respondents suggested the following language: ``Therefore, when considering nonrenewal of recreation residence permits for an alternative use be sure that the value of the alternative public use is equal to, or exceeds the value of the existing recreation use.'' Other respondents opposed the provision, stating that it overstated the importance of the use and that such words as ``important'' implied that other uses were not important. It was suggested that the word ``equally'' be placed before the words ``valid'' and ``important'' to provide better balance to the policy statement. Response. The Forest Service believes that recreation residences are a valid and important use of the National Forests. Equally, it believes that existing uses should be allowed to continue. The agency recognizes that there may be rare instances when a use is not consistent with a National Forest's Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan), and the recreation residence use must give way to an alternative public use. However, the overall policy stated in this section is appropriate to ensure that any decision to not allow a new permit for an established use to be issued must be fair and equitable and supported by careful analysis and documentation. The Forest Service is satisfied that the policy statement in FSM 2347.1 adequately establishes the appropriateness of the recreation residence use without the need for further clarification and will adopt the language as proposed. 2. Conformity to the 1915 Term Permit Act. This topic is confined to one provision of the proposed policy. Proposed paragraph 2 of FSM 2347.03 stated: ``Ensure that recreation residence use does not preclude the general public from full enjoyment of the natural, scenic, recreational, and other aspects of the National Forests as stipulated in the Act of March 4, 1915 (FSM 2701).'' This provision was placed in the proposed policy to emphasize this requirement of the 1915 Act and uses words from the Act. This provision was worded similarly in the 1988 policy but placed in a different location. The provision was moved into the policy section in the 1991 proposal to give greater emphasis to the direction and thereby respond to the appeal decision's direction to make the policy neutral. Comment. There were 996 comments addressed to this provision of the proposed policy. The word ``ensure'' was the focus of nearly all of the comments. Respondents felt that use of this word, conveying certainty of action, changed the intent of the 1915 Act language and would lead Forest officers, upon determining any impact on ``full enjoyment,'' to conclude that the permitted use should not continue. (It should be noted that ``ensure'' was used in the provision in the 1988 policy.) Some respondents pointed out that it would be impossible for a Forest officer to ensure compliance with the Act. Other respondents stated that the provision in the 1915 Act was not intended to discourage continuation of the use. They pointed out that the Act does not establish priority of use (recreation residence versus other public uses), thus an equality, not an hierarchy, of use is implied. Response. The Forest Service agrees that the word ``ensure'' is inappropriate in this provision and that equality in the consideration of uses is required. Further, the agency finds that the location of a provision in FSM 2347.03 dealing only with recreation residences is not correct. The subject of Manual section 2347 is ``Non-commercial Recreation Use,'' a broad category encompassing privately built and owned structures of which recreation residences are but one. Also included in this category of use are private clubs and lodges, houseboats, boat docks and wharves, and shelters. All of these non-commercial uses come under the guidance of the 1915 Act. The agency believes the guidance is appropriate but must be revised to reflect the broader scope of the FSM section. Therefore, the provision is retained but renumbered as paragraph 3 to reflect a more logical sequence of direction. The provision has been rewritten to remove ``ensure'' and to substitute ``non-commercial recreation sites'' for ``recreation residences.'' The reference to the 1915 Act is also removed to avoid redundancy, as this Act is cited in the list of authorities under which term special use authorizations can be granted (FSM 2701). 3. Determination of Permit Renewal and Nonrenewal. The provisions of the proposed policy dealing with continuation of the recreation residence use, conversion to alternative public uses, and the analysis and decision-making process involved in these actions brought forth the largest number and most detailed comments. There were over 1,900 comments directed to these policy provisions, many of which were very detailed, and offered lengthy revisions to the proposed policy. This is to be expected as these provisions are at the core of the appeal decision and are central to the holders' concern that they will be able to continue the use. For ease of analysis, the discussion is separated into the four parts of the proposed policy that cover this topic.
