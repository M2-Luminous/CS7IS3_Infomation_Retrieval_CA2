In his words, the document can be signed only after the Azeri specification of some items of the protocol, whose major provisions have been basically coordinated. Mamedov said the Azeri troops staying in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone have been ordered to cease fire despite the fact Azerbaijan has not signed the final protocol. The cease-fire agreement is being observed by both sides, he stressed.
