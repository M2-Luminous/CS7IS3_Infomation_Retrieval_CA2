The members of this committee present themselves as independents, in relation to Haiti's political parties and religions. The members of this committee include Carlet Auguste, former ambassador under Duvalier; Lamartiniere Honorat, presidential candidate in 1987; Georges A. Beaufils, former chief of cabinet of provisional de facto President Joseph Nerette; Daniel Supplice, former minister under Duvalier; Rosny Desroches, former national education minister under the National Council of Government [CNG], the first CNG having been presided over by former Lieutenant General Henry Namphy; and Franck Joseph, presidential candidate in 1987. Five other personalities, members of this committee, are Mrs. Odette Roy Fombrun, Georges Bailly, Marc Alex Guerrier, Sem Marseille, and Dr. Georges Michel. This committee advised that on their first workday, they will first focus on precise topics: that is, immediate problems, plus management of the critical situation caused by the embargo. Secondly, they will seek viable options for a way out of the crisis. The debates on these topics will begin on Tuesday, 25 January, tomorrow. They will hold an important meeting at the Villa Creole Hotel as of 0900. The points to be discussed relate to managing the critical situation, which is a result of the economic embargo imposed on the country. The debates will focus on the following topics: 1. Establishment of responsibility for the consequences of the embargo; 2. General, temporary closing of enterprises; objectives, time limits, and incidence; 3. Partial closings, reduction and rearrangement of political schedules, and dismissals; 4. Formation of a private-sector crisis committee; 5. Utilization of the foreign chambers of commerce and employers' associations as a means of pressuring the international community. The third major point is that resolutions will be presented on each of these topics to facilitate a common stand within the employers' sector. Fourth, in order to facilitate the formation and adoption of the resolutions in debate, the president of each employers' association will hopefully be able to consult with his respective grassroots group in order to get a precise advance mandate. This note was signed by Raymond Roy.
