FR941028-2-00180 FR941028-2-00109 If this review and/or screening does not identify additional PPD conversions, nosocomial transmission is less likely, and the contact investigation can probably be terminated. Whether the HCW's PPD test conversion resulted from occupational exposure and infection is uncertain; however, the absence of other data implicating nosocomial transmission suggests that the conversion could have resulted from (a) unrecognized exposure to M. tuberculosis outside the facility; (b) cross-reactivity with another antigen (e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria); (c) errors in applying, reading, or interpreting the test; (d) false positivity caused by the normal variability of the test; or (e) false positivity caused by a defective PPD preparation. If this review and/or screening does identify additional PPD test conversions, nosocomial transmission is more likely. In this situation, the patient identification (i.e., triage) process, TB infection-control policies and practices, and engineering controls should be evaluated to identify problems that could have led to exposure and transmission (Table 4). If no such problems are identified, a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. If such problems are identified, appropriate interventions should be implemented to correct the problem(s), and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after 3 months. If no additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. If additional PPD conversions are detected on follow-up testing, the possible reasons for exposure and transmission should be reassessed, the appropriateness of and adherence to the interventions implemented should be evaluated, and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be repeated after another 3 months. If no additional PPD test conversions are detected on this second round of follow-up testing, the investigation can be terminated. However, if additional PPD test conversions are detected on the second round of follow-up testing, a high-risk protocol should be implemented in the affected area or occupational group, and the public health department or other persons with expertise in TB infection control should be consulted. b. Investigating cases of active TB in HCWs. If an HCW develops active TB, the following steps should be taken: •The case should be evaluated epidemiologically, in a manner similar to PPD test conversions in HCWs, to determine the likelihood that it resulted from occupational transmission and to identify possible causes and implement appropriate interventions if the evaluation suggests such transmission. •Contacts of the HCW (e.g., other HCWs, patients, visitors, and others who have had intense exposure to the HCW) should be identified and evaluated for TB infection and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). The public health department should be notified immediately for consultation and to allow for investigation of community contacts who were not exposed in the health-care facility. •The public health department should notify facilities when HCWs with TB are reported by physicians so that an investigation of contacts can be conducted in the facility. The information provided by the health department to facilities should be in accordance with state or local laws to protect the confidentiality of the HCW. 2. Investigating Possible Patient-to-Patient Transmission of M. tuberculosis Surveillance of active TB cases in patients should be conducted. If this surveillance suggests the possibility of patient-to-patient transmission of M. tuberculosis (e.g., a high proportion of TB patients had prior admissions during the year preceding onset of their TB, the number of patients with drug-resistant TB increased suddenly, or isolates obtained from multiple patients had identical and characteristic drug-susceptibility or DNA fingerprint patterns), the following steps should be taken: •Review the HCW PPD test results and patient surveillance data for the suspected areas to detect additional patients or HCWs with PPD test conversions or active disease. •Look for possible exposures that patients with newly diagnosed TB could have had to other TB patients during previous admissions. For example, were the patients admitted to the same room or area, or did they receive the same procedure or go to the same treatment area on the same day? If the evaluation thus far suggests transmission has occurred, the following steps should be taken: •Evaluate possible causes of the transmission (e.g., problem with patient detection, institutional barriers to implementing appropriate isolation practices, or inadequate engineering controls) (Table 4). •Ascertain whether other patients or HCWs could have been exposed; if so, evaluate these persons for TB infection and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). •Notify the public health department so they can begin a community contact investigation if necessary. 3. Investigating Contacts of Patients and HCWs Who Have Infectious TB If a patient who has active TB is examined in a health-care facility and the illness is not diagnosed correctly, resulting in failure to apply appropriate precautions, or if an HCW develops active TB and exposes other persons in the facility, the following steps should be taken when the illness is later diagnosed correctly: •To identify other patients and HCWs who were exposed to the source patient before isolation procedures were begun, interview the source patient and all applicable personnel and review that patient's medical record. Determine the areas of the facility in which the source patient was hospitalized, visited, or worked before being placed in isolation (e.g., outpatient clinics, hospital rooms, treatment rooms, radiology and procedure areas, and patient lounges) and the HCWs who may have been exposed during that time (e.g., persons providing direct care, therapists, clerks, transportation personnel, housekeepers, and social workers). •The contact investigation should first determine if M. tuberculosis transmission has occurred from the source patient to those persons with whom the source patient had the most intense contact. •Administer PPD tests to the most intensely exposed HCWs and patients as soon as possible after the exposure has occurred. If transmission did occur to the most intensely exposed persons, then those persons with whom the patient had less contact should be evaluated. If the initial PPD test result is negative, a second test should be administered 12 weeks after the exposure was terminated. •Those persons who were exposed to M. tuberculosis and who have either a PPD test conversion or symptoms suggestive of TB should receive prompt clinical evaluation and, if indicated, chest radiographs and bacteriologic studies should be performed (Suppl. 2). Those persons who have evidence of newly acquired infection or active disease should be evaluated for preventive or curative therapy (Suppl. 2). Persons who have previously had positive PPD test results and who have been exposed to an infectious TB patient do not require a repeat PPD test or a chest radiograph unless they have symptoms suggestive of TB. •In addition to PPD testing those HCWs and patients who have been exposed to M. tuberculosis because a patient was not isolated promptly or an HCW with active TB was not identified promptly, the investigation should determine why the diagnosis of TB was delayed. If the correct diagnosis was made but the patient was not isolated promptly, the reasons for the delay need to be defined so that corrective actions can be taken. L. Coordination With the Public Health Department •As soon as a patient or HCW is known or suspected to have active TB, the patient or HCW should be reported to the public health department so that appropriate follow-up can be arranged and a community contact investigation can be performed. The health department should be notified well before patient discharge to facilitate follow-up and continuation of therapy. A discharge plan coordinated with the patient or HCW, the health department, and the inpatient facility should be implemented. •The public health department should protect the confidentiality of the patient or HCW in accordance with state and local laws.
