FR941021-0-00197 FR941021-0-00022 (viii) Additional radio astronomy sites, not located within 100 miles of the 100 most populous urbanized areas as defined by the United States Census Bureau at the time, may be afforded similar protection one year after notice to the mobile-satellite system licensees by issuance of a public notice by the Commission. (2) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations transmitting in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band shall take whatever steps necessary to avoid causing harmful interference to the radio astronomy facilities listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section during periods of observation. (3) Mobile-Satellite Service space stations operating in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz frequency band shall limit spurious emission levels in the 4990&hyph;5000 MHz band so as not to exceed ^241 dB (W/m 2 /Hz) at the surface of the Earth. (4) The Radioastronomy Service shall avoid scheduling radio astronomy observations during peak MSS/RDSS traffic periods to the greatest extent practicable. (b) Protection of the radionavigation-satellite service. Mobile earth stations operating in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band shall limit out-of-band emissions in the 1574.397&hyph;1576.443 MHz band so as not to exceed an e.i.r.p. density level of ^70 dB (W/MHz) averaged over any 20 ms period. The e.i.r.p. of any discrete spurious emission ( i.e. , bandwidth less than 600 Hz) in the 1574.397&hyph;1576.443 MHz band shall not exceed ^80 dBW. (c) Protection of aeronautical radionavigation systems. Mobile-satellite earth stations transmitting in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band shall limit e.i.r.p. levels to no greater than ^15 dB (W/4kHz) on frequencies being used by systems operating in accordance with international Radio Regulation RR 732, and to no greater than ^3 dB (W/4kHz) on frequencies that are not so being used. Pursuant to international RR 731F, respectively, all mobile-satellite Earth-to-space operations in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band and mobile-satellite space-to-Earth operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band must be coordinated and notified under the procedures set forth in Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). Such mobile-satellite stations shall not cause harmful interference to, or claim protection from, stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service and stations operating pursuant to international RR 732. (d) Fixed stations operating pursuant to international Radio Regulation RR 730. Pursuant to international Radio Regulations RR 731E and RR 731F, all mobile-satellite operations in the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band (Earth-to-space transmissions) and all operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz band (space-to-Earth transmissions), respectively, must be coordinated with systems operating pursuant to international RR 730 according to the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46 (WARC&hyph;92). All such mobile-satellite stations shall not cause harmful interference to, or claim protection from, stations in the fixed service operating pursuant to international RR 730. 16. A new ยง25.278 is added to subpart D to read as follows: ยง25.278 Additional Coordination Obligation for Non-Geostationary and Geostationary Satellite Systems In Frequencies Allocated to the Fixed-Satellite Service. Licensees of non-geostationary satellite systems that use frequency bands allocated to the fixed-satellite service for their feeder link operations shall coordinate their operations with licensees of geostationary fixed-satellite service systems licensed by the Commission for operation in the same frequency bands. Licensees of geostationary fixed-satellite service systems in the frequency bands that are licensed to non-geostationary satellite systems for feeder link operations shall coordinate their operations with the licensees of such non-geostationary satellite systems. 17. A new ยง25.279 is added to subpart D to read as follows:
