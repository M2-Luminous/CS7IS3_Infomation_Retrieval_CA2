"It is one idea," Hata said. Hata told reporters that he will meet or talk over the telephone with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan], the second largest opposition party, who made the suggestion earlier in the day. Meanwhile, chief cabinet secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told reporters that the cabinet will take Kubo's proposal seriously. Kubo, in a meeting in China with Japanese reporters traveling with him, said that the Hata cabinet should resign en masse soon after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved by the Diet, and before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion. Kubo said the SDP may seek a no-confidence vote if Hata refuses to step down. The possibility of an SDP no-confidence motion would be "very high" if the Hata cabinet does not resign en masse, he said.
