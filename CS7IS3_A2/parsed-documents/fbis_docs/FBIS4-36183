FBIS4-36183 "drnes109_l_94003" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Opposition Parties, 'Ashrawi React to Peres Letter Opposition Parties, 'Ashrawi React to Peres Letter TA0706045994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 7 Jun 94 TA0706045994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] The Peres letter on Jerusalem has angered political leaders on the right of the Israeli spectrum and raised questions in East Jerusalem. Details from Steven Pantanowitz: [Begin recording] [Pantanowitz] There have been reactions from leading members of the Likud and other parties further to the right in the Israeli political arena. Likud Knesset Member [MK] Beni Begin, who for some time has been charging that such a letter exists, issued a statement saying that publication proved the government was trying to lead the nation astray. He said only a few hours before it was put out, government spokesmen were claiming that it was merely a copy of the foreign minister's Knesset speech in September. This is not true, Begin said. He charged that the Israeli Government, with the agreement of the prime minister, had given the PLO a commitment under which the status of its institutions in Jerusalem would be preserved without any time limit whatsoever. In so doing, Begin said, the government had struck a substantive blow at Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, and he forecast the publication of more documents in this vein. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 7 June adds that "the Tzomet Knesset faction joins the Likud demand to have a revote on the Cairo agreements following the disclosure of Peres' letter. MK Moshe Peled told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that Tzomet is demanding that the government make public two other annexes to the Cairo agreement dealing with Yasir 'Arafat's status."] The National Religious Party spoke of double moral standards and a cover-up. Israel, the statement said, was abandoning its basic positions of principles, and the government was falling into a trap laid by 'Arafat on the way to turning Jerusalem into the capital of Palestine. MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, the leader of the small Moledet faction, talked of an Israeli Government participating in another march of folly, as he put it. In defense of the letter, Shulamit Aloni, leader of the left-wing Meretz coalition party, criticized the lack of forthrightness in the affair and said it was better to tell the truth and not to hide one's convictions. Police Minister Moshe Shahal met last night with Faysal al-Husayni and told him that Israel had no intention of changing the status quo that existed in Jerusalem before the Oslo conference. The two met after Faysal al-Husayni held an urgent meeting of the Arab Committee on Jerusalem. Hanan 'Ashrawi, a member of the committee, on the controversial Peres letter: ['Ashrawi] Very clearly, the Israeli officials knew about it, and they still persisted in a policy of undermining Palestinian presence and Palestinian rights. So there is, in a sense, a violation of trust. And because the letter was supposed to be kept secret until both sides agreed -- or not to be disclosed -- then it means that they used this lack of disclosure in order to create facts which are prejudicial to Palestinian institutions.
