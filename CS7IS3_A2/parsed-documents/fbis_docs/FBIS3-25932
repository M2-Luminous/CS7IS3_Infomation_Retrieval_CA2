The conference pointed out that in 1994, Hubei's labor work should proceed by focusing on key aspects, overcoming difficulties, fostering and developing a labor market, and gradually establishing a new labor system which conforms with a socialist market economic structure. The conference also emphatically called for rapidly building employment consultation institutions; strengthening management of nongovernmental employment consultation institutions; further expanding labor cooperation with other provinces and municipalities, especially coastal and economically developed regions; vigorously implementing an all-personnel labor contract system; and improving professional and occupational qualifications assessment work. To this end, the conference stated, it is imperative to establish a batch of authoritative professional and occupational qualifications assessment institutions at both provincial and prefectural levels within the year; actively develop social security undertakings as well as relevant economic organizations in both cities and towns across the province to establish a uniform, societywide, and omnidirectional social security system tailored to the needs of old-aged people. In order to properly coordinate labor relations, it is also imperative to carry out large-scale propaganda on good labor relations with a view to tackling some long-standing problems, such as unauthorized labor employment, willful lengthening of working hours, willful deduction of labor wages, noncompliance with labor safety standards, refusal to pay social security premium, illegal labor trade, and so on. It is also imperative to strictly regulate and control aggregate labor wage volume. At present, it is imperative to comprehensively implement and perfect a planned dynamic wage system in light of actual tax burdens. The conference also urged stringent labor safety supervision and reduction of all types of labor accidents. Li Daqiang, provincial party committee standing committee member and provincial vice governor, delivered a speech at the end of the conference.
