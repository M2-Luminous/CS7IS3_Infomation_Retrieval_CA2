Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said he expects the memorandum to serve as a basis for other documents that would define specific forms of defense cooperation, including acquisition of weapons by Lithuania. The assistant U.S. secretary of defense for regional security affairs, Charles Freeman, said the memorandum, which is under preparation, provides for wide-ranging cooperation and expressed hope that Lithuania and the United States will smoothly approach its signing. At a press conference in Vilnius Monday, Freeman said the United States intends to sign similar accords with all countries in East and Central Europe, except a majority of former Soviet republics. The official said the fact that the Baltics are offered such cooperation witnesses the continuity of a policy according to which the United States never formally recognized the annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviets in 1940. U.S. and Lithuanian delegations, headed by Linkevicius and Freeman, met Monday to discuss possibilities for closer defense cooperation, as well as to exchange views on the preparation of Lithuania's "Partnership for Peace" presentation document, the defense doctrine, the national security concept and the creation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Both delegations met with Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. U.S. experts gave a positive evaluation of Lithuania's defense doctrine, the national security concept and the partnership presentation document. Linkevicius said the latter document should be submitted to NATO for consideration May 25. The U.S. delegation welcomed the Baltic peacekeeping battalion initiative. Freeman said the U.S. Congress is expected to decide soon on assistance to peacekeeping initiatives in East and Central Europe. He said the U.S. Government wants to see political, economic and defensive integration of the Baltic states into transatlantic systems. As regards Lithuania national defense system, Freeman said the country made a step forward and continues to move in the right direction.
