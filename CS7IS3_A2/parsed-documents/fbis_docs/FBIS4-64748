For Scharping, this is not just a question of proper timing, but also a question of principle. Just as the chancellor decides on the guidelines of policy, so too will Scharping as shadow chancellor decide on people, and when these people should be presented to the public. Scharping will not name his shadow cabinet until the second half of August, following a brief vacation in southwest France (President Mitterrand has already invited him for a tour in a jeep). Whether public opinion will be amazed is an open question, for Scharping has suggested several times that he will reward those who have proven themselves in his government program commission. Only one thing has been certain for the past week: Transportation expert Christoph Zoepel is no longer on Scharping's list. The following can expect seat reservations in an SPD-led government: Oskar Lafontaine (finance and industry), Ulrich Mauer (internal affairs), Rudolf Dressler (social affairs), Hans-Ulrich Klose (foreign affairs or defense), and Peter Glotz (currently responsible for the entire future sphere of education, science, communications, and the media). Contrary to earlier considerations, Scharping has decided not to form an independent European Affairs Ministry; European policy is to be coordinated with a strong personality in the chancellery, such as Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul. However, a Ministry of Female Affairs, or at least "a separate slot for female issues," is planned, even though Scharping wants to cut the number of ministries from 18 to 15. The Ministry for Post and Telecommunications will be abolished. Wolfgang Thierse, whom several persons would like to see as the new Bundestag president, is considered an "Ossi" worthy of the rank of minister; the idea of "Ministry for Eastern Reconstruction" is not yet extinct. Contrary to earlier hasty reports, it is far from certain whether faction general manager Peter Struck will be new faction chief if the SPD wins the elections. He would be an ideal Chancellery Office chief for Scharping. Scharping's current efficient chief of the Office of the Minister-President in Mainz, Karl-Heinz Klaer, who is also being considered for the Chancellery Office post, must remain in Mainz to guarantee a continuity under Scharping's successor Kurt Beck. Too great is the worry that the majority in Rhineland-Palatinate could be wasted in 1996. Scharping's predecessor, Bjoern Engholm, tried to win over Karl-Otto Poehl for Scharping's team. The former Bundesbank president said he had spoken to Scharping, but evidently without success. Poehl knows where the power in Bonn lies; in the Finance Ministry, not the Economics Ministry. But Lafontaine also knows this. Poehl has also not responded to the compromise offer of including monetary policy among the Economics Ministry's responsibilities, not yet in any case.
