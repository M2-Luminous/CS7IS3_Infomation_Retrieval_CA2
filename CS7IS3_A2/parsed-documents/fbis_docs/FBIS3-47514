Through several rounds of North-South dialogue, including the North-South high-level talks, North Korea's negotiation style toward the South was revealed. However, North Korea's negotiation style over the nuclear issue, which is compared to a "long-distance race," has not been nearly revealed. In this connection, in a recent research report, "The Analysis of the Negotiation Style and Activity in the Era Moving Away From the Cold War," the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security analyzed that "North Korea's external negotiation capacity on the nuclear issue is compared both to `the style of Zhuge Kongming' and to `an acrobat dancing on the rope for the first time.'" According to the analysis, North Korea's diplomatic style concerning the nuclear issue is as follows: Regarding the international trends as a "struggle between socialist and imperialist power," North Korea has recognized external negotiations as a means for realizing socialist ideology and smashing the imperialist forces. Regarding its purpose as an absolute line, North Korea does not hesitate to employ any means and method to attain its purpose of external negotiations. North Korea's basic consciousness about external negotiations is mainly affected by a way of thinking which seeks a socialist equality, the characteristics of the closed Kim Il-song system based on the chuche idea, independence, and the patriarchal Confucian culture obedient to the supreme authority. As a result, North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style has an aspect different from the Western style of diplomatic negotiations. In particular, because North Korea has the historical experiences of being plagued by neighboring powerful countries for a long time, it distrusts external forces. On the other hand, it has the consciousness to take advantage of foreign forces. As to the nuclear issue, which has a complex and technical aspect compared with other general negotiations which were handled during the North-South high-level talks, the characteristics of North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style and activity are as follows: The Consciousness as a Means for Resisting Foreign Forces North Korea adheres to attaining the target of its negotiations. North Korea has steadily demanded that U.S. nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea, that U.S. nuclear threat against North Korea be removed, that the Team Spirit exercise be discontinued, that the U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea be removed, and that U.S.-North Korean direct negotiations be held. North Korea has repeatedly put forward such conditions. Prior to adopting the denuclearization declaration, through the government's official statements, mass communications, and various conferences, North Korea has repeatedly declared that without the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal of nuclear threat against North Korea, it could not conclude the nuclear safeguards accord with the IAEA. North Korea has created the atmosphere that if the preconditions are not met, it cannot respond to nuclear negotiations and nuclear inspections. In the long run, North Korea responded to North-South nuclear negotiations correctly after former U.S. President Bush took steps to remove tactical nuclear weapons and former ROK President No Tae-u announced the nonexistence of nuclear weapons in South Korea. North Korea does not seem to prepare in advance to specifically implement details agreed upon by the North and South. In early December 1991, North Korea agreed to start nuclear negotiations during the North-South high-level talks and, just within 20 days after this agreement, it agreed on the principles put forward by the South. These principles included "denuclearization on the Korean peninsula" and "the start of the inspections in June after formulating regulations in May." In the stage of nearly carrying out this agreement, North Korea refused to discuss the regulations of the nuclear inspections, but instead maintained that the root of the nuclear issue is due to South Korea's introduction of U.S. nuclear weapons. Under this pretext, it has deadlocked a meeting of the Joint Nuclear Control Committee for a long time. This is a good example showing that North Korea does not prepare in advance to implement agreements between the North and South. North Korea makes efforts to obtain its target for negotiations by presenting additional proposals to South Korea. When we accepted all conditions made by North Korea in December 1991 regarding the IAEA's request for inspection, North Korea put forward the simultaneous inspection of North and South Korea as a new condition for accepting IAEA inspections. When we accepted the simultaneous inspection of the North and South, North Korea called again for the "adoption of an agreement for the implementation of inspection" featuring the logic of converting the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone after the North and South forge a denuclearization declaration. Also, it has delayed discussing the inspection regulations. North Korea regards propaganda as important in negotiations. Before entering negotiations, North Korea has created international opinion by conducting a political propaganda that the fundamental root is caused by U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea and it is being threatened by U.S. nuclear weapons, and by holding the "international conferences for peace and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula." A Threat With an Extreme Diplomacy North Korea invites famous foreign figures who can speak for its position in the process of negotiations. By using them, it tries to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development and obtains information from them regarding the other party. Also, it uses them as a way to grasp the limit that the other party can compromise and, at the same time, to strengthen its demands. High-ranking North Korean military officials show, however, that they are still reluctant to meet foreign figures. As a result, officials of the State Administration and the party can mainly deal with them. Foreign figures who are believed to be highly useful for propaganda works are be selected as to meet with Kim Il-song. In addition, in the course of nuclear negotiations with the United States, North Korea has shown its strategies, such as "a threat of extreme diplomacy, the change of agenda items in negotiations by presenting either new conditions or proposals, and the presentation of uncompromising demands." Through an extreme step of the so-called declaration to withdraw from the NPT, North Korea has escaped from the pressure to accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] from the IAEA for the time being and led the United States to regard the issue of making North Korea remain in the NPT as a more important agenda than the IAEA inspection issue in the negotiations. As a result, North Korea has come to hold its long-wished-for direct negotiations with the United States. In North Korean-U.S. negotiations, particularly, North Korea has strongly called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea and for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States, while the United States has demanded that North Korea remain in the NPT. It is the current situation that the United States, by presenting irresistible demands, checks North Korea's will concerning nuclear inspections.
