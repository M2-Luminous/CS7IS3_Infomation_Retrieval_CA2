FR940804-2-00108 FR940804-2-00061 Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Carolina Heelsplitter for Review and Comment AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service. Interior. ACTION: Notice of document availability and public comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery plan for Carolina heelsplitter ( Lasmigona decorata ). This rare freshwater mussel inhabits cool, slow-moving, small- to medium-sized streams and rivers. The Carolina heelsplitter currently has a very fragmented, relict distribution but historically was known from several locations within the Catawaba River and Pee Dee River systems in North Carolina and the Saluda and Pee Dee River systems in South Carolina. The species is presently know to be surviving in only four streams_Waxhaw Creek (Catawba River system) Union County, North Carolina; Goose Creek (Pee Dee River system), Union County, North Carolina; Lynches River (Pee Dee River system), Chesterfield, Lancaster, and Kershaw Counties, South Carolina; and Flat Creek (Pee Dee River system), a tributary to the Lynches River in Lancaster County, South Carolina. It has been reduced to a few short reaches of each of these streams, primarily as a result of impoundments and general deterioration of water quality resulting from siltation and other pollutants contributed by poor land use practices. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan. DATES: Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before October 3, 1994 to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the agency draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting the Asheville Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville, North Carolina 28806 (Telephone 704/665&hyph;1195). Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to the Field Supervisor at the above address. Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Fridell at the address and telephone number shown above (Ext. 225). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is the Carolina heelsplitter ( Lasmigona decorata ). The area of emphasis for recovery actions is the upper Catawba River and Pee Dee River systems in south-central North Carolina and north-central South Carolina and the Saluda River system in northwestern South Carolina Habitat protection, reintroduction, and preservation of genetic material are major objectives of this recovery plan. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the plan. Authority: The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f). Dated: July 29, 1994. Brian P. Cole, Field Supervisor.
