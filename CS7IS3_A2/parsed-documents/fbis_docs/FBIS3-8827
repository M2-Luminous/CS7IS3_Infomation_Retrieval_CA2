Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says that "the town underwent the heaviest shelling last night between 2000 and 2100, when one person was killed and four were wounded. The unequal war that [Serb military leader Ratko] Mladic's gunners are waging against the Maglaj people is continuing in the face of international indifference." Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "last night after 1930 the Serb aggressor intensified his artillery and tank attacks on the [word indistinct] and Bihac regions. They also attacked the other parts in the operational zone of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army 5th Corps and the Bihac HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. One women carrying a child was killed in Bosanska Otoka, and several other people were wounded. Over the last 24 hours, the chetniks have been targeting the defensive positions in Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau with howitzers from Gorija." He says that "the chetniks are again bringing in new forces as they cannot reconcile themselves to their inability to capture the railroad and the road alongside the Una River in order to connect their two fictitious parastates." In his report from Bugojno, Emir Avdakovic says that "after several days of relative quiet, early this morning the chetniks from their positions in Koprivnica again started firing tank and howitzer shells at the town. The general alarm was sounded and the Bugojno people are now in their shelters." Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "our positions were last night targeted by howitzers, tanks, and mortars. A chetnik 122-mm howitzer from the direction of (Tresnjica) was firing at the central sector of the Brcko defense. From Sumari an enemy tank was firing at Jasici and Boderiste." He says that this morning there is "heavy sniper fire at the defense lines." The B-H Army 3d Corps Press Center says that "even though they have occasionally violated the cease-fire with some small arms fire, the HVO has shown over the last few days that they do want peace in this region. The same cannot be said for Karadzic's chetniks, since they have been preparing for attacks on almost all the fronts held by the 3d Corps. To judge by the intensive movement behind their front lines, the chetniks are not giving up on Zavidovici and the southern corridor. Apart from significant movement of their motorized vehicles and military hardware, they have been keeping up their provocative artillery and small arms fire." The reports says that "yesterday extremists from the HVO violated the cease-fire several times with 12.7-mm sniper rifles in the region of Bistrica. Even though it was quiet in the Lasva Valley, two nights ago a [HVO] unit of 40 to 50 soldiers moved the front line a little by entrenching in (Busovacke Staje), thus violating the cease-fire agreement."
