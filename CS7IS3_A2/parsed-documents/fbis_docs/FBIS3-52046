A statement issued by the Standing Committee on Foreign Relations, which circulated today among the delegates, reaffirmed this fact cannot be ignored by anyone "honestly interested in helping the Cuban people overcome the current situation." It points out that "no country in Latin America has ever been subjected to such overwhelming pressure, or withstood the hostility that Cuba continues to suffer, even though the Cold War is supposed to be over." The communique states the Caribbean island is living under a partial military blockade, even though top U.S. political leaders have rule out a possible military intervention before the international community. It states the U.S. Armed Forces have created a plan around Cuba that would allow them -- with the use of tactical aviation, aircraft carriers, and cruise missiles launched from air and sea platforms -- to deal a hard blow in a short period of time, by surprise or not, against important Cuban military, political, and economic targets. It adds the search for information on this country continues to be one of the U.S. intelligence community's main priorities. According to a legislative study, a total of 88 flights with radio electronic reconnaissance planes of various types were made up through 31 October 1993. In 1992, only 114 flights took place. After recalling that the Guantanamo naval station is not important to the United States in a strategical and military sense, the communique points out that the station was reinforced with ships during the first six months of 1993 and that, by year's end, the government of President Bill Clinton had ordered a new deployment of power given the Haitian situation. The Assembly also reported that the CIA's cover-operations, which include attacks, sabotage, simulated self-inflicted aggression, etc., and the CIA's support for terrorist groups that openly operate from U.S. territory violate the Neutrality Act. According to the legislative commission, despite statements by State Department officials that the government would not allow that document to be violated, work being done by terrorist organizations of Cuban origin in the United States is publicly evident. Another paragraph of the declaration charges that a frenetic radio offensive, which is justified on the alleged principle of free flow of information, is being unleashed at this time against the Caribbean island under Washington's protection.
