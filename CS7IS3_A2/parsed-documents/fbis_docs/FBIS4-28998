Voters in many localities hold that the reclassification of compensation plans for competent cadres and retirees in accordance with Decree No. 05-CP, dated 26 January 1994, is irrational because it does not reflect good care for the retirees. Besides, the wide coefficient between wages for active civil servants and the pension for the retirees represents an unfair situation. All voters in localities raised issues related to the policy toward local cadres and held that since the application of Decree No. 46-CP, various villages have experienced numerous difficulties. The streamlining of personnel and the limitation of expenditures for village cadres and activities of mass organizations at the grassroots level are not appropriate because it creates a bad feeling for the local cadres who have made great contributions to the people. The fact that many key cadres at the grassroots level resigned has caused confusion in the social life of localities. Many voters suggested that the National Assembly should question the minister concerned and chairman of the Government's Cadre Organization Committee regarding the promulgation of Decree No. 46-CP. The voters held that this decree was not in conformity with the party's line on consolidating and strengthening the local administration. Voters of the education sector expressed their indignation in the reclassification of the compensation plan. They said that this has created an unfair condition in the promotion process because in the past one only needed three years to get a step increase, now they have to wait for six years. Regarding social policy, most voters expressed concern over the unemployment problem. Voters in provinces and cities said that a large number of youth in cities and the rural areas are jobless. This is a direct cause leading to social vices such as gambling, drug addiction, prostitution, and theft. The voters suggested that the state invest more in programs to resolve the unemployment problem, considering this an important measure to stop social vices. Many voters held that efforts to send Vietnamese workers abroad is the state's correct policy aimed at resolving the unemployment issue at home. However, the government should take essential measures and reach agreements with foreign countries to protect the interests of Vietnamese workers abroad. Many voters paid keen interest in the policy toward wounded soldiers, families of the fallen combatants, and those who have contributed meritorious services to the state. Most voters held that the present allowances for families of fallen combatants are too low. They suggested that the state should formulate a better policy toward those who have made great contributions to the state to maintain the principle of gratitude while educating the younger generation and developing the fine tradition of our nation. Voters throughout the country welcomed the party and state lines in solemnly organizing our nation's major anniversaries, including the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory. The voters held that the solemn commemoration of the Dien Bien Phu victory created a significant impact in the feeling of all Vietnamese. Voters in many localities asked the state to promulgate a regulation on treatment for those who have performed meritorious service for the state. They said that they have asked for this regulation on many occasions; however, their request was ignored. They also asked that when the state completes the draft regulation on this issue, it should be made public to solicit the people's ideas. IV. Implementation of the National Assembly's resolution on practicing thrift, opposing waste and corruption, and suppressing smuggling. All voters in localities welcomed the National Assembly's resolution on this issue, which was adopted at the Ninth National Assembly's fourth session. The voters highly appraised the National Assembly's determination in the struggle against lavish spending of state budget, corruption, and smuggling which are the pressing issues at present. Many voters noted that the government has made great efforts in implementing the National Assembly's resolution. However, results attained in this regard are low while social vices tended to increase in various meticulous forms. Voters commended Dong Nai, Song Be, and Tay Ninh Provinces for their efforts in dealing with car smuggling cases. The press recently reported, however, that the government has not taken prompt action against a number of business units that imported motorcycles without proper permission. The voters held that efforts to suppress corruption and smuggling is an important, yet very difficult task. As a result, the state should formulate more concrete and effective measures to deal with this issue while urging state agencies from the central to grassroots levels to seriously oppose corruption and smuggling. Voters in some localities suggested that the state should review the organization of the Steering Committee for Opposing Corruption and Smuggling because low results were obtained in this task. Many voters suggested that the National Assembly should set up a special committee to review verdicts of some cases which were still questioned by the people and to speed up investigation of pending cases, and that the National Assembly should formulate law or regulations on opposing corruption and smuggling. Voters in many localities suggested that the state review policies and regulations aimed at eliminating officialism and procedures that lead to annoyances and extortion. Efforts should be made to simplify and publicize the procedures for issuing driving permits and registration for car and motorbike owners. Voters in many provinces and cities also suggested that during the fifth session the National Assembly deputies need to consider and evaluate the recent situation through practicing thrift and combating corruption and smuggling. Voters in some localities suggested that in order to implement the National Assembly's resolution on practicing thrift and combating corruption and smuggling, there should be a motivational campaign for the masses with good coordination between criticism and suppression. Importance should be attached to the tasks of law building; avoiding redundant, conflicting, or inconsistent laws and regulations; and solving conflicts between economic interests and responsibilities. Voters' Opinions on the National Assembly's Legislative Tasks. According to the reports of provincial National Assembly deputy groups, voters acknowledge the National Assembly's efforts in its law building activities. The large number of laws passed in 1993 -- such as the law on land, the law on tax on agricultural land use, the law on oil and gas, the law on business bankruptcy, and the draft laws to be passed in the National Assembly's current fifth session -- are proof of the National Assembly's good performance of its legislative function, thus contributing actively to building a law-governed state in socialist Vietnam. Voters, however, expressed great concern over ineffective law enforcement. They think one cause is the lack of guidance, education, and mass motivation in law enforcement. Voters suggested that adequate funds should be allocated to law education campaigns and effective measures should be developed to consolidate and clean up agencies in charge of investigation, prosecution, and jurisdiction. Voters in many provinces and cities held that the publication of draft laws in the print media -- giving people the chance to voice their opinions and suggestions -- is evidence of the democratic and popular characteristics of legislative work, making it a regular political activity of the people. Many discussion sessions were held at all levels -- resident groups, hamlets, villages, districts, cities, and so forth -- with tens of thousands of attendees offering many valuable and useful suggestions. In addition, in the campaign to solicit voters' suggestions for the National Assembly's current fifth session, the following suggestions were raised by many voters: -- Draft laws should be publicized early and the discussion time should be increased so that voters have the appropriate time to study them. -- Along with the publication of draft laws in newspapers, there should be additional guiding documents to make the discussions more effective and of better quality. -- Before a decision is made to amend a law, the law should be reviewed to check for provisions that are no longer suitable. -- Voters in some localities expressed concern over the draft amendment to the law on organization and election of people's councils and people's committees. They submit that several provisions in the draft contradict the 1992 Constitution. Some voters think that the new draft is not as good as some other drafts that were brought up for discussion before. Voters' General Opinions on National Assembly Activities. Most voters expressed delight at the constant improvement of the National Assembly's activities. They held that the National Assembly has performed its legislative function well in the recent past and has tried to improve its supervisory role. Deputies' activities have also changed for the better. Deputies have shown a high sense of responsibility, maintained regular and close contact with the people, and listened carefully to the people's opinions and aspirations. Voters in many localities, however, suggested that the National Assembly should strive to strengthen its controlling and supervisory roles, especially over the two important National Assembly resolutions passed by the fourth session -- on tasks for 1994 and on practicing thrift and combating corruption and smuggling activities. At each session, the National Assembly should review and evaluate the implementation of its resolutions so that it can develop suitable measures to improve implementation. The task of the National Assembly deputies and provincial deputies groups to meet with voters has become more effective and regular. They still think that deputies need to improve and reform their communication with voters for the sake of better quality and greater efficiency. Other Issues. According to the reports of the provincial deputy groups from Ha Tay, Ha Bac, and Vinh Phu, the voters repeated their petition to split their provinces. The above is a summarized report on the opinions and suggestions made by voters nationwide to the National Assembly. The National Assembly Standing Committee solemnly submits this report to the deputies and deputy groups.
