FMLN Spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano said that the victims were members of the same family and that the incident occurred on 29 December in the town of Ochupse, in the jurisdiction of Santa Ana Volcano. According to the FMLN version, several heavily armed men stormed the victims' house and killed Lorenzo de Jesus Cabrera, Santo Feliciana Venegas, and Ruben Eduardo Escobar--tattooing the letter M on his body after beheading him. The victims were rank and file FMLN militants in Santa Ana Department, and the sources said this was another political crime. "Nothing was stolen from the house; they came expressly to kill them," said Zeledon Rodriguez, FMLN representative in Santa Ana. The former guerrillas demanded an investigation in Santa Ana, which was one of the regions that was viewed as a bastion for the death squads during the past armed conflict. According to FMLN statistics, in 1993 approximately 40 members of that organization, including rank and file militants and leaders, were killed by presumed death squads. A special commission consisting of two delegates from the Salvadoran Government, one from the United Nations, and the ombudsman is investigating political murders that have occurred after the signing of peace agreements in January 1992. [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 0014 on 7 January transmits a report stating that "the FMLN reported on 7 January the murder of another member in the western Department of La Libertad." The report adds that "an FMLN spokesman identified the victim as Vicente Soto, a member of the Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces (FPL)."]
