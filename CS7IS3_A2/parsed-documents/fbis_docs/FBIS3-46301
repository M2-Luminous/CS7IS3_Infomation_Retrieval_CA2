The U.S. official made the statement while meeting with visiting Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu. Progress has been made in U.S.-China relations since the Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries in November, 1993, Christopher said, adding that since then there have been other contacts and consultations at various levels. This is good for enhancing mutual understanding, overcoming differences between the two sides, and further improving and developing relations between the two countries, he said. The U.S. is committed to developing important ties with China, and is willing to join the Chinese side to enable relations to develop healthfully, Christopher said. The U.S. official also expressed his admiration for the fact that the 1.2 billion Chinese people have benefited from rapid economic growth in recent years which have seen great changes taking place in China. In reply, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu said that on the whole, the two countries' common interests and common ground outstrip their differences, and this is especially so if viewed in the long term. He said China and the United States will eventually find more converging points of common interest and further relations between the two countries provided both sides show great foresight and look to the 21st century and the whole world, and strictly abide by principles set forth in the three joint communiques with a positive and serious attitude, respect reality and increase consultations. Liu arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of the State Department for political consultations at the vice-foreign-ministerial level, according to an agreement reached in Paris between the foreign ministers of the two countries. Liu had three rounds of consultations with Deputy Secretaries of State Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis, respectively, on Wednesday and Thursday. The two sides had a wide-ranging exchange of views on bilateral relations, human rights, non-proliferation of weapons, trade, and regional and international issues. The two sides found they shared same or similar views on some of these issues, though differences remain on others. Both sides agreed to continue consultations on an equal footing for appropriate, just and reasonable solutions to their differences with an attitude of mutual respect and looking to the future. On Thursday, Liu also met with Deputy Defense Secretary William Perry at the Pentagon. He also met with former U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger. Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Daoyu was also present at the meetings and consultations.
