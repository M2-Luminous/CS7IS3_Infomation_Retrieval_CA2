For two centuries, reads the appeal, Crimea has served -- and will serve, we are convinced of that -- the interests of the fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Also today President Yuriy Meshkov said that the CSCE representative put forward a similar initiative. As for the talks, they are currently continuing within the framework of the joint working commission. The main issue on which the consensus is being sought is an international human rights bill. The Crimean Supreme Soviet session is also under way at the same time. The issue of forming the government has been under consideration since the morning. Despite the fact that Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov met the deputies' requests more than half way, the deputies have, nonetheless, adopted not his, but their own draft resolution as the basis. The debate was prolonged into the evening hours.
