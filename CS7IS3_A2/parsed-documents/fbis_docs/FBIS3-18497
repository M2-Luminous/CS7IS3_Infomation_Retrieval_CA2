On Wednesday [2 March], the German Bundesbank stated that the M3 money supply in January -- after it was seasonally adjusted -- was superior to the average level of the fourth quarter 1993 with an annual rate of 20.6 percent. Apart from the notes and coins in circulation, the money supply M3 also includes sight deposits, time deposits with maturities of less than four years, and savings deposits. According to the Bundesbank, all these components grew rapidly in January. "The pace of expansion was strongest for sight deposits." For 1994, the Bundesbank is seeking a monetary increase between 4 and 6 percent.
