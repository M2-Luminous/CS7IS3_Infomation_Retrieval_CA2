With the latest reductions in the discount and Lombard rates, "the interest rates horizon should be clear for the time being," according to the Bank. "Unlike in the United States, the climb in the value of German securities does not reflect any definite inflation trends," says the Bundesbank's June report. "Foreign confidence in the stability of the mark remains unbroken. This is also visible on foreign currency markets, in which the mark even managed to gain in value against the dollar for a short time." The Bundesbank attributes the rise in German long-term interest rates over the past few months to the financial vortex coming from the United States. In the meantime, short-term interest rates are sinking. On account of the closer link between interest rates in recent years, worldwide uncertainties have materialized in the form of a "high-risk premium" for long-term investments. Bundesbank President Tietmayer is confident that a credible financial policy, supported by a financial and wages policy, "will eventually serve to overcome any unjustified rise in long-term interest rates," although the Bundesbank report also says that the interest on capital sums, which sank to as little as 5.5 percent at the beginning of the year, was underestimated. The unexpectedly strong drop in interest rates on 13 May, involving a fall in the discount rate from 5 to 4.5 percent and a fall in the Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6 percent, was "quite compatible with the concept of money quantity control," according to the Bundesbank. According to the June report, the strong increase in the amount of money in circulation over the past few months (a 15.4-percent increase on an annual scale) has resulted in a great reluctance to save money over a longer term. But the latest drop in interest rates should encourage people to keep less cash on hand and create more savings, says the Bundesbank. Between January and April, total capital sums amounted to a mere 40.8 billion marks [DM], so that the increase in medium-term investments amounted to 6.5 percent between these months, representing a 4 percent increase on an annual scale. The total value of savings certificates in the nonbanking sector fell by DM15.8 billion, while fixed-term savings plans valid for more than four years received strong subsidies (DM22.9 billion). The increase in credits between January and April was far greater than last year, DM65.9 billion compared to DM45.7 billion. The Bundesbank attributed this increased demand for credits to forthcoming reductions in tax concessions for property. Nevertheless borrowers, fearful of higher long-term interest rates, still tried to secure more favorable terms.
