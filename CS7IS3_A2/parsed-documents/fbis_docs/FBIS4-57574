He did so on Radio Ya when speaking in favor of an organization he called "Democratic Convergence." During his extended interview, he said the political right "is trying to glamorize former President Daniel Ortega so he, who is politically depleted, will run in the 1996 elections and lose and they, the right, will win. But," he cautioned, "they are forgetting about us -- the Democratic Center." The announcement was made when Carlos Guadamuz, director of that radio station, asked Lacayo if he will run as the head of the convergence, to which Lacayo also refers as the Center. The minister answered: "One word to the wise is sufficient." Lacayo said: If this Convergence "believes I am the person who has led the country's economy down a good road" and decides to nominate me, "I will not evade this task." He then noted that what is important is that the political center win. He positioned the government of Violeta Chamorro, who does not belong to any party, in this center. The Chamorro administration was born of a 14-party alliance. Lacayo said the political center will "choose the best Nicaraguan for the 1996 candidacy" and that as long as there is a centrist government, the right does not stand a chance of winning the 1996 elections." Lacayo noted, as he did two weeks ago in Mateare, that the people do not want "the liberal-Somozist option" or the Sandinists to win the elections because the country would be polarized. The presidency minister said that a centrist government is necessary to "control the extreme right and the extreme left." According to Lacayo, Democratic Convergence must not function on the basis of personalities, "as this would generate division and jealousy and because the work must not favor any particular candidate, even if the candidate is Antonio Lacayo."
