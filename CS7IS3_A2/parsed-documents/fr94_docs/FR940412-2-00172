After completion of this corporate meeting in the afternoon of April 14, the members of the BIB will reconvene in closed session, if necessary. They would consider the potential use of grant funds to achieve budget reductions consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States. This BIB meeting would be closed, therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (1), (2), and (9)(B). Premature disclosure of the information discussed would likely (1) significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action, including but not limited to negotiations abroad; (2) disclose matters that would be properly classified to be kept secret in the interests of foreign policy; and (3) in some instances, relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
