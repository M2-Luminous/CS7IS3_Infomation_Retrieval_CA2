I do not want to stress the almost nine-page long text in which the Presidency's spokesman Traian Chebeleu finally fulfills one of his presumed duties: to be a man. However, I would like to remark that, after a quick glance at the text, I felt a certain exaggeration of the situation. Traian Chebeleu takes Corneliu Vadim Tudor's attack as a real classical tragedy. The ambassador appears before the broad public with a more disheveled face than Antigone. At one point, he reaches a stage when he apologizes to his family, relatives, and to his female and male colleagues with whom he used to work together. It is clear that he is moved by the flow of insults and calumnies that fell on his head. We would sympathize with him, cry together with him, and blow each other's noses, if the following problem did not crop up. For over two years several public figures in today's Romania, among them myself, have been defamed week after week by Corneliu Vadim Tudor. This pocket-size Zhirinovskiy however is the creation of President Ion Iliescu. Thanks to the president he revived from the political and journalistic death to which the 1989 revolution condemned him. Thanks to Ion Iliescu he won in the elections. Thanks to Ion Iliescu the legal bodies have not given justice to any of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's victims. Not even in the case that is crying to heaven through its clarity, namely the case of the former prosecutor general, Gheorghe Robu. How can the legal bodies start acting against Corneliu Vadim Tudor when he is the leader of a party that is allied with Ion Iliescu?! All this time, President Ion Iliescu has not made one single move that might indicate a break with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Ion Iliescu was happily rubbing his hands every time the PRM [Greater Romania Party] leader was slandering his political adversaries. He accepted that the PRM senator should jump to his help with his journalistic filth every time a journalist or a politician dared to remark that the president also makes mistakes sometimes. This discreet complicity gave Corneliu Vadim Tudor the enthusiasm to do what he wants in political life and in the field of journalism. And now, when the wave of filth is turning against his collaborators, the president, through Traian Chebeleu, shows signs of unrest. Thus, no matter how much our souls would wish to deplore the presidency's spokesman, we can say nothing else except that his tragic posture is ridiculous. Just as ridiculous as the letter of solidarity addressed to Chebeleu by Adrian Nastase. As far as I know, Adrian Nastase is the leader of a party [PDSR -- Social Democracy Party of Romania] that is allied with the PRM. He was, until recently, in close unity of ideas and feelings with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Now, when one of the president's men is attacked, he sends that person a letter of solidarity. We would have expected something else from the man called Adrian Nastase. For example, we would have expected the radical move of a political breakup with the PRM. However, such a move involves certain risks, for example to lose the support granted to the PDSR by the PRM. How can Adrian Nastase assume such a risk? It is much more comfortable and cozy to send a letter of solidarity to Traian Chebeleu. I would have not written about the answer of the Presidency's spokesman if, in the end of his humdrum, he had not referred to my person and to the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI publication. Suddenly, sliding into the tricky field of psychology, Mr. Traian Chebeleu assumes that I have a spiritual impulse. Namely, that allegedly I have reproduced "with an undisguised pleasure" the insults and objectionable expressions used by Corneliu Vadim Tudor, in the several hundred thousand issues of the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI daily. Traian Chebeleu is just as poor a psychologist as a politician. The president's spokesman did not understand anything of our journalistic action. If the insult "oral sex" had been formulated by just any journalist, I would not have noticed it. As I have often mentioned in the columns of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, the incredible insult belongs not to any journalist but a political figure, namely the leader of a party, moreover, who, through the goodwill of the PDSR, is also secretary of the Senate. More than that, taking into consideration the negotiations of the PDSR with its left-oriented allies, starting 1 March this person might become a minister. Both through the information published, as well as through my editorials I have drawn attention to the fact that we are facing an incredible case of degradation of Romanian political life. We have not simply reproduced Corneliu Vadim Tudor's despicable words, but published an information about an unusual event. Through this fact we warned not only about the hole into which Romanian political life might fall, but also about the idiotic things that Corneliu Vadim Tudor might commit once he gets to power.
