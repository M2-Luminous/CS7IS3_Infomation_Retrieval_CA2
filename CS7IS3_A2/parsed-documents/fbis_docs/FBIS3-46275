It was agreed unanimously that the banks should firmly implement the monetary and credit policy of the People's Bank of China as well as the measures for macroeconomic regulation and control, put the national interest first, strictly abide by financial discipline, and enforce all orders and prohibitions in order to execute work in the banking sector well in 1994. The national meetings of branch directors of the five banks began in Beijing on 12 January. During the meetings, the various banks outlined their reform measures and operational plans for 1994. Zhang Xiao, president of the ICBC, noted: The guiding principle and tasks of the ICBC for 1994 are to conscientiously implement the guidelines of Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the State Council's decision on reforming the banking structure, vigorously expand sources of capital, exercise strict control over credit volume, intensify reform of internal mechanisms, make continued efforts to consolidate order in the banking sector, create conditions for gradually changing itself into a state-owned commercial bank, and promote a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy. Zhang Xiao pointed out: In transforming itself from a specialized bank into a commercial bank, the bank must first of all engage in the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities, and in risk management of assets. For this reason, starting from this year, the ICBC will implement across the board the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities under the management of lending limits. The bank will appraise -- in terms of total volume, turnover, security, and efficiency -- such indexes as the abundance rate of capital, the deposits-lending ratio, the turnover rate of assets, the quality of lending, the profit rate of assets, and so forth. There will also be an incremental switch from evaluating the volume of increase to evaluating the balance. Meanwhile, we will set up a risk safeguard mechanism, mechanisms for separating policy lending and commercial lending, mechanisms for allocating sectorial funds, and a new mechanism for foreign exchange operations. Ma Yongwei, president of the ABC, said: The principal tasks for banks in rural areas are as follows: Strictly control the volume of credit, expand the sources of funds, rationalize the credit structure, and increase input in agriculture; steadily implement reform of the rural banking structure; make continued efforts to consolidate order in the banking sector, step up infrastructure construction, strengthen internal management, and further improve economic efficiency; and persist in the policy of giving equal emphasis on two fronts and doing well in both, and raise the quality of cadres. Ma Yongwei noted: This year we must truly increase agricultural lending. The increase in agricultural loans, which accounted for 6 percent of the total increase of ABC's lending last year, should be raised to 10 percent this year. In setting lending priority, we should -- while persisting in operating under the guidance of market forces and emphasizing efficiency and technological upgrading -- help accelerate the readjustment of the structure of agriculture and the mix of agricultural products and develop, on a priority basis, a highly efficient agriculture that provides greater and better yields. Meanwhile, we should lend active support to village and township enterprises to help them improve efficiency and grow in a steady and sound manner; and we will also promote development of the rural market and enliven commodity circulation in rural areas. Speaking of the general goals of the rural banking reform set to start step by step this year, Ma Yongwei said: We will, by way of reform, develop a rural banking system whereby the Agricultural Development Bank of China [ADBC], the ABC, and rural credit cooperatives will be closely integrated and develop through coordination. Under this new system, the newly founded ADBC will handle strictly defined agricultural policy-lending business, the ABC will gradually shift toward the operating mechanism of a commercial bank, and the rural credit cooperatives will be gradually "disjoined" from the ADBC and, if needed, form an agricultural cooperative bank in a well-planned manner. Wang Qiren, chairman of the BOC board of directors, outlined the BOC's principal tasks for 1994 as follows: Intensify banking reform and change the mechanisms step by step; persist in steady operations and constantly increase the bank's resources; and improve scientific management and enforce strict management discipline. He emphasized: a new system of foreign exchange administration has been put into effect this year. The banks should conscientiously carry out foreign exchange selling and buying business, improve management of foreign exchange accounts, and improve customer service. We should institute and improve a system of listed exchange rates for the entire banking sector under which the head office is responsible for setting a unified exchange rate and the floating range, to ensure all branches follow a uniform rate. Meanwhile, we should manage the banks according to law and actively cultivate and develop a foreign exchange market. Wang Qiren said: In changing itself into a commercial bank this year, the BOC will focus primarily on setting up a renminbi fund management system characterized by unified regulation and control and division of responsibility among different levels, engage in the management of the proportions of assets and liabilities and in risk management of assets; separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking; and make active but steady efforts for entry into the monetary market. Zhou Daojiong, president of the PCBC, said: A major component of the reform of China's banking sector in 1994 will be the establishment of the proposed National Development Bank [NDB] to provide policy support for key state projects, and handle lending and discounting [tie xi 6317 1873] business. PCBC will drop policy-lending that has been part of its business. Consequently, there will be a number of changes in PCBC's business: First, in connection with the operational readjustment and division of responsibility, PCBC will not directly handle policy-lending any more. Instead, it will be commissioned by the NDB to handle policy- lending. Second, by changing its managerial mechanism, PCBC will operate as a commercial bank; it will gradually implement the management principles of independent operation, responsibility for its profits and losses, taking risks on its own, and exercising self-restraint. Zhou Daojiong pointed out: After shifting tracks, the PCBC will focus on long- and medium-term lending. Wang Mingquan, president of the CBC, pointed out that the CBC's objective for 1994 is to strive to run a standardized commercial bank. He said: In the new year, the CBC will carry out a series of reforms of its corporate system, organizational structure, motivational mechanism, distribution system, and so on. We will put the stress of business development in urban centers and economically developed regions, and further improve our internal operational mechanisms. We will ensure fluidity, safety, and profitability of banking assets, increase the value of assets and profits, and optimize our structure. The reforms will mainly deal with standardizing the CBC's share-holding system and perfecting its corporate system; persisting in comprehensive operation with business managed by specialized departments, strengthening the CBC's comprehensive service functions, conforming to the new supervisory procedures of the central bank, and establishing a system of appraisal for internal performance; gradually enhancing the head office's fund control ability and operational functions, and improving the organizational management system; actively seeking business development abroad and constantly raising the CBC's international status; and promoting the personnel system of a commercial bank, and improving the motivational mechanism and distribution system for employees.
