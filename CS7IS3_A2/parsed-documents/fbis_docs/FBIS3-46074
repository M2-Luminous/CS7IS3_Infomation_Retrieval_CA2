Now, it has opened 25 cities and 88 counties and established ties with over 140 countries and regions. In 1993, the province received over 5,400 foreign guests from some 60 countries, such as the United States, Japan and Republic of Korea. Among them, 220 were important officials who came to investigate the investment environment. For example, during his visit, Goh Keng Swee, former vice-premier of Singapore, reached tentative agreement with relevant departments on several projects involving foodstuffs, power and housing industries. So far, 17 cities in the province have sister counterparts in six countries and regions, such as Australia, Romania and Kazakhstan. Their friendly relations are mainly based on economic cooperation.
