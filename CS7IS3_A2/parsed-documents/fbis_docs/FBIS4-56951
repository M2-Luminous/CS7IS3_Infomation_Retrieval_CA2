This was reported by Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos during the inauguration of the "Businessmen and Economic Opening" seminar, organized by the Colombian Foreign Trade Institute (Incomex). According to the minister, the negotiation's technical commission will hold a new meeting before the end of the week to try to reach a decision on the points pending on the 400-page agreement. However, several businessmen, mainly in the textile sector, fear that political interests are taking precedence over commercial interests in the signing of the G-3 agreement. "We are worried that conditions unfavorable to the Colombian industrial sector might be accepted just so they can sign the agreement prior to leaving. Mexico is demanding 100-percent compliance with the product-origin regulations, and this is impossible," a textile industry businessmen stated. With the signing of the G-3 and Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] agreements, which, according to Minister Santos, will also be negotiated next week, the government will have kept the entire integration program, which it proposed when the Foreign Trade Ministry was created. The signing of approximately 22 bilateral and multilateral agreements have given the country access to a market of 200 million Latin Americans, not just a market of 34 million Colombians. In addition to those agreements, the government also obtained tariff preferences from the United States and a 10-year agreement extension with the European Union. According to Minister Santos, "having 60 percent of the international markets tariff free, Colombia will have favored access to them, but will have to learn to sell and conquer those markets." False Infrastructure To conquer the markets to which Colombia has guaranteed access through its commercial integration agreements, the country has to resolve its infrastructure and education problems. According to Santos, the country has a large infrastructure shortage and is under the Latin American average of 3.6 km of highway per citizen. "This means that, on average, our exports are 5-percent more expensive and that we are 5-percent less competitive due to our shortcomings in terms of highways, without counting deficiencies in our airports and other communication systems," Santos added. During his speech to inaugurate the Incomex seminar, Santos noted the scarcity of human resources. He highlighted the Monitor survey results that indicate that 85 percent of Colombian businessmen have expressed their dissatisfaction with the quality of human resources. "The universities are increasingly below international averages; only 50 percent of our youth get to high school, and there is a 10-percent illiteracy rate," the minister asserted. According to the foreign trade minister, the competitive advantages were previously in natural resources and cheap labor. However, today, the most important advantages are in infrastructure and human resources. Finally, Minister Santos referred to the need to attract foreign investment to the country since it will bring new technology, products, and jobs.
