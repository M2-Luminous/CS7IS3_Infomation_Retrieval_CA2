C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- With Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang's remarks on Taiwan's policy toward Mainland China becoming the focus of attention late last year, the ministry he chairs is expected to continue to play a leading role in the cabinet for the new year. Chiang said at a press conference following a ministerial meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November that Taiwan "is taking a step-by-step approach toward a two-China policy." Although Chiang later explained that his statement was simply aimed at refuting mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's remarks that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China [ROC], his words have still been a subject of much controversy. The Taipei government has reiterated that its goal of pursuing China's eventual peaceful reunification has not changed. In late December, the minister said he would ask the cabinet to consider opening direct shipping links across the Taiwan strait on a city-to-city or harbor-to-harbor basis in order to help local manufacturers reduce transportation costs. The proposal drew a mixed reaction. Taiwan currently only allows indirect trade, transportation, and mail connections with the mainland in accordance with its national unification guidelines, which set phased goals for the development of cross-strait ties. Observers here said Chiang's two politically sensitive statements were enough to make him 1993's "man of the year" in Taiwan. Since assuming his ministerial post in February 1993 after having served as a vice minister of economic affairs, Chiang has plunged intensively into his work. He placed priority on Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), rallied efforts to avert possible trade sanctions by the United States, and started to promote Taiwan as a business operations center in the Asia-Pacific. Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992, aims to become a full member this year. In late April, Taiwan was put on the American "priority watch list" targeted for trade retaliation. Chiang's efforts at making Taiwan an Asia-Pacific hub reaped bountiful success when strategic alliances with 11 foreign enterprises, including American companies AT&T, Motorola, General Electric, Carpenter, and General Motors Corp., Holland's Philips Co., and ABB of Sweden, were formed. Transfers of advanced technology from these multinationals are expected to help upgrade Taiwan's industrial base, while these firms in turn could use Taiwan as a gateway to tap the vast Southeast Asian and mainland Chinese markets. Chiang stumbled, however, in talks over the proposed joint venture between Taiwan Aerospace Corp. and British Aerospace plc (BAE) to produce and market BAE-developed regional passenger jetliners. The talks deadlocked at the end of the year. Moreover, Taiwan last year suffered its most serious drought in 39 years, underscoring the importance of preserving water resources to the minister and other officials. For the new year, a load of work is already piling up for Chiang. Taiwan's talks with the United States on tariff concessions are to be held later this month, and negotiations with respective GATT contracting parties will start in February. In addition, March will see the United States review trade practices of countries placed under the priority watch list. Chiang also has to place emphasis on growing cross-strait trade, which will be key to Taiwan's economic development. Cross-strait trade is expected to top US$20 billion this year, up substantially from 1993's US$15 billion. Judging from the tasks ahead, Chiang and his ministry will have to work hard to win Taiwan a role on the world stage.
