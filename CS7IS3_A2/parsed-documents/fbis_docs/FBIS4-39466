On Friday night Muscovites and visitors to the capital who were heading for the Central Tourist Office in Leninskiy Prospekt were stopped by militia cordons and volunteer forces. The bewildered participants in the planned ceremonies were told: We have found out that an explosive device has been planted in the concert hall of the Tourist Office, and you are not allowed to go in there.... The plan was simple: Of course people would not go in if there was a bomb there, they would stand about at the entrance for a while, and then go away. However, the organizers of the provocation miscalculated. Later, when it was established that there were no explosive devices there, the assembled company filled the capacious hall to overflowing.... The festival went on for three days, and each of these days ended with soirees at the Central Tourist Office. And I can say with certainty that these soirees left the guests and the hosts with nothing but good impressions. From talking to the initiator of the festival, the publisher of the AL-QUDS (Holy City) newspaper, Doctor Shaaban Khafiz Shaaban. From the conversations and speeches of famous Russian politicians and public figures. Ruslan Khasbulatov, Ilya Konstantinov, Stanislav Terekhov, Yegor Ligachev, Sazhi Umalatova, Vladislav Achalov, and Valentin Chikin...were greeted warmly and sincerely by the meeting participants. Maybe Aleksandr Nevzorov got more applause than the others, but there is an explanation for this. First, the participants in the festivities greeted him as a State Duma deputy and then as a famous television journalist, and then they greeted his first movie, "Miracle-working," on the bloody events of October 1993.... Artistes Aleksandr Vedernikov, Ivan Yakushin, Valentin Tsvetkov, Tamara Kartintseva, and Tatyana Filimonova, and amateur Palestinian and Russian ensembles certainly enhanced these soirees and gave people a lot of pleasure.
