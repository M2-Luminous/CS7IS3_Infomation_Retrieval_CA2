The agreements signed by the leaders of the two countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo, and Massandra, which alleviated some accumulated tension, only temporarily cooled the zeal of the Ukrainian military, who intended to have a "perhaps small but their own" fleet by confiscating the property of Russia. The fact that the Black Sea Fleet with all of its infrastructure is really Russian can be seen convincingly not only in the Massandra protocol but also in its exclusive Russian financing since September of last year. Last Friday, after a meeting of the heads of state of the CIS, presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk also drew a line under the latest attempt at a unilateral division of the Black Sea Fleet begun by the Ukrainian special forces in Odessa. An agreement was signed on the staged settlement of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, which contains three basic directions. The document states that the Ukrainian Naval Forces and the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation will be based separately and the Ukrainian side gets 15 to 20 percent of the Fleet's ships. It is planned to prepare an agreement on the parameters of such a division within 10 days. It was essentially a matter of the first Russian proposals on the division of the property of the former Union and the allocation to Ukraine of those ships and units of the Black Sea Fleet whose presence is adequate to resolve the tasks in the protection of the naval boundaries of the sovereign state. On Saturday, however, a statement by Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, was disseminated that stressed that once again the Russian side was forced to remind people of the hard reality that was the basis of the joint document of the two presidents: "Unweighed words and actions are inappropriate when it is a matter of something that is sacred to the nation, as is the Black Sea Fleet." Is it appropriate to remind people that none of the sides must put into doubt the sincerity of the negotiating process? It turns out that it is. Figuratively speaking, the ink had not yet dried on the signed agreement when the first alarming reports were received from Izmail, Ochakov, and Nikolayev on the violation of the spirit and the letter of the indicated document by the Ukrainian side. It is there where the Western Naval Region of the Ukrainian Naval Forces is being organized and its Chief, Capt 1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainetz decided "to grow into the situation in advance." A Ukrainian brigade commander--Capt. 1st Rank Yaroslav Fedorishin--has already been assigned to a brigade of river craft of the Black Sea Fleet in Izmail and the seamen have been promised high pay for swearing allegiance to Ukraine, whereas the rest will be forced to leave the boundaries of the republic. Ukraine has begun the systematic and unilateral seizure of Fleet property even before a mechanism is worked out for the division of the Black Sea Fleet as set forth by the agreement. Meanwhile, Kiev is already spreading its own interprepations of the signed document with respect to the time for which bases are leased and the places where the Black Sea Fleet will be stationed. The times specified by the agreement for the separation of the bases to avoid conflicts between the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Naval Forces are extremely rigid, something that was not in the previous documents that left the resolution of the problem to the distant future. But the mechanism for a new "watershed" may "break down" again and again because of the unilateral actions of the Ukrainian military people, complicating the relations of the two sides. Still, one would like to believe that the time of ultimatums with which the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense entered the territory of Russian military units under the cover of the assault rifles of special forces has passed. There is a document guaranteeing this and cemented by the signatures of the leaders of the two neighboring friendly countries, and there is still a whole week remaining for the achievement of a common point of view at the level of experts and working groups on the division of the Black Sea Fleet. The purpose is to accurately carry out the achieved agreements in the localities. This must be clear, above all, to the Ukrainian military people, who are presently not called upon to show any "initiative" in the interpretation of the agreement signed by their commander-in-chief.
