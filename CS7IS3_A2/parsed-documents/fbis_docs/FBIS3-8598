[Begin Havel recording] I do not agree with the view that what is happening now in Slovakia is of no concern to us. It does concern us very much. We cannot be indifferent if, in a neighboring state, which at the same time is so close to us, which is so firmly bound to us by innumerable threads, there is order or chaos, whether democracy is winning there or an authoritarian rule predominates. We cannot be indifferent to this. Therefore, I observe very tensely the developments there. [end recording]
