At a press conference following a meeting between Haavisto and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec today, the two ministers assessed relations between their countries as good. During the meeting, bilateral relations as well as economic development and European questions were discussed. Haavisto told journalists that his current two-day visit to Prague was very important for him. Zieleniec said the talks provided a good opportunity for getting acquainted with Finland's experiences in the process of integration into the European Union (EU) and in its relationship towards Russia. Zieleniec said the Czech Republic considered an active promotion of Czech-Finnish relations to be of great use, adding that Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus would visit Finland next month and a Finnish parliamentary delegation was expected in Prague. Haavisto said Finland was seeking to conclude its negotiations on membership in the EU by the end of this month. He said the EU would be one of the most important factors of future European security and membership in it would thus make it possible for Finland to participate in its strengthening. He said Finland was not interested in membership in NATO or any other new security structures. He described the U.S. Partnership for Peace project as very good for the development of security especially in Central and Eastern Europe, adding that Finland sought to find ways to approach it. Asked to comment on the statement made by Russian extremist and chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, that "if Finland was interested in Karelia then all Finland should go to Russia," Haavisto said that similar "extraordinary phenomena" also exist elsewhere and that excessive attention should not be paid to them. He said there were no problems in relations between Russia and Finland and that his country has no territorial claims against Russia. He said that Finland considered its relations with Russia and the whole of Europe to be equally important and was striving to find a solution that would enhance security and stability in Europe and especially in its northern part.
