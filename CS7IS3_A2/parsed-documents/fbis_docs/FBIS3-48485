FBIS3-48485 "dreas017__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-017-A Document Type:Daily Report 26 January 1994 ANNEX Japan DA Advisor: Need To Reexamine Civilian Control OW2201030294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2201030294 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the Joint Staff Council and currently advisor to the Defense Agency [DA], spoke at a lecture in Tokyo on 19 January, indicating Japan needs to reexamine the current situation regarding the principle of civilian control. He said this needs to be done as part of an overall review of Japan's defense program which the government has embarked on, primarily focusing on a review of the "National Defense Program Outline" [NDPO]. Expressing his thoughts on the issue, Sakuma stated: "Basically, Self-Defense Force [SDF] officials should have control over unit operations and over educating and training personnel." Concerning studies on legal problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations, Sakuma added: "Japan should now begin sufficiently studying how it can cooperate indirectly with the U.S. military should an emergency occur on the Korean peninsula." On 1 January Sakuma became the first among former SDF officers to be appointed a DA advisor at the recommendation of Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the DA, and others. He is also considered to be one of the favorable candidates for a panel which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to establish for reviewing the NDPO. Consequently, his remarks are expected to create a stir. Concerning civilian control, Sakuma said: "There were valid reasons when the two laws on defense (DA Establishment Law and SDF Law) were enacted, so it could not be helped." However, he insisted the SDF should have control over its own operations, saying: "There should be both a military command and a military administration." He also stressed role-sharing, adding: "The DA (internal division) would take care of administrative duties related to defense and act as a contact point with politics." In connection with studies regarding legislation for emergency situations, Sakuma pointed out that "a situation where only Japan would be attacked is inconceivable." On the premise of a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Sakuma stressed: "Since Japan and the ROK would be involved, Japan cannot remain idle if the United States responds to the situation. We are at a time when it is necessary to conduct preparatory studies on emergency situations which may develop outside of Japan." Concerning collective defense, Sakuma said: "I do not object to it, but I feel it is necessary to cut current restrictions to a reasonable level." Regarding the Japanese-U.S. Security Treaty, Sakuma cited the issue of a "one-sided alliance," saying: "So far the SDF has concentrated on building its own defense capabilities, but now it has become important to use such capabilities correctly. It ought to be that Japan can support the U.S. military." He thus stressed the need to conclude an agreement with the United States on having Japan provide logistic support and labor for which the United States would pay. Sakuma summarized his recommendations as follows: 1) reexamine the two laws on defense; 2) expand studies on legal problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations; and 3) formulate regulations governing the action of SDF. Concerning review of the NDPO, Sakuma said: "If a valid system were to be established regarding mobilization during emergencies and reserve forces, I believe active manpower can be cut back in times of peace. However, it is important to strengthen the SDF so it can exist independently in its own right." Sakuma held his lecture at a meeting of the "Japan National Defense Association" -- a foundation under DA jurisdiction -- with former Soichiro Ito, former DA director general, as chairman. Among the audience were DA officials and senior SDF officials.
