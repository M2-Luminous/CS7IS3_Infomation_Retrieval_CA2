In a wide-ranging interview with two senior representatives claiming to be leaders of the UDA's south Belfast and southeast Antrim battalions -- the first since the Downing Street Declaratlon last December -- it emerged that the illegal loyalist organisation has been studying IRA strategy and is planning for a "long war." "Our days of reacting to the IRA are over. As far as we are concerned our agenda is pro-active." The wooing of the IRA by the British and Irish Governments was proof that violence pays, the men said. "The view from our community is that they've bombed our towns and killed our people for 25 years and the British Government is saying, `Hold on, we don't want any more 3 million pound bombs in the centre of London.' There is a strong feeling of alienation within our community." The UDA had adopted long and short-term policies against what it calls the pan-nationalist front -- the IRA, Sinn Fein, the Social and Democratic Labour Party [SDLP] and the Irish Government -- they said. "We are planning for a long effort. Our volunteers are more than capable of carrying on the role of defenders of our way of life, and as far as we're concerned we are quite prepared for the long haul." The men said that given the recent political developments they believed there was a grim future ahead. "The ingredients are there for it. I think civil war gets nearer by the month and that's not war-mongering, that's fact." The restraint with which the UDA had responded to the IRA's temporary suspension of activities was proof that it was no longer simply reacting to republican violence. "We have our own agenda. Even if there was a permanent cessation of violence from the IRA it doesn't mean to say we would cause a cessation of our own policies because there's still the other major problem of another state on this island laying claim to the territory of Northern Ireland." The senior UDA figures said that any extension of the IRA's ceasefire would be taken as a sign that its terms had been met by the Government. "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked at." Neither man had any doubt that secret talks between the IRA and the Government were continuing and that Sinn Fein would receive the clarification it was seeking. "There's a thin line between dialogue and negotiation. The IRA want to know what comes next, what are steps two, three and four. But we would like to know that too." The UDA was developing its political agenda: a working group was meeting to fuse two loyalist blueprints, "Beyond the Religious Divide" and "Commonsense." The new policy document, setting out proposals for an independent Ulster within the framework of the European Union, would be published within the next two months, they said. The leaders said they realised that the British Government no longer wanted Northern Ireland to be part of the United Kingdom, but they were heartened by other support -- not identified -- on the mainland for the survival of the Union. Politically they would prefer to remain within the UK but the alternative was independence. "We've a great deal of faith in our own ability. We are a very independent people. There are people within Northern Ireland who are more than capable of running this country and we have no doubt that the day is fast coming when those leaders will come to the fore." The UDA wanted all the constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland to sit round the same table, settle their differences and work out new arrangements for its governance. As a gesture of good faith, two years ago loyalist paramilitaries had called a three-month ceasefire to allow a similar exercise -- known as the Brooke talks -- which had been scuppered by the SDLP. They believed the majority of nationalists would accept an internal settlement. Those who did not were entitled to pursue their aspiration for a united Ireland through democratic means, "not through the barrel of a gun." One of the men said: "I think people will progress out of that. We are all inter-dependent within the confines of Europe. Most of the legislation will be emanating from Brussels, so I think the majority of people will have moved on, not clawing themselves into that `little island' mentality. ``Personally I want to be part and parcel of a greater social and economic entity and I'll work with anybody to achieve that as long as they don't lay unconstitutional claims on my country.'' The men denied that their aims were sectarian. "We've no problems whatsoever with integrated education. That would be a barrier removed, but the main opponent to that is the Catholic Church. There's other aspects of the Catholic community that we have no problem living with at all. As far as we're concerned the cause of the confiict is the IRA." By pursuing the current political goals the Irish Government was "giving a reason for the IRA to continue." There would be a price to pay, the men warned. "They haven't paid it yet, but all their dues are being recorded and they will have to pay up." Asked whether they would be prepared to talk to John Hume, as the SDLP leader has suggested, the UDA representatives said there was no merit in the idea. "John Hume will never have our trust, he will never convince the loyalist community that he is genuine. He's past his sell-by date and it's time some other politician emerged to take his place." Mr Hume had led the SDLP down a road which "we believe a number of people within his party didn't want to go down." His removal would allow the election of a new leader with whom loyalists were certain they could work. Asked to assess the UDA's present strength and level of support, the men said: "We've recruits coming in daily who are prepared to come into the organisation, and we are very pleased with the amount of assistance that we're getting from people who would share our views but would perhaps not be prepared to join us and can give us support in other ways."
