FR940214-1-00022 FR940214-1-00004 (5) The Cooperating Sponsor may redetermine claims on the basis of additional documentation or information not considered when the claims were originally filed when such documentation or information clearly changes the ocean carrier's liability. Approval of such changes by CCC is not required regardless of amount. However, copies of redetermined claims and supporting documentation or information shall be furnished to CCC. (6) The Cooperating Sponsor may negotiate compromise settlements of claims of any amount, provided that proposed compromise settlements of claims having a value of $5,000 or more shall require prior approved in writing by CCC. When a claim is compromised, the Cooperating Sponsor may retain from the amount collected, the amounts authorized in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and in addition, an amount representing such percentage of the special charges described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section as compromised amount is to the full amount of the claim. When a claim is less than $600, the Cooperating Sponsor may terminate collection activity when it is determined that pursuit of such claims will not be economically sound. Approval for such termination by CCC is not required; however, the Cooperating Sponsor shall notify KCFMO, Chief, Debt Management Division when collection activity on a claim is terminated. (7) All amounts collected in excess of the amounts authorized herein to be retained shall be remitted to CCC. For the purpose of determining the amount to be retained by the Cooperating Sponsor from the proceeds of claims filed against ocean carriers, the word ``claim'' shall refer to the loss and damage to commodities which are shipped on the same voyage of the same vessel to the same port destination, irrespective of the kinds of commodities shipped or the number of different bills of lading issued by the carrier. (8) If a Cooperating Sponsor is unable to effect collection of a claim or negotiate an acceptable compromise settlement within the applicable period of limitation or any extension thereof granted in writing by the liable party or parties, the rights of the Cooperating Sponsor to the claim shall be assigned to CCC in sufficient time to permit the filing of legal action prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. Generally, the Cooperating Sponsor shall assign claim rights to CCC no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the period of limitation or any extension thereof. In all cases, the Cooperating Sponsor, shall keep CCC informed of the progress of its collection efforts and shall promptly assign their claim rights to CCC upon request. Subsequently, if CCC collects on or settles the claim, CCC shall, except as indicated below, pay to the Cooperating Sponsor the amount to which it would have been entitled had it collected on the claim. The additional 10 percent on amounts collected in excess of $200 will be payable, however, only if CCC determines that reasonable efforts were made to collect the claim prior to the assignment, or if payment is determined to be commensurate with the extra efforts exerted in further documenting the claim. If documentation requirements have not been fulfilled and the lack of such documentation has not been justified to the satisfaction of CCC, CCC will deny payment of all allowances to the Cooperating Sponsor. (9) When a Cooperating Sponsor fails to file a claim, permit a claim to become time-barred, or fail to take timely actions to insure the right of CCC to assert such claims, and CCC determines that the Cooperating Sponsor failed to properly exercise its responsibilities under the Agreement, the Cooperating Sponsor shall be liable to the United States for the cost and freight value of the commodities lost to the program. (e) Fault of Cooperating Sponsor in country of distribution . The Cooperating Sponsor shall pay to CCC the value of the commodities, proceeds or program income lost, damaged, or misused (or may, with prior Agricultural Counselor or Attache approval, replace such commodities with similar commodities of equal value). If the Cooperating Sponsor: (1) improperly distributed a commodity; (2) uses a commodity, monetized proceeds from the sale thereof or program income for purposes not permitted under the Program Agreement, the approved Plan of Operation or this part 1499;
