The article says: This is well illustrated by the serious crisis the imperialists now are undergoing. Above all, socio-class antagonisms have grown worse in the imperialist countries because of the reactionary and corrupt nature of the capitalist system. The capitalist political system is a political system and order which was framed up by a handful of the capitalist class to oppress and exploit the popular masses who account for an overwhelming majority of the population. Hence, the class antagonisms between the reactionary ruling class and the popular masses are increasing day by day. In 1992 alone violent protests of dissatisfied workers against the reactionary policy of the government took place in the United States on 111,000 occasions. This graphically shows to what extent the socio-class antagonisms have gone in imperialist countries. With the money-is-everything tendency fully reflected in politics, plutocracy is holding sway in capitalist society. In Japan, the cabinet had to resign and the Diet was dissolved before the expiry of its term repeatedly due to bribery cases involving political circles including the "Lockheed scandal". Economic crisis is deteriorating in imperialist countries. The annual federal financial deficits of the United States are more or less 300 billion dollars and the state debts far exceed 4,000 billion dollars. The economy in Britain, Japan, Germany, France and other countries is also floundering like a ship in distress. Japan is now in the grip of worst depression since World War II, which gives a glimpse of the society of this country seized with uncontrollable uncertainty for the future. The serious crisis of the imperialists is also manifested in all cases of corruption and social vices rife in these countries. The United States called the "drug kingdom" has more than 30 million addicts. Violent criminal cases like murder and robbery are getting more uncontrollable in the imperialist countries. The imperialists, with false propaganda about the "end of socialism," are trying to divert elsewhere the public attention from the serious crisis of destruction they are now undergoing, cause ideological vacillation among the revolutionary people of the world who aspire after independence, progress and socialism and to break their faith in socialism so as to stem the tide of history. But this is a foolish dream.
