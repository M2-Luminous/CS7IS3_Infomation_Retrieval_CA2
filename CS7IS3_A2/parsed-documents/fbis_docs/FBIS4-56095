Thursday's KSPRM meeting discussed the outcome of negotiations conducted within the trilateral commission and in six teams which are working out an agreement on social guarantees. The committees secretary Grzegorz Rydlewski told journalists after the meeting that similar treatment would be given to questions ensuing from government-trade unions negotiations on social guarantees. Head of the trilateral commission, Deputy Labour Minister Andrzej Baczkowski emphasized that the commission is not only a negotiating but also decision making organ. He also stressed that the commission examines all pressing demands put forward by the solidarity trade union which does not mean, however, that all of them would be satisfied. Baczkowski confirmed that the government would not carry out bilateral negotiations with solidarity terming that form of talks as anachronistic. Rydlewski added that the trilateral commission, grouping representatives of the government, trade unions and employers organizations, was a good instrument for solving unions demands. The next meeting of the trilateral commission will be held on June 6.
