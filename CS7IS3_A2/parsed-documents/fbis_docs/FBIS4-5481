Foreign Minister Han landed at Narita Airport today, one day earlier than the scheduled stopover for his week-long visit to Russia, to meet Director General Blix, who had just arrived in Tokyo to attend an international conference. The meeting was not opened to the press in view of North Korea's intensified criticism of the IAEA policies. The topics for discussion at the meeting are unknown, but it is believed that the two leaders discussed such issues as results of the IAEA inspections in North Korea last month and possibilities of North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspections in the future. [Begin Blix recording] We talked about the need for the IAEA's early completion of inspections in the regions resisting them. [end recording] Concerning the question of North Korea's nuclear development program, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is scheduled to visit Japan and the ROK next week. Nations concerned including Japan, have begun to move actively in preparation for the UN Security Council session in early May.
