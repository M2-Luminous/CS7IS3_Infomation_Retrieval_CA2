The recession may well have bottomed out in the last quarter of 1993, and the recession might not get any worse. However, Mieno, whose organization has been predicting an upswing for the past three years, added an important footnote: One year ago, a friendly economic climate was also discernible at the end of March, shortly before the end of the fiscal and business year, which was mainly the result of the widespread manipulation of the balance sheets, and in the months that followed it turned out to be a straw fire. Nobody can be certain that this disappointment will not be repeated in 1994. The much less reserved Finance Minister Fujii also made a statement on the same day. Contrary to the usual display of confidence, he described the economy as "unstable" and stressed that it is in an "extremely delicate state of suspense." The formation of the new government this week will show whether these two analyses are still realistic after the resignation of Prime Minister Hosokawa, which was announced two days after the analyses were presented. A weak government that would only be able to act as a caretaker cabinet until new elections later this year would cause continued economic difficulties in Japan. The big tax reform that can no longer be postponed, the trade conflict with the United States, the pressure for revaluation of the yen, and the tight budget situation and the resulting recourse to the capital market that leads to rising interest rates require a strong executive power whose formation is extremely questionable this week. If the stock market reacts lethargically -- not to speak of a slump -- Japan's economy is not likely to grow more in the fiscal year that has just started than in the one just concluded and for which the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) only expects a real growth of 0.2 percent after a revision of the 3.3 percent predicted in the fall. One thing is clear: In 1993/94 Japan's economic development was the weakest in 20 years. Also, there is no doubt that the EPA's predictions for economic growth of 2.4 percent for the fiscal year that has just started are no longer a basis for discussion after a series of spectacular wrong official estimates. Even the four gigantic economic emergency programs adopted since September 1992 and involving 45.2 trillion yen (730 billion German marks) will not trigger a return to the sizable growth rates of the second half of the 1980's of which foreign observers of the stock market still seem to dream. The result of the "delicate state of suspense" is fatal: If individual economic indicators suggest a positive development even for only a single month, private representations of interests feel the need to announce the final turnaround. The tendency to play down bad news grows in proportion to the length of the phase of downward development, according to the motto that every economic cycle must come to an end some time. Whether this would happen before the end of 1994 was very questionable even before Hosokawa's resignation. In fact, private consumption continues to be overshadowed by growing unemployment, stagnating real incomes, rising interest rates -- above all, those of mortgages -- the unabated decline in investments in the private economy, and -- as opposed to stock market expectations -- only moderately rising proceeds of enterprises in the current business year. On balance, no economic impetus can be expected from the public sector in the new fiscal year but rather preparations for a stronger political skimming off of surplus purchasing power. Deflation and the fiscal consequences of attempts to curb it continue to dominate the economic scene and ensure that Japan will not have much reason to rejoice this fiscal year. The official estimates of the real-estate price deflation for 1993 published in March went practically unnoticed by the foreign public, and their explosive impact on the economy was underestimated. This third slump in prices in a row, as a result of which real estate prices dropped to one-third of 1988 levels, corresponds to a loss of over 300 trillion yen (4.8 trillion German marks) last year. What is even worse: No end is in sight to the decline of the value of commercial property in view of the sharply increasing rate of unused space, which currently stands at 10 percent (at over 30 percent in new buildings). If the construction industry suffers a setback this year, the economy will lose its driving force of the past four years. It goes without saying that the ongoing real estate drama will continue to be a problem for the financial industry. Despite value adjustments, the deterioration of the credit portfolio is reaching dangerous levels that will force the banks to abandon recapitalization policies based on the principle of joint and several liability if the stock exchange boom does not continue. The problems of the financial industry mean that the pace at which the the recession is overcome will be painfully slow, which also destroys the dreams of a bull market. A solid and nearly blind optimism is needed there. If this cannot be ensured, the search for the upswing will resume in 12 months where it began today.
