The inspection group held that our province has done much work in implementing the "decision" and the "regulation," and achieved noticeable results in the comprehensive management of social safety. The whole province, from the urban to the rural areas, has witnessed a basically stable social safety situation and the masses of people have generally enhanced their sense of safety, and promoted the sound development of reform, opening up, and economic construction. The main expressions are: first, leaders at all levels have paid great attention to social safety, and all localities have conducted activities aimed at social safety comprehensive management work every year, thus promoting the progress of the comprehensive management of public safety work. Second, we have established and improved the social safety comprehensive management organs and conscientiously implemented the system of having leaders assume responsibility. The system of having leaders assume full responsibility over comprehensive management of social safety work has been basically implemented in most localities. Third, the work of "dealing strict blows" and improving social safety has been unceasingly deepened and noticeable results, particularly in this year's "spring offensive" on dealing blows to all sorts of crimes, have been achieved. Fourth, all departments and all sectors have jointly grasped and managed this work, and the committees and units for comprehensive management of social safety have given play to their functions and roles, particularly the various public safety organs have played a key role in the comprehensive management of social safety work. Fifth, fairly big progress has been made in the basic work of the grass-roots level. We have reshuffled and replenished the safety and people's mediation organizations and established security joint-defense teams, patrol teams, and mass safety organizations in line with the needs. Many localities have formed mass safety management networks. Through law enforcement inspection, the inspection group pointed out: At present, some destabilizing factors have still existed, and the social safety situation has remained severe. Criminal cases, particularly major criminal cases, are still in an upward trend in some localities and some repulsive phenomena and law-breaking acts, such as abducting and selling women and children, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes, and manufacturing and selling obscene articles, have appeared despite repeated prohibitions; "hot topics" which the masses have complaints have increased in number, and accidental events have occurred frequently. The problems of being "tough with one hand and soft with the other hand" and failing to effectively crack down on serious criminal offenses have still existed in some localities. Some localities are fairly weak in their basic work at the grass-roots level, and some of their social safety comprehensive management measures are not implemented well. According to the situation revealed in the inspection, the Provincial People's Congress standing committee called on all localities to act in line with the demands of the "decision," conscientiously implement the "regulation," comprehensively strengthen social safety comprehensive management work, and push it to a new stage.
