To provide better services for passengers of delayed flights, Air China has recently drafted a number of special service standards. Air China sources said that these standards apply to flights which are delayed for weather reasons or by mechanical failure. They include the following services: For passengers who are delayed more than two hours, drinks and food should be provided. Important passengers and first-class passengers should be served meals in dining halls. When a flight is delayed over four hours, passengers should be sent to hotels or sight-seeing and other entertainment activities. If a flight is postponed until the next day, board and lodging should be arranged for the passengers. Important passengers and first-class passengers should be sent to hotels of at least four- star standard; business-class passengers should be sent to hotels with three or more stars, while economy-class passengers should be sent to hotels with at least two stars. If a flight is delayed due to mechanical failure, passengers can make international or domestic long-distance calls or fax materials free of charge. If a flight is delayed due to bad weather, free telecommunications services are provided for important passengers and first-class and business-class passengers, while economy class passengers have to pay for phone calls or faxes.
