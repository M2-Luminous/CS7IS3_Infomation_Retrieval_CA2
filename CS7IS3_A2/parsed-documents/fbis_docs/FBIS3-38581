Why did the reaction come so late? [Greindl] It would be naive to believe there are no problems with such large-scale missions, even more so since this biggest ever UN peace mission includes countries that are providing a UN contingent for the first time and do not have any experience in this respect. If, as was the case at the beginning of the mission three years ago, the necessary controls do not work properly, it occasionally leads to the confiscation of relief goods and participation in black marketeering. The temptation is great, precisely in such an extreme situation as the encircled Sarajevo. [NEWS] Are you not finding excuses for the chaotic situation surrounding the UN troops in Bosnia? [Greindl] The UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with support for the relief convoys. But then the following phenomenon occurred: Without a specific political mandate, the UN soldiers were forced to take over more and more tasks: mediating between the warring parties, supplying hospitals, establishing and protecting protective zones for refugees, taking official government representatives to the negotiations, and so on. They were neither prepared nor adequately equipped for all this. [NEWS] At the same time, all sides are dissatisfied with the UN work. For example, the Muslims accuse the blue helmets of standing by and watching their women and children being murdered. [Greindl] Believe me, this hurts each individual UN soldier very much. But they simply have neither the political mandate nor adequate strength to intervene effectively there. [NEWS] Are the UN troops in ex-Yugoslavia not gambling away their reputation as peacemakers? [Greindl] The prerequisite for a successful UN mission is that all parties to the conflict also want the mission. Moreover, there must be a political concept for the objectives to be achieved. Then an area has to be specified where the UN contingent is recognized as the only authority by the parties to the conflict. In my opinion, all these prerequisites are missing in the UN commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [NEWS] The United Nations is being led up the garden path by the warring parties in Bosnia. [Greindl] Not only does the United Nations lack the big units to force peace in Bosnia by military means, it does not have any capacity for military planning. The only realistic variant is the one applied during the Kuwait crisis. The United Nations entrusts a powerful state or powerful organization with the mandate for an "action to force peace." In Bosnia probably only NATO is qualified. [NEWS] In 1993, Austria canceled its participation in the humanitarian UN mission in Somalia at short notice. Is the UN headquarters still annoyed with it? [Greindl] Austria continues to be one of the most important countries providing troops for UN missions. Precisely today, where, as a result of "peacekeeping," UN troops are increasingly becoming parties to a conflict rather than arbiters, the utmost importance is attached to our cooperation in New York. Precisely for such arbiter roles, small countries like Austria are important. On behalf of the United Nations, we are currently developing a new training program for UN officers that is directed exactly at these problems. [NEWS] Are the Austrian blue helmets fair weather troops who are only available for relatively safe UN missions? [Greindl] Because of their training alone, we cannot employ our soldiers in any offensive operations. However, we have to ensure in the future that we make allowances for the changed conditions under which UN missions operate today. The preparation time for such missions is becoming shorter and shorter and is four to six weeks at most. We should face these new challenges with specially prepared units that are operationally ready at any time, for example, regarding equipment or the establishment of special UN units.
