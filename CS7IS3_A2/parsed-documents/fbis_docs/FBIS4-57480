FBIS4-57480 "drlat097_m_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-097 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Brazil Laud University Facilities Laud University Facilities 94SM0346E Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 17 Apr 94 p 4-3 94SM0346E Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO Portuguese CSO [Article: "Russian Scientists Laud Brazilian Universities"] [Text] There is a country where the universities have enough advanced computers and possess well-equipped laboratories and it is easy to make scientific contacts abroad through computerized communication networks. That country is Brazil, and the universities are Sao Paulo's three state universities: the USP [University of Sao Paulo], Unicamp [Campinas State University], and Unesp [Sao Paulo State University], according to Russian researchers who have come here to work. At least that is the opinion of five physicists and chemists who participated in last Thursday's debate on "Russian researchers in Brazil." The debate was sponsored by FOLHA DE SAO PAULO and coordinated by the retired professor of Russian language and literature at the University of Sao Paulo. During the debate, the Russian scientists made it a point to emphasize that they are not exiles who fled their country. They were invited by Brazilian laboratories in their fields of interest and publish articles in international scientific periodicals. In addition, there were instances in which specific features of Brazil made the invitation more attractive to the scientists. Petr Melnikov, for example, a visiting professor of inorganic chemistry at Unesp, came from Moscow University to continue his research regarding rare earths, a group of chemical elements with metallic properties, some of which are used in alloys. According to Melnikov, not only are those elements abundant in Brazil, but research in that field is advanced in our country. While praising the laboratories and the availability of computers, the scientists say they would like to return to Russia if working conditions were good, and this in spite of some bitter experiences. Physicist Galina Pugachev says that members of her institute were forced by the Communist Party to harvest wheat in Kazakhstan in order not to lose their jobs. Galina, who is at Unicamp studying anomalies in the magnetic field -- typical over Brazil -- says that although she has few colleagues in that area around here, she can talk to researchers abroad by computer. "In three minutes, I receive answers from American colleagues to my questions on the computers at my university," says Galina. Her husband, Anatoliy Gusev, says the equipment in the nuclear physics lab at Unicamp is better than that at many U.S. universities. Besides good working conditions, the participants in the debate drew attention to features common to academic work in both Brazil and Russia. The level of students is similar, as is freedom in the style of research -- Brazilians and Russians are both "looser" than Americans, who are more rigid in orientation. According to physicist Gregory Surdutovich of the Sao Carlos campus of the USP, evaluation procedures are also similar. "There is not a lot of checking either there or here in comparison with the United States, and I like that. I got tired of seeing people making out deceitful productivity reports. Scientific activity needs to be measured by other parameters," he explained.
