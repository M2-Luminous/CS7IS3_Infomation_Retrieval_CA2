In a statement welcoming the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo on South Africa, he said the industry had become one of South Africa's largest exporters of manufactured goods. "Should South Africa's present 0.4 percent share in the world armaments market be increased to only one percent, this will result in 20,000 new job opportunities." There need be no fear that arms and equipment would fall into the wrong hands. The trade had to be conducted in a responsible and accountable manner. Mr Modise said he was delighted that the embargo belonged to the past. This development had far-reaching and constructive implications for South Africa and the region.
