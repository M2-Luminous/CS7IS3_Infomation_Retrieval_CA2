About 37 percent of them oppose membership. More than a fifth of all citizens cannot yet say where they stand on the issue. In comparison with the last EVA poll conducted last fall, support for membership has increased by about a percentage point. Opposition to it has decreased by about 4 percentage points. Now that the results of the membership negotiations are clear, it is surprising that the percentage of people who are uncertain of where they stand on membership has increased by 3 percentage points since last fall. Men are still clearly more enthusiastic supporters of membership than women. Nearly a third of the women are uncertain about it. The biggest change since last fall is in how young people view it. Support for membership among those from 18 to 25 years of age has considerably dropped. On the other hand, support for membership has increased in the oldest age group. Center Party Still Opposes It EVA has been reporting on how Finns view EU membership a couple of times a year since the beginning of the decade. This time 1,900 replies to an interview conducted by mail were received between 30 March and 6 May. SAK [Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions] members' position on EU membership has become more positive than before. Nevertheless, there are still more opponents of membership in SAK than supporters. On the other hand, opposition to membership has increased in the STTK [Finnish Central Federation of Technical Functionaries]. AKAVA [Academic Professional Commission] members are still the most enthusiastic supporters of membership among wage earners. Three-fourths of the farmers and MTK [Agricultural Producers Association] members still oppose membership. The interviews for the EVA poll were conducted mainly in April when national measures in support of agriculture had largely not yet taken shape. Center Party supporters now take a slightly more positive view of membership than before, but there are clearly still more opponents of it in the party than supporters. The party leadership's vigorous policy of promoting EU membership is beginning to take effect among SDP [Social Democratic Party] supporters. There are already twice as many supporters of membership as opponents of it. On the other hand, enthusiasm for the EU is fading among supporters of the Greens and the Left League. Opposition to it has grown in both parties since the fall. Sixty-eight percent of all citizens feel certain that they will vote in the consultative referendum next fall. Media Will Determine Result The results of the negotiations achieved by Finland in early March are, in Finns' opinion, mainly satisfactory. Only a small number of supporters felt that they were very good. Most of the supporters described the results as satisfactory. Most of the opponents felt that the results were poor or very poor. In the opinion of many of the respondents, there was too much emphasis on agriculture during the membership negotiations. In the opinion of the majority of the respondents, we should not have agreed to removing restrictions on foreign ownership of summer cottages in the negotiations. Over half of the citizens feel that they are not very well informed on the results of the negotiations. Young people, students, and women are most uninformed on them. Fully 81 percent of the respondents feel that the media will have a decisive effect on the outcome of the referendum. Many of them mentioned the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation television news and the local newspaper as being their most important sources of information. In Uusimaa they felt that HELSINGIN SANOMAT was almost as important a source as the television news. Finland Will Probably Be a Member Within Next Few Years Finns feel it likely that Finland will be a member of the EU within the next few years. Fully 81 percent of the interviewees, that is, at least one out of every two opponents of membership, are of the same opinion. How Finns view the most important goals of the Maastricht Treaty was also followed for a couple of years in the course of the poll. Forty-three percent of them now support a common foreign policy, but 46 percent still oppose it. Over Half Opposed ECU Fifty-one percent of all Finns supported Finland's committing itself to common EU security and foreign policies and 51 percent to a common economic policy as well. However, only 37 percent of all Finns wanted a common currency, the ECU, while 52 percent opposed the idea. Citizens Hope Finland Will Avert Disadvantages of EU Membership "In the final analysis, whether EU membership is good or bad for our country is a matter of faith, regarding which no one has certain knowledge." This, according to the EVA poll, is what one out of every two Finns thinks. This time the Trade and Industry Commission also explored citizens' fears and hopes with regard to EU membership during its EU opinion poll. Most of the respondents felt that Finland would be labeled a fringe area, isolated from West Europe if membership in the EU is not realized. Most of them also felt that, as a member of the EU, Finland would before long become a member of a military alliance, either NATO or the WEU. Frightened by the unrest in Russia, Finns feel that, "with an unstable Russia as its neighbor, it would be safer for Finland to be a member of the EU than to stay out of it." Fifty-four percent of the respondents were of this opinion, while 22 percent differed on this. Half of all Finns think that Finland does not have a chance of influencing EU decisions but, on the other hand, just as many also feel that Finns would not even notice membership in their daily lives. If the decisionmakers were to respect citizens' opinions, they would organize the referendum on the EU to be held simultaneously with those to be held in Sweden and Norway. Forty-nine percent of all citizens want a simultaneous referendum, while 24 percent do not feel that that is necessary. Many Finns do not regard the EU "as a paradise." We may infer from this that citizens hope that Finland will, as a member of the EU, first and foremost avert the disadvantages they fear will result from membership. Finns do not think that EU membership would help Finland maintain control over international crime. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents feel that Finland should further the combating of international crime in particular in the EU. Women Worried About Social Security In citizens' opinion, the third most important concern to be promoted in the EU would be the protection of [members'] right to self-determination. Citizens also hope that Finland will try to reduce the EU bureaucracy, promote environmental standards, and defend the Nordic social security model. Forty-four percent of the respondents fear that Finland would not be allowed to determine its own level of social security as a member of the EU. Both supporters and opponents of membership have the same sort of list of objectives. Women are more worried than men about women's status and Nordic social security. Finns take a more pessimistic view of the future of the labor union movement in the EU than do labor leaders. Forty-five percent think that the status of the labor union movement and its opportunities to influence decisions will be reduced with membership, and they cannot muster any faith in the labor union movement's chances of influencing international decisions either.
