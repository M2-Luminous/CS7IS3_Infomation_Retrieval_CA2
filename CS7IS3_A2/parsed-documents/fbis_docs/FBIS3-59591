These developments apply to all areas of life. At the behest of the European Commission, the DECT standard was developed for the wide application field of cordless telecommunication of voice and data in order to access local mobile networks. The DECT standard (Digital European Cordless Telecommunication) represents an evolution based on the previous industrial (CT0) and public standards (CT1/CT1+, CT2 as interim ETSI standard). With its special targeting of mobility at the office and at home, it is increasingly used as a method of network access for private branch exchanges and the analog telephone system, as well as for wide-ranging mobile communication of voice and data. European manufacturers of telecommunications facilities such as Siemens, Alcatel, Ericsson, Philips and Nokia have committed themselves to use the DECT standard and corresponding products are being developed or are already available. The DECT standard was defined and developed by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute) beginning in 1989 and was adopted in July 1992. The EC signature nations have obligated themselves within the scope of an EC guideline to introduce DECT by 1995 and to provide the required frequencies, as well as to make the necessary permit regulations available on a voluntary basis within the framework of an EC recommendation. The DECT standard defines a transparent, digital aerial interface between a mobile unit and a base station for cordless telecommunication of voice and data over analog telephone networks, ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network], GSM [not further identified], package and wire-transmitted data networks as well as local area networks. Because of the Europe-wide application area, large markets with enormous quantities are open to DECT, which makes rapid and major reduction in technological and production costs possible through scaling effects. Market demands, rapidly dropping prices, versatile application, combined with diverse advantages from the user's aspect, form the initial basis for successful opening up broad mass markets for DECT in Europe and beyond. In November 1992 the Federal Office for Posts and Telecommunication issued the German licensing regulations for DECT systems and end equipment and thus made the market introduction of DECT products possible on a broad basis. Advantages for the User The advantages of DECT for the user derive, on the one hand, in general from the use of powerful mobile communication at home, at the office and in the future from public access as well, such as high accessibility/availability/communications ability, mobile internal communication free of charge, increased action/reaction speed, accelerated decision-making, faster transaction processing, liberal waiting times for important calls, higher measure of service, lower number of unsuccessful calls, cost/time advantage because fewer return calls are required, freedom of mobility during the connection and cost savings when moving. On the other hand, many user advantages are the result of the technical concept of DECT, such as high communications quality through 32 kbit/s speech coding and continuous channel optimization, high security against wiretapping including through optional speech coding, high radio-technical area coverage and space illumination, mastery of large subscriber numbers or traffic density, roaming (localizing the subscriber through all radio cells), simple installation and expansion without frequency planning, the ability to integrate voice and data as well as investment security because of a promising standard and simple expansion possibility of the system. Technical Features DECT is a cordless access method to target networks such as the public analog telephone net, the ISDN net and in the future also the GSM net. DECT offers the technical basis for application-specific system solutions or special DECT profiles in the form of a transparent aerial interface (Layer OSI 1 through 3). DECT's protocol supply includes all procedures for realizing cordless end equipment and systems (authentication, speech encoding, mobility management) as well as all important standards and protocols of telecommunication (ISDN, LAN, X.25, X.400...) for cordless telephones and branch facilities for the home, office and in the future also for public networks (public access). DECT Profiles and System Solutions DECT's extensively defined protocol supply enables definition and specification of application-specific system solutions for voice and data as well as access through the DECT aerial interface to various target networks such as GSM, ISDN with upstream DECT systems or base stations. According to an EC recommendation, these kinds of DECT mobile units should be able to work with various DECT profiles or system solutions (common interface). The voice-oriented DECT standard ETS 300175 (Common Interface) and ETS 300176 (Approval Test Specification) were adopted in July 1992 by ETSI and made available to the public. At present a series of additional DECT profiles are operating at ETSI, for which stabile drafts will largely be available in 1993/94, which can then already be used for development activities. DECT-GSM Interworking enables the cooperation of DECT mobile units with DECT systems which are connected to GSM systems; DECT-ISDN Interworking permits the cooperation of DECT mobile units with DECT systems connected to ISDN systems; DECT Data Profiles enables data transmission between DECT mobile units and DECT systems; DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP), based on PAP (Public Access Profile, ETSI Draft TBR 11), defines a public standard interface for access from DECT mobile units to various fixed networks which take the mobility requirements into consideration (probably available after 1995). Application Areas At home, in small businesses and for the self-employed, monocellular cordless telephones and cordless small branch exchange facilities based on the DECT standard offer convenience and flexibility in the house and garden, in the home office and small business, with all the described advantages of mobility with excellent communications quality and wiretapping security. And this at a price level comparable to significantly simpler analog products. Here it is primarily accessibility at all times as well as the ability to be able to call at any time and everywhere in the house, garden and business sector, without charge between persons using internal communication or externally via the exchange at normal charges. With the available data capability of up to 19.2 kbit/s and with small systems as well, interesting solutions are available particularly for the home, because it is possible to be in contact by computer with voice and data networks from any arbitrary place within the range of the system without installation of cables and telephone extension units, in parallel with other internal and external conversations. In larger organizations which cover a correspondingly larger area or space and have their own PBX facility, powerful multicellular systems are offered. By means of overlapping radio coverage of surface and spatial building structures it is possible to assure mobile communications ability, receiving and transmitting, fixed and mobile, through continuous localizing of the mobile units in the system range (roaming) and automatic, interruption-free connection of conversations when changing from one cell to another, all the while with a high quality of communication. Because of the mobile subscriber's capability for active and passive communication, he obtains the advantages already mentioned such as rapid reaction capability, faster decision-making and increased productivity. In connection with a private branch exchange the mobile subscriber gets the performance features of the PBS, with the free internal communication which is so important particularly for business applications and which is also available in mobile form, and the external communication at normal charges. In the office sector, data applications are also gaining in importance. Here the data capability of DECT by no means replaces the high-performance Local Area Networks. DECT's data capability of up to 30 kbit/s, initially in the lower speed range, covers the important portion, estimated at 80 to 90 percent, of internal and external data communication at the office with a volume of up to 10 kbytes per operation. This fully maintains the advantage of being able to transmit speech and data at the same time over the same base station. By establishing a special data profile (DECT-DATA profile) through ETSI, pure data transmission speeds of 1 Mbit/s, in some cases also significantly higher combination values, can be achieved. In the public area, above all at special social focal points such as pedestrian zones, shopping centers, athletic stadiums, airports, railway stations, etc. with a defined area and a high traffic density, the DECT is the more suitable solution compared to GSM, since with 10,000 Erlang units per square kilometer significantly more subscribers can be served (GSM: about 200 Erlang units per square kilometer). This requires the establishment of a minimal common interface for DECT, however, which at present is being used under the working name of Generic Access Profile/Public Access Profile at ETSI. In the areas covered by the radio technology the DECT profile GAP/PAP then enables access to PBS systems (and the use of the entire range of functions thus provided) as well as public analog networks, ISDN and GSM networks through integrated DECT subsystems. Since GAP/PAP will become an integral component of the DECT standard, it will then be possible, with one and the same mobile unit, to communicate via the house base station of the cordless DECT telephone or small system or through the multicellular DECT office system or via a public base station. In connection with the compactness and ease of the DECT mobile unit, this sum of possibilities comes very close to the ideal picture of a "personal communicator" which everyone can afford, which can be carried everywhere and enables you to communicate everywhere, at any time and with everyone.
