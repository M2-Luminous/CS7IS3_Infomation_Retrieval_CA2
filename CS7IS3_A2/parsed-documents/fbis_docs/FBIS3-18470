[Kinkel] For God's sake, no. I did what was necessary and right. I am a convinced European. It was absolutely clear that we wanted the conclusion of the negotiations with the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries, which is why I made a great effort and was able to make my contribution. [Seifried] Still, it has been said that you played a crucial role. Reports said that you took off your jacket and rushed along hallways in shirtsleeves when the negotiations were on the brink of failure. [Kinkel] That is true. After very long hours of negotiations, we had reached a stalemate yesterday morning and it looked as if the talks were going to be suspended without result. So it may be true that I can claim that I held the talks together at that moment and pointed out to my colleagues that, in the interest of Europe, we could not tolerate such a situation. And at such a moment, the word that comes from a larger country is probably of some significance, and, as we can see now, things worked out all right. [Seifried] Nevertheless, some criticism has come from the ranks of the European Union [EU], and people claimed that you made too many concessions to the membership applicants. Is there a fear of a greater German bloc, maybe? Do you see such fears? [Kinkel] No, I do not see that. Do not forget, with 80 million people, Germany is now the largest country in the EU, which means that we bear special responsibility. We have in no way tried to push to the fore. We tried to be good mediators, which we could do. Nevertheless, we always made it quite clear, and that is what I said when I arrived in Brussels: We will not exclude any country, and certainly not Austria, but will try hard to achieve a positive result -- in the spirit of the Edinburgh resolutions. Actually, I thought that all that was quite normal. I have participated in heated sessions in Brussels before. Afterwards, one has to say: [word indistinct] what counts is the result -- and that does not look too bad for Austria. [Seifried] Why is Germany, of all countries, pressing so hard for this enlargement? [Kinkel] It is obvious. We are of the opinion that the EU has to be a well-balanced organism. We have -- and I am not criticizing the fact but only analyzing it -- a slight overweight in the south. The Nordic countries must join. For us it has always been absolutely clear that, as a result of historic, linguistic, and cultural closeness and ties Austrian membership is a matter of course. [Seifried] What is going to happen with membership candidate Norway? [Kinkel] I predict that it will work out all right. We have made intensive mediating efforts in this case, too. The issue of agriculture has virtually been settled. The normative power of facts [Die normative Kraft des Faktischen] will also lead to a good negotiated settlement with Norway -- at least, that is what I am hoping.
