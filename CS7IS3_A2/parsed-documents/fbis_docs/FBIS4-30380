EAEC is a caucus of the Asians within APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation)...It is not against APEC at all, he told reporters after visiting the Linggiu Dam managed by Singapore's Public Utilities Board (PUB) in the southern Johor state Sunday. Goh said Singapore has always supported the idea of EAEC and it would continue to do so. We have been quietly lobbying the others to ask for views and it is not in conflict with APEC, he said. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has said Malaysia was disappointed with U.S. opposition to EAEC and hoped Japan would not be influenced by its decision. Asked whether there was any chance the EAEC would be launched soon, Goh said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- comprising Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia -- had agreed, so it was a question of getting the proposed members of the EAEC to meet. He said Malaysia would have to be the primary force of the EAEC since the idea came from Dr. Mahathir. We will support. If Malaysia has some plans to ask us to sell the idea to the others, then Singapore would be very happy to do so, he said when asked whether Singapore would play a prominent role in setting up the caucus. Last week, a KYODO NEWS AGENCY report quoted Japanese and ASEAN officials as saying the U.S. embassy in Tokyo had conveyed to the Japanese Government on June 7 Washington's opposition to the EAEC. However, Japan said the opposition did not mean Japan would follow the U.S. stance.
