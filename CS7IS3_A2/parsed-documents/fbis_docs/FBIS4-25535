The resolution, adopted at a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, said that the DPRK, as a party to the treaty on non- proliferation of nuclear weapons, failed to carry out the main part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented the IAEA from inspecting its nuclear facilities. The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate fully with the IAEA secretariat and guarantee the IAEA access to all the documents and places concerned. The resolution said the IAEA decided to stop its non-medical aid to DPRK. This means that the country will lose about a quarter of a million U.S. dollars' worth of technical aid and support for its civil nuclear program each year. A Chinese representative pointed out at the meeting that losing one opportunity to conduct technical inspection did not mean that all the hopes to settle the nuclear issue have been lost. He said the key point at present is that all parties concerned should calm down, make specific efforts and leave some leeway for solving problems. "To go to the extreme and resort to confrontation, pressure and embargo will never achieve good results," he declared. The Chinese representative said that it was difficult for China to support the resolution and expressed his deep concerns over possible consequences. Twenty-eight countries voted for the resolution sponsored by 18 countries including the United States, Japan, France and Russia and one against while two countries, including China, abstained and two others did not participate in voting. The meeting, participated by 35 member countries of the Board of Governors, opened on June 6 with the nuclear issue in the DPRK being its main topic.
