FR940406-2-00123 FR940406-2-00074 [Release No. 34&hyph;33838; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Amending the Net Capital Requirements in Phlx Rule 703 March 30, 1994. On January 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend Rule 703 (Financial Responsibility and Reporting) to correspond to recent Commission amendments to SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;1 (``SEC Net Capital Rule''). 3 Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the Federal Register on March 4, 1994. 4 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange subsequently filed Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change. 5 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 These amendments go into effect on April 1, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737 (August 11, 1993), 58 FR 43555 (August 17, 1993) (``Exchange Act Release No. 32737''). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33692 (February 28, 1994), 59 FR 10447 (March 4, 1994). 5 Amendment No. 1 to the proposal (1) added the phrase ``foreign currency option'' before ``participant organization'' in proposed Rule 703(a)(v), and (2) deleted the word ``tentative'' before the phrase ``net capital'' in proposed Rule 703(c)(ii)(A). Amendment No. 1 also clarified that the proposed rule change does not alter the Exchange's current net capital requirements applicable to Registered Options Traders (``ROTs''). See Letter from Gerald O'Connell, Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 1, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). Amendment No. 2 requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. See Letter from Edith Hallahan, Special Counsel, Regulatory Services, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 11, 1994. Pursuant to the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, all specialists, except options market makers, 6 who are currently exempt from the net capital requirements of Rule 703, will be subject to a minimum net capital requirement of $100,000. 7 As a result, the Exchange believes that these amendments require the deletion of Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v). Currently, Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset 8 requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are both equity and options specialists. 6 Phlx ROTs qualify as options market makers that are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule. ROTs, however, are, and will continue to be, subject to a minimum net capital requirement of $25,000 pursuant to Phlx Rule 703. See Amendment No. 1, supra note 5. 7 In addition, for certain purposes under the SEC Net Capital Rule, certain specialists will be exempt from the application of the rules haircut and undue concentration charges with respect to their specialty securities. See Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 3. 8 ``Net liquid assets'' is defined in Phlx Rule 703(b). The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 703 to require each member organization and participant organization, including each ROT, to notify the Exchange if it fails to maintain the minimum net capital required by the SEC Net Capital Rule or it fails to maintain liquid assets in accordance with Phlx Rule 703. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to add a new paragraph (v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or foreign currency option participant organization to promptly notify the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii) or (iv) ( i.e. , former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)). Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried in the account. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5), 9 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market makers, that previously were exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, therefore, will have the following effects on Phlx specialists: instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as both equity and options specialists, the SEC's minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply. 10 The Commission finds that the proposal will conform Rule 703 to the SEC Net Capital Rule, as amended, and is therefore consistent with the Act. 9 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 10 See supra note 6. The Commission believes that the notification portion of the proposed rule change may prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest by providing the Exchange with the ability to respond promptly to such notification, especially respecting options market makers. Currently, Commission Rule 17a&hyph;11 requires, among other things, prompt telegraphic notice to a broker-dealer's designated examining authority, as well as the SEC, when a broker-dealer falls below its minimum net capital requirement pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule. This rule does not apply to options market makers, because they are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange's proposed notification provision would apply to all member organizations and participant organizations, including options market makers. As a result, the Commission finds that the proposed notification provision is consistent with the Act, in general, and with SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, in particular. Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker may serve to protect investors and the public interest by promoting liquidity and confidence in the credibility of floor broker orders, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to ensure that the amendments to Rule 703 are in place prior to the April 1, 1994, effective date of the Commission's amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Commission believes that by granting accelerated approval, the potential for any confusion between the current net capital standards provided in Rule 703 and those that will apply on April 1, 1994, pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule, will be adequately minimized. Finally, the original proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received, and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 are simply clarifications of the original proposal. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;04 and should be submitted by April 27, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 11 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;04), as amended, is hereby approved on an accelerated basis. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 12 12 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
