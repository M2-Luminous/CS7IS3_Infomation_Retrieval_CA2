Prudential will have no discretion as to when securities will be sold except that it is authorized to direct the trustee to sell securities upon failure of the issuer of a security held by a Series to declare or pay anticipated cash dividends, institution of certain materially adverse legal proceedings against the issuer, default by the issuer under certain documents materially and adversely affecting future declaration or payment of dividends, or the occurrence of other market or credit factors that, in the opinion of Prudential, would make retention of such securities by a Series detrimental to the interests of the unit holders. The adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a Series' portfolio. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 12(d)(3), with limited exceptions, prohibits an investment company from acquiring any security issued by any person who is a broker, dealer, underwriter, or investment adviser. Rule 12d3&hyph;1(b) exempts from section 12(d)(3) purchases by an investment company of securities of an issuer that derived more than fifteen percent of its gross revenues in its most recent fiscal year from securities related activities, provided that, among other things, immediately after such acquisition, the acquiring company has invested not more than five percent of the value of its total assets in securities of the issuer. Notwithstanding the above, rule 12d3&hyph;1(c) prohibits any registered investment company from acquiring any security issued by that company from acquiring any security issued by that company's investment adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter, or any affiliated person of such investment adviser, promoter, or principal underwriter. 2. Applicant seeks an exemption to permit any Series to invest up to approximately twenty percent, but in no event more than 20.5 percent, of the value of its total assets in securities of an issuer that derives more than fifteen percent of its gross revenues from securities related activities. Applicant and each series will comply with all of the provisions of rule 12d3&hyph;1, except for the five percent limitation on the amount of assets that may be invested in securities of issuers that derived more than fifteen percent of their gross revenues from securities related activities in their most recent fiscal year. 3. Applicant asserts that section 12(d)(3) was intended to prevent investment companies from exposing their assets to the entrepreneurial risk of securities related businesses, to prevent potential conflicts of interest, and to eliminate certain reciprocal practices between investment companies and securities related businesses. 4. One potential conflict discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company purchased securities or other interests in a broker-dealer to reward that broker-dealer for selling fund shares, rather than solely on investment merit. Applicant argues that this concern does not arise in connection with its application because neither the applicant nor the sponsor has discretion in choosing the securities or percentage amount purchased. The security must first be included in the DJIA, which is unaffiliated with Prudential and applicant, and must also qualify as one of the five highest dividend yielding securities as calculated by the objective formula described above. 5. Applicant also states that the effect of a Series' purchase on the stock of parents of broker-dealers would be de minmis . Applicant asserts that the common stocks of securities related issuers represented in the DJIA are widely held, have active markets, and that potential purchases by any Series would represent an insignificant amount of the outstanding common stock and the trading volume of any of these issues. According to applicant, it is highly unlikely that purchases of these securities by a Series would have any significant impact on the market valuer of any such securities. 6. Another potential conflict of interest discussed by applicant could occur if an investment company directed brokerage to a broker-dealer in which the company has invested to enhance the broker-dealer's profitability or to assist it during financial difficulty, even though the broker-dealer may not offer the best price and execution. To preclude this type of conflict, applicant and each Series agree, as a condition of this application, that no company held in the portfolio of a Series nor any affiliate thereof will act as broker for any Series in the purchase or sale of any security for its portfolio. 7. Applicant states that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicant's Condition Applicant agrees that the requested exemptive order may be conditioned upon no company held in the portfolio of a Series, nor any affiliate thereof, acting as broker for any Series in the purchase of any security for the Series' portfolio.
