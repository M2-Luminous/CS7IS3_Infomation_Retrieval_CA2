[Palmero] "They have been a school for training cadres and communists. We, just as our people do, greatly admire and appreciate them for their revolutionary attitude and exemplary commitment to the work of the Revolution in these difficult times." Palmero also highlighted the significant support of the troops in the province's agriculture. [Palmero] "Approximately 2,000 members -- generals, officers, soldiers -- conducted the potato harvest, together with the Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Over 73 percent of the harvest was collected with enormous efficiency. Right now, the EJT is 50 percent of the entire labor force in the province. They successfully complete their tasks with fewer men and more efficiency and productivity." Palmero pointed out the influence of the Western Army in the combat training of the people in the province. [Palmero] "During these 33 years, this command has done wonders for the defense of the Revolution. One of the most historic and difficult struggles has been that many of us, a great number of the population -- militants, workers, and farmers -- fulfilled internationalist missions while in the service of the Western Army. Many comrades of this command gave their lives in other lands."
