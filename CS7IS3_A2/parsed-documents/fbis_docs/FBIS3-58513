FBIS3-58513 "drweu011cc_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Jan 1994 INTER-EUROPEAN AFFAIRS Publishers Close Ranks Against EC Media Regulations AU1701191694 Paris AFP in English 1744 GMT 17 Jan 94 AU1701191694 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Brussels, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The European Publishers Council (EPC) said here Monday [17 January] that a proposed law to limit media concentrations would cripple the ability of European companies to compete in new global information technology. It said that a resolution to be debated in the European Parliament at Strasbourg on Thursday was aiming at new restrictions at a time when U.S. media companies were being freed to face up to a technological media revolution. EPC chairman Sir Frank Rogers said the threat of new regulations came "at the very moment when media companies are attempting to ensure that the European Union is a major player on the global information superhighway." Rogers, deputy chairman of Britain's Telegraph group, said the resolution was dangerous because recent developments in global information, communications and media technology required a less restrictive approach. The resolution, sponsored by Euro-MPs Ben Fayot of Luxembourg and Dieter Schinzel of Germany, would give the European Community power to limit European-wide print and audiovisual concentrations which "threaten diversity of opinion and pluralism." The Fayot-Schinzel motion says that multimedia concentration should be "assessed more effectively and, if necessary, limited." But Rogers said the motion ignored evidence presented by the EPC, which represents 27 European publishers and is pushing for less, rather than more, control on cross-border investment and ownership of media companies. He said the current revolution in digital, interactive media technology required that media companies should be free to join forces in order to exploit these new developments. "Yet Europe could be left on a side road while American and Japanese media companies are freed to dominate the new global opportunities," he said. The EC's executive European Commission is expected to make formal proposals on framework policies for the media industry in three or four months. The industry has been lobbying fiercely for several years against any regulations or even policy guidelines from Brussels.
