ITAR-TASS learnt at the Moscow Chief Militia Department that an explosive device without a shell went off due to careless handling. The society's driver brought it to the office due to some reasons. He received several lacerated wounds, and both his hands were torn away. He soon died from the loss of blood. Militia found two cartridges, two electric detonators and two radio transmitters at the place of accident. The blast was so powerful that the society's door was blown out, and all glass was shattered at the house entrance foyer. The second explosion sounded in Moscow's suburb (2, Varshavskoye highway). An explosive device was planted into a Lada car which belonged to the managing director of the Grigori-91 firm. Luckily, there were no casualties. Only the Lada car and nearby Zaporozhets car were damaged. Windows were shattered at a house. Investigation was started in both cases.
