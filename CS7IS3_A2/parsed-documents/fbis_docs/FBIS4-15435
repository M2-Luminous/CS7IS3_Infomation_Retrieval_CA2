Opposition Sees Russian Retirees as Republic's Potential Enemies"] [Text] The history of the Russian-Latvian treaty on the army pullout reminds one of a detective story. Even now that the agreement has already been initialed by heads of government delegations, a number of questions remain unresolved. One of them is whether the treaty will be signed at all. At any rate, the radical opposition in the Latvian parliament is not very enthusiastic about it and continues to do its utmost to block the treaty's ratification. Aleksandr Kirsteins, chief of the Movement for Latvia's National Independence parliamentary faction and chairman of the parliamentary international affairs committee, explains: "We do not oppose the treaty itself. But this is not a single document; this is a package of agreements, including the matter of the Skrunda radar and the matter of social safety nets for retired Russian officers. It is the latter question on which our faction disagrees. Russia insists that Latvia should take over the social protection of officers who left service before 22 January 1992. But if we gave in on Skrunda, this does not mean at all that now we should accept any terms that Russia is trying to impose on us." "The Constitution of the Latvian Republic was reinstated as early as 4 May 1990. It is from that day that we have seen Russian officers as servicemen of another state. Hence, by fulfilling this provision Latvia would directly violate its own Constitution. Even if in the period from 4 May 1990 to 22 January 1992 the army may be considered Soviet, not Russian, even then the social safety nets for its officers will be a matter of Latvia's bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, but by no means with Russia alone," he claimed. "Moreover, from our point of view, one cannot talk with such assurance that all Russian servicemen will automatically remain in Latvia. We cannot accept this, either. We cannot confer the status of Latvian citizens on officers of a foreign army, that is, people who are potentially disloyal to the state. Such people number around 50,000 in Latvia, and they are far from innocuous lambs. According to our information, these are officers who served in special purpose units in Moldova, in the Caucasus, in Afghanistan. Why should we need this contingent -- from professional assassins to specialists in psychological warfare? Let them practice all that in Russia, not in Latvia," Mr. Kirsteins said. He also thinks that the reluctance to sign the treaty in its present form cannot give Russia a pretext for blackmailing, such as: "No treaty, no army pullout." "If Russia is to be a normal, democratic state, if it is to cooperate with key European countries, it will withdraw its troops even without any agreement. If not, no treaty will help." The parliament's majority faction holds a more cautious view on the problem. Indulis Berzins from "Latvian Path" said that the treaty initialed in Moscow is very much based on compromise: "Of course, I do not like some of its provisions. I do not think that Russia, either, is pleased with everything." To all appearances, "Latvian Path" and its allies will advocate the ratification of the treaty. "Let the Saeima decide whether we need the treaty or not," Mr. Berzins noted. "But we must clearly determine right now who will be responsible if it is not signed. Currently it is easy for the opposition to bring together rallies and pickets, currently all are heroes. But whom will the people hold responsible if the army does not leave on 31 August?"
