Alekseyeva: "Benefits of a Vacation in Sochi"] [Text] Krasnodar -- After B. Yeltsin left Sochi, all the newspapers here noted with one voice: The president's vacation was chiefly beneficial to...Krasnodar Kray. Kuban Governor N. Yegorov and Sochi Mayor N. Karpov had more intensive contact with him this time than ever before. Yegorov acknowledged that in two weeks they had five meetings with the president, and quite long ones at that -- from 1.5 to 14 hours. The local leaders were able to obtain from these contacts the maximum benefit for their region, and to resolve questions which usually take a very long time to resolve (or, more often, not to resolve). Thus, the president's consent was obtained for the introduction of a visa system in Krasnodar Kray. This means that people living in the nearby foreign countries will now be able to visit the Kuban only on special invitations, with entry visas, and by virtue of paying to register with the local organs (this will not apply to citizens of Russia). The question of stationing additional military formations in the kray's territory was also decided -- specifically, one army division and one division of internal troops -- in order to strengthen security in the region as well as preventing possible interethnic conflicts. B. Yeltsin gave the "go-ahead" for the allocation of 434 billion rubles to the kray to provide amenities for servicemen's families, something that the military men themselves and the kray's organs of power have long been asking for. In short, O. Lobov was instructed to prepare a whole list of questions relating to strengthening the security of the kray -- which is now a border region -- for examination in the Security Council. And that is not all. The president promised to sign an edict on the development of the resort of Anapa as an all-Russian children's health resort. Anapa was an all-Union children's health resort before, but in the years of reform it fell, like all of us, into a total decline, so now we will recreate what we ourselves destroyed. B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin, who visited him in Sochi, also backed the kray's initiative on building new cargo ports on the Black Sea at Sochi and Anapa, and special government decrees will probably be adopted on this matter in the near future. They even succeeded in obtaining a written petition from the president of Russia to the International Olympic Committee on holding the Winter Olympics in Sochi in the year 2002. Last, and most important: During the presidential vacation a decision was adopted on drawing up a special treaty (agreement) between Krasnodar Kray and the federal organs of power on the demarcation of rights and powers (similar to the one that it is planned to conclude with Kaliningrad Oblast), which substantially boosts the kray's status as a component of the Federation. I cannot help being pleased for my native land. If the state's top men continue to take regular vacations on our coast, the Kuban will soon become the most prosperous region in Russia. But I cannot help sympathizing with those oblasts, especially in remote parts of Russia, where the president and the premier never stop by.
