These draft revisions will not be incorporated into the FIP inventory until SCAQMD finalizes its 2010 inventory revisions. b VOC estimates are based on reactive organic compound estimates from SCAQMD. d. Mobile sources. _(1) Highway vehicle emission factors. The on-highway emission factors for California vehicles are based on CAL15a, which is the March 1993 release of MOBILE5a with modified model year emission control groupings, basic emission rates, and registration age mix based on EMFAC7D. The EMFAC model could not be used for the FIP for several reasons. Most importantly, an enhanced I/M program is a key part of the FIP proposal, and EMFAC does not allow the examination of I/M programs besides the one currently implemented in California. Similarly, there is no mechanism within EMFAC to address the enhanced in-use compliance program being proposed in the FIP. There is now an in-house EPA version of MOBILE5a for California based on EMFAC7F, EMFAC7D's replacement, referred to simply as CAL15. More detailed descriptions of CAL15a and CAL15 are provided in the docket. EPA currently plans to use CAL15 in subsequent analyses for the FIP. EPA invites comments on the merits of the various models. Based on these comments and any new data that may become available, EPA may make inventory and control effectiveness adjustments in the final FIP. Such technical adjustments could require or allow changes in the control measures. Vehicles certified to 49&hyph;State standards are assumed to comprise 10 percent of the light duty VMT and 20 percent of the heavy duty VMT in the FIP areas. The emission factors for these vehicles were based on MOBILE5a runs using the same inputs as for the CAL15a runs, except the LEV program was excluded, since it would not apply to 49-State vehicles. It should be noted that the baseline emission calculations include control programs that have already been adopted. This includes the California LEV program, California Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline, and California Clean Diesel Fuel.
