Soskovets, Full Member of Russia's Engineering Academy] [Text] The history of Russian light alloy metallurgy which served as the basis for subsequent formation of the aerospace technology in the former USSR dates back to the commissioning of the first specialized aluminum rolled stock mill 60 years ago. The birth and constant dynamic development of aviation engineering in the 1930s were inextricably linked to improvements in the equipment and practices of casting ingots, manufacturing various types of metallurgical semifinished products, developing alloys, and expanding their applications in the aircraft industry. Aviation metallurgy achieved tremendous success during the Great Patriotic War when an industrial base was created in the shortest time in the eastern part of the country, complex methods of manufacturing high-quality metal products were implemented at new plants, and scientific research work aimed at increasing aircraft ``survivability'' and improving their flight performance was carried out. The use of light alloys in space technology, shipbuilding, and other areas of new technologies on a wider scale began in the postwar years. As a result, aviation metallurgy is becoming specialty metallurgy of light alloys and organizationally--subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Aviation Industry as a metallurgical department; at present, it is a part of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy. The following landmarks characterize the postwar development of specialty metallurgy: - mastering continuous casting of aluminum alloy ingots and subsequently improving it by introducing vacuum melt treatment using electromagnetic molds, group casting, etc.; - developing and bringing on stream high-output vertical hydraulic presses with an up to 750 MN force for producing large-size stampings as well as horizontal presses with an up to 200 MN force and mastering on their basis production of large extruded sections and panels - developing and mastering multistand hot and cold rolling mills which ensure production of a broad assortment of slabs, sheets, and bands for aircraft manufacturing and for other engineering fields; - mastering and implementing titanium, high-temperature, and refractory alloys and new melting methods (vacuum arc, electron beam, and electroslag remelting) which make it possible to produce alloys with a higher doping level in order to increase the strength, heat resistance, and other properties of materials; - producing high-temperature nickel, titanium, and aluminum alloys by the granular metallurgy method based on utilizing rapid solidification and hot isostatic pressing and production of billets by the methods of powder metallurgy, isothermal stamping, diffusion welding, etc. - Specialty metallurgy made a significant contribution to solving complex problems related to the development of modern aviation equipment at a high scientific and engineering level: these are the Buran spacecraft, the Mriya AN-225 aircraft with the highest load lifting capacity in the world, the comfortable civilian aircraft IL-96-300, TU-204, and IL-114, the newest military aircraft MIG-31, MIG-29, and SU-27, the Ka-32 and Mi-26 helicopters, highly efficient PS-90 and TV7-117 engines, support aircraft, and other flying vehicles which are equal to the best developments in the world. Today, specialty and light alloy metallurgy in industrially developed countries occupies one of the leading spots in various types of rolled stock production. The assortment of semifinished products produced has been expanded considerably, production of especially large deformed products has been mastered, and the quality indicators have been improved substantially. Semifinished products from nickel-based alloys, refractory metals, and aluminum-lithium alloys have been mastered and implemented extensively. A stable ratio has developed--40% of light alloy blanks are used in aviation and specialty technologies and 60%--in the national economy. This subindustry production largely determines the possibilities of engineering progress in the production of computer equipment, electronics, radio engineering, nuclear power, construction, production of containers and packaging, and other branches of the national economy. In Russia, virtually all structural rolled stock from aluminum, titanium, and a number of specialty alloys is produced at eight specialty metallurgy plants: the SMK, SaMZ, KUMPO, BKMPO, VSMPO, KMPP, KraMZ, and VILS. Specialty metallurgy is characterized in that it represents a through technological production cycle--from smelting ingots to developing ready products (including those with a high degree of precision) for subsequent use in the mechanical engineering complex. High-production processes which ensure production of billets from light alloys of the requisite quality have been implemented at all production stages. The principal types of rolled stock are large-size slabs and sheets from high- strength thermally hardened aluminum alloys. This rolled stock makes it possible to reduce the number of fastening joints in the structure thus considerably decreasing the product mass. Today, new practices have been developed for hot and cold rolling of slabs and sheets with a variable cross section along the length whose macro- and microstructure and mechanical properties correspond to the sheets and slabs with a constant cross section in the same shipping condition. Sheets and bands with a textured surface and decorative pattern are produced at specialty metallurgy plants, and production of thin aluminum bands with embossed relief for new structures of refrigerator and conditioner evaporators has been assimilated. Sheets with an isotropic surface roughness are being produced in order to improve the stamping ability and adhesion resistance as well as to upgrade the outside appearance of paint and varnish coats (primarily in the automotive industry). In the 1970s, sheet rolling production at the Samara metallurgical plant was radically restructured. By upgrading the hot rolling mill and installing two imported high-speed cold rolling mills as well as a continuous heat treatment production line, the capacity of the rolling shop producing sheets and slabs from aluminum alloys increased by 2.5 times. During the overhaul, large-scale production of anodized tin can band was set up for the first time in our country. Subsequent upgrading of the seven-stand hot rolling mill 2800 in the 1980s made it possible to increase the hot rolled coil mass from 6 to 10 t and reduce the semifinished rolled stock thickness from 6 to 3 mm, thus making it possible to increase the productivity of modern high-speed cold rolling mills 1800 and 2300 and improve the rolled stock precision. Today, a sheet rolling complex on the basis of a modern 8-stand hot rolling mill is being assembled at the Krasnoyarsk metallurgical plant. The specialized equipment complex makes it possible to produce large slabs from aluminum alloys with a width of up to 2.7 and a length of up to 30 m. A unique hardening unit with controlled jet cooling produced by the Ebner Company ensures a high quality of slab and plate heat treatment. Production of laminated sheets and slabs (including those from dissimilar materials) as well as rolled-welded panels from aluminum alloys has been set up at Russia's plants. The use of laminated rolled stock in various fields of mechanical engineering (in aerospace technology, shipbuilding, and rocket building) makes it possible to use principally new structural designs, lower the aircraft and spacecraft mass, increase the service life characteristics, and save scarce materials. Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with stainless steel have been successfully used both as structural materials for making vacuum-tight adaptors for welding products consisting of dissimilar materials, for making containers and vessels intended for storing corrosive liquids and biological products in agriculture, and for producing clad metal kitchen utensils. Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with copper on one or both sides are used for making current conducting electrical equipment, current leads, contactors, and circuit breakers, and repeater and radar systems; in household appliances, this ensures a high operating reliability and saves scarce copper. Rolled welded panels and thermal plates from aluminum and its alloys are used in heat exchange systems for developing household refrigerators, heat and pressure chambers, and life support systems and for making solar water heaters. One hundred and eighty extrusion complexes and production lines on the basis of horizontal hydraulic presses with a force from 5 to 200 MN are in operation in rolling mills of specialty metallurgy plants. They are used to produce more than 20,000 types of sections from aluminum alloys. Commercial production of thin-walled panels with a 960-2,100 mm width and an up to 12 m length from aluminum (including aluminum-lithium) alloys on the basis of presses with a force of 50-80-120 and 200 MN has been underway for 25 years. This unique technology is based on extruding finned pipe and subsequently uncoiling it into a plane on special dressing equipment. The domestic industry is producing hot-extruded, cold-strained, and welded pipes. In addition to making regular round pipes, finned, rectangular, and oval-shaped pipes are also produced. A method has been developed and specialized production line equipment for making drilling pipes has been manufactured. In recent years, highly efficient methods of producing seamless tubes from aluminum alloys with an inside corrosion-resistant coating has been developed in Russia in recent years. Methods of making wound grain storage structures have been developed. Large-size stamped blanks (with a broad assortment) from aluminum alloys are produced in vertical hydraulic stamping presses with a force from 50 to 750 MN. Spars, beams, arm props, chassis frames, etc., are being produced with a minimum machining allowance. Rolled large-size rings should be mentioned among large-size semifinished products. A technology of stamping piston-type parts from alloy AK12D containing 12-14% Si has been developed at specialty metallurgy plants. Full-scale tests demonstrate that their wear resistance increased by fivefold while their service life was extended by approximately twofold. Such branches as the aviation industry, shipbuilding, general mechanical engineering, chemical and petroleum machinebuilding, and metallurgy have a need for titanium rolled stock. Russia's titanium production set up at the VSMPO possesses the largest smelting capacities in the world for making ingots. With respect to the equipment range and capabilities and ingot production, the smelting industry exceeds all other countries taken together (120,000 t/yr). Cylindrical ingots with a 280-1,200 mm diameter and an up to 15 t mass are smelted. Double and triple vacuum arc remelting technologies have been implemented in production thus ensuring a high metal quality. The autocrucible melting process which ensures chemical homogeneity of titanium alloys and the possibility of utilizing (up to 100%) waste and returning it back to the melt without preliminary grinding has been commercially implemented at the VSMPO. Existing production of deformed semifinished products from titanium and its alloys carried out at the VSMPO, VILS, KMPP, ChMZ, SMK, and other enterprises ensures a diverse assortment of semifinished products from a wide range of alloys. Methods of extruding titanium alloys and steels which provided for overhauling existing hydraulic presses, heating devices, and straightening tensile machines which have been used before for making aluminum alloy sections was developed in the mid-1960s for ensuring production of sections for engine frames. Production of thin-walled sections with a minimum 1.5 mm wall thickness and with a surface quality which made it possible to weld them without additional machining was set up in the early 70s. A coil method of making 0.2-0.8 mm thick sheets from titanium alloys with a mass of 2 t has been mastered at the VSMPO. Due to the breakup of the USSR, Russia, being a dominant consumer of titanium and its alloys, was left without its own operating sources of titanium ore raw material or existing production of alloying composition and has only a 40-45% (of the demand) capacity for titanium sponge production. In the near future, the issues of supplying Russia's titanium industry with its own raw material, improving the rolled stock and blank quality to the level of world standards, creating conditions for more economic metal utilization at all process stages, supplying all branches of the national economy with the full range of semifinished products and blanks, and ensuring access to the world market for Russia's titanium production must be solved comprehensively in the near future. The scientists working in specialty metallurgy mastered for the first time in the 1960s vacuum arc melting of refractory nickel alloys which subsequently was implemented at all ferrous metallurgy plants. This made it possible considerably to improve the metal purity. Extensive research into using electron beam smelting has been carried out in order to improve the refractory alloy ingot quality further. Work is underway on manufacturing equipment and developing methods of continuous ingot casting using intermediate foundry ladles and separating the metal melting and solidification processes. Yet nickel alloy blanks produced by traditional methods no longer meet the increasing requirements of high-temperature strength. Granular metallurgy which was borne at the VILS in the 1970s made it possible to ensure the properties of compact blanks at the level of deformed metal properties or better and thus eliminate deformation in a number of cases and produce blanks with a high shape complexity and dimensional accuracy, ensure a radical improvement in properties, and manufacture principally new types of blanks (with a variable chemical composition) and combined parts (discs with blades, impellers, etc.) whose production is impossible by traditional metallurgy methods. Various types of specialized domestic equipment have been developed for producing granules by the centrifugal electrode sputtering methods and their processing and degassing, as well as gasostats and equipment for subsequent processing and monitoring of ready parts. A shop for producing granular metallurgy products from refractory nickel alloys, particularly discs and shafts for mass-produced aviation engines, has been constructed and brought onstream. The RD-33 for MIG-29s are equipped with discs and shafts produced by granular metallurgy methods. Today, increasing the reliability of discs for modern turbojet engines PS-90 and TV7-117 and passenger airliners IL-96- 300, TU-204, and IL-114 is a high-priority task. Development of modern aviation and specialty equipment calls for creating new materials with a low density which have high service characteristics. Traditional foundry and powder metallurgy methods have virtually exhausted their capabilities of increasing the properties of materials. In recent years, extensive developments of materials using a principally new method-- mechanical alloying--which differs in that all alloy formation processes occur in the solid phase have been underway at the VILS in recent years. This makes it possible to produce materials with a unique combination of physical and mechanical properties which are unattainable by other methods. Assimilation of high-modulus aluminum-based materials for instruments and their components whose use will make it possible to lower the instrument mass by two- to fivefold and increase the instrument reliability and accuracy and high-temperature and heat resistance iron and nickel alloys for combustion chambers, heat protection screens, nozzles, heat exchangers for high- temperature structural fastening elements, etc., is underway. This will make it possible to increase the operating temperature of gas turbine engines by 100-150�C made from age-hardened titanium alloys with an elevated wear resistance. Materials on the basis of intermetallic compounds with a reduced density and elevated corrosion resistance are being developed for substituting high-temperature nickel alloys in making gas turbine engine blades. In recent years, work has been underway on producing new alloys by utilizing the vacuum deposition processes. The possibility of producing aluminum alloys with an elevated high-temperature strength for use in structural elements in place of titanium alloys and steels is confirmed. Composite materials with a metallic and ceramic matrix have been generating considerable interest. Aluminum composite materials with a discrete reinforcing agent are promising for ensuring a low part mass combined with a high strength and rigidity and good wear resistance. Thus, the specific rigidity of Al-SiC materials is 1.5-2 times higher than that of conventional structural alloys (steel and titanium and aluminum alloys) while their specific strength is comparable to that of titanium alloys and considerably exceeds high-strength steels. The solution to the problem of producing materials ensuring operation of structures at a 1,500-1,800�C is closely related to utilizing composites with a ceramic or intermetallic matrix. Composites on the basis of silicon nitride and carbide which are characterized in that they combine high strength and heat conductivity with low specific gravity and coefficient of thermal expansion are the most promising. The use of hot isostatic pressing makes it possible to produce highly dense blanks with a complex shape with a small finishing machining allowance and with isotropic physical and chemical properties. The accumulated experience of producing metallurgical semifinished products for the defense complex must be actively implemented under today's conditions for producing civilian items. It is necessary to maintain the scientific and technical potential of specialty metallurgy, support and promote scientific developments, and lay the foundation for stable performance of the industry in an environmental of world market competition. Due to a reform of economic management methods in Russia under today's conditions and the need to merge with the economies of the world community, there is an urgent issue of ensuring that the metallurgical enterprises manufacture competitive products which meet customer requirements. An infrastructure for testing and certifying semifinished made from light and specialty alloys in conformance with series 9000 ISO international standard requirements must be developed for ensuring the high competitiveness of the metallurgical products. Setting up certification efforts will enable the metallurgical plants to ensure high-quality product shipments to domestic plants and earn a reputation of suppliers of high-quality products among foreign partners.
