Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of mobile police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and forcibly searched office rooms of the headquarters, residences of its leading officials and branch offices. Earlier, rightwing gangsters under the manipulation of the authorities swarmed to a central organ of Chongnyon and its affiliated organizations and kicked up a row, even murdering a businessman of Chongnyon. "This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty of Chongnyon and crudely violating the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan and a challenge to the DPRK which cannot be overlooked," the statement says, and goes on: "We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the Japanese authorities are intensifying their suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating the situation over the fictitious 'nuclear issue' of the DPRK at the instigation of the United States. "Chongnyon is a peaceloving organization whose activities are officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and the Japanese law and which enjoys full support of many countries and organizations in the world. "There is neither reason nor ground for Chongnyon to be an object of crackdown by the Japanese authorities. "Moreover, Koreans in Japan are innocent people who were forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard toil under the brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their descendants. Therefore, special protection must be granted to them by the Japanese authorities. "Far from apologizing for and liquidating the past crimes committed against the Korean people, however, the Japanese authorities are engaging in suppression of Koreans in Japan and their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act. "We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively counter it." The statement expresses the hope that all the progressive personages and broad sections of people in Japan and the world will continue to express support and solidarity for the righteous activities of Chongnyon for its democratic national rights and national reunification.
