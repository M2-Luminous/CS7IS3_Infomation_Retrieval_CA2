FR940317-1-00045 FR940317-1-00012 Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12630 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act This document is not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This proposed revision is a technical amendment that allows the regulation to conform with the current edition of a publication that has been incorporated by reference, which will make compliance and enforcement more practical and efficient. Also, this current action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630, since compliance with the revised regulations will have neither greater nor lesser effect on constitutionally protected individual property rights. The revision to Part 14 certified not to have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Small entities are already required to comply with the current regulations and the 18th edition of the IATA Live Animals Regulations. It is expected that the revisions would reduce the burden on small entities by adopting the current edition of the industry guidelines rather than imposing a requirement for an outdated version. Since the rule applies to importations of live wildlife into the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. Author The author of this proposed rule is Dr. Susan S. Lieberman, Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. 20240 (703/358&hyph;2095). List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 14 Exports, Imports, Incorporation by Reference, Labeling, Reporting requirements, Transportation and Wildlife.
