It will aim to provide low-cost transmission services through the use of digital transmission using what is called the "C-band." In the past, international video data transmission was monopolized by Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), but it appears that lower rates will go into effect with the participation of ITJ. On the 30th, ITJ and Fuji Television conducted a joint experiment in transmitting digital data between Japan and the United States. A tracking and data relay system (TDRS) satellite and digital receiving facilities owned by Columbia Communications was used to transmit animated images from an Earth satellite station located in Washington State to Fuji Television headquarters in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo. "C-band" operates at a frequency where attenuation distortion is minimal during rainfall. The recent experiment involved the use of the "Ku-band" because of the fear of jamming in the case of Earthbound radio waves in Japan, and demonstrated the commercial feasibility of receiving services.
