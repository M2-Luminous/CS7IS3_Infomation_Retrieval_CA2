"The meeting was an instructive and a constructive one," Mr. Claes added. The Troika (which also includes the head of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, the Greek and German state secretaries for foreign affairs, Messrs. Kaltrut and Papandreou, respectively, and European Commissioner for External Relations Hans van den Broek) is to report on the political, economic, and social situation of Algeria before the Twelve in the context of European financial support for that country's economic recovery. The EU wants to contribute to the political stability of that country, which has endured Islamic violence. At a press conference, Mr. Papandreou welcomed the Algerian Government's sincere will to take up the political and economic challenge. "This sincere will is the basis of a successful cooperation between the EU and the Algerian Government," he added. The EU representatives who met with the Algerian Prime Minister Mr. Mokvad Sifi, Foreign Ministry head Salah Bendri, and President Lianine Zerouan had a message of support for the ongoing reforms in Algeria. "We want you to know that Europe is on your side and supports your reforms," Mr. Papandreou said. He also firmly condemned violence and terrorism and called for the respect of human rights. Besides the political message, the Twelve have recently earmarked ECU150 million for Algeria (as the second part of a larger credit of ECU400 million aimed at sustaining the Algerian balance of payments) and should soon grant another ECU200 million which has already been approved in principle by the EU finance ministers. A group of European experts is expected in Algiers next month to examine the terms and conditions for implementing the economic recovery program. Algeria also wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the EU, similar to that between the Twelve and Morocco and Tunisia. The Algerian foreign minister hopes that this will lead to the creation of a free-trade zone. "We are anxiously waiting for a decisive step to be made in favor of Algeria at the Corfu Summit," he added. Mr. Bendri said that Algeria had "turned its back on those who have hindered its development so far" and that it was heading for a democratic, pluralistic society which is open to democracy and solidarity. He expressed the desire that "all political and social forces that reject terrorism should adhere to the principle of a pluralistic society that respects human rights and take part in the national dialogue to prepare the future together." Furthermore, the Algerian minister invited the international human rights organizations to come to see for themselves how the Algerian authorities are ensuring their implementation.
