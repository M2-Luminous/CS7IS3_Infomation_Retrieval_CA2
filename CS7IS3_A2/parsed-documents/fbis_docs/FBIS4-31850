He pointed out the Interior Ministry has yet not delivered citizenship notifications to about 85 percent of the Serbian population in Macedonia. Miletic attacked media in Macedonia for writing of Macedonia being allegedly endangered by Serbia and of putting pressure on Serbs in Macedonia to declare themselves Macedonians at the census. According to him, the names of some Serbs, especially those living a longer period in Macedonia, are being changed. Miletic also spoke of existence of Serbian enclaves in Macedonia, which presently have a status of national communities, but, if necessary, will turn into territorially independent enclaves.
