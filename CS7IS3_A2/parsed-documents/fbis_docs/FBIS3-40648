It has planned country-wide programmes to make their plan turn into a movement. The party general secretary, Mr K.L. Sharma, today said the movement would be converted into an agitation around the time of the budget session in February. According to the plan prepared by the general secretaries of the party, there would be a mass awakening programme at the panchayat level all over the country. The Kisan Morcha of the BJP has been given the charge of successfully holding these programmes. The party intends to publish a large number of pamphlets which would be distributed freely among the farmers to explain the BJP's stand on the Dunkel draft. A comprehensive, documentary film is also being planned. The budget for the publication of pamphlets and organising meetings would be decided at a meeting of the Kisan Morcha to be held in Delhi on January 7. The meeting would be presided over by the Kisan Morcha president, Mr Kailash Joshi, MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] from Madhya Pradesh. Leaders like Govindacharya and others have been involved in this programme for creating a movement against the Dunkel draft. During the first phase of the programme, which would be from January 15 to 31, the party intends to hold seminars and meetings in all major cities. The party would give the slogan of "kisan bachao, kheti bachao" during these various meetings. The party would be decided on the further stages of the programme at the meeting of its "kisan morcha." The BJP is also contemplating to amend its constitution to bring about "internal democracy with discipline in the party." According to sources, this move is being thought of in view of the growing indiscipline in the party, which had surfaced recently during the assembly elections. Leaders in the party feel that the internal squabblings were the result of the BJP's poor performance in the recent elections.
