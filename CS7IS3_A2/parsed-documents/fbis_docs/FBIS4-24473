Yesterday, deputies began discussing in groups the "Government Work Report" delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu. Deputies Chen Kuiyuan, Raidi, and Gyaincain Norbu arrived at the conference center early in the morning [of 16 May]. They participated in discussions and attentively listened to other deputies' speeches. At a group discussion held by the Lhasa city delegation, when the delegation convener invited Comrade Chen Kuiyuan to take the floor, the latter said laughingly: "I am just an ordinary deputy. Let everyone express his or her views." At group discussions of the Nagqu and Xigaze delegations, Comrades Raidi and Gyaincain Norbu attentively listened to the deputies' views on the "Report," added remarks during the deputies' speech from time to time, and earnestly took notes. When reporters were present as visitors at group discussions of Nyingchi, Qamdo, Ngari, Shannan, and People's Liberation Army delegations, they noticed deputies of these delegations unanimously maintained that the 20-character principle -- "Seize the Opportunity, Deepen Reform, Open Up Wider, Promote Development, and Maintain Stability" -- decided upon by the central authorities had been conscientiously implemented and had produced concrete results in Tibet. It was also embodied in the entire "Report." Deputy Kong Qinghua, from Maizhokunggar County said: It is a realistic "report" without any exaggerations or empty words, and has a high possibility of being put into operation. Deputy Caiwang Bandian, of Xigaze Prefecture, explained the economic development and stability enjoyed by Tibet as a result of reform and opening up and in light of Xigaze's actual conditions. He deeply felt that 1994 is, indeed, a very crucial year. He said: The "Report" affirmed the main aspects, and found out the problems that Tibet needs to solve badly. It has new ideas and proposes many measures. The crux of the matter lies in implementation. Deputies believed we must focus attention on improving peasants' and herdsmen's income in our endeavor to promote economic development at agricultural and pastoral areas. The "Report's" plan in this respect conforms to Tibetan realities. The crux of the matter lies in doing a good job of propaganda and explanation to win the understanding and support of the masses as well as their participation. The establishment of a market system, enterprises' "transformation of operating mechanisms," education, trained personnel, exploitation of resources, grain circulation, and foreign trade were also hot points of deputies' discussions. The special importance of stability in Tibet was a topic to which deputies paid very close attention. They believed the third part of the "Report" offered a clear, definite, and specific explanation on how to create a favorable social environment to ensure the smooth progress of reform and development. Deputies suggested that emphasis be laid on the grass roots when carrying out the work of maintaining stability, and that all problems be resolutely addressed in the bud while efforts are made to do a good job of propaganda and guidance.
