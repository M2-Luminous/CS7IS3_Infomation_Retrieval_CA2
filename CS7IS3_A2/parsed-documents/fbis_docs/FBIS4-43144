Giving what is believed to be the first news conference in the garden of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister said that two-thirds of the electorate simply did not bother to vote and the turnout in Britain and in other EU [European Union] countries was "frankly derisory." But he insisted: "I intend to stick to what I set out to do because I passionately believe it is in the long-term benefit of this country." He also promised that with the co-operation of the opposition parties the Government hoped to make progress on reforming the way the House of Commons conducted its business before the summer recess. The Prime Minister, speaking in warm sunshine, went through the Government's programme both implemented and planned. He said the results, although poor, were a good deal better than almost anybody had predicted. "The opinion polls have been discredited again," he said. "It has been clear for some years that many people are simply not frank when asked questions by opinion pollsters. I expect they resent the prying nature of the questions." He added: "It is apparent that many people are still both angry and bruised as a result of the recession. That has happened here in the UK as it has happened right across Europe." He said that governing parties in Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal had all enjoyed a smaller share of the vote than in their last general elections. "In the United Kingdom we are firmly back into growth but that is clearly not yet the general perception of the public. Many people simply declined to vote on this occasion." Mr Major: "`Not this time' was the frequent message on the doorstep." He said there was irritation with all politicians, certainly directed at the Government. The elections were held at a time uniquely favourable to the Labour Party. In an apparent reference to the death of Labour leader John Smith, he said some of the reasons were sad, which everyone understood. Describing the failure of the Liberals to make any advances, Mr Major said: "We are back into the politics of clear choice. The only alternative to a Conservative government is a Labour government. Any other choice is a good spoiler but unreal. "We are now back into economic growth and this is going to continue. I am confident we will meet our growth forecasts. We have the lowest inflation since the 1960s and I am confident we will meet inflation targets. Unemployment has fallen consistently and I am confident that will go on." Mr Major: "We will continue to pursue long-term policies that we believe will lead to success for this country." Asked about a leadership challenge, the Prime Minister declared: "I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish to challenge in the autumn -- that's a matter for them. I don't expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I will beat it and I will be here through and through the general election." Mr Major went on to claim that Labour had shown they would prefer to spend people's money themselves than to cut taxes. But he said of the Tory Party: "If and when it is prudent to cut taxes in the future, our instinct will be to cut them. I would rather let people decide for themselves how to spend their money than we should decide on their behalf." Questioned over claims by some MPs that the Tory European manifesto had been too Euro sceptic, Mr Major said: "I am not bowing either to the Euro enthusiasts or the Euro sceptics. I am saying and doing precisely what I believe is right for Europe." On a Cabinet reshuffle, Mr Major said: "There will be one. It isn't imminent. I think there are appropriate times to hold a reshuffle both in terms of good management and in terms of man management." Asked by one reporter whether he had at any time during the European election campaign considered resigning, Mr Major replied confidently: "The question didn't cross my mind." Mr Major said governments across Europe had experienced a "mid-term dip in popularity" and a general election could be up to three years away in the UK. People tended to "protest less and move back to their natural home" as a general election approached.
