FBIS4-34038 "drlat115_b_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 Barbados Haiti Ministry Denies OAS Civilian Mission Allegations Ministry Denies OAS Civilian Mission Allegations FL1406212294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 14 Jun 94 FL1406212294 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The Jonassaint government guarantees all foreigners living in Haiti the freedom to attend to their affairs. The Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination strongly denies the allegations contained in the 8 June communique issued by an organization claiming to be an OAS/UN international civilian mission in Haiti, which recounts incidents that occurred on the evening of 7 June between agents of that organization and segments of the Haitian police force. In its concern for the truth, and to shield the country from the systematic denigration campaign of which it is an object, the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is pleased to present the following corrections: The first and most important correction concerns the arms and radios seized by the police patrol on duty that night. The arms and radios were not registered with the police or with the National Council of Telecommunications [CONATEL], and the two operations were led by known police agents working under the the strictest military discipline. The Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is reacting to the U.S. State Department memo, which responded to the report by this alleged OAS/UN international civilian mission in Haiti. The Ministry is amazed at the hasty conclusions drawn by this U.S. state entity, which asserts that the lives of Americans are threatened and their safety remains tentative. Is it necessary to remind them of the series of incidents that occurred during the seven-month Aristide government, including, among others, the Leogane affair, which cost about 10 U.S. citizens their freedom and almost brought them to a tragic death by lynching; and that these types of events were inspired by the anti-American violence of President Aristide's speeches. How and why did they forget that anti-imperialism was nourishing state-sponsored terrorism at that time -- fortunately in the past -- and threatening the lives of Americans and the safety of people and buildings of foreign embassies? The Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination wonders about this. On that score, this Ministry believes this communique by the international civilian mission in Haiti is very thoughtless as is its corollary, the State Department memo, which can cause irreparable damage to Haiti which -- despite low blows and ingratitude -- remains on the track of friendship among peoples based on mutual respect and human values and freedom. The Ministry of Information takes this opportunity to remind all foreigners living on national territory that they have the government's full guarantee of their safety and rights and are free to attend to their affairs. This note was signed by Jacques Saint-Louis, minister of information, culture, and coordination.
