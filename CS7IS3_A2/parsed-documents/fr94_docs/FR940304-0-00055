FR940304-0-00055 FR940304-0-00017 10. In the Further Notice in this proceeding, 57 FR 54205 (Nov. 17, 1992), the Commission certified that the proposed rule changes would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Neither the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration nor any commenting party disagreed with that analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Report and Order, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law No. 69&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1981). Ordering Clauses 11. Accordingly, it is ordered that pursuant to authority contained in sections 1, 4(i) and (j), 201&hyph;205, 220, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§151, 154(i) and (j), 201&hyph;205, 220, and 403, parts 61 and 69 of the Commission's rules are Amended as set forth below. 12. It is further ordered that the policies and rules adopted herein shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Because the initial restructured transport rates went into effect on December 30, 1993, thus allowing LECs subject to price cap regulation to propose rate changes that do not comply with the policies adopted herein in the absence of these rule changes, good cause exists to make these rules effective less than 30 days from publication in the Federal Register . 13. It is further ordered that the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau is delegated the authority specified herein.
