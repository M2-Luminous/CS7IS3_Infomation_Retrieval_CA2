According to local officials, the bases, which are scattered across both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, have a total cotton growing area of 200,000 ha, accounting for one third of the autonomous region's total cotton growing acreage. The production capacity of the bases has been greatly enhanced thanks to the establishment of comprehensive services concerning operation and management, technology application, the breeding of good strains, purchase and processing, coupled with increased investment from the central government. Last year Xinjiang earned 7.2 billion yuan from sales of commodity cotton, accounting for more than half of the earnings from the marketing of produce from the region's farming sector. Local farmers also netted an increase of 80 yuan in their per capita income from the growing of cotton alone. The officials said that this year the growing area of cotton in Xinjiang is expected to surpass 733,333 ha, compared to 644,666 ha in 1993. They pledged to redouble their efforts to boost cotton production and make the region's total output of cotton reach one million tons by 1996.
