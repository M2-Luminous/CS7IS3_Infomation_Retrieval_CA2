Mock said he thinks people can learn their lessons from history; the European unification process based on German-French reconciliation was one of these enormous learning processes, and it still is today. "In the case of Germans in the Czech Republic, I have always spoken out for the protection of human rights, and I will continue to do so in the future -- my commitment in the CSCE and the Council of Europe also proves this," Mock added. Mock finds the irritation about his comparison of expulsions and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia especially incomprehensible: "I only mentioned views of [Czech President Vaclav] Havel's that are supported by quotes and which I found very impressive, which I share and which have never been revoked." [passage omitted] Karsten Eder, chairman of the Sudeten Germans in Austria, cannot understand "why the Czechs are making such a fuss when someone is awarded a prize for advocating a just order of nations. I cannot understand how they can protest against this. I also cannot understand how the Czech Government can react with dismay and indignation to an invitation by the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft," Eder said. Like Mock, he stressed that problems can only be solved through talks. [passage omitted]
