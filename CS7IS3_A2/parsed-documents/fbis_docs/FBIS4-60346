Speaking at a meeting today of the country's judicial authorities, Ayatollah Yazdi, head of the judiciary branch, said: Governmental sense and wisdom dictate that, in order to solve a particular case, the Saudi authorities should not set themselves up against the world of Islam and regional countries and face unanswerable questions from public opinion. The judiciary chief said the recent action of the Zionist regime was overt theft and blatant kidnapping. He declared: Such ugly behavior by the illegitimate offspring of world arrogance is not surprising, particularly since the raison d'etre of the Zionist regime is usurpation and delinquence. The deathly silence of the international forums and organizations who talk about human rights is surprising and regrettable, however.
