In the 70-minute meeting, Jiang said that Kissinger, with the foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, has always worked for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. Discussing the world situation, Jiang noted that after the end of the cold war, the multi-polarization of the world structure is increasing, with the international situation moving towards relaxation and economic interests becoming a leading factor for the development of international relations. "It represents the common wish of all peoples in the world to seek relaxation of tensions, cooperation and progress," Jiang said. "However, the end of the cold war has not brought about overall peace, and some regions suffer from turbulence and even continuous wars," Jiang said, adding that such a situation has aroused concern from across the world. As two big nations that have international influence, China and the United States "shoulder an important responsibility for the future of the world and the fate of mankind," a Chinese source quoted Jiang as saying. After a review of the growth of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said that confrontation between China and the United States benefits neither side, while cooperation brings benefits not only to the two peoples, but to world peace in general as well. Despite some disputes, problems or differences of one kind or another between the two countries, Sino-U.S. relations need to be improved, Jiang said, calling this "the need for world peace and stability." Practice shows that Sino-U.S. relations have never been restricted to bilateral dimensions alone, but are closely linked with the international situation, Jiang said. "When Sino-U.S. relations have enjoyed smooth growth, it has always been when the two sides could overcome the differences in social systems and concepts of values, proceed from the common interests to develop mutually-beneficial cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, practice non-interference in each other's internal affairs and equality, and strive to expand common ground," he noted. In contrast, when those principles were violated and ideological differences emphasized, in cases of imposing one's own views upon the other side or even resorting to sanctions and exerting pressure, Sino-U.S. relations have encountered difficulties, set-backs or even retrogression, Jiang said, calling those "profound historical lessons." Jiang, noting that the development of Sino-U.S. relations is facing a good opportunity at present, said that the two countries should seize the opportunity to work together, in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, so as to ensure expansion of bilateral ties along a healthy and normal track, as well as on the basis of the three Sino- U.S. joint communiques. Kissinger said that a friendly relationship between the United States and China is essential for peace and stability in Asia and the world at large. Also, he said he has always opposed using the MFN [most-favored nation] status to exert pressure on China and exerting pressure on China in general. Kissinger said he hoped to see greater improvement of u.S.-China relations, according to a Chinese official.
