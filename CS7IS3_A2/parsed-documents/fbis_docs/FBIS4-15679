In Autumn 1991, the structure of "Soviet Railways" was liquidated. It was then that "Baltic Railways," which was part of the old system, turned the Puduri railway station over to Russia. The board of "Baltic Railways" made this decision without discussing the matter with the Latvian Government, Robert Milbergs, head of the parliamentary Commission on Investigation, told DIENA. As Vladimirs Zacharovs, chief of the Latvian Prosecutor's Office Transport Department, who is investigating the case, told DIENA today, after the annexation of the Abrene district by Russia in 1946, the border dividing the two states was not precisely delineated. It was only mentioned that the border follows the river, but the river course has changed after drainage operations. A high-ranking official of the joint stock company "Baltic Railways," who did not want his name mentioned, stated that he thinks the "Fatherland and Freedom" request is baseless, as in 1991 the administrative borders clearly showed that Puduri station is situated on Russian territory. This can be confirmed by simply looking at a map. The Saeima will investigate the controversy over Puduri station and all problems related to the borders, during its spring session, after it receives clarification from the Cabinet of Ministers.
