The actions are sponsored by the chambers of Caracas and the States of Miranda, Anzoategui, Aragua, Barinas, Carabobo, Merida, Nueva Esparta, Tachira, and Trujillo, as well as the industrial chambers of the footwear, manufacturing, and plastics industries, whose registered enterprises suffer acute production stagnation, loss of investment, and decapitalization problems. For this purpose, the chambers are backed by Corpoindustria, an organization that announced its willingness to present in the Congress an Emergency Refinancing Bill to take the sector out of the stagnation it suffers. According to a report by the VeneConsultants firm for Conindustria, the industry's profits have been lower than the amounts paid in interest rates. The problems thus resulted in some prompt, radical positions, which urge protection for the financial system while the production system is on the verge of collapse. During a recent meeting of a group of important industrial chambers and associations, the financial assistance provided by FOGADE [Guarantee Fund for the Protection of Bank Deposits] to "compensate for the irregular handling of the depositors' money" was seriously questioned. Some of the strong expressions heard went like this: "While we had to compete for exports, the banks got financial assistance." "While the doors of financing are closed for us, banks are benefited by the Zero Coupon." "We cannot obtain dollars, but the banks can obtain them exclusively." The industrialists reported that Banking Association President Jose Bouza Izquierdo's pledge that compulsive collection would not be affected is not being made good. This is the case for the footwear industry, whose representative organizations, Cavenic and Anpmicals, say the indebtedness index in the sector tripled in the past few months, thus increasing the final cost of the finished product, whose price increases "without receiving any bank assistance. Quite the contrary, they are the recipients of stronger and more pressing actions from the banks." According to Deputy Development Minister Warner Corrales Leal, the government is also concerned with the problem. He said the Executive Branch is waiting for "the banks to demonstrate the same expeditiousness in solving these problems." Frankly, he said, the ministry would like to receive from the banks clearer signals that they are indeed concerned and that they are doing everything possible, just as the government is doing. The ministry's criticism is shared by Corpoindustria, where the problem is seen to become more complex with the rise in the price of the dollar because already raw material suppliers are quoting prices in foreign currency and shortening payment terms. Manuel Gallegos, Corpoindustria acting president, has reported that FIV [Venezuelan Investment Fund] is considering negotiating a $100-million loan with Citybank, a loan which will make it possible for Corpoindustria to refinance part of Pymi's debt with this organization, which amounts to 7 billion bolivares, of which 1.7 billion bolivares are overdue. Also, a joint action by Corpoindustria, Foncrel, Sogamoi, and Banco Industrial de Venezuela is being prepared to create a bloc for financing and industrial support.
