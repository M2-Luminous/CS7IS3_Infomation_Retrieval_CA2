Good morning. [Kinkel] Good morning. [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, to begin with, a topical development. Yesterday evening the German ambassador in London, Hartmann, was summoned by Agriculture Minister Shephard, who evidently protested at the possible plans of the Federal Government to act unilaterally on the question of BSE [Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis -- Mad Cow Disease] and possibly introduce import restrictions on British beef. This is not an entirely normal event. What is your assessment of it? [Kinkel] Well, to begin with, this is a subject that particularly interests us, and we have of course said that if no agreed policy can be found in Europe, we must in certain circumstances reserve the right to our own course of action. And I am assuming that that remains the position. I must now -- I have heard about the summoning -- but my position is that I must first know precisely what the subject of the discussion was and then we will deal with it. [Correspondent] Do you see in this development a strain on German-British relations in view of the fact that British Agriculture Minister Shephard threatened -- to give one quotation -- very serious consequences? [Kinkel] No, I do not see any strain. We should not immediately put such things in the category of strained relations. It is in a lower category, let us wait and see. It is an important subject; we shall discuss it and settle it calmly and quietly. [Correspondent] Minister, you will soon be beginning a meeting at the Petersberg in Bonn with Russian President Yeltsin on the third day of his German visit. What is on your agenda today? [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] Of course, the visit and the talks have shown we have deepened and strengthened our relations of friendship and partnership with our great neighbor. We are both economically and politically very important partners for each other; (?a factor there) is the personal chemistry between the chancellor and the president. [passage omitted] We are supporting Russia, particularly in its admission to the Council of Europe and the G-7 problems. Russia is naturally also placing its hopes especially on our support for a cooperation agreement with the European Union [EU] when we take over the presidency of the council on 1 July. But we have also achieved a number of particular results. It is now clear how the dignified withdrawal of the Russian troops will take place here. Above all, we have been preparing the meeting today in Geneva of the five on the Yugoslav question, and we have, of course, also discussed intensively -- which is of great importance to the Russian side and to us -- the Partnership for Peace, the problem of creating a new security architecture for Europe. [Correspondent] What would you say is the most important result of this Yeltsin visit? [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] I am, of course, also pleased that we have been able to have intensive discussions about the NATO problem and the Partnership for Peace, since that, I believe [word indistinct] is the crucial subject for the Russian side and is of course of very considerable importance to us too. [Correspondent] Some of the press comment today expresses regret that the Yeltsin visit has basically produced few concrete results. [passage omitted] [Kinkel] [Passage omitted] The criticism that we have achieved few concrete results is mistaken. [passage omitted] We have also, for example, discussed other subjects that on their face are not so crucial but are still very important. For instance, we were able to explain the enlargement of the EU to take in the Central and East European countries, decided last Monday [9 May] in Luxembourg, which is also important for the Russian side. We have talked intensively about relations with the Baltic states. It is now clear that Mr. Kozyrev will come to the forthcoming Baltic Sea conference in Tallinn. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] You will be meeting your Russian counterpart Kozyrev again today, this time in Geneva at, as you have mentioned, a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the EU troika on the Bosnian conflict. This meeting is taking place against the background of the new developments in Washington, where the U.S. Senate has expressed itself in favor of lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia- Herzegovina. What is Bonn's position? [Kinkel] When I was in Washington recently this very discussion was taking place on the Hill, and the expectation was that the result would be what it now is. It does not bind the executive. As far as lifting the embargo is concerned, of the 12 Europeans the Dutch and the Germans have always been on the American side, or at least very close to it. The other 10 countries, in particular those with troops on the ground, are against lifting such an arms embargo. I have just been speaking with Douglas Hurd and Alain Juppe: The British and the French in particular are against it, and I understand that, because they are concerned for their troops on the ground and are concerned that the fighting will only get worse. Aside from that, it would of course also be relatively difficult now, with a lifting of the arms embargo, to get arms into the enclosed areas. But as I said, we are with the American position. It is just that I do not think it will come to lifting the embargo. For that we need the Security Council, and the Russians, the British, and the French will certainly be against it. [Correspondent] Germany does after all supply weapons to governments that do not take human rights all that seriously -- like Turkey and Indonesia -- so why not the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fighting against the Serbs for its very survival? [Kinkel] Yes, as far as the first subject goes, we must have more time for me to explain this a little, because of course I quite understand this. But I I will have to concentrate on the second question, for reasons of time. The issue is that there exists a resolution of the Security Council that simply does not permit it, and of course we are abiding by that, just as are the others. [Correspondent] That was Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Many thanks. [Kinkel] Thank you.
