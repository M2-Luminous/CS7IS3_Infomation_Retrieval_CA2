[passage omitted] The congress outlined concrete tasks aimed at bringing the country out of the political and economic crisis and an action program. In particular, great attention was devoted to questions regarding privatization, the development of entrepreneurship, the improvement of the taxation system, and the boosting of industry and agriculture. The union adopted a program document and rules. The attention of the deputies was focused on the problem of Abkhazia. Zurab Erkvania, Zaur Chanchibadze, Vakhtang Kobalia, and others delivered speeches during examination of this question. It was said that the UGC, unlike other political organizations, had assumed responsibility for the country's fate. "In this Union, we see a strong organizational force for the return of Abkhazia. No further state development in Georgia is possible while the Abkhazian question remains unresolved." The speakers gave a positive assessment of the decisions adopted by the Georgian authorities regarding Abkhazia and their attempt to regulate Russian-Georgian relations. [passage omitted] Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze delivered a long speech at the congress. Then, elections were held. By secret ballot, the congress's delegates elected Eduard Shevardnadze as chairman of the Union. Zurab Zhvania was elected its general secretary, Gia Zhorzholiani speaker of the consultative body, and Revaz Chkheidze chairman of the auditing commission. The congress elected members of the auditing commission, the Union's main council, and its consultative body. The UGC once more confirmed that its ideology was evident from its name. The country's concern for the citizen and the citizen's concern for the country is the guarantee for the political, social, and economic strength of Georgia.
