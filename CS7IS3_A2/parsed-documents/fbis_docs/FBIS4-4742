As a member of the House of Representatives, Nakamura, 44, pressured the Fair Trade Commission in 1991 not to file a criminal accusation against a group of 66 contractors over suspected bid-rigging, prosecutors allege. Nakamura received the money on January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice president of Kajima, the indictment said. At the time, Nakamura was acting head of the then governing Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly affairs. Kiyoyama, 68, was charged Tuesday with bribing Nakamura. If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in prison, according to the penal code. The indictment said Nakamura repeatedly urged then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa not to file a criminal accusation with prosecutors against the cartel. Umezawa announced on May 15, 1992 that the FTC would not file the accusation against the group. It is not yet proven whether Nakamura influenced the FTC decision. Prior to his arrest on March 11, the prosecution asked the Diet to lift Nakamura's parliamentary immunity, which provides that Diet members cannot be arrested while the House is in session. The lower house voted March 10 to approve the request. Nakamura served as construction minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. He is the only Diet member thus far to be arrested and indicted in connection with a series of scandals involving construction firms and politicians. Since last June, two governors, two mayors and more than 20 executives of eight top contractors have been arrested.
