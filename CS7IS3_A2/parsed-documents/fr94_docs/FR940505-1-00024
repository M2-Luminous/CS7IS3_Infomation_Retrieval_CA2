ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: Under the authority of section 110(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or ``the Act''), EPA today proposes federal implementation plans (FIPs) to attain, by the applicable statutory deadlines, the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone in the Sacramento and Ventura nonattainment areas, and to attain the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide in the South Coast nonattainment area. EPA's final FIPs must be signed by the EPA Administrator no later than February 1995. EPA requests comment on these proposed FIPs. EPA expects the California Low Emitting Vehicle (LEV) program will substantially reduce emissions from cars and light trucks, compared to the federal standard. In addition, for motor vehicles, EPA requests comment on an enhanced in-use compliance program to provide extra emissions.
