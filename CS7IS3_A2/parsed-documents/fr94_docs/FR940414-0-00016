FR940414-0-00016 FR940414-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;141&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8850; AD 94&hyph;06&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; Short Brothers PLC Model SD3&hyph;30, SD3&hyph;60, and SD3&hyph;SHERPA Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Short Brothers PLC Model SD3&hyph;30, SD3&hyph;60, and SD3&hyph;SHERPA series airplanes, that currently requires an inspection to detect corrosion on the distance piece associated with the wing strut pick up on the stub wing, and repair of corroded parts. This amendment requires repetitive inspections to detect corrosion of repaired or reworked distance pieces and adjacent side plates; and provides a terminating action for the repetitive inspections. This amendment is prompted by reports of corrosion on the distance pieces and adjacent side plates of the wing strut pick up. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the distance piece and adjacent side plates, which could result in reduced strength of the wing strut attachment to the stub wing on the fuselage and, subsequently, reduced structural strength of the main wing. DATES: Effective May 16, 1994. The incorporation by reference of Shorts Service Bulletin SD3&hyph;SHERPA&hyph;53&hyph;1, Revision 1, dated May 1993; Shorts Service Bulletin SD360&hyph;53&hyph;38, Revision 1, dated May 1993; Shorts Service Bulletin SD330&hyph;53&hyph;65, Revision 1, dated May 1993; Shorts Service Bulletin SD3 SHERPA&hyph;53&hyph;2, dated July 1993; Shorts Service Bulletin SD360&hyph;53&hyph;39, dated June 11, 1993; and Shorts Service Bulletin SD330&hyph;53&hyph;66, dated July 1993; as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 16, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain other publications listed in the regulations was approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May 27, 1993 (58 FR 27928, May 12, 1993). ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Short Brothers PLC, 2011 Crystal Drive, Suite 713, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3719. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 93&hyph;09&hyph;08, Amendment 39&hyph;8574 (58 FR 27928, May 12, 1993), which is applicable to certain Short Brothers PLC Model SD3&hyph;30, SD3&hyph;60, and SD3&hyph;SHERPA series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58992). The action proposed to supersede AD 93&hyph;09&hyph;08 to continue to require a one-time inspection to detect corrosion on the distance piece associated with the wing strut pick up on the stub wing, and repair or rework of corroded parts. The AD also proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect corrosion of repaired or reworked original equipment type distance pieces (with pockets) and adjacent side plates. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 106 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The currently required one-time inspection action requires approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that action on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,150, or $275 per airplane. For operators who replace or repair a distance piece, this AD will require that repetitive inspections of that distance piece be performed. Such inspections will require approximately 5 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the repetitive inspections that will be required of these operators will be $275 per airplane per inspection cycle. Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that will be provided by this AD action, the number of hours required to accomplish it will be approximately 80 per airplane, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts will be approximately $2,600 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the optional terminating action on U.S. operators will be $7,000 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.
