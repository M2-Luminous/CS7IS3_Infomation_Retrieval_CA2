This electronic jamming system was jointly produced by the U.S. firm Westinghouse and ITT [expansion unknown]. However, its actual combat performance tested in 1992 failed to show satisfactory results, leading the U.S. Defense Department to cancel its contract to buy the system. While noting that the F-16's which the ROK is set on purchasing are supposed to be equipped with this system, the BALTIMORE SUN did not specify the price or number of systems the ROK will purchase from the United States. The paper said that the U.S. decision to sell this system to the ROK was noted in the letter which U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry recently sent to the ROK defense minister. The system was developed as a self-defense system to protect the fighter plane from a radar-guided arms attack of an enemy.
