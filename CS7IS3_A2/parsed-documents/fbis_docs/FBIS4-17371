He pointed out the need to accelerate the process of setting up formidable financial-industrial groups in Russia and the CIS in order to manufacture science-intensive industrial products for both civilian and military purposes that will be competitive on the world market. The creation of financial-industrial groups will make it possible considerably to ease pressure on the government budget and to boost investment in industry. Back in 1991, Andrey Kokoshin, who headed a group of economists, historians, and industrialists at the time, put forward the initiative to create such groups and powerful companies drawing on rich foreign experience. The main elements of these "locomotives" of the domestic economy would be enterprises of the former USSR's military-industrial sector that are undergoing conversion to civilian uses and diversifying their area of expertise.
