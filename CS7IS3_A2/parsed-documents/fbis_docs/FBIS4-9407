Another participant in the discussion, Andrzej Karkoszka, a department director in MON, pointed at the danger for Europe that ensues from conflicts of the so-called old type--that is, national, ethnic, and religious ones. In his opinion, hopes to prevent such conflicts should be attached with UN and CSCE actions. [Begin recording of unidentified official] Poland cannot build its own security around its borders on its own. Poland must base this security upon a broader system: from the global one, through the regional--that is, the continental one--to a subregional one. We know that every greater conflict in Europe rolled across Poland or involved Poland, and vice versa. We hope that our security, in connection with the above, will be linked to that broader security. [end recording] [Announcer] The small budget of the Defense Ministry was pointed out in the discussion. It was recalled that an average Pole pays 10 times less for defense than a German citizen. Asked if Poland can afford to modernize its Armed Forces, which would help give us full NATO membership, Minister Milewski replied: [Begin Milewski recording] There are no defined requirements by the NATO side concerning the size of our defense budget. On the other hand, we know the size of the financial burden carried by societies in countries that are current NATO members. We believe that, if 3 percent of the gross national product is assigned for the Polish Republic's defense budget, and if we have some sort of an assurance that this figure will be maintained in the next five to 10 years, we will find that such an amount, albeit a minimal one, will be sufficient to meet our aims.
