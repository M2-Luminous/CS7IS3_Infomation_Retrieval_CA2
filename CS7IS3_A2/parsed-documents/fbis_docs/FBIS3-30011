The two sides are expected to jointly submit the amended package to the Diet on Monday and the bills are likely to be approved by the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors by Wednesday or later, they said. The two camps struck a deal Thursday on the last remaining point of difference, when the coalition parties conceded to an LDP demand to discuss giving political parties the status of a juridical person, the sources said. The LDP has called for the reform bills to state that political parties have the status of a juridical person, saying parties should be in a more responsible position because they will be subsidized by the government under the package. The coalition has opposed this, maintaining that freedom of association under the Constitution may be violated if political parties are obliged to have a juridical person's status. The two sides agreed to keep discussing the matter and conclude the debate by the time a bill on the locations of 300 single-seat constituencies for the lower house is presented to the Diet, the sources said. The bill is expected to be presented in the fall. According to the package, 300 lower house will be elected through a single-seat constituency system and the remaining 200 through a proportional representation system. Currently, lower house members are elected from constituencies with two to six seats. The package was passed January 29 at the last extraordinary session of the Diet, but some amendments and the date of enforcement were removed from the package to get it through. Shortly before the passage, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement will be discussed at the current ordinary session.
