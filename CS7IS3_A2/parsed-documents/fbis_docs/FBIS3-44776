At a press conference here today, Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of the commission, said that over 10,000 such enterprises were set up over the past year. High-tech enterprises refers to firms started by scientists which raise capital funds through non-governmental channels and enjoy independent management and hold sole responsibility for their own profits and losses. For example, some of the country's best-known high-tech firms, such as Stone Company, Legend Group Corp., Beijing University Founder Co. Ltd. and Hope Computers Co. Ltd. are among these enterprises. According to the Chinese official, the 40,000 non-governmental firms, who in total have more than 600,000 employees, hit a record profit of 25 billion yuan (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) last year. He said that the businesses of these enterprises have extended to virtually all industries in the national economy while concentrating in technology-intensive industries including chemical industry, telecommunications, machinery, precision instruments, computers, building materials, medicines, biological products and environmental protection. Hui noted that the average input in research and development has made up over 6 percent of these enterprises' total income and the scientific and technological employees have accounted for over 30 percent of their total staff. According to Hui, China's large non-governmental scientific enterprises have got off to a good start in industrialization and internationalization of high technologies. One example is that the Hope Computers Corporation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was started by eight graduates ten years ago, now has the largest share of the country's sales of cad products. The Legend Group Corp. now holds ten percent of the international market in the sales of QDI [expansion unknown] personnel computer cards. "In the next two years, the Chinese Government will work out a series of policies, documents and regulations in order to help the non-governmental technological enterprises grow in a healthy, sustainable, rapid manner, bringing them into the international market in a big way," Hui said.
