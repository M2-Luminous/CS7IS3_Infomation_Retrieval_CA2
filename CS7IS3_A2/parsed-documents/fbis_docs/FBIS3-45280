In Guangzhou today, more and more enterprises under various economic ownerships are taking shape, including over 6,000 foreign-funded enterprises. They make labor-capital relations more complex, according to Du Meixian, vice president of the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions. To effectively protect the interests of both sides, the city government is hammering out relevant regulations and setting up supervision and arbitration organizations. Trade unions inside enterprises are playing their part in mediating disputes. In 1993, the city government worked out a decree which set the minimum worker's salary at 250 yuan a month. On the other hand, the city advocates workers associating themselves more closely with the rise and fall of their enterprises. Every year, the city will commend a large number of outstanding workers, factory directors, company managers and trade union leaders.
