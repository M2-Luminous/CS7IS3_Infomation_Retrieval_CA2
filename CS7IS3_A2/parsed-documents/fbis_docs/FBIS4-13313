[Khaz'al] Good evening Nawwaf. [Nabbari] Reports from Muscat say last-minute difficulties prevented issuing a final joint statement on the negotiations within the Water Affairs Committee. [Khaz'al] Yes, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs Committee meetings. A final statement was scheduled to be issued at 1400 today, at 1300 Jerusalem time, but the journalists were asked to gather again at 2000 Muscat time, 1900 Jerusalem time, that is one hour from now to hear the final statement. At the same time, international telephone lines and faxes have been busy for the past four hours between Muscat, Amman, Washington, and Tunis in a bid to find an outlet for the crisis caused by 'Ali al-Gazzawi, Jordan's representative to the Water Affairs Committee, when he rejected the final statement of the water committee's fifth round of talks to protest the continuation of the inspection of ships heading to the Jordanian Port of al-'Aqabah by the U.S-led allies. Head of the U.S. delegation John Herbst who heads this committee stemming from the multilateral talks, seeks to unanimously approve the final statement, and rejects the Jordanian reservations. The Americans want the Jordanians to remain an active partner in the multilateral negotiations because it is an important party to the peace process. A short while ago, the Palestinian delegation cabled PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis asking him to intervene with the Jordanian Government to abandon its opposition to the final statement, because this statement includes great gains to the Palestinians, including welcoming the formation the national water authority, and implementation of a number of projects in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, proposed by the United States, Israel, Austria, and Germany. These projects are able to overcome the water crisis from which the West Bank and Gaza Strip still suffer. The Omani delegation did not hide its dissatisfaction with the Jordanian position, especially since the Sultanate of Oman considers the convening of the Water Affairs Committee in Muscat a first-class international gain. The evidence on this is the broad international media coverage of the committee meetings in Muscat. They expect here that the fraternal and warm relations between King Husayn and Sultan Qabus would rescue the multilateral negotiations--in other words the prestige of the Omani sultan is being tested. Likewise the sea water desalination center in Muscat is now in danger. Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Amman, as we knew, is playing a role in convincing the Jordanian Government to approve the final statement, which includes several proposals on implementation of the projects on which it was agreed. A while ago, the Israeli and Palestinian delegations agreed that even if Jordan continues to oppose the final statement, all joint projects will be implemented, including replacing old water networks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and organizing courses on administering and rationalizing water, as Israel proposed. The Palestinian and Israeli delegations will ask the donor states to finance these projects in spite of Jordan's reservations. In other words, there is a crisis in the Water Affairs Committee talks in Muscat, contacts are going on, and it is expected to reach a solution to this crisis nearly one hour from now, at 2000 Muscat time, 1900 Jerusalem time, and the final statement is expected then to be announced on the joint projects that will be implemented in the water field.
