He said he was pleased at the government's approval of the method of sales of Army buildings worth about 1 billion korunas ($34,5 million). The Czech Army will get rid of this property either by transferring them free of charge to municipalities, in exchange for flats, or by selling them through real estate agencies, Baudys said. The Army has been selling unnecessary buildings because it is impossible for it to continuously earmark soldiers for guarding them and money for their maintenance, Baudys explained.
