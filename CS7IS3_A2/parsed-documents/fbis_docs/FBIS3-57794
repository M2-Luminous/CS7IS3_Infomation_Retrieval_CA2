Referring to the country's unemployment level -- 3.3 million or 12 percent of the active population -- he said there could be "no healthy economy without social cohesion." It was "intolerable to stand by while powerful companies get rich, which is good in itself, while the workers and those ensuring the success can be thrown out of work at any moment," he said. In a speech broadcast on national radio and television, he called for French workers and labour unions to join the government in establishing the "basis of a new social contract for work" as soon as possible. He lamented that 1993 had led to Western countries "to live in a system whose logic is increasingly untenable for the weakest." There was no guarantee that "economic revival which we are being told about will spark a decline in unemployment," he said. In particular he said the "peoples of the east" were being given cause "to doubt the benefits of liberty" by the economic hardship they were having to suffer. In this regard he lamented the continuing unrest and tensions in former eastern bloc countries. "1993 will leave us with images of blood and death, with Sarajevo as the symbol of marytred people," he said. On a more positive note, he said the past year had also seen "peace in Cambodia, the end of apartheid in South Africa, talks opened between Israel and the Palestinians," and "for us, the birth of the European Union."
