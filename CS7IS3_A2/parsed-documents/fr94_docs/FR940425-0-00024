FR940425-0-00024 FR940425-0-00016 PART 94_PRIVATE OPERATIONAL-FIXED MICROWAVE SERVICE 1. The authority citation in part 94 continues to read: Authority: Secs. 4, 303, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 94.59 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), and (f) and removing the undesignated text following paragraph (f) to read as follows: §94.59 Transition of the 1.85&hyph;1.99, 2.13&hyph;2.15, and 2.18&hyph;2.20 GHz bands from Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service to emerging technologies. (a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging technologies (ET Licensees) may negotiate with Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the Existing Licensees would relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other media, or alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the ET Licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may also negotiate agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated. (b) Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service licensees, with the exception of public safety facilities defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology service (two-year voluntary negotiation period), and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations (one-year mandatory negotiation period) or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations (one-year mandatory negotiation period). When it is necessary for an emerging technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply. Public safety facilities defined in paragraph (f) of this section will maintain primary status in these bands until four years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology service (four-year voluntary negotiation period), and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee or an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations (one-year mandatory negotiation period). * * * * * (f) Public safety facilities subject to the four-year voluntary and one-year mandatory negotiation periods, are those that the majority of communications carried are used for police, fire, or emergency medical services operations involving safety of life and property. The facilities within this exception are those part 94 of this chapter facilities currently licensed on a primary basis pursuant to the eligibility requirements of §90.19 of this chapter, Police Radio Service; §90.21 of this chapter, Fire Radio Service; §90.27 of this chapter, Emergency Medical Radio Service; and subpart C of part 90 of this chapter, Special Emergency Radio Services. Licensees of other part 94 facilities licensed on a primary basis under the eligibility requirements of part 90, subparts B and C of this chapter, are permitted to request similar treatment upon demonstrating that the majority of the communications carried on those facilities are used for operations involving safety of life and property. 3. Section 94.65 is amended by revising paragraph (g) to read as follows: §94.65 Frequencies. * * * * * (g) 3,700 to 4,200 MHz. 20 MHz maximum authorized bandwidth. 20 MHz bandwidth channels: ␣ 1Transmit (receive) (MHz) 1Receive (transmit) (MHz) 3710 3750 3730 3770 3790 3830 3810 3850 3870 3910 3890 3930 3950 3990 3970 4010 4030 4070 4050 4090 4110 4150 4130 4170 n/a 14190 1This frequency may be assigned for unpaired use. * * * * * 4. Section 94.81 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §94.81 Authorization of microwave equipment. * * * * * (c) After July 15, 1996, the manufacture (except for export) or importation of equipment employing digital modulation techniques in the 3700&hyph;4200, 5925&hyph;6425, 6525&hyph;6875, 10,550&hyph;10,680, and 10,770&hyph;11,700 MHz bands must meet the minimum payload capacity requirements of §21.122(a)(3) of this chapter.
