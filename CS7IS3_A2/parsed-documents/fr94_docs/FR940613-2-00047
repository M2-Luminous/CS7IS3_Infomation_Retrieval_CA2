SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Historical Background Mutual savings institutions were founded to fill gaps in the market_and for a social purpose. Commercial banks have not always welcomed retail customers as either depositors or borrowers. Mutual savings banks were in many respects charitable organizations designed to encourage and facilitate thrift on the part of urban wage-earners. Their trustees were self-perpetuating groups of leading citizens, some of whom may have contributed the capital to establish the bank in the first place, who took no fees and did no business with the bank. Savings and loan associations were essentially cooperatives. One became a ``member'' in order to save_in order eventually to borrow the money to build a home. There were limitations on the ability to withdraw one's funds. The right to be the next borrower, when enough funds had accumulated, was often decided by lot. Trustees were elected by the members_and in the early days members were required to attend meetings and take their turn as officers. The notion of ``self-help'' motivated both sorts of formations. At one time, people spoke of the spread of these institutions as a ``movement.'' As a legacy of that tradition, today there are approximately 1,100 mutuals in the United States. (Ten years ago there were about 2,500, five years ago 1,775.) From time to time, one or another of them desires to convert to stock form. It may be that they need more capital_in some cases on an urgent basis. It may be that they see expansion opportunities and need a currency (stock) with which to acquire. For many small institutions, it makes sense to join a larger organization, and they often need to convert to be able to do so. Based on our own research and analysis, as well as published cases, there is also little question that some institutions have converted primarily to enrich those who controlled them.
