Local people said a rocket was fired from a car parked across the street from Connelly House in the Andersonstown Road. Sinn Fein said the missile went through an upstairs window and exploded in an office, parts of the warhead imbedding themselves in a wall. No one was in the building at the time, but a Sinn Fein spokesman said a meeting of party members had been due to start there soon afterwards. Last Monday, a booby-trapped grenade, planted by the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters, was defused at the security gate outside the building. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams visited the scene soon after the attack and accused the security forces of collusion in today's attack and others on Sinn Fein members in recent years. "Loyalist death squads are operating with a high degree of intelligence information on individuals, offices and the movement of Crown forces patrols," he said. He insisted Sinn Fein would not be intimidated or deterred by the attacks from its search for peace. He claimed recent attacks were carried out with weapons provided to loyalists by British intelligence. [passage omitted]
