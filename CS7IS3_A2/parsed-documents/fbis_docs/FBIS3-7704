The reason that Morihiro Hosokawa met two figures from whom he had become somewhat distant after he won government power was probably not because he foresaw a situation verging on the brink of failure, but because of a feeling of uneasiness. It was late in the year [1993] when Hosokawa humbly invited Noboru Takeshita, who resigned from the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] after being questioned about his relationship with Kominto [right-wing group] and appeared to be shut out from Nagata-cho [prime minister's official residence]. In an attempt to escape from the one-man axis of Ichiro Ozawa (secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]), is it eventually this man that enters everyone's mind? [Hosokawa] The reason that I have met with you today is because the Ministry of Finance [MOF] is strongly against separating tax reduction from the consumer tax. At this rate the budget cannot be planned. Your assistance will be appreciated. [Takeshita]It is quite difficult. The MOF wants a clause inserted stipulating that the deficit will be made up by the consumer tax regardless of how many years later it is. However, I will try to talk to them. [Hosokawa]I would also like to ask your advice regarding economic stimulus measures. [Takeshita]Naito has submitted his resignation, so nothing can be done about it; but I cannot approve of others doing the same thing. Hosokawa persevered with the SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan], which tended to dissociate itself from the administration concerning political reform and the rice market under the cause of "preserving the coalition." However, with the final stretch of political reform and the planning of the next fiscal budget overlapped, he is faced with the gravest crisis since the advent of his administration. The reason is that, even if bold steps are taken to reduce tax for business recovery, when he makes his intention clear to raise the consumer tax as a source of tax reduction, they might really drop out of the coalition. There is a saying that "there are limits to one's endurance" (the SDPJ left-wing faction). The separation between tax reduction and the consumer tax is based on advice by Kiichi Miyazawa at a meeting in Karuizawa last summer. However, aside from Miyazawa who is a financial expert, the MOF, which advocates sound finance, would not agree with Hosokawa regardless of his efforts. It would not give an inch even if Hosokawa, Chairman Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito (deputy prime minister and foreign minister), and Chairman Koshiro Ishida of Komeito (director of the Managenement and Coordination Agency) all acted in unison. If so, whatever Ichiro Ozawa may think, there is no alternative except to depend on Takeshita who has practical clout with the MOF. Takeshita criticized the firing of Masahisa Naito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], for favoritism concerning personnel changes, and he casually warned: "It will not do to continue such firings." Although the truth cannot be verified, it is rumored that Kyosuke Shinozawa, director of the Budget Bureau of the MOF, and Hisakazu Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, could become the second and third "Naitos." Ozawa may be displeased if it were said that everything is based on Ozawa's suggestions, but the LDP's view is that it is not unrelated to Ichiro Ozawa's concept of "controlling the bureaucracy" to suppress the bureaucracy by broadly introducing a "political appointment system" for the positions of vice ministers and parliamentary councillors. The former Soviet Communist Party used to deploy its party cadres to battleships in order to control the powerful "Red Army." There is a view that Ozawa may be imitating this strategy. It is said that, unlike Jiro Saito, administrative vice minister who is friendly with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinozawa is close to Ryutaro Hashimoto, Ozawa's rival. However, Saito and Shinozawa have worked as a team for many years in the budget field, and there is reason to doubt that they will be targeted. As for Kuriyama, he once angered Ozawa by admonishing him to "think like an adult" when the latter strongly advocated rearguard support for the multinational forces against Iraq as part of Japan's international contribution when Ozawa was LDP secretary general. It is a matter of opinion as to whether this fuss is seen as incidental or as a link in the subjugation of the bureaucracy. It appears at least that public opinion has sided with MITI minister Hiroshi Kumagai who fired Naito. "In the United States, a mass change of the bureaucracy takes place with a new president."Although unrelated to MITI personnel moves, upper house member Sadao Hirano, Ichiro Ozawa's confidant, stresses the need to probe into the bureaucracy which has become rigid following political reform. However, Takeshita cites the bygone struggle between the "Seiyukai" [Constitutional Party of Political Friends] and "Minseito" [Constitutional Democratic Party] parties which even replaced policemen with changes in the administration, thus throwing national politics into chaos, and he asks that the morale of the bureaucracy not be damaged. Told To "Cut Takemura" Following this meeting, Hosokawa visited an elderly and long-time friend. [Hosokawa] It has been some time since I last saw you." [Friend] You seem to be working very hard. [Hosokawa] At the end of last year [1993], Ichiro Ozawa whom you know came alone to see me and strongly demanded: "Are you going to choose me or choose Takemura?" His point was: "Cut Takemure, or I will not cooperate." I believe that is why Ozawa announced his decision to take a leave of absence." The elderly friend facing Hosokawa was Yoshitaka Yotsumoto, president of Sanko Construction Industry. He once held a Zen session with Yasuhiro Nakasone, who was the prime minister like Hosokawa, and taught him how to control his mind as a person engaged in politics. After becoming involved in the Ketsumeidan [Blood Brotherhood Society] incident, he became friends with Kantaro Suzuki, the prime minister toward the end of the war. He was also secretary to Fumimaro Konoye, Hosokawa's grandfather, and talked with Konoye at his villa in Mt. Hakone immediately prior to the latter's suicide. After the war, aside from Kakuei Tanaka, he was spiritual adviser to numerous prime ministers including Shigeru Yoshida. Noboru Takeshita followed Nakasone in seeking his advice on various occasions. It was Hosokawa's first assignment as a reporter for the ASAHI SHIMBUN in Kagoshima Prefecture when he met Yotsumoto and became devoted to him, praising him as "the most respectable person I know." Encouragement From Yoshitaka Yotsumoto "That is nothing." Yotsumoto talked about the past: "During the Kishi cabinet, Bamboku Ono who greatly disliked Eisaku Sato, Nobusuke Kishi's younger brother, demanded that Kishi `cut Eisaku Sato.' "In those days, Kishi was weak-kneed and promised anything to save his administration. I joined with Ryugo Hashimoto, Ryutaro Hashimoto's father and a great man, to scold and encourage Kishi to `absolutely not cut Sato.' "An interesting episode is written in Bamboku Ono's Memoirs. Ono removed Hirokichi Nadao as the minister of posts and telecommunications in the fifth Yoshida cabinet and appointed Juichiro Tsukada, his follower, to the post. "However, there are a lot of shrewd people in this world. A man phoned Tsukada to tell him triumphantly: `I recommended you for minister and it was successful.' I hate to mention the name of the caller, but his name is was Eisaku Sato. "Speaking of Sato, I recall cooperating with Ichiro Kono to give another chance as justice minister to Ken Inukai, who had spoiled his chance as the justice minister due to his use of authority in connection with the shipbuilding scandals. However, the prime minister absolutely refused. I learned later that it was strongly opposed by Sato whose own political life was spared due also to the exercise of authority." It is an episode that illustrates the bad relations between Ono and Sato. After relating the above, Yotsumoto encouraged Hosokawa, saying: "That is that. There is nothing for to you to fear. You must do what you think is right." Yotsumoto has always contended that a leader must make decisions without consulting anyone. "If you act according to what someone tells you, the person who tells you will become the leader." He is telling Hosokawa, who is at an impasse concerning political reform and shows signs of desperation: "If you move ahead prepared for cabinet dissolution and a general election, it is the LDP that will suffer. In other words, a breakthrough can be made by grappling with the problem through conviction. One Cannot Cross a Bridge Without Taking Risks Yotsumoto acts swiftly. After the meeting with Hosokawa, he immediately called Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, with whom he is on intimate terms. Yotsumoto, who thinks that Takemura will someday become prime minister, quoted his friend Eizaburo Nishibori, commander of the first Antarctic winter expedition, who said: "A bridge cannot be crossed by avoiding risks," counseled Takemura as follows: "Hosokawa has crossed a bridge by not being cautious. Your job is to be extremely cautious and supportive. In doing so, relations between the two of you will never go sour. The coalition is sustained by the heads of the seven parties and factions joining hands, and the administration could be dismantled by a single defector. Despite such a fragile administration, it seems rash to demand that a choice be made between the options of choosing or not choosing Ichiro Ozawa. However, from the standpoint of a strategy of unifying the coalition into a single party and demoting the LDP from a "mammoth party" to an "ordinary party," the fight with Masayoshi Takemura who, given the opportunity, wishes to revive an administration centered on the LDP by joining with the LDP reform faction, transcends a mere struggle over leadership and is a struggle over direction itself. That is why "Masayoshi Takemura is said to have replaced Nakasone as Ichiro Ozawa's real enemy." The lack of a clear perspective concerning the political reform bill overlapped with this confrontation that pressures have swiftly built for dissolution. Hosokawa himself is reportedly prepared to use his trump card as a last resort and to be the toughest hardliner. Shinseito's Declaration for Dissolution Within the Shinseito, Moriyoshi Sato called the younger members together and declared: "Dissolution will surely come. Mr. Kanemaru also says so." Borrowing Kanemaru's words is typical of Sato who was Kanemaru's close associate. Shin Kanemaru, former LDP deputy prime minister who was indicted on suspicion of violating the income tax law (tax evasion), moved from Azabu, Tokyo, to his home district of Shirane-cho in Yamanashi Prefecture; however, Sato visits Kanemaru from time to time to comfort him. Sato emphasizes that, if political reform is crushed, public criticism will focus on the LDP and it will inevitably suffer defeat. Like being alarmed by the flapping wings of waterfowl, its members will waver and scramble to abandon the LDP. The party may split even further. The "sleeping lion" called the "considered rejection" in Article 59, paragraph 4 of the Constitution suddenly arose and loomed menacingly. The gist is as follows: If the upper house receives a bill but does not offer a decision within 60 days, the lower house "will consider it to be rejected by the upper house," and if the lower house reapproves it by a special two-thirds majority, it can enact the bill. The aim of the legislation is to prevent sabotage by the upper house. If the stipulation is invoked, the upper house would be powerless. The aim is not to invoke the stipulation, but to offer the LDP an opportunity to realize political reform and to try to force it to take a "loyalty test." It probably implies that "If you agree with political reform, prove it by your action." Therefore, if it opposes it, it must clarify its stand before the people and move toward dissolution. This will be painful. The reason the upper house can openly call for political reform is simply that the upper house does not have to worry about dissolution. However, former Defense Agency Director General Keisuke Nakanishi who attended the meeting rebutted: "Despite what is said, can you really win?" It may sound plausible to say that a solution will be reached through dissolution and a general election, but it is not certain whether victory or defeat will result from a general election. From Nakanishi's viewpoint, holding a general election based on the current medium-size constituency system would merely play into the hands of the LDP. Providing the backdrop for the threat to push dissolution and a general election is the high rate of support for the Hosokawa cabinet. A shadow has begun to appear in the support for the cabinet. A blade with a sharp cutting edge could end up cutting the holder if things go wrong. One source of apprehension is that the empirical rule concerning elections called the "pendulum principle" may come into play. If a sense of disappointment grows that, although it caused the LDP an overwhelming defeat, the Hosokawa cabinet itself has done nothing to boast of, the votes could revert to the LDP. Runner-Up's Resilience Another point is the "resilience of the runnerup." The LDP had as many as 36 runners-up in the general election in July 1993. Beware of these "second-place candidates." In the 1990 general election, 45 of the 73 candidates who were in second place in the previous general election garnered wins (61.6 percent). In the LDP, 23 of the 31 previous runners-up (74.2 percent) were elected. A simple comparison cannot be made because of replacements among LDP members. However, according to this theory, at least 20 or more comebacks will be possible if a general election is held on a medium-constituency basis. The LDP currently holds 222 seats, which is 34 short of a majority (256 seats). Therefore, it cannot achieve a majority unless all of the previous runners-up win. Consequently, while it will not be easy for the LDP to regain ruling power, the presence of Sakigake must not be forgotten. Rather than Sakigake itself, it is the presence of its leader, Masayoshi Takemura, who is competing against Ichiro Ozawa. Assuming that the LDP succeeds in gaining a total that is 10 seats short of a majority, the choice by Sakigake (12 seats) can be decisive. Although it is said that Sakigake will not be so foolish as to assist the LDP's restoration to power, if the Sakigake should entice the LDP by making a drastic request concerning political reform and economic reform, a coalition between the LDP and Sakigake cannot be ruled out. At this point, the LDP will probably accept anything. It will be much more expedient than tottering toward reform. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that Ichiro Ozawa would stand by idly. In fact, he is said to have already made advances to Sakigake and to have tried to persuade a number of members, except Takemura, to come to Shinseito. That is probably why he requested "Takemura's transfer." On Yotsumoto's advice, Takemura visited Ozawa early on the morning of New Year's Day, bowed his head, and sought to heal their differences. He was probably determined to endure in order to reverse his fortunes in the future. Kono With No Trump Cards On 6 January 1994, LDP President Yohei Kono et al gathered at the LDP headquarters for a New Year's party. Kono spotted Takushi Hirai, chairman of the joint houses general council and head of the upper house, and told him: "The rest is up to the upper house. I hope you will do your best." Kono probably intended it to be a New Year's greeting. However, Hirai did not interpret it that way. "President, you asked me to do my best, but how and concerning what am I to do my best? Please give me some direction. Are you saying that I should crush political reform at this stage, or what do you ask me to amend? I cannot do anything unless I have some direction." At this rebuttal, Kono remained silent. However, the situation changed abruptly. The SDPJ, the Achilles' heel of the coalition, has finally exposed its weakness. The recent split in the SDPJ appears to be virtually irreparable. The future of political reform has suddenly become murky. Across-the-board resignations or dissolution of the lower house? Regardless of the twists and turns, the ultimate result will inevitably be one or the other. Political reform can only be postponed for the time being. However, everyone knows that the public is not so naive as to let it pass unheeded. Already "political reform" in another sense with "political restructuring" in mind is on the rise.
