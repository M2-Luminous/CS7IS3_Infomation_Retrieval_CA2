FBIS4-4763 "dreas065_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Thailand Evidence Shows Russian Diplomat Left Country Evidence Shows Russian Diplomat Left Country BK0504045994 Bangkok THE NATION in English 5 Apr 94 p A4 BK0504045994 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Metropolitan police have insisted that missing Russian diplomat Igor Makeyev has left Thailand after they were criticized for releasing the information to the press. "The evidence I have received indicates that Igor has most probably left Thailand," said metropolitan police commissioner Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Chaiyasit Kanchanakit, who is overseeing the search for the Russian Embassy's missing third secretary. Chaiyasit said deputy commissioner Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Thawi Thiprat, who is investigating the case, told him yesterday that Makeyev's credit card records confirm he had visited the Limelight Restaurant, in Bangkok's Patpong Road red-light district, and where he had been spotted with a friend Van Nappier [not further identified] on March 19. Chaiyasit had previously listed the date as March 23. According to Thawi, Nappier told police that Makeyev planned to go abroad, after first sending his family back to Russia. A search of Makeyev's Soi Saladaeng apartment in Bangkok revealed that his wife and daughter had moved out, Thawi said. "But police are checking with the Immigration Division for further evidence that Makeyev has left the country, when he did, by what airline and to what destination," he said. Neither Makeyev nor his laptop computer have been seen since March 22.
