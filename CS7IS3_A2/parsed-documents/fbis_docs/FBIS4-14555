This was the opinion expressed by the head of state's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, at today's briefing in the Kremlin. Asked about the possibility of Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy coming to power, Vyacheslav Kostikov remarked on "the amorality of such an alternative" to the president in office. Furthermore, he stressed, "the very thought of their coming to power lowers the hurdles of political morals in Russia because people with the mentality of hooligans and foul-mouths should not become presidents of a great power." The head of state's press secretary expressed regret at the fact that militant appeals made recently and being made today by the persons mentioned seemed to pass by those set on seeing Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy become president.
