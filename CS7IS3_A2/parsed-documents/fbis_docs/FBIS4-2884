Shen Guofang said that China has not yet received the full text of the report and that a detailed comment would be made following a full study of the report. On the question of the British side's request for a dialogue with China on human rights, Shen replied that the Chinese Government is always ready to maintain contact with the British side based on equal footing and mutual respect. At the same time, China also maintains contacts with many other countries on the question of human rights. China holds that the concept of human rights covers a great deal of ground. The Chinese Government has declared on numerous occasions that it abides by the World Declaration on Human Rights and will make its due contribution to defending human rights and basic freedoms. China is willing to carry out international cooperation on human rights.
