FR940926-0-00081 FR940926-0-00015 Section 7 contains the requirement that passengers be briefed (in addition to §§91.102 and 135.117) before takeoff for an air tour flight with a flight segment beyond the ocean shore of any island. The briefing shall include information on water ditching procedures, use of personal flotation gear, and emergency egress from the aircraft. The PIC must orally brief passengers, distribute written instructions, or ensure that passengers have been briefed on emergency procedures. This provision is necessary in light of the flotation equipment requirements set forth in this emergency rule. Related Rulemaking This SFAR is an emergency final rule addressing air tour operations in the State of Hawaii in light of the increasing frequency of accidents. The FAA is considering other rulemaking action to address noise and other issues concerning sightseeing overflights in national parks and other scenic areas. On March 17, 1994, the FAA and the National Park Service (NPS) issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) (59 FR 12740) seeking public comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory actions to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks. The FAA is currently analyzing comments submitted in response to the ANPRM. This SFAR is an emergency rule and not a final action in response to the joint FAA/NPS ANPRM. The promulgation of requirements and restrictions in this SFAR, including the minimum flight altitude restriction, does not preclude the FAA from revisiting the issues addressed in the SFAR. As mentioned above, changes to this SFAR may be necessitated after a review of the comments received from related regulatory proposals. Additionally, this SFAR may be amended after consideration of the comments received on this SFAR. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 et. seq.). Regulatory Evaluation Summary Introduction Changes to Federal regulations are required to undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. With respect to this rule, the FAA has determined that it: (1) is ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is significant as defined in the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. Therefore, a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost-reducing alternatives to this rule, has been prepared. This regulatory evaluation summary presents a concise analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the final rule that amends the Federal Aviation Regulations by establishing certain operational, procedural, and equipment requirements for air tour operators in the State of Hawaii. Costs The FAA estimates the total cost of the SFAR to be about $2.0 million, with a present value of $1.8 million (7 percent discount rate), from 1995 to 1997. The FAA assumes that air tour operators will elect to have lifevests on board the helicopter rather than installing external flotation gear because the costs are dramatically lower. This present value cost includes the cost of about $190,000 to provide lifevests on the affected helicopters; the potential of $1.6 million in lost revenue to air tour operators due to minimum flight altitudes; and $10,000 for the development of a helicopter performance plan. Other requirements of the rule_helicopter operating limitations and passenger briefing_will impose little if any cost.
