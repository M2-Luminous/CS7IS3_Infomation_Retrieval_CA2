Who buys these tickets of support? We asked spokesman Andras Toth. [Toth] The idea comes from the British Labor Party, and there are decades of tradition behind it here. We "sell" these tickets of support in our citizens' forums and in our local organizations. So far, the typical supporter is a party member or sympathizer with a small income, often a retired person, who gives us one or two hundred forints. A few have given us 50,000 forints and their names will be made public, in keeping with the party law, in our end-of-the-year accounting. [MN] How large is the sum that has been received so far? [Toth] About 1.2 million forints in Budapest. We think that the MSZP will be able to collect a good part of 25 million forints. The first nationwide reckoning is expected in March. Incidentally, one-half of the received sum is earmarked for our local organizations, and one-half for our central budget. [MN] How much money are the socialists using for the campaign? So far Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] is the only party that has announced that its national committee has approved 18 million forints for the campaign. [Toth] I cannot give an unequivocal answer to this, but this much is certain, that we will not spend more than the above amount either, and financial factors will not dominate our campaign. [MN] Do you mean that since it is well-organized, the party will substitute the communal work of its activists for money? [Toth] Yes, because after all the middle-class type of party is, by virtue of the way it is structured, geared to elections, while the social democratic, left-wing type of party, which the MSZP is, functions continuously and so has at its disposal a significant activist network. In the course of the campaign we will emphasize low-level work, and it is certain that our members and sympathizers will be happy to take our flyers to people's houses so that we will not have to use the services of the post office. The socialists presented their education program in their Thursday media club. [MSZP] vice president Gyorgy Janosi stressed that it is one of the most important goals of the party to modify, even if only in the long term, the inequality of opportunity that is presently noticeable. To achieve this, it is necessary to have a flexible, penetrable educational system as well as autonomous schools. In its program the MSZP considers the so-called sector-neutral education financing system to be the good one, independently of who runs the school, since the sum used for this purpose is a right of the student by virtue of citizenship. The party considers it very important that the state ensure teachers' wages from the central budget, without burdening local governments.
