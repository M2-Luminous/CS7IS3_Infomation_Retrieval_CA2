The agreement has recently been signed with the Russian government. Afterwards, the Agrarians will make their final decision whether or not to sign the treaty on civil accord. This was announced by Deputy Chairman of the Agrarian Union, Gennadiy Kulik. The union includes Russia's biggest agricultural enterprises. Kulik suggested that this meeting was needed since none of the signatories had as yet seen the final text of the document. That is why the Agrarian Party, the Agrarian Union and the Agricultural Trade Union wanted to make sure if the government had accepted all their demands. In particular, the Agrarians insisted that the government included into the treaty a number of obligations in order to prevent forceful pressure on farmers when choosing forms of property, to ensure Russia's independence in food supply and to support the agricultural regions with 10 or 15 percent of the budget expenses. Several other conditions have also been put forward. The agreement was signed on April 30 on the day after the ceremony of signing of the treaty on civil accord in the Kremlin. The Agrarian leaders did not take part in the ceremony.
