How are the Armed Forces celebrating it and what does this holiday mean for them? [Kokoshin] Of course, they are celebrating the holiday in a solemn manner, in accordance with the rituals that have taken shape in the Soviet Army and those new ones that have appeared in the Russian Army. Our pre-revolutionary army traditions are being vigorously revived in symbols and in the traditions of officers' assemblies. But what I regard as extremely important is the spirit of victory and of victors. You know, we need the spirit of 1945 today, too, but in peaceful life. We need much more self-confidence and we must believe that we will create a powerful and prosperous economy with armed forces that correspond to our needs, armed forces that would be part of a civil democratic society. These armed forces will be powerful enough to be formidable, while posing a threat to nobody. I think that herein lies, perhaps, the meaning of our great holiday of Victory Day which, I am sure, will be celebrated 100, 200, 300, and even 500 years from now, because this was our country's and people's hour of true glory. This was a great day of victory over the darkest forces of Nazism that ever existed in human history. I hope this will never be forgotten. Ours is a long-suffering people but by its sufferings it redeemed the fate of today's developed and prosperous states, and we should be one of them.
