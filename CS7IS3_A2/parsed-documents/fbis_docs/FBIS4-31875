FBIS4-31875 "dreeu116__a94002" FBIS-EEU-94-116-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Foreign Ministry on Upcoming FYROM Census Foreign Ministry on Upcoming FYROM Census AU1506145294 Sofia BTA in English 1325 GMT 15 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1506145294 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- European standards concerning the free expression of national identity are much higher than those operative in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] which are likely to be applied in the forthcoming census there, Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaykov told a news conference here today. The official documents on the forthcoming census (to be taken June 21-July 5) mention a choice of seven nationalities, including even Turkish and Egyptian, but no Bulgarian. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that prior to the census the government of Macedonia should take the necessary steps to secure free expression for all its citizens, in line with European standards. Bulgaria will take a stand on the results accordingly. Bulgaria follows with great interest the process of democratization in Macedonia and supports its efforts to join the community of free and democratic states, Mr. Vlaykov pointed out. He reminded that Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of Macedonia and clearly declared its willingness for close cooperation. It makes efforts to assist Macedonia's integration with the international community and the recognition of its independence. Bulgaria's efforts to help Macedonia overcome its economic difficulties are no secret, either, he added. Only 1,500 Bulgarians were registered in Macedonia in the latest census. In the forms for the new one the Bulgarian nationality has not been included at all. The previous census was boycotted by the Albanians for the same reason. Now, unlike Bulgarians, they have been included in the forms. Mr. Ilija Ilijevski, leader of the Human Rights Party in Macedonia, told reporters in Sofia last week that Bulgarians will be deprived of the right to free expression of their national identity. He also pointed out that the census will be conducted in conditions of long-lasting violation of the human rights of Bulgarians in Macedonia and that the results will not be objective and reliable.
