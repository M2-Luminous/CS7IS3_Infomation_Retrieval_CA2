At a weekly press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin said, "At the moment, I can say that there is no preparation (to meet Kim Il-song)." Early this month some South Korean press reports said that Kim Il-song would visit China to observe economic reforms and that North Korean Party Secretary Hwang Chang-yop's recent visit to Beijing was to prepare for Kim's visit. Spokesman Wu said Hwang's visit was a scheduled tour and had nothing to do with any visit by Kim Il-song. "Kim's visit was not among the matters discussed between Hwang and Chinese officials," Wu said. He also voiced China's objection to the reported plan to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea. "We do not approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the Korean peninsula," he said. Wu further demanded the retraction of the U.S. plan to create "Radio Free Asia," calling it an act of interference in other's internal affairs. "The true purpose of the radio is to interfere in the internal affairs of and set off confusion in China and other Asian countries," Spokesman Wu said.
