Territory: 16,000 square km. Population: approximately 1.2 million. Main industrial sectors: oil production and refining, production of drilling rigs and automated control systems. Decline in industrial production in 1993: 25.7 percent, in the agro-industrial complex, 10 percent. The budget in 1993--R500 billion--was deficit-free. Main difficulties: the economic blockade on the part of Russia--frozen bank accounts, Chechnya has not received a single ruble for two years, and the Russian Federation's arrears for oil in 1993 constituted R30 billion. A government program, the emphasis in which was placed on self-reliance, was drawn up last year. Previously the oil industry constituted up to 80 percent of the total volume. Now approximately 3 million tonnes are being produced, and virtually no oil is being received for refining currently (potential for 20 million tonnes a year). The question of the temporary closedown of certain types of operations like, for example, the production of polyethylene, phenol, and certain types of oils is being studied. It is contemplated switching production to the manufacture of fuel ($6 million of equipment has been purchased). On account of the loss of sales markets, the Molot Plant, which used to supply all of Russia with drills, is switching to the manufacture of mini-rigs (trials are under way in the republic). The production of building materials and consumer goods in the republic has increased, which has afforded an opportunity, generally, to slow the decline in production. Agriculture. An increase in the numbers of livestock, poultry, and so forth is being stimulated in the private sector. The prices of agricultural products are free. In order to secure state supplies of grain, meat, milk, and vegetables the government has undertaken to pay up to an additional 30 percent per ruble of the price asked by the seller. The agro-industrial complex is in a reform phase--it is contemplated creating state farms in place of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (there will be no private ownership of the land). Average wages are R60,000 (payment has been held up for several months), pensions, R42,000. Of the R25 billion received by the National Bank in 1994, R17 billion have been channeled into the payment of pensions. But many retirees have received no money since August-September of 1993. The rational consumer basket costs R42,000. Officially registered unemployed: 200. From a SEGODNYA interview with Taymaz Abubakarov, minister of economics and finance of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. "The foundations of the USSR are in Chechnya, and Gorbachev and Lukyanov, who were unlawfully removed from power, could embark on the discharge of their duties here, therefore." [Gorodetskaya] Mr. President, how do you feel in the role of victor? Sergey Shakhray's resignation is being linked with his incorrect policy in the North Caucasus, in Chechnya particularly. [Dudayev] I do not feel that I am in the role of victor because I have never linked any issues with Shakhray either as a leader or as a politician or as a man. As you know, Chechnya has stated that we will negotiate with Russia only as a sovereign state--via the Foreign Ministry or between the presidents directly. [Gorodetskaya] Do you have prior conditions for such a meeting? [Dudayev] None. But groups of specialists should, naturally, meet in advance to prepare the meeting, particularly in respect to matters of protocol. [Gorodetskaya] What would you expect from a meeting with Boris Yeltsin? [Dudayev] Everything would, most likely, culminate in a communique, a joint statement. I do not believe that Yeltsin is ready as yet. More precisely, he himself is ready, perhaps, to make a decision, but his entourage and the branches of power are not yet prepared to adopt an unequivocal decision, and Yeltsin is not prepared to stand up for it. Today he has too many opponents who are prepared to destroy and make trouble, and no one has any desire to create. [Gorodetskaya] What economic questions specifically would you like to discuss at the negotiations? [Dudayev] We have a firm economic program. We have grabbed hold of the basis under the present conditions of the transitional period. We have substantiated production and the economy mathematically. [Gorodetskaya] Could you provide a little more detail? [Dudayev] Fragments of this program are now being considered overseas and have already been discussed with the top industrialists and billionaires. [Gorodetskaya] With possible investors, that is? [Dudayev] Yes, with possible investors that have taken the initiative and have already begun to embody it. The main issues are land, water, and oil. The Arab East is totally without water, and a liter of gasoline is now 2.5 times cheaper than a liter of water. We have water--eternal glaciers. I proposed that they run a pipeline from our glaciers. They agreed. Further, why should oil belong to the strong alone. It should belong to all regions and should be affordable at uniform prices to all regions and peoples. Armenia and Stavropol and so forth. I, as premier, have already taken control of the oil and am now protecting it against the petty thieves. [Gorodetskaya] Of what significance is the program for the North Caucasus? [Dudayev] It is of great significance for the entire former Soviet Union. All will have to repeat this. Everything should have a price, then there would be production. We should stop being lazy, therefore, and value everything: a cubic meter of sand in a quarry used for raw material, a cubic meter of oil, each tree, and only then calculate the finished product. Further, conduct a complete stock-taking, draw up the government contract, revise the taxation policy, and change the formula of formation of the budget. Only then will there be a normal economy and production in the primary phase. [Gorodetskaya] The Chechen opposition declares that the republic's economy has been completely destroyed. [Dudayev] You should not listen to the opposition because there simply is none. In order to guzzle down what they have plundered, commonplace petty thieves and looters, who committed crimes and took to their heels, have found a nice slot beneath the word "opposition." At the negotiations with the Russian Federation I shall attempt to raise the matter of the extradition of criminals that have become ensconced in Moscow and Russia. Two and a half years ago I myself made the statement that I would like to have a radical opposition that had its own program and engaged in political struggle by civilized methods. I missed such an opposition. The next day a statement was made to the effect that, well, you asked, we are born. Now, however, all the so-called members of the opposition have scattered. [Gorodetskaya] What about the opposition's claims that the Provisional Council completely controls Nadterechnyy Rayon. [Dudayev] I cannot say this. They make many claims, and there is a great deal that they want, but they have no programs, no vision of constitutional arrangement or legal base. Their desire is to push their people into the executive in order to grab an appetizing piece and run. They operate by wolves' methods--roundup, capture, pullback. [Gorodetskaya] Of what does your idea of the creation of a common Caucasus home consist? [Dudayev] I do not divide the Caucasus into either north or south or east. [Gorodetskaya] Regardless of religious belief? [Dudayev] Regardless of religious belief, of language. The Caucasus is one. The Almighty has already divided up the Earth, the peoples have settled apart. Man is the direct accessory of this land, its attribute. There are peoples that cannot settle, like the Gypsies, for example. But they once had their own land, Atlantis, maybe, which became submerged. They will wander until that land rises from the water to dry land or is released from beneath the ice. The Caucasus is a geopolitical point of the world. The Almighty did not create on this green sphere more favorable climatic or geopolitical conditions than in the Caucasus. There are here the most ancient civilizations and culture, and we need to reckon with this, not destroy but find the sources of man's real development. This is why I have a program for the integration of the economy. [Gorodetskaya] What is the reason for you choosing so distinctive a form of the solution of the land question--the land and its resources belong to the Almighty? [Dudayev] The land truly does not belong to man. Nothing would ever satisfy us. We must reconcile ourselves to the fact that nothing in this world belongs to us. Only the regulation of property relationships. Dividing up the land--man has not thought up anything more absurd. [Gorodetskaya] I was told that a lieutenant general of the Russian Air Force came and offered you his services. Is this true? [Dudayev] Yes, I have had such offers. I believe that there are gifted generals in Russia, we need merely to appreciate them, not kill off aviation and generals for politicking petty thieves. But I am convinced and have stated that restoring the defense shield of the USSR is not only essential but urgently necessary to prevent everything sliding into total collapse and utter hopelessness. [Gorodetskaya] It is said that you were, for all that, invited to restore this shield, that is, to head the CIS forces, and you have not declined? [Dudayev] No, I have not declined to head the CIS forces. But I do not want to be the head, it would suit me were such a leitmotiv to be put on a legal basis, and I would be merely a participant. It is not a matter of command, it is a matter of self-esteem, a matter of the need to restore the defense shield. [Gorodetskaya] How do you see the operations of a Russian or joint peacekeeping force, in Karabakh or in Yugoslavia, for example? [Dudayev] This is my profession, I know how to perform them. Withdraw all the troops, all the blues and greens, I would with a single regiment of mine without a single weapon ensure an end to the war in Yugoslavia, for example. [Gorodetskaya] How? [Dudayev] There is no need to commit there desperadoes in masks and helmets or to dangle trinkets if we have come to help and restore balance on humane, legal foundations. We need to go with the intent to make peace, but were just one of my subordinates to be killed, 100 heads in response. [Gorodetskaya] You constantly speak out against the United Nations, the Security Council. Are you not afraid of Chechnya finding itself isolated? [Dudayev] Of course it is isolated. International institutions of the United Nations type know full well that the Chechen have for 300 years now been a proving ground. Who has said a sympathetic word about us, not to mention words of protection. If they would at least leave out the vilification and provocations. It will reach the point where I also permit myself to reveal the mechanisms of international incidents. The present status of the United Nations is one of an entirely illegitimate formation organizing its activity on an unlawful basis. Let us start with the name--United Nations--but not all states are members. The UN Charter still contains the "hostile states" concept. [Gorodetskaya] Which states have recognized Chechnya? [Dudayev] Georgia was the first. We do not want to publicize these states as yet. Were I to need the recognition that the world community needs, I can assure you that I would obtain 10 acts of recognition in 10 days. But we do not need such recognition. Everyone at one time recognized Georgia. Where is the first lawfully elected president now? [Gorodetskaya] How do you view the fact that Ruslan Khasbulatov, the former speaker of the Russian parliament, is not only living in Chechnya but canvassing the people for the rapprochement of Chechnya and Russia? [Dudayev] If the people accept his campaign, I have nothing against such campaigning. [Gorodetskaya] I was told that approximately 200,000 Russians have left Groznyy. [Dudayev] Everyone is entitled. They have left, they are coming. [Gorodetskaya] But there are, after all, problems when it comes to skilled personnel. [Dudayev] A nation should be taught via difficulties. The main thing is that the right path be chosen. Spare me a legacy where all are scholars, and no one wants to work. [Gorodetskaya] Russia has been assailed as of late not only for what it has done but for unrepentance also. Were Russia to apologize to the peoples, the Chechen included, and give assurances that this would not recur, how would mutual relations be built? [Dudayev] How would it apologize, and what would follow--crocodile tears? Russia must cure itself. It must first guarantee its own state, its own statutes, and its own law and their efficacy and the viability and effectiveness of the branches of power. The State Duma is an illegitimate organ of power, no one knows what the Duma is, they thought up a Duma and went and dashed off to think. The Federation Council is a hybrid, and it is not known where this comes from. The authorities are not working, no branch of power is in control of the situation. There is collapse, robbery, and chaos, the economy has been completely destroyed, production has been halted. And Russia would guarantee? What? It cannot guarantee anything at home--they shot up the White House from large-caliber machine guns. There is no constitution. There is no law on citizenship, but everyone votes. Citizenship was taken away overnight. I have the right to say: "I am a citizen of the USSR, here is my USSR passport, by what right have I been deprived of it?" [Gorodetskaya] You believe that the USSR can be restored? [Dudayev] Restored, no, but renewing it and creating a new union is a real necessity. [Gorodetskaya] Would Chechnya join such a union? [Dudayev] We would join a legal union, but not an adventurist union. I believe that all the former republics would join. [Gorodetskaya] There was a fleeting report that Mikhail Gorbachev was invited to Groznyy to discharge the duties of president of the USSR. This was a false report, surely? [Dudayev] It was not. A research center placed documentary material on my desk. The government studied this material and concluded that the Chechen Republic is today the sole exponent of the legal base of the former USSR. Some 92 percent of citizens voted for preservation of the Union. We respect the right of the citizens. We rejected the ballot in the Russian Federation, we did not take part. The USSR passports have been preserved. We are guided by Union laws where they do not conflict with the laws of the republic. We are preparing a currency, and exclusively the notes issued on the territory of the Soviet Union will be valid on our territory. All the attributes of the USSR--the coat of arms and the anthem and the flag--are present in the office of the president and will soon be introduced as the official attributes of dual citizenship--of the USSR and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. The foundations of the USSR are in Chechnya, and Gorbachev and Lukyanov, who were unlawfully removed from office, could embark on the discharge of their duties here, therefore. We have not made official inquiries, merely made an offer. If they agree, we will remain the sole guarantors of the succession of the USSR. If they decline, even better. We could then assume the debts of the USSR. By all means, and we would guarantee that we would divide them equably among all republics and peoples of the USSR and pay them off.
