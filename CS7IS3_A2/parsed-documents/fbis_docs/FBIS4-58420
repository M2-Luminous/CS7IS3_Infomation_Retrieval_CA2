War Against Corruption MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FIGURE REFLECTS ON POLICE-ISLAMISTS WAR In a 3,000-word article on page 5, Muslim Brotherhood figure Dr. Ahmad al-Malat reflects on the "quagmire of bloodletting on the good Egyptian soil," between policemen who carry out officials' orders and young people who went astray. He remarks that: "The greatest disaster ever is that the bloodletting persists in the form of mutual vendetta, continuing executions, indiscriminate killing that makes no distinction between the innocent and the guilty, and the insistence on violence as the only approach against both policemen and young Islamists." Although we are pleased to see the policemen doing their noble duty of safeguarding the homeland's and the citizen's peace, we certainly disagree with them on the way they perform this duty because man is entitled to certain rights that should be preserved, he says. To explain this, he states that "mass arrests that make no distinction between the innocent and the guilty are prohibited and torturing and humiliating them is prohibited." He adds that mere suspicion does not provide enough justification for the police to do whatever they want unless they rely on that "repulsive emergency law, for which there is no equal in terms of cruelty, severity, and longevity elsewhere, except in this afflicted country." Referring sarcastically to the 23 July 1952 revolution and its leader, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, he says: "Dead and buried, the so-called blessed revolution has left the Egyptian people a heritage of humiliation and denigration, forcing them to walk in the shadow of the sole, inspired ruler and to worship in his temple rather than in the mosque of Islam." Al-Malat contends that "certain police groups" have committed themselves to fighting anything Islamic in nature. He notes that Muslim Brotherhood founder Imam Hasan al-Banna was assassinated by the guards of King Faruq of Egypt. He cites an interview with a former interior minister's assistant, which the magazine LIWA' AL-ISLAMI published in its April edition, in which he talks about police violence during interrogations. Moving to another point, al-Malat states that a "fierce war was launched against preachers" for fear that they might refute secularist claims. Some of the victims of that war, he says, were Shaykh Kishk, Shaykh Ahmad al-Mahallawi, and Shaykh 'Umar 'abd-al-Kafi. He says that the police silenced hundreds of those preachers and replaced them with men who do not even read the Koran properly. Promising the "second part" of his article on Tuesday, 3 May, al-Malat concludes with the Koranic verse 2-114: "And who is more unjust than he who forbids that in places for the worship of God, God's name should be celebrated? Whose zeal is to ruin them? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in this world, and in the world to come an exceeding torment." CHIEF EDITOR VOWS TO KEEP UP WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION The newspaper's chief editor, Majdi Ahmad Husayn, writes in his 2,000-word article on page 5 that "official complaints against AL-SHA'B continue in an obvious attempt to dissuade it from keeping up its determined line to fight corruption." He vows that the paper will not shift an inch from its position in spite of the scores of interrogations and the four cases filed against it. "It has become clear to all that it is not a matter of slander or defamation on the paper's part, but an attempt to silence every free and candid voice," he says. Noting the complaint the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority filed against the paper, he says that the authority chairman does not care about the billions of pounds the authority loses every year through human error, mismanagement, and fraud and only wants to defend himself and silence AL-SHA'B. Citing the Japanese and U.S. experience, Husayn stresses that issues involving public funds should be discussed in public. In conclusion, he writes: "There is no time for playing games. If this nation is to be rescued from its ordeal, the heads of corruption must be amputated and society must be cleansed. To do that, we have to pay the price and make sacrifices." AL-GHAZALI ON ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC SUPREMACY In his 400-word column on page 12, Muhammad al-Ghazali quotes Israel's founder, Ben-Gurion, as vowing that Israel would conquer Arab states with military supremacy, and if that was not possible it would conquer them with economic supremacy. He states that "Solomon's jinns" work around the clock to perfect the peace and war industry and that their products have invaded world markets. He admits that the Israeli skill in civilian and military production is not surprising because the plan to set up greater Israel is based on "a hardworking people who sweat in the field while neighboring, smooth-handed people indulge in luxury and their young men are deprived of firm religious guidance." Al-Ghazali notes that the Jewish experience in highly productive farming is being offered to Egypt, a country that has farmed the land for 50 centuries and to which the Jews fled tens of centuries ago to escape poverty and famine. He wonders what has happened to Arabs and Egypt to make them fail to exploit their lands and double their wealth. He affirms that the Egyptian youth are idle wealth and paralyzed talent who could surpass Jews if they were given the chance. He notes that deserting Islam has led to all this. Noting the killing of 16 "fundamentalists" near an Arab capital, he says: "We are only strong when we fight among ourselves as we compete for worldly luxury. But the distance is long between us and God's book and his prophet's tradition." ISLAMIST ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN JAILS Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus' 500-word column on page 12 states that the "violation of human rights is the major defect in Husni Mubarak's regime," which commits the most despicable acts against inmates in the al-'Aqrab, the scorpion, jail south of Cairo. He affirms that inmates in that prison are held in cells resembling cemetries and that they never see the sun. He adds that visits by family members, newspapers, letters, sports, bathing, airing of blankets, and going out of the cells are prohibited in that place. On top of all that, inmates are regularly insulted and humiliated, he adds, noting that this prison is a mark of disgrace on the regime. He finally calls on the authorities to wake up before it is too late. EDITORIAL CALLS FOR DRIVING OUT FOREIGN FORCES FROM SINAI A 400-word editorial on page 1 commemorates the 12th anniversary of Sinai's liberation and notes that U.S. forces, "better known as the multinational forces," are still present in Sinai. The editorial asks when these forces will leave and calls on all national powers to drive these forces out of Sinai. It calls on the government to use the Armed Forces to exploit the area. OPINION POLL SHOWS SHARI'AH CAN CURE ARMED VIOLENCE A 200-word report by Ahmad al-Siyufi on page 1 says that an opinion poll on armed violence conducted by the National Dialogue Committee at Asyut University has shown that 62.27 percent of university professors attribute violence to economic and social causes, widespread corruption, the conduct of the security forces, and insufficient religious education. The report says that 37.8 percent of professors attribute violence to foreign elements. The poll showed that 73.4 percent believe that the application of shari'ah is the right cure for violence. Asked about the causes of sectarian strife, 31.9 percent said the cause was foreign elements, 35 percent said it was the incorrect understanding of religion, 8.4 percent said it was the feeling of being persecuted, and 24.7 said it was the failure to apply shari'ah. The poll showed that 88 percent of professors believe that the existing parliamentary institutions do not represent the people properly, while 5.7 percent believe they do. WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION A 2,000-word report by 'Imad Mahjub on page 2 cites a report by the Central Accounting Organization on the abuse of public funds in Aswan Governorate, where a total of 635,249 pounds of the governorate's budget and the local development fund were spent on "guests" between January 1992 and May 1993. The report claims that Aswan Governor Salah Misbah used the development fund to buy gifts and entertain and accommodate guests at five-star hotels. The prime minister's private secretary was among these guests. Her birthday party at the Cataract Hotel in February and her golden birthday gift were financed by public funds. Other "guests" are mentioned in the report. A 3,000-word report by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman on page 2 gives an account of the "crimes" AL-SHA'B reporters have been accused of committing against the Suez Canal Authority and its chairman. Of these, he cites reports published earlier about violations in the Suez Canal expansion project, the electric control project, and the shipyard project. He promises to submit documents proving these violations to the attorney general. A 1,500-word report by 'Ali al-Qammash on page 3 writes about Nabil Mishriqi, better known in the press as Madinat al-Nasr Shark, who is getting special treatment in jail. He wears civilian clothes, strolls freely around the court, and even runs his business from his "five-star" prison cell. A 2,000-word report by 'Amir 'Id on page 3 writes about corruption in the North Alexandria Mills Company. A 1,500-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 deals with "big sharks" who seized 45,000 feddans [1.038 acres] of the most fertile arable land with the help of officials.
