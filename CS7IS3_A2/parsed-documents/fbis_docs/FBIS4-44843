The computer can perform 12.8 billion calculations per second. The German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) displayed Germany's fastest and most powerful mainframe computer in Goettingen on Friday. The head of the DLR Central Data Processing Division in Oberpfaffenhofen, Hans-Martin Wacker, put the NEC Corporation SX-3R supercomputer into operation following a test run lasting several months. The mainframe, which was installed in the DLR institute in Goettingen in September of last year, is one of the three fastest computers available in Europe. The "superbrain" can perform up to 12.8 billion calculations per second. Especially scientists who work in the fields of aerospace and traffic technology as well as climate research can carry out numerical simulations with the computer. The "superbrain," which was installed on a 100-square-meter surface, consists of a puzzle-like set of metal boxes. The system includes, among other things, a main memory unit that has the enormous capacity of 1 gigabyte (a billion bytes) and numerous disk drives with a total capacity of 46 gigabytes. The most impressive thing about the mainframe is its speed. Access to the main memory unit takes 20 nanoseconds (20 times 10 to the power of -9 seconds). The technical child prodigy is Japanese product. The DLR had also invited leading representatives of the NEC Corporation from Tokyo to the opening. As early as the beginning of September, 10 of the manufacturer's engineers came to Goettingen from Japan to install the computer comprising three truck loads at the DLR research center. Those scientists in particular who work on extremely calculation-intensive tasks can benefit from the new mainframe. Even the most difficult numerical problems can be solved with the "superbrain." Thus designers of aerodynamic equipment, for example, can simulate the flow response of aircraft or individual airfoils on the computer. Such enormous amounts of data can only be processed with this immensely rapid access to the main memory unit. But computer-controlled computational procedures are not only used in the calculations for and optimization of aerospace vehicles, but also in environment and climate research to, for example, obtain insights into the origins and dissemination of pollutants. The enormous speed and capacity of the system are also apparent in the central unit, the so-called CPU (central processing unit). It has four so-called pipeline sets, each of which has four vector pipelines that operate at a total of 6.4 gigaflops, that is, 6.4 billion floating point operations per second. Andreas Landhaeusser, who is in charge of the DLR computer, illustrated its scarcely imaginable speed with an example: "If the entire population of the world were to add two numbers on a pocket calculator, the SX-3 would still be faster than all the people on this earth together."
