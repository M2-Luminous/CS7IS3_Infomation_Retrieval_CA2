A delegation of the Hungarian Interior Ministry held talks recently with the Norilco military industry firm on purchasing such tanks. The delegation, led by State Secretary Attila Korom, left Beijing on 18 January. According to our correspondent, the Chinese side does not exclude the possibility of selling the tanks in exchange for the 107 million Swiss Francs Chinese state debt to Hungary accumulated in the course of bilateral clearing trade. However, this way, the price is higher than in the case of free currency accounting. The Hungarian Interior Ministry is conducting information talks on the purchase of 100-150 PSZH tanks, and the Chinese offer stands at $375,000 a piece. Thus, the value of the entire transaction stands around $50 million. The Nikex foreign trade firm has been put in charge of carrying out this purchase. The executive manager of this firm, Attila Varadi, who participated in the current negotiations, used to be the Hungarian commercial attache in Beijing, and later worked at Gyorgy Matrai's Autotrade company. Originally, it was the Autotrade that won the right to settle the Chinese debt to Hungary, but it failed to carry out this task in time, probably due to Matrai's arrest in connection with the Samax- affair. Varadi left the Autotrade after the arrest of his boss.
