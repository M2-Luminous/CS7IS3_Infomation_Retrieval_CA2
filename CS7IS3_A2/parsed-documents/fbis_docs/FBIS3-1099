Three items were on the meeting's agenda. Here is a report on the meeting by the minister of communication and spokesman of the government, Cyriaque Simbizi. [Begin Simbizi recording] Three items were on the agenda of the meeting, first, the draft decree on the organization of the services at the Presidency of the Republic; second, the draft decree on the creation and organization of the General Administration of State Security; and third, the draft decree on the organization of the Ministry of National Defense. [passage omitted] The ministers discussed setting up a General Administration of State Security charged with all the problems relating to the security of the head of state, the other state institutions, and senior political personalities. The main reason for this draft decree originates in the unfortunate events that our country has been through since the night of 20 to 21 October 1993. The serious consequences of destabilizing the institutions, notably the Presidency, justifies the establishment of a body technically and morally trained to efficiently ensure the protection of national democratic institutions, irrespective of the party or people in power, today or tomorrow. It is within this framework that we have proposed the creation of a General Administration of State Security which comprises a security unit for the institutions and the Central Investigation Office. The unit is military and made up of about 1,000 men, whose recruitment will be carried out from existing units of the Armed Forces or through military channels. The unit will have to reflect the image of a truly national army in its composition, discipline, and technical, moral, and patriotic training. The members of the council unanimously recognized the appropriateness of such a structure given the circumstances our country has just experienced. They recognized that this was, in fact, a formalization of its existence, since there has always been a Presidential Guard Unit, though without a regular function. This unit did not deal with the protection of the president of the republic alone. It was often drawn from a military barracks and dealt with other tasks. Under the new project, the same body will also deal with the protection of other senior political personalities and strategic points. It is worth noting that the project was conceived jointly with the services concerned, notably the Army and the Gendarmerie headquarters, as well as the National Documentation Services.
