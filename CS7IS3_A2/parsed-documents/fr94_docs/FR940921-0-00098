(2)(i) Unleaded gasoline representative of commercial gasoline which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation. Leaded gasoline will not be used in service accumulation. (ii) The octane rating of the gasoline used shall be no higher than 1.0 Research octane number above the minimum recommended by the manufacturer and have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, where sensitivity is defined as the Research octane number minus the Motor octane number. (iii) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used shall be characteristic of the motor fuel used during the season in which the service accumulation takes place. (3) The specification range of the gasoline to be used under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (b) Petroleum diesel test fuel. (1) The petroleum fuels employed for testing diesel vehicles shall be clean and bright, with pour and cloud points adequate for operability. The petroleum diesel fuel may contain nonmetallic additives as follows: Cetane improver, metal deactivator, antioxidant, dehazer, antirust, pour depressant, dye, dispersant and biocide. Fuels specified for emissions testing are intended to be representative of commercially available in-use fuels. (2) Petroleum fuel for diesel vehicles meeting the following specifications, or substantially equivalent specifications approved by the Administrator, shall be used in exhaust emission testing.
