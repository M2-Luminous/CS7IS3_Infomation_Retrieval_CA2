He said this in reaction to a recent report that 60 British Special Air Service (SAS) troops were infiltrated into the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Jovic's opinion, the SAS troops have been in Bosnia since the beginning of the conflict, some have even been captured in actions, but they posed as mercenaries. Jovic, a commander of the parachute brigade for many years, said on the basis of his long experience, that the operations preceding the disintegration of former Yugoslavia as well as those taking place today in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, can be termed special war or a low-intensity conflict. The special war doctrine originated in the U.S. in the 1960s on the basis of its experience in the local wars in Korea and Vietnam and the conclusion that the next war would not be a global conflict of opposing blocs but an endless series of limited clashes and special operations which would require special units. All the developments in the territory of former Yugoslavia in recent years fully fit in with the special war doctrine, Jovic said. The generally known special units are the British SAS, the American Green Berets and Rangers, the Russian Spetznaz and others. British SAS units continue the tradition of British units from the World War Two and subsequent local wars, and they use their ample experience to perfect their training and operations. The present U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander in Bosnia- Herzegovina, General Michael Rose, used to be an SAS commander and participated in operations in the Falklands. Gen. Rose has been known to Yugoslav experts because he lectured at the Belgrade Military School in 1983. Other countries were also preraring for operations in Yugoslav territory, Jovic said. For instance, there was a unit within the first batallion of the 10th group of the Green Berets located in Bad Tolz in Germany, which was trained for operations in Yugoslav territory even some 20 years ago. The unit included Yugoslav emigres. There is numerous evidence that the troops of this American special unit are now in Bosnia. Some have been captured, and former UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia Philippe Morillon confirmed their presence in Srebrenica. Jovic said that some operations in Bosnia can come under the heading of "dirty tricks" stipulated in the American special war rules. To illustrate this, he mentioned the alleged shelling of the presidential office in Zagreb, the massacres in Sarajevo's Vase Miskina street and in the Markale market, the fabrication of Serb death camps and massive rapes of Moslem women. There is no proof for the presence of special units of other countries in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is obvious that these countries have taken part in training troops of the breakaway republics, Jovic said, mentioning the training of Slovene territorial defence officers in Germany and special Bosnian Moslem police units in Libya. The army of the Bosnian Serb republic, the Serb state in Bosnia, also has special sabotage and reconnaisance units, storm troops and anti-terrorist units. Their training and combat experience is evident from the daily reports on routing of enemy sabotage groups in the Bosnian Serb territory, Jovic said.
