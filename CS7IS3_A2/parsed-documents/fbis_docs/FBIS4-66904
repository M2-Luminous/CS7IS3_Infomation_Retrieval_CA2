Sergeyev Cited on Compliance With START I Accord MK0605073094 Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 6 May 94 p 2 MK0605073094 Moscow SEGODNYA Russian BFN [ITAR-TASS report: "Russia Implements START-1 Accord and Helps Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia to Become Non-Nuclear"] [Text] From the moment the START I accord on the reduction of offensive weapons went into effect, Russia "has destroyed 350 missiles and 300 launchers," Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces, told a press conference. He reminded the audience that Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorussia [Belarus] became parties to this accord in June 1992, and this put a fresh obligation upon Russia. For example, according to Gen. Sergeyev, 180 nuclear weapons have been shipped from Ukraine to the Russian Federation to be destroyed at Russian plants under agreements between both countries and the United States. Besides, as the commander in chief intimated, as of last year Ukraine removed from alert status RS-18 missile systems with expired guarantee dates; the shipping of nuclear weapons to the Russian Federation and the radiological decontamination of SS-24 missiles began this year. Gen. Sergeyev also recalled that, in line with an agreement signed with Minsk, the Strategic Rocket Forces group has been placed under Moscow's jurisdiction: A scheduled withdrawal of missile regiments to Russian territory is in progress. An agreement also was reached this March with Kazakhstan on lending a "Russian status" to the missile subunits deployed in the republic, and on the dates for their pullout. Now an agreement is in the works of the elimination of the missile systems. Col. Gen. Sergeyev underscored that the implementation of the disarmament process depends not only on the United States and the Russian Federation but also on all former Soviet republics on whose territories strategic arms are deployed.
