Strong Muslim forces are in evidence near the town's bridges. Serbian military sources see this as a likely indication that the Muslims are preparing to destroy the bridges. Throughout yesterday afternoon NATO planes frequently flew over Serbian army positions at an altitude of over 3,000 meters. This provided the Muslims with an additional motive to intensify their combat activities. Yesterday the Muslims tried to use for propaganda purposes an incident in the chemical plant in Vitkovici, four kilometers south of Gorazde, to accuse the Serbs of using poison gases. The Herzegovina corps command stresses that due to the low level of technological process in the plant there is a danger of a genuine ecological catastrophe throughout the Drina basin. Over the past 24 hours two Serbian fighters have been wounded on the Gorazde front.
