Extending a welcome to Lowry on his first visit to China, Jiang said he hoped U.S. guests could visit China more frequently in the future so as to gain a better understanding of China's reform, opening and modernization drive. Previously, Jiang met with the governor in Seattle where he was attending an APEC meeting last November. Lowry and his party came to China as guests of the government of southwest China's Sichuan Province, with which Washington has been a sister state since 1981. During the meeting in Zhongnanhai, Jiang expressed hopes that Sichuan Province and Washington State would make greater efforts to push forward the cooperation links between them, and between the two countries as well. Lowry said his visit to Sichuan was impressive and that his delegation is "here to learn and further strengthen cooperation with China."
