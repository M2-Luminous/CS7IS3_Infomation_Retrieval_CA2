The announcement was made at a meeting with a CIS inter-parliamentary delegation led by Kyrgyz parliament chairman Medetkan Sherimkulov that arrived in Baku on Thursday. Guliyev praised their peace mission seeking to "untie the Karabakh knot," adding that Azerbaijan's position remains unchanged -- it stands for peaceful solution of all disputable questions that have piled up over the years of confrontation. Shirimkulov said that the current visit to Baku is the continuation of the extensive mediatory work started in September 1993 by the CIS inter-parliamentary assembly. It has already organised a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian parliamentarians in Finland. Another such meeting, this time with the participation of representatives of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, is expected to take place in Bishkek in early May. "Our aim is to help the sides bridge the gap between their positions and find a way out of the crisis," Shirimkulov said. He added that the CIS countries are interested in restoring peace in the trans-Caucasus. Early on Friday the delegation will meet with deputy parliament chairman Afiyaddin Dzhalilov and will be received by Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev at noon. After the talks the delegation will fly to Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.
