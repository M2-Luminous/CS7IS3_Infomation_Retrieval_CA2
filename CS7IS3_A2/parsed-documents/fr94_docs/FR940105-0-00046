Request for Comments Interested persons may, on or before March 7, 1994 submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this final rule. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. VI. Environmental Impact The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. VII. Economic Impact FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. This rule amends the regulations for FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA. Because the amendments merely update the regulations to reflect procedural changes already adopted by the agency as a result of legislation, executive branch directives, or legal precedents, no additional impact is anticipated. Accordingly, FDA finds that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.
