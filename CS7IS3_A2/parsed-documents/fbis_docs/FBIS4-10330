Despite the silence of authorities and the school, diplomatic sources learned that the girl's father is a businessman. Sources from the Attorney General's Office who spoke with AFP and asked to remained anonymous identified the girl as seven-year-old Georgina Rosse Robyn, the daughter of a U.S. businessman who exports nontraditional products in Guatemala. According to this report, the girl was abducted by unidentified persons shortly after leaving her home in a residential neighborhood in southern Guatemala City. Thus far, both the U.S. Embassy and the principal's office of Maya School, which the girl attends, have remained silent and have neither confirmed nor denied the news, which was also disclosed by Police sources. Two weeks ago the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala warned U.S. citizens of future attacks in retaliation for the presumed abduction of Guatemalan children by U.S. citizens. Recently an Alaskan photographer was accused of abducting children and was attacked by a mob in a rural town. The individual was hospitalized in serious condition.
