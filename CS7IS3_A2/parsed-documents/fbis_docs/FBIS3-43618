The participants took a lunch break on Tuesday, but then reconvened at 1500 GMT in a closed-door session -- which was not attended by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Michel Roussin, French cooperation minister. The two men had met separately Tuesday morning with the African leaders. The authoritative sources had reported that the participating countries had agreed in principle late Monday to a devaluation of their common currency, the CFA franc, but had reached no formal accord. They said the participants had endorsed the idea of a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West African currency pegged to the French franc. Authoritative sources said later that the continuation of the Dakar summit meeting was to be explained by the difficulty of reaching agreement between the participating countries and aid donors on measures that should accompany a devaluation. They said that a uniform rate of devaluation would be adopted for the 14 countries in the Franc Zone, on the order of 50 percent, but the funds for providing compensation would be shared out depending on each country's specific needs. The total amount might be on the order of two billion dollars, one Western source said in Dakar. In another development, French businessman Pierre Castel, chairman of Castel Freres, which supplies most of French-speaking Africa with beer, protested strongly against a possible CFA franc devaluation -- which he said would have "dramatic" consequences both for Africa and for his group. He said "A 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc would force us to hike the price of our beer by around 40 percent. And if African salaries don't go up, we will lose half of our sales, and have to make layoffs".
