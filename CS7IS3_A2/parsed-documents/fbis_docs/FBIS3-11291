Through an official document, the Foreign Ministry reminded JIFE that Bolivia "acknowledges as legal the traditional use" of the coca leaf. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas stated that "Bolivia is a sovereign country," where there is a law that differentiates between the legal and illegal use of coca leaf. "I believe that Bolivia demands respect for its laws and sovereignty. Coca leaf will continue to exist because a large part of the country uses it for medicinal, healing, and cultural rituals," Cardenas said. Foreign Minister Antonio Arinibar reported that the case of excessive coca leaf production has caused a conflictive situation due to the process of the change in governments. "The basis of the government's policy is that of voluntary eradication in coordination with a responsive and joint effort with the producers," he said. Regarding the eradication of coca and the latest incidents in Chapare, Felix Santos, executive secretary of the General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia, stated that this sector wants to live in peace, not under a regime of violence. "But the government causes violence by forcefully eradicating coca plantations that are the only economic support for the workers in Cochabamba's tropical region," he said. [passage omitted]
