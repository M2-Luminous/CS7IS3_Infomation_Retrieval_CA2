FR940317-1-00181 FR940317-1-00015 Virtually every class of visitor activity at Grand Canyon National Park is limited or controlled in some way by the NPS to insure that there will be no derogation or impairment of resources and values. Each raft trip on the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park must have a permit and the number of permits is limited for both commercial and private rafters. For some private raft trips, a permit may take 4 or 5 years to obtain. Each over-night visitor in the backcountry must have a backcountry permit; the demand for such permits far exceeds the supply. The waiting list for trips by mule into the inner canyon runs into years for some times of the year. There are a limited number of hotel rooms in the park and there are a limited number of parking spaces. In contrast, the commercial air tour sector has experienced unlimited growth at Grand Canyon National Park in the last 10 years. This is so even though Congress found noise associated with overflights to be significantly and adversely affecting the park in the 1987 Overflights Act. In addition, the NPS believes there is ample evidence that the uncontrolled and unregulated growth in this sector is in derogation of the resources and values of the park. NPS studies to that effect will be published later this year. Grand Canyon_Actions to Date Public Law 100&hyph;91 directed the DOI to substantially restore ``natural quiet'' to the Grand Canyon National Park. Public Law 100&hyph;91 also required a study of aircraft noise impacts at a number of national parks and imposed flight restrictions at three parks: Grand Canyon National Park, Yosemite National Park in California, and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. Public Law 100&hyph;91 also required the DOI to conduct a study, with the technical assistance of the Secretary of Transportation, to determine the proper minimum altitude to be maintained by aircraft when flying over units of the national park system. The research was to include an evaluation of the noise levels associated with overflights. Before submission to Congress, the DOI is to provide a draft report (containing the results of its studies) and recommendations for legislative and regulatory action to the FAA for review. The FAA is to notify the DOI of any adverse effects these recommendations would have on the safety of aircraft operations. The FAA is to consult with the DOI to resolve these issues. The final report must include a finding by the FAA that implementation of the DOI recommendations will not have adverse effects on the safety of aircraft operations, or, in the alternative, a statement of the reasons why the recommendations will have an adverse effect. The DOI expects to complete the report by early summer, 1994. Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks The national parks in Hawaii_Hawaii Volcanoes and Haleakala_have similar problems with commercial air sightseeing tours, principally noise associated with helicopters. The FAA held a series of public hearings in January 1994 to elicit public comments and recommendations for regulatory or policy action related to overflights, including their effects on parks. There are 9 tour operators on the island of Hawaii, and there are approximately 60 commercial air tours a day over Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. At Haleakala, which was established to preserve resources in ``natural condition,'' (39 Stat. 432, section 4), seven companies based on the island of Maui offer helicopter tours. On clear days, helicopters fly over the park during all hours of daylight so that helicopter noise is audible over 30 minutes of every daylight hour (personal communication, Haleakala National Park). Interpretive talks, wildlife observations and censuses, ceremonies, and other normal activities are interrupted by air tour overflights. The NPS recognizes that the commercial air tour industry is important to the economy of Hawaii but also believes that the tourism industry benefits from the continued NPS protection of the superlative resources of its national parks, unimpaired. Hawaii_Actions to Date The majority of flights conducted by helicopter companies in Hawaii are commercial air tour/sightseeing operations. Both the NPS and FAA have received numerous complaints of commercial air sightseeing tour flights over residential communities, national parks, wildlife refuge areas, State natural reserve areas, sanctuaries and areas of significant historic or cultural value. Issues raised by the growth of air tour sightseeing activity and the associated increase in the number of flights conducted over a given area include aircraft noise, flight noise, flight safety, and airport site constraints near scenic areas. It may be necessary to determine if there are thresholds of adverse effects that have been met in terms of impacts to the parks.
