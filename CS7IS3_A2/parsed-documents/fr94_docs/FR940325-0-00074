FR940325-0-00074 FR940325-0-00016 Nonuse values, unlike use values, are not linked to behavior and, thus, are more difficult to validate externally than use values. Therefore, the Department will soon be issuing a proposed set of standards to improve the reliability of CV when used to estimate lost nonuse values. This final rule renumbers §§11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii) of the original rule, which restrict the assessment of lost nonuse values to cases where lost use values cannot be determined, as new §§11.83(c)(1)(iii) and 11.83(c)(2)(vii)(B), respectively. However, pending completion of the rulemaking concerning assessment of lost nonuse values, the Department is temporarily leaving unchanged the language of renumbered §§11.83(b)(2) and 11.83(d)(5)(ii), which was remanded by Ohio v. Interior. C. Resources Covered by the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Regulations The final issue remanded by Ohio v. Interior concerns the scope of the resources covered by the rule. The rule as originally published incorporated the statutory definition of ``natural resources.'' This definition encompasses any resource_ Belonging to, managed by, held in trust by, appertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States *␣*␣*, any State or local government, any foreign government, or any Indian tribe, or, if such resources are subject to a trust restriction on alienation, any member of an Indian tribe. CERCLA sec. 101(16). The court in Ohio v. Interior noted that, although CERCLA does not authorize recovery of damages for injuries to purely private resources, the statutory definition of ``natural resources'' is clearly not limited to resources literally owned by a government. 880 F.2d at 460. Similarly, in its oral argument in Ohio v. Interior, the Department recognized that applicability of CERCLA's natural resource damage provisions does not hinge solely on ownership. Id. at 461. However, the August 1, 1986, preamble to the final type B rule stated that ``section 101(16) of CERCLA clearly indicates that privately owned natural resources are not to be included in natural resource damage assessments.'' 54 FR 27696. Therefore, the court asked the Department to clarify whether the natural resource damage assessment regulations may be used to assess damages for injuries to any resources that are not owned by the government. The Department never intended to suggest that the applicability of the regulations hinges solely on ownership of a resource by a government entity. The rule is available for assessments of all natural resources covered by CERCLA, which under the plain language of the statute includes more than just resources owned by the government. Section 11.14(z), which was not affected by this rulemaking, incorporates the statutory definition of ``natural resource.'' The rule does not interpret this statutory definition. This final rule does, however, add a requirement that trustee officials prepare statements explaining the bases for their assertions of trusteeship. This statement must be included both in the Notice of Intent to Perform an Assessment, which is sent to PRPs, and in the Assessment Plan, which is subject to public review and comment. D. Other Significant Issues This final rule addresses two additional issues related to the court order: (1) Development of a preliminary estimate of damages; and (2) The date of promulgation of the natural resource damage assessment regulations. 1. Preliminary Estimate of Damages Under §11.35 of the rule as originally published, the determination of the appropriate measure of damages was made in the Economic Methodology Determination. In the Economic Methodology Determination, trustee officials were required to estimate both the costs of restoring the injured resources and the diminution in the value of the injured resources without restoration. The smaller value served as the measure of damages. The Economic Methodology Determination was then used to help trustee officials develop an Assessment Plan. Under this final rule, damages always include the costs of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. Therefore, the Department has eliminated the Economic Methodology Determination. However, the Economic Methodology Determination served a function that is still relevant under the revised rule. CERCLA provides that trustee officials may recover the costs of performing an assessment, but only if those costs are reasonable. Under the definition of ``reasonable cost'' in §11.14(ee), which was not affected by this rulemaking, the anticipated cost of the assessment must be expected to be less than the anticipated damage amount. Under the original rule, the damage estimates developed during the Economic Methodology Determination helped trustee officials design their Assessment Plans so that this standard was met. In order to continue assisting trustee officials in performing assessments at reasonable costs in the absence of the Economic Methodology Determination, this final rule requires trustee officials to prepare a preliminary estimate of damages before they begin the development of an Assessment Plan.
