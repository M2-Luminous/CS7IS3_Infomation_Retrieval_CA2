FR941013-2-00044 FR941013-2-00040 [OPPTS&hyph;51839; FRL&hyph;4916&hyph;8] Certain Chemicals Premanufacture Notice; Extension of Review Period AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA is extending the review period for an additional 90 days for premanufacture notices (PMNs) P&hyph;94&hyph;1799, P&hyph;94&hyph;1800, and P&hyph;94&hyph;1801, under the authority of section 5(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The review period will now expire on December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dave Schutz, New Chemicals Branch, Chemical Control Division (7405), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;611, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;8994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 1, 1994, EPA received PMNs P&hyph;94&hyph;1799, P&hyph;94&hyph;1800, and P&hyph;94&hyph;1801 for three substances, identified as 1-amino-2-butanol; 1,1' aminodi-2-butanol; and 1,1',1'' Nitrilotri-2-butanol. The submitter claimed as confidential business information: The production volume, manufacturing process information, and some other information. Notice of receipt of the premanufacture notice has not yet been published in the Federal Register . The original 90&hyph;day review period under section 5(a)(1) of the TSCA was scheduled to expire on September 28, 1994. With this extension under section 5(c) of the TSCA, the 90&hyph;day review period is now scheduled to expire on December 27, 1994. Based on its analysis, EPA finds that there is a possibility that the substances submitted for review in these PMNs may be regulated under TSCA. The PMN substances appear to meet the Agency's exposure-based criteria under section 5(e)(1)(A)(ii)(II) in that there may be substantial human exposure to these substances in the form of chronic inhalation by a large number of workers. The Agency requires an extension of the review period, as authorized by section 5(c) of TSCA, to investigate further potential risk, to examine its regulatory options, and to prepare the necessary documents, should regulatory action be required. Therefore, EPA has determined that good cause exists to extend the review period for an additional 90 days, to December 27, 1994. The PMN substances will be reevaluated once data are received. PMNs are available for public inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), Rm. NE-B607, EPA headquarters, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
