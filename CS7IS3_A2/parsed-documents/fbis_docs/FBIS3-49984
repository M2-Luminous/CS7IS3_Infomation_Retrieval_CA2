"Therefore, it is very important the three sides accept the establishment of peace and resolve the remaining disputes peacefully," Koljevic pointed out. Koljevic said the joint declaration signed by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was "a significant step for overall Serb-Croat relations," stressing that progress was much slower in the negotiations with the Muslim side.
