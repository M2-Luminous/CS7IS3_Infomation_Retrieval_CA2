A total of 30,000 hectares have been affected, and this caused not only huge losses to wheat crops but also to human life (from 1979 to 1992) due to the emergence of new and fulminating diseases such as acute meningoencephalitis, which attacks the brain directly and kills in less than 72 hours. Legislators of all parties met here today with jurists, researchers, and specialists on this issue to discuss the problem and determine the terms and juridical recourses that could be used to renegotiate and renew this treaty with which the United States has failed to comply for the past 20 years. In 1993 alone Mexico received from tributaries of the Colorado River in the United States 10 million cubic meters of mud in which large concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and calcium were detected. They "have ruined the productivity of the land and have irreversibly contaminated human life, flora, fauna, and aquatic life." Moreover, as was already mentioned, also detected in those waters were the free-living protozoan amoebas [protosoario amiba de vida libre], which reproduce when in contact with organic matters, such as feces, and cause diseases such as the aforementioned acute meningoencephalitis which affects people swimming in such waters. This problem worsened last year when the Colorado River overflowed into the Mexicali Valley. This nearly flooded the city. As a result, the Permanent Committee of the Chamber of Deputies instructed the Border Affairs Committee to verify the scope of the damage and determine whether the overflowing of the Colorado River violated the treaty in question. A special subcommittee chaired by Deputy Javier Cital Camacho conducted the respective study and concluded that "the provisions contained in the International Treaty on Limits and Waters signed by Mexico and the United States are inadmissible and unfair to our country." The document was also signed by Ernesto Enciso Clark and Rafael Morgan of the National Action Party [PAN]; Marta Maldonado of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD]; Jorge Tovar Montanez of the Popular Socialist Party [PPS]; Rogelio Appel Chacon, Oscar Garzon, and Luis Moreno Bustamante of the Institutional Revolutionary Party; and Javier Colorado Pulido of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution. In this document they concluded that there is no compatibility between the hydraulic systems of the two countries, and thus, the flow [desfogue] of solid matters that ends up at the Morelos Dam "provokes permanent storage and contamination of our waterways [vasos]." This is "highly and dangerously harmful to the Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado Valleys." For these reasons they proposed renegotiating the treaty to turn it into a document that "promotes the principles of good neighborliness, international respect, fair treatment, and good intentions." They also pointed out that a new treaty should include the San Luis Rio Colorado Valley, Sonora, and the Gulf of California Mar de Cortes. They said that the United States must expand its ability to retain solid matters at water bodies above the Gila River and promote the construction of reservoir systems and regulators to prevent the flow of mud, among other things. These proposals were revealed today during a forum to analyze the treaty. It was headed by Governor Guillermo Mercado Romero and Agustin Basave Benitez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Border Affairs Committee. Also present at the forum were Jose Ramirez Roman, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Health Committee; PAN members Tomas Esparza Carlos, Ernesto Encizo, and Rafael Morgan; PRD member Marta Maldonado; PPS member Jorge Escobar; and specialists Rodolfo Moreno Dahma, Maria Valdes, Luis Flores Lui, Manuel Ortega, and Jesus Roman Galleros. The latter, who is a researcher at the School of the Northern Border and in charge of the Environmental Studies Department, said that this issue is extremely delicate and requires an urgent solution because concentrations of salt of 2 kg per cubic meter of water coming from the United States have been detected. This, he added, is without taking into account the organic residues and mud coming from the other side of the border. "Water coming from the United States is completely contaminated, and this is so because the dam system along the Colorado River is the most controlled system in the world." It contains 2,500 km of water flow controlled by 39 dams that at the lower end release into Mexico a heavy load of contaminants from agroindustrial residues. In a speech Agustin Basave warned that this string of problems with the United States threatens to deteriorate our bilateral relationship. He added that in this case a definitive or "lasting" [de largo aliento] solution must be sought, because it is no longer advisable to postpone discussion or a possible renegotiation of this issue. [Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish on 3 March carries a 600-word article on page 4 stating that: "Following more than 11 hours of negotiations, the Chamber of Deputies Border Affairs Committee has decided to propose to the government of the republic a `review' of Act 242 on limits and waters signed with the United States instead of proposing a 'renegotiation' of the entire treaty, because the latter would create more conflicts between the two nations." Committee Chairman Agustin Basave points out that this issue will be brought up at the upcoming Mexico-U.S. binational meeting in April at the Port of Huatulco, because this problem "is increasing tension in the relations" between the two countries.]
