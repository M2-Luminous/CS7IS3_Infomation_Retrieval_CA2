Sustained and speedy growth of the economy has significantly increased the composite strength of this province. Last year, party and government leaders at various levels paid more attention to agriculture and set forth a series of policies for increasing input into agriculture, consolidating the status of agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and reducing burdens on peasants.

The grain output was 35 billion kg, an increase of over 10 percent; the output of oil-bearing crops increased by 42.3 percent; and that of cotton equalled the previous year. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery developed steadily. The total output value of agriculture is estimated at 67.5 billion yuan.
