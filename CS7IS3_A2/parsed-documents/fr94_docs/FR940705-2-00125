FR940705-2-00125 FR940705-2-00089 II. Basis for Determination The Region 10 Administrator has determined that the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System meets all applicable sole source aquifer designation criteria established through Federal statute and EPA guidance documents, as follows: (1) Sole or Principal Source of Drinking Water: Sole source aquifers must supply at least 50 percent of the drinking water to persons living in the area overlying the aquifer and in areas supplied by the aquifer. The Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System supplies approximately 71 percent of the drinking water to persons living on the Island. (2) Potential Public Health Hazard: Contamination of the sole source aquifer must create a significant hazard to public health. As the principal drinking water source for the area, contamination of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System would create a significant hazard to public health. (3) Definable Aquifer Boundaries: EPA guidance allows designations to be made for entire aquifers, hydrogeologically connected aquifers (aquifer systems), or part of an aquifer if that portion is hydrogeologically separated from the rest of the aquifer. The Vashon-Maury Aquifer System boundary is based on hydrogeological principles and EPA's interpretation of available data. The Island's hydrogeology is representative of an aquifer system, as data indicate that water from shallow aquifers infiltrates to underlying deeper aquifers. The sole source aquifer boundary is coincident with the shoreline of the Island, and at depth includes all geologic units that can supply significant quantities of drinking water to wells. This boundary is assumed because stratigraphic data are not available to fully map the vertical extent of the aquifer materials. (4) No Alternative Source of Drinking Water: There can be no physical, legal, or economically feasible alternative source(s) of drinking water of sufficient volume that could replace the sole source aquifer, should it become contaminated. EPA has determined that there are no reasonably available alternative source(s) of drinking water that could replace the aquifer. III. Description of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System Note: Information in this section represents an unfootnoted summary from EPA's Support Document, EPA 910/K&hyph;94&hyph;002. Vashon-Maury Island is located near the southern end of Puget Sound in the southwestern corner of King County, Washington. The Island covers an area of 36.7 square miles and its population has been estimated at approximately 7,800 persons. Recorded data indicates an average rainfall of 46.53 inches. The aquifer system is composed of both interbedded glacial and non-glacial deposits. In general, the water table elevation reflects the surface topography and the ground water moves radially outward from the interior to the shorelines of the Island. The uppermost and most recent deposits (Quaternary Vashon unit) are mainly stratified sand and gravel overlying glacial till and sandy gravel interbedded with medium and fine-grained sand. The Vashon unit contains a surficial aquifer comprised primarily of glacial till which has poor water-bearing characteristics, and the uppermost fresh water aquifer (Principal Aquifer) comprised of outwash sand and gravel beds. The Principal Aquifer is found at an elevation of between 0 and 400 feet above mean sea level. Recharge of the Principal Aquifer is probably highest along a north-south corridor of west-central Vashon Island, and is estimated to be approximately 9 million gallons per day. The Principal Aquifer supplies ninety-five percent of the wells located on the Island. Underlying the Vashon unit are non-glacial deposits (Quaternary Olympia beds) generally consisting of thin-bedded sand and silt with local layers of gravel, massive silt and clayey silt. The Olympia beds serve as a leaky aquitard between the upper Principal Aquifer and the lower Deep Aquifer. The Deep Aquifer underlies the Olympia beds and consists of a variety of interbedded glacial tills, sand and gravel units and laminated silts and clays. The Deep Aquifer is located at an elevation of between about 100 to 300 feet below mean sea level. Recharge to the Deep Aquifer is estimated at between 1.73 and 3.46 million gallons per day. Ground water quality data was sampled from 72 wells in the aquifer area. In general, deeper wells exhibited higher specific conductance values. Elevated chloride concentrations were found in near-shore wells on the northern and eastern edges of the Island. Ground water quality trend data is limited, but combined water system and spring data indicate that source water nitrate concentrations show a generally increasing trend. The sand interbeds within the surficial glacial till deposits allow easy infiltration, and although discontinuous, make much of the Principal Aquifer vulnerable to contamination. The Deep Aquifer is also vulnerable to contamination from activities occurring on the land surface, as evidence suggests that it receives recharge from the Principal Aquifer. Potential sources of contamination include landfill leachate, on-site sewage disposal systems, leaky sewer lines, underground storage tanks, agricultural chemicals, small hazardous waste generators, accidental spills, seawater intrusion, and improper household, forestry and farm practices.
