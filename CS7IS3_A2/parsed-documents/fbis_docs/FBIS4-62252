The plan was considered on Thursday [12 May] at a session of the collegium of the Ukrainian Economics Ministry. It also highlights demonopolizing national economy; fostering small businesses; forming stock market and implementing agricultural reform. The participants in the session also discussed a national programme called "Ukraine's oil and gas -- 2010", which provided for a comprehensive evaluation of opportunities to increase both national oil and gas production and reserves. At present, Ukraine's own gas and oil production may meet 9 to 11 percent (4 mln tonnes) of its oil consumption needs and 18 to 20 percent (18 bln cubic meters) of its gas consumption needs. An effective use of its natural resources may enable Ukraine to stabilize and, in the long run, increase its oil and gas production to a measure.
