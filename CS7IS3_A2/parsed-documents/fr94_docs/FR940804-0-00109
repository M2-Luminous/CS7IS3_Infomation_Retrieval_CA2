FR940804-0-00109 FR940804-0-00024 The Committee of Chief Justices commented that it is the exclusive province of the state supreme courts to construe state disciplinary rules and to determine whether this regulation falls within the ``authorized by law'' exception to these rules. The Department has simply expressed its intention to fit communications made pursuant to these rules within the ``authorized by law'' exception to state and local federal court rules, and its belief that this regulation indeed constitutes legal authorization for such communications. The Department notes that it would seem to require a very strained reading to conclude that a regulation duly promulgated after notice and comment and within the scope of its delegated authority does not also constitute ``law.'' Cf. Chrysler Corp ., 441 U.S. at 295&hyph;96 (1979) (``It has been established in a variety of contexts that properly promulgated substantive agency regulations have the `force and effect of law.'. . . It would therefore take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before the phrase `authorized by law' in [18 U.S.C.] ยง1905 could be held to have a narrower ambit than the traditional understanding.'' (citation omitted)). However, the Department recognizes that situations may arise in which the power of this regulation to displace state rules will depend on its preemptive force under the Supremacy Clause. Such situations may arise in several forms: where the applicable ethics rule has no ``authorized by law'' exception; where this regulation is deemed not to constitute ``law'' for purposes of such exception; or where a communication is held to violate the applicable ethics rule and not be ``authorized'' by this regulation. Therefore, an important feature of this regulation is its express intention to preempt and supersede the operation of state and local federal court rules as they relate to contacts by Department attorneys, regardless of whether such rules are inconsistent or consistent with this regulation, absent a finding of a willful violation of these rules by the Attorney General. The preemption of state regulation of contacts with represented persons, except when the Attorney General has found a willful violation of the federal regulation, was an integral feature of this rule as proposed earlier. The proposed rule reflected the Department's belief that preemption of state and local rules, which have been unevenly applied, is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct respecting ex parte contacts is subject to uniform and predictable standards. The Department has made minor revisions to section 77.12 to clarify that the Department's intent is to displace even purportedly consistent state regulation in this area (or, as it is commonly phrased, to ``occupy the field'' of reviewing ex parte contacts by Department attorneys). The rules and this commentary now state in more express terms the Department's intention to preclude any state regulation of government attorneys respecting the subject matter of these rules, unless the Attorney General first finds a willful violation of these rules. Several comments suggested that the Attorney General lacks the authority to preempt state disciplinary rules, absent an explicit Congressional authorization to do so. These comments misconceive the power of a federal agency or department to preempt state regulation. Congress may, of course, expressly preempt all state regulation in a particular field, see Rice v. Sante Fe Elevator Corp ., 331 U.S. 218, 247, 255 (1947); accord Jones v. Rath Packing Co ., 430 U.S. 519, 536&hyph;37 (1977), and, in proper circumstances, a federal agency similarly ``may determine that its authority is exclusive and preempts any state efforts to regulate in the forbidden area.'' City of New York v. FCC , 486 U.S. 57, 64 (1988). See generally Fidelity Federal Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. De La Cuesta , 458 U.S. 141, 153&hyph;54 (1982) (``[f]ederal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes'' under the Supremacy Clause); Hillsborough County, Fla. v. Automated Med. Labs , 471 U.S. 707, 713 (1985) (``We have held repeatedly that state laws can be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes.''). A federal agency may preempt state regulation whenever the agency, in doing so, is acting within the proper scope of its congressionally delegated authority. Louisiana Public Serv. Comm'n v. FCC , 476 U.S. 355, 368&hyph;69 (1986). Accord City of New York , 486 U.S. at 64 (``if the agency's choice to pre-empt `represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency's care by the statute, we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that Congress would have sanctioned''' (citation omitted)). Thus, contrary to the commenters' suggestion, ``[a] preemptive regulation's force does not depend on express congressional authorization to displace state law . . . .'' Fidelity Federal Sav. & Loan Ass'n , 458 U.S. at 154. In promulgating this regulation, the Department is acting within the scope of its discretionary authority. The ample consideration given to this regulation and its earlier versions reflects the Department's effort reasonably to accommodate the relevant policies concerning law enforcement and professional conduct, and, as discussed in the previous section, there is no basis for concluding that the Department has exceeded its statutory authority. Moreover, the purpose of these rules, as defined in section 77.1, is to ``ensure the Department's ability to enforce federal law effectively and ethically'' and so fulfill the Department's statutory responsibilities. See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp , 467 U.S. 691, 700 (1984) (authority to regulate extends to all regulatory actions necessary to ensure the achievement of statutory responsibilities). The ``presumption against finding preemption of state law in areas traditionally regulated by the States,'' California v. ARC America Corp ., 490 U.S. 93, 101 (1989), and the traditional state regulation of legal practice and lawyers' ethics, Leis v. Flynt , 439 U.S. 438, 442 (1979), does not foreclose the Attorney General from concluding that it is appropriate here to displace those state rules that regulate the conduct of federal officials in the performance of their law enforcement duties. Here, the presumption against preemption is overcome by this regulation's express preemption provision, which is fully effective even in matters traditionally occupied by the states. Furthermore, under the intergovernmental immunity doctrine, states may not directly regulate or punish federal officials for acts undertaken in their official capacities, or otherwise substantially interfere with the lawful functions of federal officials. See, e.g ., Hancock v. Train , 426 U.S. 167, 178&hyph;79 (1976); M'Culloch v. Maryland , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 316, 437 (1819); Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C. 576, 601&hyph;02 (1980). ``An officer of the United States cannot, in the discharge of his duty, be governed and controlled by state laws, any further than such laws have been adopted and sanctioned by the legislative authority of the United States.'' Bank of the United States v. Halstead , 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 51, 63 (1825). Contacts covered by this regulation fall within the scope of federal attorneys' duties to carry out the law enforcement activities of the United States. The application to those attorneys of state ethics laws prohibiting such conduct therefore would constitute interference with the activities of the federal government forbidden by the intergovernmental immunity doctrine.
