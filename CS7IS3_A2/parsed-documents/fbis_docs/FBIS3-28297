In this connection, a top Foreign Ministry [MOF] official stated on the evening of 4 February: "If the prime minister cancels the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit meeting because of a failure to implement tax cuts, it will be questioned how other issues would be dealt with." Thus, the official indicated that Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the United States set for 10 February should take place even if no conclusion is reached on the tax cuts issue.
