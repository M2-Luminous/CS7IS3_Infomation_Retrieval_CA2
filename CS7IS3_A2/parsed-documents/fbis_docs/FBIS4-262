One person died, but it is not known if the victim -- a noncommissioned officer assigned to guard a union leader, Bocamba Yangouma, who is close to the presidential group -- was involved in the shoot-out or if he was simply hit by a stray bullet. Sergeant Vourou Samba died from a bullet wound in the stomach. Calm returned soon after the incident, which occurred in an eastern suburb of the Congolese capital. Since the cease-fire agreement reached at the end of January, after two months of political and interethnic violence, there have only been isolated incidents in Brazzaville.
