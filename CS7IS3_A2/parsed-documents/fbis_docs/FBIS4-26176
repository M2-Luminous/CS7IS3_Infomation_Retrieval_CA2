The primary task of the conference is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to further carry out the strategy of giving priority to educational development, and to mobilize the whole party and country to earnestly implement the "Outline of China's Educational Reform and Development," in order to accomplish the task of China's educational reform and development in the 1990's. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, Comrade Li Peng will deliver an important report at the conference; I hope that all departments and localities will earnestly study the report and act accordingly. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the leaderships of party committees and governments at all levels and with the diligent work of mass education workers, the country's education has developed rapidly, educational reform has been carried out step by step, noticeable results have been achieved in educational work, people's educational levels have been raised, and a large number of specialized personnel have been cultivated. All of this has made great contributions to the country's economic construction, science and technological progress, and social development. On behalf of the party Central Committee and State Council, I would like to extend my high respects to the masses of teachers and other education workers who have worked diligently on the education front. I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to people of all social sectors who have shown concern for and given support to educational work. The party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping have always attached importance to educational work -- in the overall development strategy for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, they have always regarded educational work as a fundamental issue that affects the overall socialist modernization efforts and the historical fate of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the important position and role of education in the socialist modernization drive, and he has maintained that the first step in the "three-step" development strategy is to develop education, science, and technology. He pointed out: Science and technology are the key to achieving modernization, and education is the foundation of modernization. We should respect knowledge and specialized personnel. Leaders at all levels should ensure good educational work as they ensure good economic work. We should not engage in empty talk and should do more practical things. However poor we are, we should ensure the availability of sufficient funds for science and educational development. We should do everything we can to solve educational problems -- even if this means we have to bear with difficulties in other areas or even slow down the speed of development a little. However difficult the situation may be, we have to raise remuneration for teachers and truly help them solve their specific problems. Comrade Xiaoping also has given many important instructions on educational reform and development: Education should be modernized and be geared toward the world and the future. We should thoroughly and correctly carry out the party's principle guidelines on educational development, adhere to the right course, and truly do a good job in educational reform, in order to bring about the great development of and a major improvement in educational work. We should closely attend to ideological and political education among young people and students and cultivate socialist people of the younger generation who have lofty aspirations, a sound moral sense, and good education and discipline. Comrade Xiaoping's discussions on education are the theoretical basis for the party's principal guidelines and policy on education in the new period. They set the course and serve as a powerful ideological weapon for educational reform and development. In studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, comrades of the whole party, especially leading cadres at all levels, should truly comprehend Comrade Xiaoping's educational thinking and, like Comrade Xiaoping, should attach importance to education from a strategic perspective, in order to contribute to educational reform and development. Comrades, what are the means and ways to realize the grand objective of socialist modernization construction for China, a country with nearly a 1.2 billion people, with inadequate resources, and with a relatively undeveloped economy and culture? There are ways which are of decisive significance. They are: shift economic construction onto the track of relying on scientific and technological advances; raise the quality of the working people; genuinely elevate education to a strategic position and give priority to the development of education; and strive to raise the people's moral, scientific, and cultural levels. These are the major and fundamental ways to realize China's modernization. The following message was solemnly delivered at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to all party members: whether China can establish a socialist market economic system and realize its modernization will be decided finally by whether it can raise the quality of its people and by whether it can train a large number of talented people. Since the implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, the entire party and society have renewed and raised their understanding of the importance of education and of the need to elevate education to a strategic position. Also, there has been a sharp rise in the number of regions, departments, and units which have done an excellent job of carrying out educational reforms and of developing education since China implemented the policy of reform and opening up. Despite these remarkable results, education lacks balanced development. Some regions and departments have yet to raise education to the strategic level. Some comrades do understand the policy of making economic construction the central task, but they do not have an adequate understanding of the need to shift the strategic policy onto the track of relying on scientific and technological advances to develop the economy and to raise the quality of the working people. Some comrades made such remarks as: "We must develop the economy, but education can take a backseat"; "develop the economy first, and education later." There are even cases of diverting educational funds for economic projects and for the construction of office buildings, luxury hotels, meeting halls, and guesthouses, as well as the phenomenon of delays in paying teachers' salaries. Some comrades have not exerted enough effort to carry out the policy of promoting the reform and opening drive with one hand and promoting the building of a socialist spiritual civilization with the other and have slackened their efforts to carry out ideological and political education among youth. Such an understanding of education, and also those practices run contrary to the demands made by the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They not only lack being farsighted but also are harmful. All levels of leading comrades should understand completely that the energetic development of education, accelerating the pace of training talented people for socialist modernization construction, and raising the ideological, moral, scientific, and cultural quality of all the people in the nation are the inevitable demands for implementing the party's basic line and for unwaveringly adhering to the party's basic line for 100 years. Only by developing education will we be able to fundamentally enhance China's overall strength and be able to seize the strategic initiative in the fierce international competition. Only by training generation after generation of the builders and successors with ideals, morality, culture, discipline, and devotion to the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics can we guarantee the long reign and stability of the state. In the entire course of socialist modernization construction, we must always persist in elevating education to the strategic position and in giving priority to develop education; we must never waver on this point. If we do not have a correct understanding of the issue of education, we will lose our opportunity, adversely affect our great plan, and make a historic mistake. To accelerate educational reform and development, it is necessary to comprehensively realize the "Development Outline for China's Educational Reform" promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. This is an important matter both for educational departments and for the entire party and society. All levels of party committees and governments should enhance their leadership over education work in a down-to-earth manner, should formulate a concrete enforcement plan by taking localities' actual conditions into consideration, and should carry out careful planning and arrangements for implementation. Major responsible comrades should frequently visit schools and grass-roots units to carry out investigations, to provide guidance, and to handle in a timely manner major and pressing issues. When formulating a development plan and an annual plan, all levels of party committees and governments must make sure that they give priority to developing education. The CPC Central Committee has set out the demand that areas and departments which have failed to implement well the guidelines on elevating education to the strategic level are required to further increase their understanding of the importance of education, to readjust their construction layout and investment structure, and to ensure that priority be given to developing education. Attaching importance to training talented people, ensuring adequate funds for education, and doing concrete things for education must be incorporated into the target responsibility system for leading party and government cadres and be made the important criterion for evaluating their performance. Job-performance evaluation departments must take the above conditions into account when evaluating cadres. All leading cadres who have a high sense of responsibility toward the party and the people should work hard for the reform and development of education in their localities. As for schools' leadership structure, party committees at institutions of higher learning which practice the school presidents responsibility system under the leadership of party committees should discuss and make decisions on major issues and ensure that administrative leaders fully exercise their own rights and functions. Party organizations should also fully bring into play their political roles in other schools as well in secondary and primary schools which experiment with or practice the school principals responsibility system. Implementing the guidelines on elevating education to the strategic level and on giving priority to develop education requires the entire party and society to help foster and maintain a good social mood for respecting teachers. The hope for revitalizing the nation rests with education, and the hope for invigorating education rests with teachers. Teachers are what we call the engineers of the human soul. Their profession is noble and yet arduous. They deserve respect from the whole party and all of society. All levels of leading cadres, senior leading cadres in particular, should take the lead in respecting teachers and education. It is necessary to conscientiously implement the "Teachers Law," to help maintain teachers' legitimate rights and interests, to raise their salaries and improve their welfare in line with the relevant provisions, and to create the necessary conditions for their work, for their study, and for their daily life. Every year, many party committees and governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities do several concrete things for teachers. This is a good practice that needs to be greatly promoted. All departments and all social sectors are called upon to show concern for and to support education with great enthusiasm, to respect teachers' hard work, and to carry forward the Chinese people's excellent tradition of respecting teachers and education. Various categories of schools at different levels should thoroughly implement the party's education principle, uphold the socialist orientation in running schools, and make efforts to train new people with "lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education, and a sense of discipline" along with the development of morality, intellectuality, and physics. Schools should respond to the new situation and the new problems that have emerged in the course of reform and construction by constantly strengthening and improving their ideological and political work as well as their political education. It is necessary to strengthen education on such things as the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought -- particularly Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's basic line, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, China's modern and contemporary history, state conditions, and fine cultural and revolution traditions. Various categories of schools at different levels should sum up experience and improve their teaching skills to ensure teaching results in political lessons. The purpose of strengthening theoretical and ideological education and political work is to guide and help youths and students to foster a correct world outlook, outlook on life, and concept of values; to build a scientific theoretical foundation; and to identify the political orientation of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is only through these means that we will be able to enhance youngsters' ability to resist the corrosive influence of such decadent types of thinking as wrong ideological trends, money worship, hedonism, and ultra-individualism. Principal leading cadres of various localities and departments should make it a rule to hold regular situation discussion meetings with teachers and students. To promote stability and unity, it is necessary to conscientiously maintain teaching order in schools. All of society should help create a fine educational environment by showing concern for and offering protection for the healthy growth of our students. At this juncture, I would like to particularly touch on the question of integrating education with productive labor. This phrase, which has been explicitly included in the "outlines," is an important component of our education principle. The integration of education with productive labor is a basic measure to uphold the socialist orientation in running schools. We have been implementing this clause all along since the founding of the nation. This has been a correct direction with overall success -- despite the emergence of some problems in its implementation -- and it has been conducive to the healthy growth of youths and students. Facts have proved that confining students to classroom studies without taking part in labor, without contact with social practice, without knowledge of how workers and peasants laboriously create social wealth, and without fostering passion for the working people will not be beneficial to their healthy growth and all-around development. Students' appropriate participation in certain types of material production labor should be made mandatory and not optional. We should fully understand this point and attach importance to it. To implement the principle of integrating education with productive labor, we should do well the following tasks: 1) Schools should include this subject in their teaching programs in consideration of their own realities and through overall planning; 2) education departments at various levels should offer concrete guidance and carry out supervision and inspections; 3) party committees and governments at various levels should strengthen their leadership in this respect; and 4) all parties concerned should positively offer their support and cooperation to help provide the necessary conditions for students' participation in productive labor. One of China's basic national conditions is developing education on a large scale while the economy is relatively backward. We must bear this fact in mind and deepen educational reform to ensure that the educational structure and system meet the requirements of development in the socialist market economy and in all social sectors. No matter how difficult our financial situation is, we must be willing to invest in education to ensure that compulsory education develops well -- this is a foundation-laying project for improving all the people's educational level. We should carry out reform to further improve the quality and efficiency of higher education; we should forcefully develop vocational and adult education at various levels to enable the majority of our people to raise their ideological and cultural level and to improve their vocational skills. The key way to readjust the educational structure is to establish more vocational schools of various kinds to train large numbers of junior- and medium-level specialized personnel in all fields. This not only will help students pursue studies in different fields but will also meet the current needs of economic and social development. The mass of education workers of education departments and schools at all levels should further emancipate their minds, do things in light of reality, strive to develop a new educational system, seek a new educational development path under the conditions of a socialist market economy, and endeavor to build a socialist educational system with Chinese characteristics. Comrades, achieving the grand goals of China's educational reform and development for the 1990's is a very honorable yet arduous task. With the efforts over the 40 years and more since the founding of the People's Republic, especially with the development over the 15 years since the country adopted the policy of reform and opening up, our education has developed considerably, we have accumulated many valuable experiences in carrying out educational reform, and the country now has more than 10 million teachers. All these things have laid a good foundation for future educational reform and development. The central authorities believe that under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, China's education definitely will develop day by day as long as we unswervingly attach strategic importance to education and give priority to educational development, and as long as we seize the opportunity to implement the "Outline of China's Educational Reform and Development" in a down-to-earth manner.
