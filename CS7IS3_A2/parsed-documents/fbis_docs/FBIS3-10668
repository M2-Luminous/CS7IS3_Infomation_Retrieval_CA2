In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Dufour has said the strengthening of bilateral relations constitutes a reply to Cuban efforts to broaden, more each day, the ties uniting this Caribbean nation with the rest of the world, particularly with the European Union. Dufour recalled the French delegations that recently visited Cuba were very impressed with the Cuban people's efforts to overcome their current difficulties. Our representatives saw how Cubans are working to find solutions by using imagination with knowledge. When they returned to Paris, they reported they found a very active people ready to work with us, the ambassador has added. After saying the 35 businessmen who accompanied the first mission had a similar reaction, Dufour said all of this contributes to a positive evolution of the negotiations. He said the French Government has guaranteed a $120-million credit by which Cuba can acquire basic products for industries and food. He added both countries must work at materializing a profound development of commercial relations and overcoming financial difficulties. Dufour has said he favors finding solutions for investing in Cuba so that Cuba can obtain resources and credits to be invested in tourism and to improve the economy. It will be necessary to find solutions via the Bank of Paris to grant Cuba the credit it needs. Naturally, via efforts from both sides, we will be able to sort this obstacle, Dufour said during the interview. Dufour stressed the importance of Cuba's current relations with Europe and the place the European Continent occupies in the country's investments and trade, with France in an outstanding position, along with Spain, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and the Netherlands. We must help Cuba overcome its economic difficulties and facilitate its full development.
