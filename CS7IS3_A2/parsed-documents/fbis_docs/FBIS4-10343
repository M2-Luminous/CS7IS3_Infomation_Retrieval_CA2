According to the agreement, these four countries must withdraw from GATT, which rejected the quotas imposed by the EU on Latin American banana imports. Steichen has said that Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are supplying the Latin American banana amounts the EU requires. In July of 1993 the EU imposed an annual quota of 2 million tonnes of bananas on Latin American exports to protect producers from the Canary Islands and the former European colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. It was agreed last December to increase the quota to 2.1 million tonnes as of 1 October 1994 and to 4.2 million tonnes as of 1995. The new agreement states duties on the fruit will be reduced from 100 to 75 European Currency Units per tonne. The quota assigned to Costa Rica amounts to 23.4 percent of the total amount imported by the EU, while Colombia will export 21 percent, Nicaragua 3 percent, and Venezuela 2 percent. Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama refrained from supporting the agreement and are demanding suspension of the restrictive system.
