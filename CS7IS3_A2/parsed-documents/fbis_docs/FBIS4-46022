Clarifying a statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, the spokesman said that the press has attributed an incorrect statement to him. The foreign minister said that the United States proposed that if Pakistan agreed on a verifiable restriction [bandish] on its nuclear program, then there will be a one time exemption from the Pressler Amendment. The foreign minister categorically reaffirmed the Pakistani stand that Pakistan was ready to consider all proposals on declaring South Asia a nuclear-free zone provided these proposals were just and nondiscriminatory. The spokesman said that the nuclear issue is an extremely sensitive one and a national consensus on it is very essential. He expressed the hope that the press will keep national interests in view and refrain from out of context presentations of statements on this most important issue.
