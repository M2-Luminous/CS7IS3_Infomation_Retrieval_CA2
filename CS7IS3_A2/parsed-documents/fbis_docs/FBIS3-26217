At present, some 230 million TV sets are owned by China's households, and China ranks first in the world in the annual production of TV sets. However, in 1978 there were only 7.5 million TV sets in China, a country with the largest population in the world. During the early eighties, TV sets were still in short supply in China's big and medium cities, and were rationed. On the black market, however, they were best-selling items. [Video begins with a birds-eye view of modern buildings and then cuts to television production lines, TV stores, TV stations, TV relay stations, and satellite ground receiving stations] China's TV industry has witnessed rapid development in the past 15 years since the introduction of reform and opening up to the outside world. By the end of 1993 there were 614 TV stations in the country, and their programming has increased from the original 9,000 hours per annum to more than 150,000 hours per annum at present. With the continuous progress in the building of a material and spiritual civilization, television sets have made their way into tens of thousands of households, increasingly becoming an indispensable part of the people's daily life in China. Television relay stations, big and small, are everywhere from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau to the shores of the East China Sea, and from the north to the Xisha Qundao [Paracel Islands]. At present some 32,000 satellite ground stations have been built in China, and TV programs now can be viewed by more 81 percent of the population. Today, new TV programs are being constantly introduced in China, and literary and art programs are blossoming in radiant splendor. More than 5,000 sets of TV plays or dramas are televised, and their quality has improved steadily. China's television now reaches, via satellite, more than 61 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Clear Chinese TV programs can be viewed in countries in North America and along the Caribbean Sea. China has established business links with the TV agencies of more than 100 countries and regions in the world. Television has served as a window for China, which is engaged in reform and opening up to the outside world. From this window China has learned something about the world, and through this window the world has been able to witness a China full of vigor and vitality.
