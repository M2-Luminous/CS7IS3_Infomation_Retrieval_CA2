The bulletin carries a photograph of the great leader President Kim Il-song receiving bereaved families of anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and introduces his reminiscences "With the Century". In an article titled "For Nuclear-Free Korea", the bulletin notes that the purpose sought by the United States in its clamour about "nuclear inspection" is to detract the world's attention from its nuclear weapons in South Korea. Saying that there is no ground for the DPRK to allow inspection of even the military base which has no nuclear facilities, it stresses that all the anti-imperialist peace-loving forces must extend support to the Korean people who are striving to realise the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea and achieve the independent and peaceful Reunification of the country.
