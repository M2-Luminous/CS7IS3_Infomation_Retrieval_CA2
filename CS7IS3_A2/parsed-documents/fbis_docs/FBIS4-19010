Talking to representatives of the foreign press gathered in the premier's office, Ciampi said, "Events in Bosnia in these days can do nothing other than confirm Italy in its position pursued up to the present, which provides for joint action to apply maximum pressure to bring peace to Bosnia and, more in general, to all ex-Yugoslavia." After noting that the deployment of NATO warplanes at air bases on Italian territory represents the nation's greater contribution to this effort, the head of government said Italy provided this assistance "with an awareness of the importance, and also the risks, connected to certain positions and can only calmly maintain this position." Earlier today, the Italian press reported that the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, had threatened to make Italy "pay dearly for its complicity in the attack" with reference to the second raid carried out Monday by NATO planes flying out of the Aviano base.
