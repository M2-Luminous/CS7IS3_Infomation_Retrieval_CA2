Generally though, 58 percent of the people favor holding a referendum on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. These findings came to light after a pan-Cypriot public opinion poll was carried out by AMER [Agency for Middle East Research] between 21 April and 9 May. It was based on a random sample of 898 persons 18 years old and over. Eighty-five percent of the people said they had heard something about the confidence-building measures, while the rest had not heard anything or did not know anything about them. Only 27 percent of the people consider the opening of Nicosia Airport to be positive. DISI [Democratic Rally] supporters were the most positive, as opposed to EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] supporters, who were the most negative, followed by AKEL's [Restorative Party of the Working People] supporters. The return of Varosha under UN supervision is considered negative by 42 percent of the refugees and by 17 percent of the non-refugees. Overall, 36 percent of the people were negative and 19 percent said they did not know. Asked whether there should be a referendum for acceptance of the confidence-building measures or not, 58 percent of the people said they are in favor, while 27 percent said the government should decide. Forty-four percent of the people said the confidence-building measures favor the Turks more than us. Only 16 percent said the confidence-building measures will help our side; 24 percent said the measures will help both communities; 9 percent said that neither community will benefit from the measures; and 8 percent said they do not know. The views regarding the UN secretary general's statement, that the confidence-building measures will help new generations to get to know each other, are divided evenly, as 35 percent agree and 35 percent disagree. The financial effects of the implementation of the confidence-building measures do not concern Cypriots, as 43 percent believe that things will remain the same as today, 31 percent say they do not know what will happen, 17 percent believe things will be worse, and only 9 percent said things will be better. The provision for free movement of Turkish Cypriots is considered the most alarming, as only 21 percent agree to it and 65 percent disagree. Thirty-seven percent said the confidence-building measures should not be accepted, 31 percent said they should be accepted and 33 percent did not answer. Thirty-four percent are against a federal solution to the conditions discussed today, 33 percent are in favor, and 33 percent said they do not know or did not answer. Those supporting a federation included 38 percent of DISI and AKEL supporters, 36 percent of DIKO [Democratic Party], and 16 percent of EDEK supporters. Against the federation were 46 percent of EDEK supporters, 40 percent of DIKO, 32 percent of DISI and 28 percent of AKEL supporters.
