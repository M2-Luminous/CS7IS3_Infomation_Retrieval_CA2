Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, made the remarks here on a public occasion on Wednesday [25 May] while commenting on the proposal recently put forward by Chris Patten for establishing a human rights commission in the territory. The human rights of the Hong Kong people are fully guaranteed in the Basic Law, Zhu said, noting that the proposal runs counter to the Basic Law, and therefore, is not conducive to the smooth transition of Hong Kong. He also criticized Patten for paying only lip service to the Sino-British cooperation on the one hand, and constantly setting up new barriers on the other hand. Zhu warned that such a human rights commission would be dismantled in 1997 if it were indeed set up.
