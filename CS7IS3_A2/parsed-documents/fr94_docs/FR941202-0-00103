Subpart T specifies startup and shutdown procedures to be followed by an owner or operator for batch vapor and in-line cleaning machines. 63.6(f)&hyph;(g) Yes Yes l 63.6(h) No No Subpart T does not require compliance with an opacity or visible emission standard. 63.6(i) (1)&hyph;(14) Yes Yes l 63.6(i)(15) No No l 63.6(i)(16) Yes Yes l 63.6(j) Yes Yes l 63.7(a) No Yes Subpart T gives owners or operators the option to perform an idling emission performance test as a way of demonstrating compliance. Other options are also available that do not require a performance test. 63.7(b) No Yes This is only required for those owners or operators that choose the idling emission standard as their compliance option. 63.7(c)(1) No Yes This is only required for those owners or operators that choose the idling emission standard as their compliance option. 63.7(c) (2)&hyph;(3) No No Subpart T does not require a site-specific test plan for the idling emission performance test. 63.7(c)(4) No No Subpart T does not require a performance test that involves the retrieval of gas samples, and therefore this does not apply. 63.7(d) No No Requirements do not apply to the idling emission performance test option. 63.7(e) No Yes l 63.7(f) No Yes l 63.7(g) No Yes Subpart T specifies what is required to demonstrate idling emission standard compliance through the use of the Environmental Protection Agency test method 307 and control device monitoring. Reports and records of testing and monitoring are required for compliance verification. Three runs of the test are required for compliance, as specified in section 63.7(e) of subpart A. 63.7(h) No No Subpart T does not require the use of a performance test to comply with the standard. The idling emission standard option (which requires an idling emission performance test) is an alternative option offered to owners or operators of batch vapor and in-line cleaning machines for compliance flexibility. 63.8 (a)&hyph;(b) Yes Yes l 63.8 (c)&hyph;(e) No No Subpart T does not require the use of continuous monitoring systems to demonstrate compliance. 63.8(f) Yes Yes l 63.8(g) No No Subpart T does not require continuous opacity monitoring systems and continuous monitoring systems data. 63.9(a) (1)&hyph;(4) Yes Yes l 63.9(b)(1) Yes Yes l 63.9(b)(2) Yes Yes Subpart T includes all of those requirements stated in subpart A, except that subpart A also requires a statement as to whether the affected source is a major or an area source, and an identification of the relevant standard (including the source's compliance date). Subpart T also has some more specific information requirements specific to the affected source (see subpart T, sections 63.468(a)&hyph;(b)). 63.9(b)(3) Yes Yes The subpart A and subpart T initial notification reports differ (see above). 63.9(b)(4) No No Subpart T does not require an application for approval of construction or reconstruction. 63.9(b)(5) Yes Yes 63.9(c) Yes Yes 63.9(d) Yes Yes 63.9(e) Yes Yes Under subpart T, this requirement only applies to owners or operators choosing to comply with the idling emissions standard. 63.9(f) No No Subpart T does not require opacity or visible emission observations. 63.9(g)(1) No No Subpart T does not require the use of continuous monitoring systems or continuous opacity monitoring systems. 63.9(h) No No Section 63.468 of subpart T requires an initial statement of compliance for existing sources to be submitted to the Administrator no later than 150 days after the compliance date specified in section 63.460(d) of subpart T. For new sources, this report is to be submitted to the Administrator no later than 150 days from the date specified in section 63.460(c). 63.9(i) Yes Yes l 63.9(j) Yes Yes l 63.10(a) Yes Yes l 63.10(b) No No Recordkeeping requirements are specified in subpart T. 63.10(c) (1)&hyph;(15) No No Subpart T does not require continuous monitoring systems. 63.10(d)(1) Yes Yes l 63.10(d)(2) No No Reporting requirements are specified in subpart T. 63.10(e) (l)&hyph;(2) No No Subpart T does not require continuous emissions monitoring systems. 63.10(e)(3) No No Subpart T does not require continuous monitoring systems. 63.10(e)(4) No No Subpart T does not require continuous opacity monitoring systems. 63.10(f) Yes Yes l 63.11(a) Yes Yes l 63.11(b) No No Flares are not a control option under subpart T. 63.12 (a)&hyph;(c) Yes Yes l 63.13 (a)&hyph;(c) Yes Yes l 63.14 No No Subpart T requirements do not require the use of the test methods incorporated by reference in subpart A. 63.15(a)&hyph;(b) Yes Yes l BCC=Batch Cold Cleaning Machines.
