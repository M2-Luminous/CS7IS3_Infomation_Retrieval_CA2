Ozdem Sanberk, under secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has said that "talks can be held on the new proposals on the condition that the balance between the two sides is not disrupted." Meanwhile, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, has begun his contacts in Ankara. In a statement to CUMHURIYET regarding reports that Ciller has made a concession to President Clinton on the Cyprus problem, Sanberk denied speculations of a difference of opinion between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office on Cyprus. In response to a question on whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was bypassed when Ciller decided to send Ambassador Volkan Vural to Nicosia to hold talks with Rauf Denktas on the new UN proposals during the weekend, Sanberk said: "That is a move that the prime minister has decided to make." Regarding Ciller's visit to the United States, Sanberk said that she made no statement that can be regarded as a "concession." He stressed: "A concession has not been made. Clinton's remarks that important developments will take place in Cyprus in a few days can be regarded as a statement that was prompted by the radical Greek lobby's pressure. The prime minister has said nothing different from the views officials have expressed for a long time. She explained that Turkey wishes to have the Cyprus problem solved. Considering the Greek lobby's pressure, the United States wishes to create an expectation in the world. That may not be a deliberate U.S. policy. The information we have received indicates that the prime minister has not made any promise on the Cyprus problem. However, the Greek Cypriots, the Greek lobby in the United States, and Greek officials have tried to create an expectation of a concession by the Turkish Cypriot side. Clinton's remarks were aimed at satisfying the Greek lobby." Recalling that Turkey is maintaining a policy that is aimed at finding a just and durable solution to the Cyprus problem, Sanberk said: "Prime Minister Ciller's remarks in the United States do not conflict with Turkey's policy. On the contrary, they are within the framework of Turkey's policy. Everyone supports the solution of the Cyprus problem. However, everyone talks about concessions when the question of solving that problem is mentioned. The government is accused of planning to make concessions to get rid of that problem. That approach is a simplification of the matter. Our view on the solution of the problem is that the two communities should hold talks between them and find a solution. Considering Rauf Denktas' policy, we have supported the original form of the package of confidence-building measures. We have not supported the changes that have been made in it in favor of the Greek Cypriots. The policy we have maintained on that has not changed." Sanberk also said that the UN officials have submitted several proposals under the title "draft views" since February and that Denktas has assessed them. Stressing that talks can be held on the new proposals on the condition that the balance between the two sides is not disrupted, Sanberk said that Joe Clark's visit to Turkey was made at his request. He said that it had not been planned before the recent developments.
