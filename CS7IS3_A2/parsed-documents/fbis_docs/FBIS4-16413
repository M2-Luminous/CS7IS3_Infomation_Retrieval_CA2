The first issue on the agenda was a speech by Giorgiy Zhorzholiani, deputy chairman of the Union, who presented a brief outline of major trends and forms of the board's activity during the period following the congress [held in March 1994]. The board confirmed the commission chairmen. It was pointed out that the Union of Citizens is already beginning to put its practical measures into effect. Speaking during debates on determining the political course of the Union, which was the final issue on the agenda, the chairman of the Union of Young Citizens has said that there would be a danger of having an amorphous and unmanageable organization unless the Union were experienced emotionally as an incorporated organism. In addition, it is essential that mistakes should be avoided like those made during the confirmation of members of the government. The state treasury was said to be allocated to people who have not yet passed either a patriotism test or an honesty test. It was also noted that the Union's approval rating would decrease sharply unless a serious program was drafted to be presented to the electorate. According to Zurab Zhvania, general secretary of the Union, there are many serious problems in the Union, but talks about the danger of disorganization are rather exaggerated. Union Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze made a closing speech, and the board passed a resolution.
