Despite the fact that the three-day all-Russian conference of the heads of customs organs that ended yesterday was originally supposed to generalize the results of 1993 operations, the main issues discussed here were problems related to the introduction into customs operations of concepts new to the service. This involves not only a whole series of documents dedicated to customs procedures, but also the transfer to the State Customs Committee of functions as main currency control agent. [Begin box] From the Report of Russian State Customs Committee Chairman Anatoliy Kruglov Following completion of its structural reorganization, the Russian customs service comprises 12 regional directorates, 127 customs offices, and 413 customs check points. According to 1993 freight customs declarations, 1.9 million export and import dispatches were registered, as were 3.2 billion tonnes of freight, 14.7 transportation facilities, and baggage and property of more than 275 million physical persons. According to preliminary data, customs officials put R3.8 trillion [rubles] (including over $970 million) into the Russian federal budget. This constitutes 15 percent of the revenue portion of the federal budget. The export of about 4,000 objects of art and antiquities was prevented. More than 50,000 firearms and ammunition, and over 2.4 tonnes of narcotics were seized. [End box] No matter how impressive the figures sound that are cited in the report of State Customs Committee head Anatoliy Kruglov, the customs service has accumulated more than its share of problems. The main portion of these are related to the introduction of new customs operating procedures. For the majority of customs workers in the regions, their exact role remains a puzzlement. They are confused as to how and for what the required customs fees should be exacted. Assembling employees at the conference not just from the central region but from the outlying areas as well, committee leaders attempted to explain the essence of the operating modes being introduced and procedure for their practical application. Customs employees are troubled most of all, it turns out, by the freight-in-transit mode. The fact of the matter is that in the absence of a precise regulatory statute in this regard, freight often does not reach its intended destination. As we know, it is precisely for this reason that the system of bond duties for excise commodities was introduced. Nonetheless, this measure has not corrected the situation, in the view of customs officials. The customs service has therefore gone one step further and announced the creation of a special customs escort structure. The next sphere of problems examined at the conference concerned the introduction of rigid requirements in the importing of certain commodities and increased customs fees in their regard. In particular, a reduction in volume of imported automobiles was noted. The state budget simply loses as a result. No less serious have been the problems associated with nonreceipt of appropriate hard currency proceeds from exports. Currency control was therefore discussed especially thoroughly at the conference. In spite of customs service efforts, the Russian budget loses something on the order of $10 billion annually, according to data cited at the conference. Although it was in 1993 that the function of main currency controller was transferred to the Russian State Customs Committee, observers believe there is still a long way to go before practical results of this measure are seen. The reasons for this are the absence of technical capabilities for setting up precise customs control over foreign trade operations and the lack of personnel training for this activity. It was reported at the conference that plans call for the establishment in 1994 of a single technological system for registering and controlling the movement of freight and effecting financial deductions. This system is supposed to unite all customs structures--from the customs check point to the State Customs Committee. If successfully instituted, this system will result in significant reductions in the time required to register freight and will enable timely and accurate compilations of customs statistics to be made. But in order for hard currency control to really begin to function--first and foremost with respect to the export of strategic raw materials and later for other commodities, specialized subdivisions are being instituted at all authorized banks which will have direct contact with the Russian State Customs Committee and Federal Currency Control Service. [Begin box] COMMENTARY The conference was essentially a training session for personnel from the localities. According to the Law on Customs Duties and the Customs Code, the authority of the State Customs Committee has been significantly expanded. First of all, in collecting duties, value-added tax, and excise tax from imported production, the State Customs Committee is carrying out fiscal functions. Secondly, in increasing the number of customs operating procedures, the State Customs Committee is controlling a new segment of entrepreneurial activity. Thirdly, the customs service is the pivotal element in the system of hard currency control (for both the Central Bank of Russia and Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations scenarios). It is the customs authorities that start up the mechanism for circulation of information: exporter--State Customs Committee--authorized banks. They can actually dispute the contract prices of exporters and importers. The multi-profile nature of the customs service is turning the State Customs Committee into the department possessing the most powerful arsenal of weapons for effecting real regulation of foreign economic activity.
