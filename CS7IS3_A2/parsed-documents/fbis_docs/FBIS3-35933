The U.N. Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was set up in 1993 to help end fighting between the Government of Georgia and Abkhazian separatist rebels. The council resolution expressed readiness to consider any recommendation from Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali in the next few weeks to increase the force up to a strength of 88. It stressed the need for substantive progress in talks due to resume next month between the two sides on the political status of Abkhazia, fully respecting Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Yuliy Vorontsov, permanent representative of the Russian Federation at the U.N., expressed support for the Georgian side's call to launch a full-scale peacekeeping operation throughout Abkhazia to ensure the return of refugees. He voiced regret that "at this stage the Security Council has been unable to comply with the request made by the Republic of Georgia."
