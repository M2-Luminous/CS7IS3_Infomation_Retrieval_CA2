The only success of the Gaza-Jericho accord is that it has changed the nature of the 46 years of anti-Zionist struggle from demanding total independence to seeking partial autonomy, said the `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial. It noted that the armed struggle against Israel by Hamas was the result of the world community's inability and unwillingness to end the illegal presence of Zionists in Palestine. Armed attacks of Hamas are a natural and justified reaction to Israel's intransigence, said the paper, adding that the Zionists had showen repeatedly that the only language they understand "comes from the barrel of a gun." The basic stand of Hamas stemed from religious beliefs, and war was not considered sacred to Hamas, but was used as a means to achieve an end, it noted. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) "can give away the rights of its followers by signing the Gaza-Jericho accord. But, by the same token, Hamas has as much right to choose the path of its struggle against the Zionist occupiers," it said. The daily concluded by saying that Palestinians desired justice more than they need peace and Hamas held the view that peace without reinstatement of full Palestinians rights, was not preferable to war.
