The famous model, which has been produced in various versions since 1962 and is used by the thousands throughout the world, will carry out a series of demonstrations throughout the country before touring other Latin American countries, according to Uralaz general manager Anatole Guben Uliantzeff. Uralaz-Chile has purchased an MI-17, the largest helicopter operating in Chile, with which it hopes to make many deals. Guben said: "We set up our enterprise one year ago with 30 percent Chilean capital. Despite the fact that we specialize in Russian military technology, we started off importing bulldozers and trucks such as the `Ural' truck, which due to its size can be used, among other purposes, to carry surveillance radars." The businessman commented that so far they have been very successful and hope to be even more so with the MI-17 because it will meet needs that no other helicopter now used in Chile does. He noted that one of the MI-17's advantages is its price, which is no more than $3 million, while a similar helicopter in the Western Hemisphere costs more than $12 million. Regarding its safety measures, Gubin said it fulfills all international safety measures and the company currently is applying for a permit to fly it in Chile. "For the time being we have a temporary permit."
