Pallais, in statements made on the phone from his house in Leon, said: "I do not see the need to resort to The Hague to resolve matters which we, as friendly countries, can discuss ourselves." The Nicaraguan Government informed Costa Rican authorities that it "would implement immigration controls on tourism activities carried out on that river" and would charge a $5 fee for each person who used the river for tourism. "Nicaragua is free to implement the measures it feels necessary on its territory, and Costa Rica has to respect our decisions," Pallais underscored. The Costa Rican president told the Costa Rican newspaper LA REPUBLICA over the weekend that he did not agree with the measures implemented by Nicaragua because the Canas-Jerez Treaty established free transit on the San Juan without any type of preference. Calderon requested his foreign minister, Bernd Niehaus, to establish immediate negotiations with Nicaraguan authorities. "If an agreement is not reached, the future Costa Rican administration -- headed by Jose Figueres -- will have to present the case at the International Court of Justice, although we expect that will not be necessary," he said. Pallais reaffirmed Nicaragua's right to safeguard its sovereignty over the San Juan River as established in the Canas-Jerez Treaty signed last century. He said the treaty stipulates that Costa Ricans cannot navigate more than three miles of the river, much less navigate up to Nicaragua Lake, which is where Costa Ricans go in a clear violation of our sovereignty.
