Camacho Solis said a few minutes ago that he joins in with all Mexicans to reject the attack perpetrated this afternoon against Luis Donaldo Colosio. What happened, said Colosio, is a big offense against his family and against all of us. Here is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from Chiapas. [Antoyo] Camacho Solis was to give a report, a summary on the Chiapas situation. We were summoned at 1900 [0100 GMT] but the message did not arrive. Suddenly there was silence and reactions were soon felt; the news was released. Manuel Camacho Solis arrived one hour later to give this brief statement that he had written by hand on a piece of paper. The following is his message: [Begin Camacho Solis recording] The information I was to release today will be made known in the following days. I have just communicated with Mexico City and was told that Luis Donaldo Colosio is in the hands of the best Mexican doctors. I join the whole nation's indignation for the attack against Luis Donaldo Colosio's life. What occurred is an attack against peace and democracy in the nation. The highest value is the individual's life and his dignity. What has occurred is a great offense against his family, all our families, and the nation. [end recording] [Antoyo] This is all Camacho Solis said.
