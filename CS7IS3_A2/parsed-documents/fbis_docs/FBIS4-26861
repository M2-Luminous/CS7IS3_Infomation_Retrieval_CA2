White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that "President Clinton and Prime Minister Hata enjoyed a good working relationship." "We regret the decision" by Hata to offer his resignation, Myers said in a statement. Hata announced this morning on June 25 that he and his cabinet will resign to avoid defeat in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. His announcement came less than an hour before the parliament was scheduled to open debate on a no-confidence motion that appeared likely to carry. Myers said that "the United States will continue to work closely with the Government of Japan as only allies and friends can at a moment of political change."
