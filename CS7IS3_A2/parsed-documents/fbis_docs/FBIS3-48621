A policeman, Police Officer 3 Leody Ray Lumibao, and a militia man, Alfredo Lorenzo, were seriously wounded in the attack. Political analysts considered the attack as significant since it was the first time that communist rebels mounted such an operation after their retreat to their mountain sanctuaries years ago. The communist-led New People's Army (NPA) was founded in Cepa, Tarlac, in March 1969 and it opted to use the Central Plains as a support base rather than a target for rebel attacks. The reports said the rebels, numbering about 35, attacked the police detachment in Iba, San Jose, Tarlac, at about 7:45 A.M. At least four of the raiders were believed wounded in the exchange of fire. The rebels raided the detachment using two passenger jeepneys commandeered in San Jose, Tarlac, the reports said. The drivers, Nicolas Apan and Pedro Balagtas, have been held for "tactical interrogation" at the Tarlac PNP [Philippine National Police] headquarters. Four M-14 assault rifles, one M-16, four M-1 Garand rifles and one carbine were taken by the rebels from the policemen. The PNP's 181st Mobile Force Company (MFC) is pursuing the withdrawing rebels, while the 185th MFC has set up a blocking force at the Capas-San Jose and the San Jose-Mayantoc boundaries. Earlier, defense and military officials said that the government can achieve "strategic victory" within this year, claiming that the military has already regained control over several barangays [villages] formerly controlled by the CPP [Communist Party of the Philippines]-NPA. The communist movement has suffered major setbacks after the popular revolt against the Marcos regime. It is currently being wracked by a major internal crisis.
