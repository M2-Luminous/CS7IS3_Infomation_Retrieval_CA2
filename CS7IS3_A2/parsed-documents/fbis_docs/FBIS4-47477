Vesnicheva and A.Yu. Ivanov, St. Peterburg Institute of Aviation Instrument Engineering; 07;02] [Abstract] Considering that stable radiation emission by a liquid laser requires a sufficiently large number of molecules in the active medium, a uniform distribution of the liquid over the emission zone, and a precisely aligned high-Q dispersive optical cavity, these conditions are applied to dye lasers featuring the best performance characteristics of all: not only wavelength-tunability over the 0.26-1.3 ï¿½m range and up to 10 kW power emission pulse but also compactness and cost effectiveness. When dye and solvent are being thoroughly mixed while being pumped by pulse trains of optical radiation, however, both hydrodynamic and photothermodynamic turbulence with attendant heat-induced convection of the solution will inevitably develop as the dye flow rate and the pump radiation intensity exceed the respective critical ones. The result will be randomization of the emission process with attendant lowering of both pump and laser efficiency. In search of a way to avoid this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance. As the main limiting factors are regarded not only both turbulence modes and thermal convection but also photodecay of dye molecules upon incidence of a pumping radiation pulse, their subsequent restoration, and the stroboscopic effect. As the optimum construction of the active element is selected a cylindrical cell with dye solution and a cylindrical mixing device inside. Thus are established the conditions under which a ``window'' will exist in the dependence of emission irregularity on the dye flow characteristics and the pump radiation characteristics within which the emission process is least disordered, allowing a dye flow rate sufficiently high for stable replacement of dye molecules during the interval between pump radiation pulses. The relations established in this analysis indicate the feasibility of a laser with dye molecules in different instantaneous states and thus of wavelength tuning without a resonator. A rhodamine-6G laser pumped by a neodymium laser with second-harmonic 10 kW radiation pulses of 10 ns duration was designed and built. Tests revealed no turbulence throughout the 1.2x10[.sup]-7[/]-1333 l/s range of dye flow through the emission zone. References 8.
