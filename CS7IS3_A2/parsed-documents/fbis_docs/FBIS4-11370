He stated that this "does not affect in the least" Argentina's chances of selling the aircraft to the United States. In remarks made at the Defense Ministry when asked about the theft that took place at the Cordoba Materiel Area, Camilion noted: "No confidential material, designs, or manufacturing processes have been stolen." The minister stated moreover that the hard disks stolen from four computers in a Material Area office "have nothing to do with the designs for the plane." "A truck would be needed to steal them," said Camilion ironically in referring to the designs for the Pampa, a modern trainer. The minister further stated that the theft -- which occurred between 21 and 31 January while personnel from the Materiel Area were on holiday -- "does not affect in the least" the Pampa's chances of being the successful bidder at the international bid to take place in the United States on 12 May. On that date, the U.S. Armed Forces will decide on the purchase of 700 trainer aircraft, the cost of which will range between $5 million and $7 million [figures as received]. Companies from Italy, Brazil, the United States, Germany, and Switzerland will participate in this international bid in addition to Argentina. [passage omitted]
