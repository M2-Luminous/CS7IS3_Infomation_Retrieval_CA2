FBIS4-11796 "drnes063_l_94014" FBIS-NES-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ISRAEL `New' IDF Evacuation Plan From Strip Detailed `New' IDF Evacuation Plan From Strip Detailed TA0104115294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 1 Apr 94 p A3 TA0104115294 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] [Text] Under agreements achieved yesterday in Cairo, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will permit the international force due to deploy in Hebron to set up constructions, such as observation points and offices. Members of the force will be free to drive their cars about and to perform various construction-related tasks without IDF intervention. A senior military source said last night that he did not think the IDF would be able to complete the Gaza evacuation within 72 hours. "The new plan approved by the IDF indicates that from the moment the Gaza and Jericho agreement is signed, or from 13 April, the IDF will require three weeks to complete its withdrawal. We need this time, and we will not be able to carry out the task in less time," he said. The military source stressed that the evacuation of Army buildings and bases from the Gaza Strip, which was launched in recent months, was not a comprehensive evacuation and it did not include the evacuation of operational infrastructure. According to the IDF plan, no operational troops are to pull out of the Strip as long as no agreement has been signed. According to the new plan, the evacuation agenda will be as follows: In the first stage, the Hof 'Aza detention facility; in the second stage, the hotel in which policemen are quartered; later, small bases scattered throughout the Strip; in the fourth stage, observation posts and outposts; and in the last stage, the division and brigades command. "There will be no actual evacuation until the agreement is signed. We are reducing the number of our troops, but not those of operational nature," the senior source said yesterday. The implementation of the new evacuation plan began yesterday with the evacuation of Ansar 2, the Hof 'Aza detention facility. The Palestinian detainees and prisoners held in this facility will be moved to Qezi'ot prison. The military source said yesterday that the whole facility will very soon be handed over to the Palestinian police. As soon as the facility is cleared, the Army will evacuate the hotel used as night quarters by Gaza District policemen and as an office building. Rather than demolish the evacuated buildings, the IDF leaves them intact, including their electricity and water mains. The IDF has not sold any equipment to the Palestinians, and all the equipment will be moved out. The military source said that the Army continues the construction of new installations in the Qatif Bloc concurrently with the evacuation. Some settlements have agreed to the IDF's building the installations inside their boundaries. The General Staff Logistics Branch has decided not to call up extra reserve troops for the evacuation. The evacuation process is being assisted by officers who participated in the evacuation of the Sinai bases, and an attempt is being made to apply the lessons learned there to the Gaza situation. The IDF has begun evacuating facilities in Jericho as well.
