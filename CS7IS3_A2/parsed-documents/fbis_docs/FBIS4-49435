FBIS4-49435 "drchi088_k_94014" FBIS-CHI-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Authorities Suppress Journal, Promote RENMIN RIBAO Authorities Suppress Journal, Promote RENMIN RIBAO HK0505052794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 5 May 94 p 12 HK0505052794 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] [Text] Beijing has put pressure on a group of liberal intellectuals to stop publishing an avant-garde journal. The authorities have also tried to boost the sales and influence of the People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] by launching several regional editions. Chinese sources said yesterday the editors of the magazine JINGPIN (ELITE) could not find an official book registration number to publish its third edition. The two previous editions had been published earlier this year under a temporary registration number, which had expired. The editors and contributors of JINGPIN are influential intellectuals and ex-officials associated with the former party chiefs Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. They include former PEOPLE'S DAILY editor Qin Chuan, former culture minister Wang Meng, and liberal economist Yu Guangyuan. While this group did not openly support the 1989 democracy movement, it is understood that the authorities fear the liberal intellectuals might give "spiritual support" to the underground dissident movement. "All the articles for the third edition are ready," a source close to the magazine said. "Our failure to get a registration number is a sign the authorities are getting tough with dissent." Meanwhile, the Propaganda Department of the party is anxious to reverse the decline in the sales of a large number of official mouthpieces, including the PEOPLE'S DAILY, whose circulation last year reportedly dropped by almost 20 percent. Media analysts in Beijing said the party had given the green light for the paper to launch several regional editions, the first of which will appear in the East China area. Cadres on the People's Daily said they hoped the new editions, which will have more local content, would help to stem the decline in circulation. It will be the first launch of regional editions by a national paper. Sources in the paper said the editorial policy remained "rigid and doctrinaire" despite the appointment in the past year of two moderates, Fan Jingyi and Zhou Ruijin, as chief editor and vice- chief editor. Mr Zhou, considered a protege of President Jiang Zemin, sat at the same table as Mr Jiang when the latter hosted a Lunar New Year banquet for the leaders of the Beijing media. While the authorities are clamping down on liberal journals, they have not stopped efforts by the Maoist ideologues to discredit the reform policy. Chinese sources said commissars led by Deng Liqun, a former head of propaganda, had started writing a series of articles on how patriarch Deng Xiaoping's open-door policy could encourage the growth of capitalism and a "new class of exploiters". These articles are to be published after the death of Mr Deng. The sources said Mr Deng and his family were aware of the "anti-reform articles," but they had decided not to take action. Moreover, the remnant Maoists still have a stranglehold over many departments within the Central Committee. The sources added that to ensure his predominant position in the post-Deng era, Mr Jiang had formed alliances with the ideologues.
