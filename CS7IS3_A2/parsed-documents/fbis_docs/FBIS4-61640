As of late March these include 18.6 percent of all industrial enterprises -- as opposed to 8.2 percent at the end of 1993. The largest percentage of unprofitable enterprises has been registered in the fuel and energy complex -- 30.7 percent of them as against 17.2 percent at the start of the year, in second place is the food industry (20.8 percent as against 5.9 percent), third is metallurgy (17.2 percent as against 4.2 percent), and fourth is machine building (16 percent as against 6.2 percent). The report stresses that the first quarter of 1994 has been the period which has seen the most considerable reduction in industrial output at any time during the course of the reforms -- which is to a considerable extent related to the intensive impact of demand constraints on the economy.
