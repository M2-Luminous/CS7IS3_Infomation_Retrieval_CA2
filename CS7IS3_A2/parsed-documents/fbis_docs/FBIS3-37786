So said Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, to his U.S. counterpart William Perry during a telephone conversation Monday evening. The conversation over the "hot line" was conducted by the Russian defense minister from his office and lasted around an hour. It was the latest in a series of extraordinary telephone contacts devoted to the situation around the Bosnian capital. Army Gen. P. Grachev expressed concern that he still is not clearly aware of the Bosnian Muslim side's intentions as regards the fulfillment of NATO's demands and in particular with regard to the Russian contingent's presence in Sarajevo. He voiced misgivings that provocations against Russian servicemen might bring a drastic deterioration in the situation and disrupt the efforts being made by Russia and the NATO countries. In this connection Pavel Grachev suggested that the U.S. side consider Russia's proposal for a U.S. military contingent to be sent to Sarajevo and stationed on Muslim-controlled territory. According to Army Gen. P. Grachev, W. Perry promised to brief President Bill Clinton on this proposal. However, the Pentagon chief deemed it necessary to stress that the White House does not as yet have any plans to send its contingent to Bosnia. At the Russian defense minister's request his U.S. counterpart briefly explained the NATO Council's stance on the question of the Serbian side's fulfilment of NATO's demands, which effectively boils down to the idea that, if the Bosnian capital is threatened again, that may be sufficient cause for bombing raids. Without rejecting that approach, Army Gen. P. Grachev in turn again emphasized the immutability of Russia's position, which considers air strikes on any of the conflicting parties' facilities to be intolerable. At the close of the conversation the ministers expressed their satisfaction with the level of mutual understanding and cooperation. It was agreed to continue their contacts on Bosnia once a week. When asked by journalists whether the threat of bombing should be considered to have been removed once and for all, Pavel Grachev replied that he thinks air strikes "unlikely." As for the additional contingent from Russia that will be sent to Sarajevo if the State Duma gives its approval, according to the Russian minister, it "will not necessarily be manned by airborne troops." Units of the 27th and 46th Motorized Rifle Divisions have been trained to perform peacekeeping functions [K vypolneniyu mirotvorcheskikh funktsiy podgotovleni....
