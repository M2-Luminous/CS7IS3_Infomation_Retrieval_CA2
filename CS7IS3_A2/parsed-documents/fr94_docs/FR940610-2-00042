FR940610-2-00042 FR940610-2-00034 [ER&hyph;FRL&hyph;4712&hyph;2] Environmental Impact Statements and Regulations; Availability of EPA Comments Availability of EPA comments prepared May 23, 1994 through May 27, 1994 pursuant to the Environmental Review Process (ERP), under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act and Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act as amended. Requests for copies of EPA comments can be directed to the Office of Federal Activities at (202) 260&hyph;5076. An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements (EISs) was published in FR dated April 8, 1994 (59 FR 16807). Draft EISs ERP No. D&hyph;BLM&hyph;E65044&hyph;FL Rating EC2, Florida Land and Resource Management Plan, Implementation, Split-Estate Federal Mineral Ownership (FMO), several counties, FL. Summary: EPA supported alternative 2, but expressed environmental concerns regarding the potential wetland and wading bird impacts. ERP No. D&hyph;FHW&hyph;K40202&hyph;CA Rating EO2, CA&hyph;58_Mojave Freeway Project, Construction from 0.1 mile east of the Cache Creek Bridge to 5.0 miles east of the town of Mojave, Funding, COE Section 404 Permit and Right-of-Way Acquisition, Kern County, CA. Summary: EPA expressed environmental objections due to the loss and fragmentation of habitat for the desert tortoise, a species listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The preferred alternative affects the most desert tortoise habitat despite the US Fish & Wildlife Service's strong recommendation to avoid habitat loss and fragmentation. EPA's second objection was the failure of the draft EIS to address the requirements of the Clean Water Act Section 404 or its regulations. The preferred alternative had the most impact to waters of the United States, according to the draft EIS. The final EIS needs to address the project's consistency with Section 404 requirements, including impact mitigation. ERP No. D&hyph;FHW&hyph;L40189&hyph;WA Rating EC2, WA&hyph;525/Paine Field Boulevard Project, Improvements, between WA&hyph;99 to WA&hyph;526, Funding and COE Section 404 Permit, City of Mukitteo, Snohomish County, WA. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns about the potential for adverse impacts on water quality, wetlands and fisheries resources. EPA had requested additional information on effects of the estimated annual pollutant load on water quality, effectiveness of mitigation, and potential impacts on natural resources from indirect effects, secondary and cumulative impacts. ERP No. D&hyph;NPS&hyph;K61128&hyph;CA Rating EC2, Santa Rosa Island Development Concept Plan, Implementation and Funding, Channel Islands National Park, Santa Barbara County, CA. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding potential adverse impacts to water quality from the project, particularly construction-related impacts. The final EIS should closely examine potential project impacts to water quality and water quality mitigation measures which may prove necessary under the Clean Water Act (stormwater permitting from construction actions, consistency with California's nonpoint source management program). The final EIS should provide details on hazardous substances which could have emanated from a defunct air force base on the Island. Final EISs ERP No. F&hyph;AFS&hyph;K67021&hyph;NV, Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine Expansion Project, Implementation, Plan of Operation and COE Section 404 Permit, Humboldt National Forest, Mountain City Ranger District, Elko County, NV. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns about the new information in the final EIS on the acid potential of waste rock at the project site, EPA had serious concerns regarding waste rock characterization, handling and disposal. ERP No. F&hyph;DOE&hyph;L05204&hyph;WA, Tenaska_Washington II Generation Electric Power Plant Construction, Operation and NPDES Permit, Pierce County, WA. Summary: EPA had a lack of objection to the proposed project. ERP No. F&hyph;FAA&hyph;L51014&hyph;WA, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Improvement, South Aviation Support Area, Airport Layout Plan, Airport Master Plan, Funding, Section 10 and 404 Permits and NPDES Permit, Port of Seattle, King County, WA. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns based on potential effects to wetland and aquatic resources. EPA recommended the development of a wetland plan that is an enforceable condition of a 404 permit. Mitigation measures to deal with flow attenuation in Des Moines Creek remain inadequate. EPA recommended that the types and amounts of pollutants that will enter Puget Sound be documented in the Record of Decision. ERP No. F&hyph;IBR&hyph;K39032&hyph;CA, All-American Canal (AAC) Lining Project, Construction and Operation, Lining a 23-mile Canal from Pilot Knob to Drop 4, Controlling Water Seepage, Imperial Irrigation District, Imperial County, CA. Summary: EPA had no objection to the proposed action. Dated: June 7, 1994. Marshall Cain, Senior Legal Advisor, Office of Federal Activities.
