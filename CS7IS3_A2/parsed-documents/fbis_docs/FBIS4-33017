Zaldivar, whose comments were released today, said he was really impressed with the dramatic situation affecting the Cuban people, who "are starving because rationing is brutally strict." Zaldicar, who belongs to the most important party in the coalition governing Chile, said cooperation must be sought to find a political solution that would allow Cuba to evolve toward democracy. According to Zaldivar, the way to reach a political opening must be discussed with Cuban President Fidel Castro. He said: "Fidel Castro is maintaining his leadership. I saw that. The people are with Fidel Castro. And we should take note of that." Zaldivar has the impression that Cuba is a besieged region in the medieval sense, which even creates the fear that the crisis may evolve into a collective sacrifice, which he believes would be inadmissible. He added: "We should follow a path toward opening up relations, not with the objective of validating a regime with which I disagree, but in order to help Cuba in a transition toward democracy." During his stay in Havana, Zaldivar met with the Cuban ministers of finance and agriculture, but he did not have any contact with the opposition. Christian Democratic Party President Gutemberg Martinez, however, will meet with all Cuban political sectors during the visit he will make to Cuba in the next few days. Zaldivar went to Cuba as president of the Spanish foundation Ibero-American-European Research and Promotion Center, which he created when he was living in exile in Madrid. Diplomatic relations between Havana and Santiago were broken in 1973 after the military coup that overthrew the Chilean Socialist government headed by Salvador Allende. Relations were resumed at the consular level in 1990 after the return of democracy in Chile. Various Chilean Socialist and Social Democratic sectors of the government Coalition of Parties for Democracy have expressed support for the full reestablishment of relations with Cuba, which is expected to be achieved in the next few weeks.
