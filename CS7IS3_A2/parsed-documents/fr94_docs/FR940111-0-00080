FR940111-0-00080 FR940111-0-00019 Some ANPR commenters asserted that funeral providers, in response to emerging competition in the sale of caskets from cemeteries and other third-parties, charge high ``casket handling fees'' for arrangements where consumers supply their own caskets purchased from those third parties. 117 The alleged purpose of these fees was to recoup overhead costs and profits built into casket prices but lost on the third-party casket sales. The Commission in the NPR thus sought comment on the existence and impact of so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and on whether, and how, the Rule should address that practice. 118 117 See R&hyph;A&hyph;1 (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking) at 19867. 118 Id. at 19870 (Question 14). a. Existence and impact. Members of the third-party, casket seller industry 119 provided empirical and other evidence on the purpose, widespread existence and impact of these ``casket handling fees.'' Casket seller representatives asserted that the emergence of third-party casket sellers is directly attributable to the Funeral Rule's ``unbundling'' provision; those sales were virtually non-existent before the Rule. 120 A PAA official who presented the results of a PAA membership survey (the ``PAA Survey'') on handling fee issues, Mr. Duke Radovich, estimated that there are between 100 and 200 casket retailers in the country. 121 119 Third-party casket sellers generally were represented during this review by the PAA. 120 R&hyph;M&hyph;12 (PAA) at 18, 82. See also, Radovich, Tr. Vol. III, 1029 (Casket retailers owe their existence primarily to the enactment of the Funeral Rule, which allows the consumer to use a casket from an outside source); and Drozda, Tr. Vol. II, 894 (few casket retailers before the Rule because providers would not accept the outside casket and provide funeral service). 121 Radovich, Tr. Vol. III, 1057 (31 of the 90 survey respondents were active third-party casket sellers at the time of the survey). He reported that these thirty-one active casket retailers are located in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; 74% of those sellers exist in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio. Id; HX&hyph;101 at Exhibit ``A&hyph;3.'' The PAA Survey provided empirical evidence on the widespread existence and amount of ``casket handling fees,'' as reported by the respondent retailers. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said that at least 60% of the funeral homes in their market area assess handling fees, about two-thirds said that 80% to 100% charge the fees, and one-quarter reported that all of the homes impose the casket handling fee. 122 Mr. Radovich concluded that a substantial number of providers assess ``casket handling fees'' wherever third-party sellers exist. 123 Individual casket retailers agreed with that finding, 124 and further testified that funeral providers began imposing handling fees when third-party casket sellers entered the market. 125 122 Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at 17 and Ex. B, p. 5. 123 Id. at 12, 17, 20. 124 See Neel, HX&hyph;25 at 4 and Exhibit 2; Teck, HX&hyph;58 at 5&hyph;6 and Ex. B; and Heffner, HX&hyph;33 at 8 and Ex. J&hyph;1. 125 Graf, Tr. Vol. II, 647; Neel, Tr. Vol. I, 582&hyph;584; and Teck, Tr. Vol. II, 861&hyph;862. See also, Showalter, Tr. Vol. II, 118. One funeral provider witness who did not charge handling fees stated on the record that, if he got competition from casket retailers, he would begin to assess fees. Hennessy, Tr. Vol. II, 997. Concerning the amount of ``casket handling fees'' assessed, 81% of the PAA Survey respondents said that the average handling fee was over $300; 74% reported an average fee between $300 and $500. 126 Sixty-two percent of the PAA Survey respondents further reported that the highest fee charged was over $500; 35% said that the largest fee was over $700. 127 A ``handling fee'' of $500 was nearly equal to the average wholesale cost of a casket in 1988 ($517) and 60% of the average casket mark-up in that year ($821). 128 Wendell Hahn of the FFDA, which provides financial advising services to 1,500 providers in 30 states, testified that handling fees are assessed because providers, who typically charge professional service fees ``hundreds of dollars'' below their true operation cost, will try to recoup those costs that are lost by the third-party casket sale. Mr. Hahn concluded that handling fees are thus roughly equal to the amount that providers' non-declinable service fees are underpriced. 129 126 Radovich, HX&hyph;101 at 18 and Ex. B, p. 6. 127 Id. 128 See Hahn, FFDA, HX&hyph;49 at 2. The average mark-up in 1988 was $1,338 (average retail casket price) minus $517 (average wholesale cost), or $821. By definition, a handling fee must be ``high'' if its purpose is to recoup overhead costs and profit lost on the casket sale. 129 Tr. Vol. II, 692&hyph;693. Mr. Hahn further suggested that by failing to disclose the amount of overhead not included in the non-declinable professional services fee, providers may be engaged in deceptive pricing. Id. at 671. Several local surveys conducted by individual casket retailers provided further evidence on the range of ``casket handling fees'' in given market areas. Those surveys found that handling fees ranged from $100 to $700 in Chicago; DeSoto, R&hyph;B&hyph;42; and Hennessy, HX&hyph;61 at 8; from $150 to $1000 in Greater Pittsburgh; Neel, HX&hyph;25, Exhibit 2 at 1; and from $100 to $800 in Detroit, Michigan; Teck, HX&hyph;58, Exhibit A. Wendell Hahn of the FFDA reported six instances among a sampling of funeral home records he reviewed for the month of August 1988 where handling fees ranging from $75 to $480 were disclosed on providers' GPLs. HX&hyph;49 at 5, Tr. Vol. II, 673, 719&hyph;720. Other witnesses, including two funeral directors, testified to the existence of handling fees ranging from $425 to $2,500. See Showalter, Tr. Vol. II, 120; HX&hyph;36, at 17 (citing an open letter from Steve Shurden, President of the Oklahoma Funeral Directors Association, printed in The Oklahoma Director , Vol. XV, No. 9 (Sept. 1985) at 1) ($1,000&hyph;$2,500); Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 412 ($700); and Drozda, Tr. Vol. II, 896&hyph;897 ($425).
