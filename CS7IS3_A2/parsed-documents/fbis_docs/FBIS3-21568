This Time in a Railway Siding"] [Text] Ukraine has suspended the evacuation of nuclear warheads to Russia. As SEGODNYA reported in its 2 March issue, 60 "Ukrainian" nuclear warheads dismantled from the strategic missiles of the 46th (Pervomayskaya) Missile Division of the 43d Missile Army were delivered to embarkation points on flatcars of a special high- security train. But then everything stopped going according to plan: the train did not arrive at its destination -- the "electromechanical" plant in a closed town run by the Atomic Industry Ministry in the Urals region where nuclear charges are assembled (and dismantled).... It will be recalled that on 14 January a tripartite Russian-U.S.- Ukrainian agreement was signed in Moscow on conditions for the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In subsequent weeks, experts on both sides prepared a coordinated schedule for the evacuation of the nuclear warheads. Specialists of the Russian Defense Ministry's 12th Main Directorate managed (with the assistance of the Ukrainian military) to resolve all technical problems within an early period. The warheads were delivered to the embarkation point and prepared for shipment. The Ukrainian side, however, suddenly suspended the withdrawal, demanding confirmation that the Russian Atomic Industry Ministry will in March supply to Ukraine fuel assemblies for its nuclear power plants in exchange for the warheads. Ukraine badly needs nuclear fuel, with its power industry being on the verge of closure. But so far there has been no confirmation from Moscow about nuclear fuel supplies. Therefore the Ukrainian side also put on hold the loading of warheads because it is not at all safe to keep nuclear munitions "on wheels." Meanwhile the Ukrainian president has begun his visit to Washington. Earlier it was expected that Leonid Kravchuk would report to President Clinton about the start of real implementation of the 14 January agreement which was apparently supposed to raise Kiev's prospects of getting U.S. economic assistance. At the end of February, however, the general atmosphere of Russian-U.S. relations changed: the Ames case, followed by mutual deportation of diplomats and the demands in Congress to freeze U.S. aid to Russia.... Kiev must have concluded that the orientation of U.S. foreign policy is changing and now there will be no direct linkage between economic assistance and the nuclear issue -- and the time has finally come for Ukraine also to show firmness in its relations with Moscow. True, Moscow is behaving far from impeccably. To date the question about who will pay for fuel deliveries has not been settled. The Atomic Industry Ministry cannot just present fuel assemblies from its stocks to Ukraine as a gift: people in closed cities are also experiencing difficulties over the nonpayment of wages. As a result, the military just sits waiting with its dangerous, restless cargo until the politicians have figured out what has to come first, "the money or the goodies." Meanwhile the Russian Gazprom has already started to cut gas supplies to Ukraine, and this can hardly improve the general atmosphere of deep mutual distrust between Moscow and Kiev.
