He does not see any credible possibility of forming any other majority coalition. "I want to return to the `purple' option," Van Mierlo stated on Monday evening [27 June] after his news conference on the failure of the current round of talks to form a "purple" coalition. The D66 leader accepts that the position he has taken greatly increases the likelihood of a minority coalition. Van Mierlo asserted that it was VVD leader Bolkestein who had rendered impossible the option of a center-right cabinet in which D66 would be willing to participate. Bolkestein is demanding more interference in the budget and social security than D66 and the PvdA are ready to accept. According to Van Mierlo, the "purple" coalition-to-be had already come a long way. He believes that only a coalition with a new composition will be able to withstand the burden of 18 billion guilders in spending cuts. "A center-right coalition is not in a position to produce such a package without causing a lot of damage." In mid-May, Van Mierlo, who with his 24 seats is indispensable to a majority coalition, described a center-left coalition with the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] as "lacking credibility." Yesterday evening, he restated this view. "How could the CDA and the PvdA after some four years in government and a severe election defeat credibly claim that they are going to pursue a totally different policy? Can you ask parties to do that? I mean, you can always forgive, but that is no basis on which to form a government." Van Mierlo says: "I still see the only way of arriving at a majority cabinet as being with a `purple' coalition." Van Mierlo admitted that putting together a coalition at this point in time would serve no purpose. VVD leader Bolkestein also rejected the idea of such an attempt. Van Mierlo now hopes that it will become clear in the course of the following weeks that a majority coalition between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66 is the only possibility. "But I recognize the danger that others will form a minority government in the meantime," the D66 leader stated. Today, the leaders of all parties must again consult the Queen. At the beginning of May, the PvdA had said that their second option after a "purple" coalition would be a center-left government, while the VVD opted for a center-right government. In recent weeks, Bolkestein has often repeated that he would prefer to join the opposition ranks if the new government was not committed to a firm policy. The CDA probably wants an "informer" [a politician appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various coalitions] to look at the possibility of a government comprising the CDA, the VVD, and D66. With the exception of "informer" Van Ardenne (VVD), VVD leader Bolkestein yesterday drew the blame from all concerned for the present failure. Bolkestein: "That leaves me cold." He strongly denied that he had laid new proposals on the table. He said that earlier in the negotiations he had already described cutbacks on, among other things, defense and infrastructure, as unjustified and unacceptable. The VVD leader was unwilling to accept a proposal by PvdA leader Kok to find a creative solution to these budget problems on a year-to-year basis. Kok: "A slight fall in the rate of the dollar would cause the same problems." Bolkestein: "It would have been a time bomb under the next government. I want nothing to do with it." Rather than this, the VVD leader wanted increased intervention in welfare payments, which was not acceptable to the PvdA. Kok: "This was obviously necessary to relieve the state budget and people on welfare are always there to be penalized. Bolkestein should have known that with such a proposal for social policy he would be going beyond the limits of what is a fair balance." Bolkestein: "What was laid on the table now was the core of a government agreement for a fourth Lubbers government without any substantial measures. I am not going to sign up to that." Van Mierlo: "Even if this government is able to save 18 billion guilders? I must say that it is not the point. The old cliches are back again." Van Mierlo: "It is a great disappointment. Bolkestein wanted everything, and immediately. It is of course crazy not to bring any creativity to the process." Yesterday afternoon, Crown "informers" De Vries (PvdA), Van Ardenne (VVD), and Vis (D66) relinquished their mandate after it became clear on Sunday afternoon [26 June] that negotiations for a "purple" coalition had come stuck on Bolkestein's objections to a provisional accord on the main lines of a social, economic, and financial policy. The effects of this accord had been calculated by the Central Plan Bureau (CPB). The results were positively received by the PvdA and D66 "informers." De Vries: "I thought on Saturday evening when the CPB figures arrived: That looks good." The growth in jobs would be as much as 117,000 or even 140,000 in a more optimistic version. Two-thirds of the job growth would be in the market sector. These results do not vary very much from the VVD election program. The relationship between the employed and the unemployed would improve, from around 86 unemployed to less than 85 unemployed for every 100 employed. The fall in purchase power, the sensitive point for the PvdA, would remain limited. Neither those on minimum or average wages, with the exception of civil servants, would have to contribute anything.
