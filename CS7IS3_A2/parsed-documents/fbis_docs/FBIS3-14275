These pressures have recently been intensified with the aim of forcing Jordan to sign a separate peace treaty with the Israelis. The U.S. envoy, however, refused to make any promises that these pressures would be lifted. He said only that his government would study the Jordanian demands. The U.S. Administration stepped up its pressures on Jordan during the U.S. envoy's tour of the region by intercepting ships and holding them in international waters, sometimes for over a week, on the pretext of inspecting them or the claim that they are carrying banned goods bound for Iraq. Washington asked the Jordanian Government through its envoy Dennis Ross to end the second and third degree Arab boycott of Israel and support the Arab states calling for the lifting of this boycott at the Arab League meetings in Cairo next Saturday. The U.S. envoy said that the continuation of the U.S. and European aid to Jordan is conditional on Amman's response to the following specific U.S. terms and conditions: 1. Expediting negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track. 2. Sparing talk about the issue of Jerusalem because this will be discussed in the final stages of the peace process. 3. Ending the Arab boycott of Israel and dealing with the U.S. companies that trade with Israel, have branches in Israel, or are engaged in joint ventures with the Israelis. This will be a prelude to eventually dealing with the Israeli companies and to opening Jordanian markets to their products. 4. Canceling the government protectionism of some domestic products and allowing for free trade. 5. Intensifying the embargo on Iraq and banning the entry of any mechanical [ali] materials except through the United Nations. 6. Suspending Jordanian media campaigns against the Israeli policy and stopping the mobilization of the masses against Israel. 7. Ending the activities of the Palestinian organizations opposing the U.S. policy, and pursuing their members. 8. Pursuing the hardline Islamic current that is hostile to U.S. policy, and supporting the moderate Islamists who do not engage in politics. According to the U.S. proposal, this will be a cover for government pursuit of political Islamists. 9. Cooperating with the United States in pursuing international terrorism. 10. Expediting the implementation of the International Monetary Fund reforms. AKHBAR AL-USBU' has also learned that the U.S. Administration has asked its friends in the region not to support Jordan on the political, economic, or media levels as a retribution for its positions. It is also seeking to isolate Jordan and besiege it politically and economically in order to force it to yield to the U.S.-Israeli conditions. Sources in the U.S. delegation that accompanied Mr. Ross on his Amman visit voiced resentment over the harsh Jordanian campaign the Jordanian House of Representatives launched against the U.S. policy a few hours before the U.S. envoy's arrival. Responding to this, a responsible Jordanian source said: The Americans can ask the deputies and parties. The Jordanian Government does not officially interfere in this. These are popular demands and Jordan is a democratic country. In a related development, an Arab official in Washington confirmed to AKHBAR AL-USBU' that in the wake of Security Council Resolution 904, which condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, Jordan began to face tremendous U.S. pressure to expedite the peace process with Israel. He added: These pressures are represented in the U.S. retraction of a commitment to lift the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and in growing media campaigns against the pan-Arab Jordanian position so that Jordan will continue to be isolated on the Arab level, in addition to threats to withhold U.S. and European financial aid. The impact of the U.S. pressure and threats on the Jordanian track of the peace process will be weak and will not serve the cause of peace, nor will any economic or political embargo that leads to Jordan's isolation serve the cause of peace. Continuing, he said: The onslaught on Jordan has been exposed to the Jordanian people, who are suffering from the siege on al-'Aqabah. Moreover, there is interference to prevent pan-Arab cooperation and coordination with Syria to get out of the Israeli bottleneck, which the United States is strongly seeking to impose on the peace tracks, especially the Jordanian track, and expedite a solution in accordance with the Israeli concept.
