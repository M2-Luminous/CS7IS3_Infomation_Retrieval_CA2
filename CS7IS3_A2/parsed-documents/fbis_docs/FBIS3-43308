UNITA operations include in particular the attack on the Malongo oil camp in Cabinda at dawn on 1 January, as well as an attack on an FAA logistics base in Malange, resulting in the death of two soldiers and material losses. Also on 1 January, UNITA forces attacked Dange-ia-Manha location of Cuanza Norte Province, and shelled Menongue, using artillery. On 2 January, UNITA attacked Quijenje location and shelled the capital of Ukuma District in Huambo Province. Those operations are designed to bring about changes to the present correlation of military forces so as to gain advantages at the negotiating table. Yet, FAA forces are thwarting every UNITA plan by firmly defending their positions. The FAA General Staff once again draws the attention of the international community to the fact that UNITA is responsible for the prevailing atmosphere of war in the country in that it does not adhere to the so-called unilateral cease-fire it declared on 20 September 1993, and is clearly committed to poisoning the Lusaka talks and undermining the peace process. Those designs ought to be condemned by public opinion as a whole. The FAA will remain firm in the defense of the people and democracy. [Issued] The FAA General Staff in Luanda, 3 January
