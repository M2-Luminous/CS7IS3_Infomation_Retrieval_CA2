Reviewing the state of the nation in order to take stock and reflect on the consequences of about four years of hesitation and confusion, Marshal Mobutu dwelt in his speech on economic and political harmony in our country. It is often said: Give me sound politics and I will give you a sound economy. But what can be expected when we observe that the president himself cries angrily at this laconic order and I quote: It is enough! Enough is enough! In any case, by this, one can understand, if I may say, politics has precedence over the economy. One can then ask to know if it is the latter that commands the former -- or vice versa. Upon analysis and on account of the situation currently prevailing in Zaire and the world, one thing is certain: If it is true that the bad conduct of the political game annoys the [word indistinct] of the economy to the point of causing even confusion, no one can deny that the ruin of the economy has finally made the political sector nervous and has led to the economy's modification, just as economic successes contribute to the reinforcement of political stands. Concerning Zaire, our country, one can note that at the beginning, it was, above all, the serious economic difficulties and the unrest that ensued that forced our people to question the institutions of the Second Republic and demand change. As one can observe, the detonator for democratization was economic. But later, when there was hesitation and other acts of tardiness and stalemate in the machinery of democratization, it was economic arguments that external partners resorted to in order to continue the process of political reform. At the home level, we can remark that any time there is something wrong in the democratic mechanism for one reason or the other, it is the economic weapon that is resorted to in order to make things work once again: Unlimited strikes are decreed, civil disobedience is called for, industrial units are attacked, and in commerce, the transportation network is targeted. In short, people want to paralyze the economy and prevent the government from working in order to force it to change its mind and orientate its policies to a given direction. In the light of all these arguments, there is no doubt that the economy controls politics, hence the president of the Republic's recommendation to his fellow citizens to behave in such a way that 1994 may be a year of national redress.
