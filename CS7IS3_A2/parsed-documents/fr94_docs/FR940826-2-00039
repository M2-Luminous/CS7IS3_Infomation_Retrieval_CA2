ACTION: Notice of availability of grantee performance evaluation reports. SUMMARY: EPA's grant regulations (40 CFR 35.150) require the Agency to evaluate the performance of agencies which receive grants. EPA's regulations for regional consistency (40 CFR 56.7) require that the Agency notify the public of the availability of the reports of such evaluations. EPA recently performed midyear evaluations of one local and five state air pollution control programs (City of Albuquerque, New Mexico; Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology; Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality; New Mexico Environment Department; Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality; and Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission). These audits were conducted to assess the agencies' performance under the grants made to them by EPA pursuant to section 105 of the Clean Air Act, as amended. EPA Region 6 has prepared reports for the grantees identified above and those 105 reports are now available for public inspection. ADDRESSES: The reports may be examined at the EPA Region 6 office at 1445 Ross Avenue, 12th floor, Dallas, Texas 75202 in the Air, Pesticides, and Toxics Management Division. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Please contact Terrie Mikus, Grant Oversight Section Chief (6T&hyph;AG), at the above EPA Region 6 address for information concerning these reports.
