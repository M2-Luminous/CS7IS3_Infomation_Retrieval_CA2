As we have learned, President Berisha last evening met with political party representatives, government members, and chairmen of various associations to discuss this tragic and painful event. [Koleci] The president's press and information office reports that President Sali Berisha yesterday afternoon organized a meeting attended by Meksi, Vukaj, Malasi, Serreqi, [Public Order Minister] Musaraj, [Social Democratic Party Chairman] Gjinushi, Laco, [Republican Party Chairman] Godo, Shamata, Hajdaraga, Kola, and [Independent Trade Union Chairman] Xheka to discuss the massacre that one of the Greek commando units carried out with premeditation in the early hours of Sunday [10 April] in the recruiters barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme, 4 km into Albanian territory. President Berisha stressed that this act is a real massacre and an unprecedented violation of Albania's integrity and sovereignty since 1949. This marks an open hostile act by Greece against Albania and is a continuation of other terroristic acts committed by Greek forces, such as the case of the murder of the shepherd in Devoll and the assault on our warship in our own waters. All of these -- even though they are documented -- have been negated by the Greek Government through dishonest means. For the past two years, Berisha continued, we have made intensive efforts to develop cooperation and relations with Greece. We have tried and will continue to try so that the Greek minority in Albania and our emigrants in Greece will be a powerful factor of cooperation and understanding between our two peoples and countries. Unfortunately, I would say, for the misfortune of the Greek Government circles, we have ascertained that the Greek side has used Albanian emigrants as a means of pressure against Albania, even openly making calls for its destabilization. Concerning the minority, attempts have been made to manipulate it and turn it into an apple of discord for Albania. Berisha stressed that our policy toward the minority cannot change because of the absurd stance of the Greek Government and officials toward Albania. The president continued to say that the minority is and will be free citizens of Albania. We will continue our efforts for the expansion of human rights and freedoms for Albanians and the minority. Further on, Berisha reconfirmed his determination and that of the government to persistently continue the policy of decreasing the tension and contributing toward peace and stability in the region, something that is not at all desired by those who are interested in creating tensions and conflicts. On the other hand, the Albanian president informed those present that the government is making all the demarches to friendly countries and international organizations to condemn this grave act of terrorism on the part of Greece and ask her to put an end to this policy by finding and convicting its culprits. The Albanian Government will take every measure to counteract terror of any kind and secure its own citizens. Those present supported the statement by President Berisha and considered this meeting very useful. They strongly condemned the ugly and terroristic act against Albania and supported the constructive policy of the Albanian Government in the region. They also asked the government to condemn this terrorist act to the UN Security Council and international organizations and take all measures to see that such acts are no longer repeated. They also asked the Albanian Government to continue to oppose the policy of Hellenism in the south of the country and expand its policy on preserving peace and stability in the region. Those present at the meeting said that everyone should clearly understand that when it is a question of the national question, the Albanians are and will remain a sole voice.
