FR940524-1-00013 FR940524-1-00005 Use of automatic sprinklers may be the best approach to providing life safety. Sprinklers respond automatically to fire, limit fire size, and are also able to sound the alert. In addition to enhancing life safety, sprinklers provide property protection and limit potential business interruption. Sprinklers can significantly reduce the hazard which firefighters must face in combating a fire. The cost effectiveness of sprinklers for new construction cannot be overstated. Sprinkler protection can be added with minimal impact on overall project cost while significantly improving the level of fire safety. In recognition of the many benefits and relatively low cost of sprinkler protection, the General Services Administration has instituted a policy of providing sprinklers in new construction. The issue of providing sprinkler protection in existing buildings is not as clear cut. Typically, the cost of providing protection is higher in existing buildings. It may not be possible to provide complete sprinkler protection due to existing physical conditions or competing requirements (e.g., historic preservation laws). The decision to provide sprinkler protection must be part of an integrated fire protection strategy. Existing building systems and applicable requirements must be considered in developing the strategy. Most model codes provide an equivalency concept which allows for use of alternative approaches or systems. This concept is provided in recognition of the fact that compliance with one prescribed solution may not be the best alternative in every case. These alternative systems, methods, or devices achieve a reasonable level of protection and meet the intent of the specific code requirement. Alternative methods for limiting fire effects which might be considered include using fire-rated enclosing barriers, low flame spread interior finish materials, low heat release rate furnishings, and low ignition propensity materials. In evaluating alternatives, consideration needs to be given to the reliability of the proposed approach the life of a structure. Enforcement and maintenance practices will vary significantly depending on the use (office, residence, store, factory, etc.). B. Working Group Discussions On July 14, 1993, the working group met with representatives from both the public and private sectors. The interests of trade associations, State Fire Marshals, fire chiefs, consulting engineering firms, building owners, academia, and research were presented at the meeting. Based on this meeting, the working group identified a number of issues important for consideration in developing the regulations. From these issues, the working group identified four central concerns. Should the regulation address equivalency to sprinklers or to the level of safety provided by sprinklers? The group agreed that sprinklers provide a unique combination of fire detection and suppression, and that no current system could be considered equivalent. However, sprinklers provide a level of safety, especially life safety, which can be provided through the use of other systems in various combinations. Such other system combinations may include sprinklers. Should the regulation describe a method of analysis to determine equivalency or the result needed to be equivalent? GSA had originally drafted a proposed analysis method. This raised more questions than it answered. The group agreed that the regulation should address the endpoint, or a performance objective which must be satisfied to be equivalent. Are there significant differences between office and housing occupancies which need to be considered? Reaction time is the significant difference between these two occupancy groups. Reaction time must be emphasized in any analysis of equivalency in housing. An occupant's ability to react to a fire and evacuate from the area exposed to fire effects can be influenced by a number of factors including physical ability, mental status, age, and training. Should the regulation have a height threshold, specifically should it not apply to high rise buildings? This question was the most difficult for the group to deal with and a consensus was never reached. The group was divided between two opposing points of view. One portion of the group believed that the fire safety problems inherent in high rise buildings could only be addressed through complete sprinkler protection. The Act was intended to require sprinklers in high rise buildings. Therefore, the regulation should place a maximum height limit on the applicability of the equivalent level of safety provision. The opposing view held that no height threshold was necessary. Any analysis, required as part of the equivalent level of safety regulation, should address the fire safety issues associated with protection of high rise buildings. In high rise buildings, automatic detection and suppression are vital components of a fire protection strategy. Fire protection strategies developed for high rise buildings under the provision would include some level of sprinkler protection. The legislation gives the General Services Administration the responsibility to develop the regulation defining an equivalent level of safety. GSA believes that the law is clear requiring high rise (6 or more stories) Federal Employee Office Buildings to have sprinklers, or an equivalent level of safety. The Congressional intent for an equivalency option was recently reinforced by the passage of an amendment to the original legislation providing an equivalency option in Federally assisted housing in New York City. Finally, the model codes support the use of equivalency concepts especially in existing buildings. For these reasons, GSA believes the regulation should not have specific thresholds. Comments on this subject are requested; any comments should include supporting rationale. C. Equivalent Level of Safety Analysis The working group identified and discussed a number of critical factors in developing a life safety equivalency analysis. Rate of fire growth is controlled by the type and location of combustible items, the layout of the compartment, the materials used in construction of the space, openings and ventilation, and suppression capability. Detection time, occupant notification, occupant reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress are important considerations in evaluating egress time. Finally, the life safety equivalency analysis must be conducted by a person familiar with fire dynamics, building construction, hazard assessment, and human behavior. As a minimum, this person should have a bachelor of science degree in engineering. In order to evaluate whether or not a life safety equivalency has been achieved, the building systems must be defined, reasonable worst case scenarios developed, maximum probable loss estimated, time required for the space to become hazardous calculated, and time required for egress determined. The proposed regulation establishes a general measure of building fire safety performance. Building environmental conditions are specified to ensure the life safety of building occupants outside the room of fire origin. The specified environmental conditions should be applicable whether or not the evaluation is conducted for the entire building or for just the hazardous areas. In the latter case, the room of origin would be the hazardous area while any room could be a room of origin in the entire building scenario.
