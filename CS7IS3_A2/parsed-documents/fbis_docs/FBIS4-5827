The Pyongyang municipal art propaganda troupe is now greatly encouraging working people in the city to register great achievements in carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy shaped by the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. Its performance vividly reflects the fruitful efforts of working people to successfully implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies advanced by the WPK. The art troupe is calling on them to make this year a year of a historical turn in the revolution and construction by effecting a revolutionary upsurge in socialist economic construction in the spirit with which they crossed the river in flame and marched through the marsh during the rigorous war in the 1950s and in the spirit with which they brought about a great upswing of Chollima in the postwar period when everything had been destroyed. Art propaganda troupes engaged in agitation for increased production were organized and are now active in all provincial seats. Travelling art propaganda troupes are seen in all counties, factories, enterprises and cooperative farms. They are encouraging working people to increase production in various forms and ways on cooperative fields bustling with sowing, at consumer goods production bases, power stations, coal mines, railway stations, chemical, metal and building material production sites, housing and other construction sites in the capital and deep sea fishing grounds. Stirring and appealing oral propaganda and introduction of achievements through on-spot broadcasting and by radio cars and loud voices of announcers congratulating innovators are making the whole country replete with revolutionary zeal and spirit. Agitation troupes made up of artistes and men of the press of the capital and provinces have been dispatched to major sites to powerfully rouse working people in increased production and faster construction.
