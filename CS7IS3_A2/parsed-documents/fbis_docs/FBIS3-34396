A notice announcing the establishment of a new, a hitherto unheard of group is daily placed in our mailboxes. Whatever their number, they represent an achievement scored by the settler lobby unified under the roof of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, or in short -- the YESHA' [acronym for Judaea, Samaria, Gaza] Council. [passage omitted] The emergence of the various protest groups can be credited to a few enthusiasts from settlements, from Jerusalem, and from other locations throughout the country. The YESHA' Council is ostensibly uninvolved in their establishment, which is presented as a personal initiative motivated by anxiety for democracy and the Israeli nation's well-being. In practice, most groups are in one way or another linked to the YESHA' Council, which assists them in every way, including lobbying, telephone and fax facilities, and even through the services of their spokesmen. [passage omitted] One of the most veteran organizations is the Action Committee for the Annulment of the Autonomy Plan, which is inspired by Elyaqim Ha'etzni. Ha'etzni explains that the somewhat obsolete name is due to the fact that the body was established back in the days when autonomy, and not self-rule, was on the agenda. "Later we were visited by this catastrophe, the new government, and today our main job is to try and save Eretz Yisra'el." In brochures and flyers, Ha'etzni calls for civil mutiny. "Do not play according to the rules!" says his introduction to a leaflet, which is rife with quotations from Moshe Hanegbi, 'Amos 'Oz, and Thomas Jefferson in support of illegal action for the sake of liberty. In Ha'etzni's understanding, the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and Samaria is a violation of that liberty. "Signing such an agreement and sacrificing us all on the false altar of peace is an illegal act." His leaflet speaks of "the insane government" "which endangers the life of every Jew from Holon to Hebron," whose leaders are as good as prostitutes. Ha'etzni encloses a questionnaire to the leaflet asking the reader to fill it out and send back to the action committee. This is what the form says: "I, the undersigned, will not carry out a plainly illegal order. I will not uproot settlements." Ha'etzni does what Yesh Gvul [organization supporting soldiers' refusal to serve in territories] never dared: He openly calls on citizens to violate laws and disobey orders. In the propaganda material he disseminates Ha'etzni explains how important it is to be arrested. "The stick of detention should not scare anyone," Ha'etzni told DAVAR. "We ought to take the Palestinians' place in prisons. When thousands of Jews are in jail, the government will fall." Another body in the midst of hectic activity is This Is Our Land [Zo Artzeynu], the group which initiated the Hamakhpil [doubling] operation that aims to establish new quasi-settlements in the vicinity of existing ones independently and demonstratively, in full knowledge that the operation is illegal. The operation organizers have two addresses: Ginot Shomron and the state of New York, the United States. [passage omitted] At first the YESHA' Council subscribed to the concept that new settlements should be established and the existing ones expanded without consulting the authorities. At some point, however, heads of the YESHA' local and regional councils concluded that the idea may elicit negative public reactions, and they decided to pull out. Today the YESHA' Council's official stand on this matter is that they are not partners in the endeavor, but will not take action against it. When necessary, they provide assistance, providing telephone services and any other required logistic facilities. In the wake of this week's arrests, the YESHA' Council issued a public statement protesting the police commissioner's announcement about the plan to set up detention camps for settlers and criticizing the government "which releases Palestinian terrorists at the same time detaining good Jews." One of the publications of This Is Our Land notes that the organization supports the women's group headed by Rut Matar. Women for the Sake of Tomorrow [Nashim Lema'an Hamahar], Matar's organization, also opposes the peace process and does not mince words describing its objection to the government's peace plan. "Peres and 'Arafat have reached an agreement in Switzerland, in other words: The terrorist Palestinian state is in the making," their press communique says, urging reporters to come and cover their rally near the Jerusalem-Jericho road in Ma'ale Adumim last Tuesday. "This road will be the main road from Jerusalem to the terrorist state. Any Jew daring to take this road will be jeopardizing his life," the statement adds. [passage omitted] This week we received propaganda material from the Public Committee for the Protection of Ma'ale Adumim. This week, a hostile rally welcomed Police Minister Moshe Shahal as he arrived to inaugurate the first Civil Guard station in the territories. "In Jericho the government plans to arm 3,000 terrorists, and in Ma'ale Adumim it establishes a Civil Guard station with 30 soldiers," their leaflet states. There are no soldiers in the Civil Guard, only civilians. "The Ma'ale Adumim kindergartens are against the Gaza and Jericho agreement," says another leaflet. One activist with the group believes the possibility of handing Judaea and Samaria over to Palestinian rule undemocratic. "A free regime has no right to uproot a settlement and assail citizens rights, even if they are an unpopular minority." The group works in coordination with, and is sometimes financed by the YESHA' Council, and is closely associated with This Is Our Land. Newspapers occasionally carry advertisements placed by various groups denouncing the government's peace plan, and each of these groups is confident that its way is the right one: Professors for Political and Economic Strength; Army officers join forces in the Awakening and National Strength Forum. The executive committee of the Knesset opposition came out with the slogan -- the Eretz Yisra'el Front, while the Endeavor [Ma'amatz] Action Committee, headed by Ya'aqov Novik and Ya'aqov Sternberg invests daily efforts and complicated logistics in organizing rallies, transportation, and other necessary steps. Their activities are centered mainly in Jerusalem. Bney 'Aqiva [youth movement affiliated with the National Religious Party], and the 'Ezra and Habad movements are willing to supply anyone with masses of youths for rallies, sometimes for the purpose of collecting donations. The activity is initiated by West Bank settlers and Jerusalem-based activists ideologically related to the tenets of Gush Emunim. Their primary goal is to foil the peace agreement with the Palestinians. The protest activities against withdrawal from the Golan Heights have become a part of the greater drive, and today it is sometimes difficult to tell the issues apart. This did not happen by accident. The first stimulus for demonstrating against withdrawal from the Golan Heights came from West Bank settlers, who organized and prodded the Golan activists to rally against the peace agreement. In these groups, activists speak in the same breath of the West Bank and the Golan Heights, brewing a sentimental concoction of arguments about the nature of Israel's ties and problems with the Palestinians on the one hand and with Syria on the other. Others view the Golan Heights as a separate issue while emphasizing that they do not oppose the government policy, that they are only against giving up the Golan. The slogan "People With the Golan" pasted on thousands of verandas was the work of the Golan Action Committees [Matot Hagolan]. A prominent activist based in Jerusalem, a sort of an aficionado, says that since the movement is scattered throughout the country, all the work in done by volunteers and with modest donations, "because the problem is not just of the Golan settlers. The entire nation should decide this vital issue of the Golan. There is no right or left in this matter." Setting up signing-up stands throughout the country, activists expand their enterprise by enlisting new activists. They claim to be unrelated to the YESHA' Council or the Golan Settlement Committee headed by Eli Malka. In all these fields, the YESHA' Council operates behind the scenes. On the one hand, its activists are pleased with the voluntary operations conducted in various locations. Their work is done by others. On the other hand, it does not want to lose control. For that reason, it has established a superstructure named the Joint Action Committee [Hamate Hameshutaf]. A Tel Aviv office organizing rallies throughout the country is financed by YESHA', according to the secretary who took our phone call. Meetings at which short- and long-term activities are coordinated are held periodically at the council offices. All the groups receive assistance from the YESHA' Council: telephone and fax facilities, spokesman's services, and probably funds too. As if the number of organizations and names was insufficient, they established One Israel [Yisra'el Ahat], a body defined as the operational headquarters of the Joint Action Committee. It is headed by Moshe Merhavya, a resident of 'Eli who had worked for Minister Ari'el Sharon at the Construction and Housing Ministry and is credited with having obtained the authorities' approval for so many new houses in the settlement of 'Eli in recent years. Yesterday's demonstration in the ancient synagogue of Jericho, for instance, had been planned in Knesset Member [MK] Hanan Porat's office at the Knesset last week. The meeting was attended by Uri Ari'el, chairman of the YESHA' Council, by Moshe Merhavya, and a representative of the Endeavor Action Committee. People want to stand by MK Porat's side and show the Jericho synagogue students that they are not being abandoned, YESHA' Council members said and proceeded to help print notices about transportation to the rally.
