Such a committee whose members will include representatives from the People's Bank of China and related government departments, will be delegated by the State Council to monitor and examine each bank's operational approach and its capital preservation and growth situation. It will also monitor, assess and record the performance of each bank's director, proposing performance rewards and penalties. Ma Delun, the People's Bank's policy research department's deputy director, yesterday said branches of state-owned commercial banks would also see the establishment of such committees. A monitoring authority already exists in the State Development Bank -- one of the mainland's policy banks. Under existing banking reform, China's four specialised banks are now in the process of transforming into commercial banks which, being new financial entities, calls for a new mode of regulation. These banks will not be allowed to invest directly in non-financial enterprises with their investments in insurance trust services and securities also restricted to a proportion of available capital. Their branches are granted no investment rights. Meanwhile, the People's Bank has adjusted the bank reserve requirement to three per cent as one of the measures to maintain currency stability. Mr Ma said the banking system put currency stabilisation before economic development, with the former expected to affect the latter. Previously this approach was reversed. He also said the implementation of financial reforms should be preceded by the establishment of a system of regulations, such as the present one. "In the past, some reforms were just about implementation and action was taken before (attention was paid to) other considerations...existing financial reform starts with the establishment of financial rules," he said. Mr Ma conceded the insurance industry was still not well developed on the mainland. "People don't understand the concept of insurance very well. More publicity is needed to educate them that it is an investment apart from being a kind of protection," he said. "Policy insurance and commercial insurance should be audited separately...for fair and orderly competition. "The industry should be differentiated into life insurance and non-life insurance. We should develop national, locality and specialised insurance companies." Reinsurance companies should be set up and a rural insurance industry should be developed, he said. "We should expand the scope and autonomy of capital use for insurance enterprises, and duly raise insurance solvency margins to strengthen the industry's financial strength."
