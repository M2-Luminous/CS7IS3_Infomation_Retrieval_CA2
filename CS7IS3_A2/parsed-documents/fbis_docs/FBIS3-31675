An independent Greek source adds that he noticed unusual activity by Greek special services in the Greek provinces of Thrace and Rhodopes precisely at the time of the diplomatic visit to the eastern Rhodopes by Thomas Price, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, and Second Secretary John Kunstadter. As is well-known, Greece has good reasons for its fears regarding the attempts to draw together the Muslims on both sides of the Bulgarian-Greek border. According to circles close to the Greek cabinet, this is the main reason for their unwillingness to open up the Makaza border crossing point. According to experts, the U.S. position concerning drawing together the two Muslim lobbies on either side of the border aims to hold Greece in check because of its stubborn stance regarding Macedonia. This supposedly is to be achieved by insinuating that in the eastern Rhodopes and Thrace only a spark is needed to ignite a new Bosnia. When asked if they were checking on the existence of such a possibility during their visit to Kurdzhali, diplomats John Kunstadter and Thomas Price denied such an insinuation with amazement. However, according to someone who took part in the closed talks with the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], this was precisely the problem that worried the emissaries of Ambassador Montgomery. Serious observers of this problem are firm in their view that there is no doubt that the Americans are mediating in trying to bring together the two Muslim lobbies of the eastern Rhodopes and western Thrace. The number of illegal visits by two Greek parliamentary deputies, the Muslims Ahmed Saduk and Ahmed Faikoglu, to the former Kurdzhali Okrug during the last election campaign in Bulgaria allegedly formed only part of the plan that had been hatched up by strategists in Washington to draw the two Muslim communities together. Ahmed Saduk is known to have claimed that the Muslims in northern Greece are Turks. According to Greek sources, in northern Greece the Muslims number between 100,000 and 120,000. Ankara considers that about 300,000 Muslims inhabit this region. Greek lawyers recall that, before he became a member of the previous Greek Parliament, an investigation was mounted against Ahmed Saduk on suspicion of fomenting nationalist enmity. According to sources close to the U.S. Embassy, certain diplomats are supposed to have quite seriously discussed the possibility of the DPS becoming a model for the Muslims of northern Greece. The Muslims there were recognized as a community by the 1923 Lausanne Conference, but do not possess anything like the rights now enjoyed by the Turks in Bulgaria. This is a very difficult task, because the Greek Constitution forbids the existence of ethnic parties, and in Greece it is impossible even for Slavonic-speaking Greek citizens to form a party. According to REUTER, infuriated Greeks were reported to have hurled stones at a Turkish parliamentary delegation in Xanthe in early February. It is alleged that the Turkish deputies also held talks with the Muslim community in the town about them forging closer links with their brothers in the neighboring countries. Sources in northern Greece claim that U.S. radars are still controlling the airspace there, and they point to such equipment mounted in Maria and other nearby villages. Furthermore, it is known that all the financial aid for the mosques in the eastern Rhodopes and western Thrace, declared to consist of donations from Islamic organizations, really comes from U.S. banks.
