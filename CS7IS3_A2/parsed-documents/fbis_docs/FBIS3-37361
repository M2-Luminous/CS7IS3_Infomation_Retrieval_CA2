An introductory comment says: "Last week did not abound in vivid domestic policy events." What actually happened was that the State Duma, "which has not yet adopted a single important law," discussed the question of moving out of the old mayor's office and into the White House. It also set up a commission to look into the events of 3-4 October. Members of the old and new economic schools continued to argue about future government policy. "The president reduced his activities owing to illness. That may be why the latest package of decrees signed by him did not look as impressive as during the previous week." After briefly surveying the various decrees on personnel changes, Filatov says: "In accordance with a directive from the president, the signing took place of a protocol on political consultations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Azerbaijan. In general, I must say that it is a very good document, since it does place on a permanent footing the dialogue between the leadership of these republics at various levels and on all matters, and that is precisely what is said in the document, which is to be signed by the Foreign Ministry on the instructions of the president." Asked about moves to bring the president into conflict with parliament, Filatov looks at the three possible sites that parliament could occupy, according to a suggestion from Lukyanov -- the Kremlin, Old Square, and the White House -- and dismissed each one as a practical impossibility. The interviewer then asks about the state of the president's health, since there is considerable speculation about it. Filatov replies: "There is a lot of flu about in Moscow at the moment, as you all know. There have been many cases. As far as I remember, we expected Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Monday. He really did want to come, but later he felt unwell. You know the way it goes: Sometimes you get up and it passes off once you are on your feet, and, at other times, the illness knocks you out. I don't think that he managed to avoid that insidious illness. It seems quite normal to me."
