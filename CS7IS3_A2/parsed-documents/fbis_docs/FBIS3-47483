Those who attended the meetings were members of the LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law, including former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, as well as FTC officials headed by former Commission Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, the sources said. On several occasions at a Tokyo hotel and the headquarters of the LDP, then the ruling party, both sides discussed the size of the maximum penalty and decided to raise it to 100 million yen from 5 million yen, the sources said. Nakamura, who was the panel's deputy chairman, is facing allegations that he received 10 million yen in dubious contributions in January 1992 from major construction firm Kajima Corp. The negotiations were reportedly tough since the LDP had strongly opposed the FTC's proposal in 1991 to raise the penalty to several hundreds of million yen. But when the meetings started, the LDP relaxed its stance, the sources said. They quoted one participant as suggesting that there must have been an arrangement within the LDP on settling the issue beforehand. Nakamura reportedly acted as an agent of former political kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who has been indicted on charges of evading income tax on secret donations from the construction industry. Kanemaru and Nakamura are known for having close connections with the nation's construction industry and have therefore become the center of the current corruption scandal involving the industry. It has also been reported that Umezawa explained Nakamura's role in a meeting with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara. After reaching the agreement with the LDP, the FTC announced the 100 million yen penalty figure on March 12, 1992.
