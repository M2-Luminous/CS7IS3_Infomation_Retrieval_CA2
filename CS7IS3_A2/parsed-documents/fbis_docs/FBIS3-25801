The newly published TIYU DA SHICHANG weekly integrates sports, consumption, market, and economy into one entity, regards "acting as a bosom friend of readers and enterprises" as its tenet, takes "practicality, readability, and modernization" as its styles, and sets "the prosperity of the sports market and the development of sports" as its goals. While celebrating its 40th founding anniversary, the People's Sports Publishing House also donated nearly 300 new books to the Training Bureau of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.
