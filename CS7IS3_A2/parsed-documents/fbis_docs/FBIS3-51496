In light of the regrettable developments in the state of Chiapas and the illegal activities involving armed groups, the signatories of the Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact agreed on the need to reaffirm, reinforce, and fully comply with the commitments acquired on 3 October based on the following: 1. That unified cooperation of all segments of the population, within a framework of respect and permanent communication, is an indispensable condition to reach common goals which will guide Mexico's progress, defend our sovereignty, and strengthen our national identity. 2. That reaching a consensus within the framework of the law, and not through confrontation, is an efficient instrument to coordinate society's efforts in tackling the challenges of a just and equitable economic development within a world situation that demands greater efficiency and competitiveness. 3. That the consensus reached and the efforts made by all segments have brought about specific and significant results, which we pursue. Inflation has been reduced to a single-digit figure, and productivity shows important and sustained growth. We have noted strict discipline in the handling of fiscal and monetary policy. We have made progress in economic deregulation and trade opening. We have created new means to ensure more active participation of private and social segments in economic activity, and we have made profound budget reforms that seek to make quicker progress in resolving the social underdevelopment that persists. Therefore, the labor organizations that comprise the Labor Congress, the peasant organizations, the business organizations that represent a great majority of the country's productive forces, and the federal government agreed to the following: 1. The signatories ratify the commitments in the current consensus agreements and pledge to make greater efforts to comply, fully and in a timely manner, with each and every one of them within their own jurisdictions. 2. Within a context of fiscal discipline and in strict compliance with provisions of the federation's expenditures budget and the Revenues Law, approved by the honorable Congress of the Union, the federal government commits to establishing a timetable giving higher priority to the use of allocations that correspond to public investment expenditures to promote economic activity and those corresponding to social development expenditures. These allocations increased by 10 percent and 10.5 percent in real terms, respectively, in the budget approved for 1994. Therefore, expenditures for social development represent 53.9 percent of programmed expenditures and 10.2 percent of the GNP. These are the highest figures in our history. 3. The labor and managerial sectors agree to promote and increase, via every means available to them, a direct and permanent dialogue and an understanding among the production sectors to prevent and to expeditiously resolve any possible differences. They also agree to increase efforts to directly sign productivity and quality agreements between labor organizations and management in accordance with the guidelines of the national agreement to increase productivity and improve quality. 4. The labor, peasant, and managerial sectors, as well as the federal government, believe it is imperative to continue giving priority attention to the agricultural sector. With this in mind, they agree to strengthen their interrelation with the rural sector through productive chains in an effort to support their productivity and profitability and thereby improve the standard of living of people living in rural areas. 5. To guarantee that the goals established in this agreement will be met, the parties deem it necessary that, effective with the signing of this agreement, the sessions of the Follow-up and Assessment Commission will be held twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, instead of once a week, as has been the case up until now. The social dialogue, in a climate of peace and national unity, and with the unavoidable respect for the law, has resulted in significant achievements. The labor, peasant, and management sectors, as well as the federal government, believe that society's concerted efforts within the law are the most effective way to consolidate the achievements made in the struggle against inflation, as well as to consolidate the construction of a firm basis to boost growth and employment and to advance efforts to meet the needs and demands of our compatriots, particularly those who have less. This pact is being signed at Los Pinos Official Residence on 12 January 1994 in the presence of the president of Mexico.
