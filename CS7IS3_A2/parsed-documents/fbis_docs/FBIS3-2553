During the conference, the spirit of the national forum of directors of organizational departments was relayed. Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing committee and director of the organizational department, delivered a report to make organizational work arrangements for the province this year. During the work conference Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered an important speech on conducting the organizational work under the new situation and on having the province seize the opportunity and provide reliable guarantees for accelerating development. Gu Jinchi said: An important characteristic in the current development in the country is a deep change cropping up in the transformation from the planned economic system to the market economic system. This has set new demands for the organizational work, which chiefly are to seize the opportunity and to accelerate development. In conducting organizational work under the new situation, we should not only help cadres upgrade their capability of having the market economy well in mind but also help them gain the experience of building two civilizations simultaneously. We should not only uphold the principle of having the party manage cadres, but also provide a fine environment for outstanding personnel to give full play to their professional knowledge and skill. Gu Jinchi said: We are encountering so many difficulties and tasks for overcoming these difficulties and improving the shortcomings are very arduous. Therefore, the organizational work should assume important responsibility in this regard. The organizational front should coordinate with the propaganda and ideological front to do a good job in grasping the work of having party members and cadres emancipate their minds and in building leading bodies at all levels and party organizations at grass-roots levels so as to bring into full play the enthusiasm and creativeness of various talented personnel and to have them fully play their role in the main battlefield of economic construction. Gu Jinchi urged the organizational departments to lead the broad masses of party members and cadres to take the lead in emancipating minds, as well as promoting the organizational work and to continuously create a new situation in work by regarding reform as a motive force. Attending the work conference were Xu Wencai, member and secretary general of the provincial party standing committee; secretaries from the party committees under the provincial level departments and bureaus; and directors from the organizational departments of various cities.
