FR940412-1-00072 FR940412-1-00012 Discussion of Proposed Amendments Subpart 97.12 Subpart 97.12 of 46 CFR part 97 would be revised to clarify that the subpart would apply to bulk solid cargoes in general and not only to ores and ore concentrates. Due to experience gained from a casualty to a foreign vessel that loaded a bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port, the Coast Guard also proposes to extend the applicability of this part to foreign vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. Further, existing §97.12&hyph;5, which has not been revised since 1965, references a manual that was the predecessor of the BC Code and that is no longer in print. The revised section would include reference to the BC Code as a source of information for use in complying with the requirement that the master of a vessel be furnished with guidance on safe loading and stowage. Part 148 As discussed, the title of part 148 would be changed to read ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling''. This NPRM also proposes to modify the structure of the regulations from four to six subparts. Each is explained below briefly. Subpart A would state the purpose and applicability of the regulations, define terms used in the part, and list (in tabular form) the solid materials permitted to be carried as bulk cargoes. Subpart B would provide all relevant information concerning Special Permits. Subpart C would set forth minimum transportation requirements for all materials regulated by 46 CFR part 148 and the requirements for shipping papers and Dangerous Cargo Manifests. Subpart D would set forth general stowage and segregation requirements for materials according to their hazard class, and, in addition, would contain stowage and segregation requirements for specific materials. Subpart E would contain special handling, loading, and carriage requirements for specific materials. The requirements for specific materials in subpart D and this subpart would be in addition to the minimum requirements for all materials and the general requirements for their respective hazard classes contained in subpart C. Subpart F would contain requirements for special equipment or procedures when dealing with certain cargoes. The requirements of this part would apply when dealing with a cargo only if a provision from this part is included in Table 148.10 in reference to a particular material included in that cargo. The current sections of part 148 would be revised and renumbered as follows: ␣ 1Current section 1Replaced by proposed section 148.01&hyph;1 148.1, 148.3 148.01&hyph;7 148.10 148.01&hyph;9 148.15, 148.20 148.01&hyph;11 148.25 148.01&hyph;13 148.12 148.01&hyph;15 148.9 148.02&hyph;1 148.60 148.02&hyph;3 148.70 148.02&hyph;5 148.115 148.03&hyph;1 148.50 148.03&hyph;5 148.60 148.03&hyph;7 148.100 148.03&hyph;11 Subpart D 148.03&hyph;13 148.110 148.04&hyph;1 148.300 148.04&hyph;9 148.265 148.04&hyph;13 148.260 148.04&hyph;15 148.295 148.04&hyph;17 148.295 148.04&hyph;19 148.320 148.04&hyph;20 148.315 148.04&hyph;21 148.130(a)(4) and (c) 148.04&hyph;23 148.230. The following proposed sections differ substantively from the current regulations: Section 148.1. The proposed regulations would apply to foreign-flag, as well as U.S.-flag, vessels when operating in U.S. waters. The regulations would apply to all classes of vessels that transport solid bulk cargoes which require special handling, including unmanned barges and barge-carrying vessels. Section 148.3. This section would include several new definitions, including ``potentially dangerous material.'' Also, the definition of ``bulk'' has been revised for clarity and consistency with the BC Code.
