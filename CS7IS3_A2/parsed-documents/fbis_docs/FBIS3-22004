Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18 March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials. As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled by police." The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue, and Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to reduce demand for drugs." He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society." [passage omitted]
