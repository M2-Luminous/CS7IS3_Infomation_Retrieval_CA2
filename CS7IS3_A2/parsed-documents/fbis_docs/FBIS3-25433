Renamo's Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations that General Eduardo da Silva Nihia was training men to fight Renamo after elections have been denied by General Raul Dique, head of the Renamo team to the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. Let us listen to an excerpt of the interview I had with him at the Military Club in Maputo this morning. [Begin recording] [Matos] What are the findings at this stage? [Dique] The (?commission) [words indistinct] men being trained to fight Renamo after elections. At this stage, men are assembled... [Matos] Lt. Gen. Mr. Ngonhamo said that Mr. Nihia was training men to fight Renamo to disrupt elections. Is that (?true)? [Dique] Well, the truth is that people were found, and at the time they were not undergoing training. Obviously, if they had been undergoing training previously, once everything was brought to the press it was easy to stop the whole thing. [Matos] What does Renamo think? After this report by the commission that has gone to investigate the matter, does it think that men were being trained to fight Renamo (?after) the election? [Dique] Well, when the investigating team got to the area, it did not see any men undergoing training. There is no confirmation that men had been trained there before. That side of things was not investigated. [Matos] What is Renamo's opinion now? [Dique] Renamo's opinion is that training is not happening any more. People (?are being) moved now to assembly areas. [Matos] Is Renamo satisfied with those results? [Dique] Renamo is satisfied because it was disappointed with the confinement of the forces and its conclusions are that, under the control of the regional CCF team, all forces that are assembled in that area [words indistinct] satisfied. [Matos] Kindly tell me something, Gen. Dique: The problem that Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo raised, and his accusations in regard to Mr. Nihia, are now a thing of the past? The matter has been clarified? [Dique] It has been clarified now because those forces will be removed from that area and there will be no problems. [end recording] [passage omitted]
