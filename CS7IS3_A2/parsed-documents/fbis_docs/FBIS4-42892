He said that relations with Russia have a great importance for NATO, expressing satisfaction upon the announcement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia will sign the Partnership for Peace [PFP] document. Referring to a demand by Russia on `flexibility' within the document, Hurd said that the PFP has a very realistic character and it is large enough for including each country. He also recalled words said earlier by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, adding that NATO will make every effort for bringing lasting peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
