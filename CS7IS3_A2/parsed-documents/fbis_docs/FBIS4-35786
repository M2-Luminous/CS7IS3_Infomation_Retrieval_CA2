Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the Arab League's assistant secretary general for political affairs, has told our radio correspondent that Israel seeks from these hostile operations to obstruct the peace process on all tracks, particularly the Lebanese track. He added that Israel believes that striking at the Lebanese national resistance is a step in that direction. He stressed that national resistance is a legitimate right for the Lebanese that will not stop before Israel withdraws from every inch of the Lebanese occupied territories. Ambassador 'Imran noted that the more Israeli aggressions against the Lebanese people there are, the more determined they will be to continue the struggle to expel Israel from south Lebanon, in implementation of UN Resolution 425, which the Security Council and the major states have thus far failed to implement.
