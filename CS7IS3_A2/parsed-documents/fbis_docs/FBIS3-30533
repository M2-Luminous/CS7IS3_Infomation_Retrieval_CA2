FBIS3-30533 "dreeu024_r_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 ROMANIA Iliescu Gives Interview to Kiev Daily AU0402120394 Bucharest DIMINEATA SUPPLEMENT in Romanian 29-30 Jan 94 pp 2-4 AU0402120394 Bucharest DIMINEATA SUPPLEMENT Language: Romanian Article Type:BFN [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by Larisa Ivshyna, deputy editor in chief of the Russian-language Ukrainian daily KIEVSKIYE VEDOMSTI; place and date not given -- "translated from the Russian-language audio recording"] [Text] [Ivshyna] I believe that the people of Ukraine want their country to be part of a united Europe. As far as we are concerned, it is obvious that this is also one of the characteristic features of Romania's foreign policy. At the same time, the Ukrainians would like to know your opinion on this and also whether your are satisfied with the relations with your neighbors, particularly Ukraine. [Iliescu] Regarding your first question, I believe this is the common desire of all European countries, which is in accordance with the new trend in the evolution of international relations on our continent. The old state of affairs and the old division of the continent into two parts have been done away with. The old opposing military alliances and political-ideological divisions have been abandoned. I believe that all European countries are now moving toward the establishment of a new climate of general integration of all European countries into a single community. Of course, this does not exclude the existence of good relations with one's neighbors. Therefore, our foreign policy is aimed at developing overall relations with all the European countries, while also improving relations with neighboring countries, primarily Ukraine, since both our countries are going through the same difficult period of changes. I believe it is to our mutual benefit to have good-neighborly relations. [Ivshyna] The first question was rather diplomatic, while the second one had more to do with the human aspects of relations between people. For instance, when I left Kiev, it was no easy matter to get to Bucharest. I would have liked to have been able to board a plane in Kiev and fly directly to Bucharest. Will that become possible? That would be a good sign in view of the fact that we are, after all, close neighbors. Do you not think that we can move toward closer economic cooperation if we develop our transportation links? Is this a real possibility? [Iliescu] I believe that we will find ways and means of facilitating these links as well as the human links so that people can communicate more easily with one another. In this way, we will also be able to eliminate the relics and vestiges of the past, when we proclaimed "fraternal relations" between our countries, while extremely tough and forbidding obstacles were being raised to block communications between people. I believe that, with the development of democratic structures in our countries, we will manage to establish new and good links for direct communication. [Ivshyna] As far as I know, you are already expected in Kiev and we hope that you will meet with our president there. Could you specify when that visit is going to take place? [Iliescu] I hope that we will be able to pay this visit to Kiev in 1994 and meet with President Kravchuk. [Ivshyna] Will the visit take place at the beginning of the year? [Iliescu] This will be established through democratic [as published] channels. [Ivshyna] I hope we will not have to wait too long. [Iliescu] No. I believe it will take place in the first half of the year. [Ivshyna] In this regard, I would like to ask you another question, one which is equally important for us, namely whether work is proceeding on the drafting of a treaty between our countries and whether you expect it to be signed in the near future. If this is not the case, maybe you can tell us if there are any obstacles to its drafting. Or maybe the drafting of the treaty is not so important as its essence. [Iliescu] Right now, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is elaborating a political document -- a political statement -- to be signed by the two presidents. I believe that we will manage to finish it so that we can meet and sign it in the first half of 1994. This will be a good signal for the overall development of our relations. Of course, there are various problems between our countries. History has left us a difficult inheritance regarding territories and borders, but we are approaching these issues realistically by taking into consideration the new realities prevailing on the continent and between our countries. In view of these realities, we must find political solutions to all these problems in order to promote a climate of good neighborliness between us. [Ivshyna] Mr. President, you are known as a man with progressive views in Ukraine. We do not think of you as a revolutionary in politics, but rather as a politician who believes in consensus, something which is good for politics, since the people are tired and want some quiet for a change. They seem to think that, if things proceed at a slower pace, such a process may ensure that confrontations can be avoided. I realize that a politician of your caliber must take into consideration the entire political spectrum. In this respect, it would be very important for our countries to engage in a dialogue of trust so as to dispel the doubts nurtured by some people in Ukraine. I am referring to the problem that might hamper the signing of a treaty between our countries, namely the territorial problem. If I understand correctly, the real issue is the recognition of existing borders. [Iliescu] The problem raised by you is a complex one. I consider myself a revolutionary but also a politician who is a realist. I was at the center of all the events that characterized the Romanian revolution that was spontaneous and tougher than all the upheavals that took place in the other countries. This has also led to an abrupt change in the political structures. Romanian society was given a revolutionary jolt but, then, we had to create new structures, foster new relations between people, establish a democratic climate in political and social life, reorganize the economy, and implement economic reforms, something which requires a climate of overall cooperation among all the constructive forces in society. This requires exactly what you have just said, namely an open approach to all problems and an open attitude toward all social categories and all political and social forces. This is what I am striving to achieve in my practical activity and what is important for international relations too. In other words, there is the need to tackle concrete situations in a realistic and unbiased manner, something which can create a good climate for the development of international relations. This is what we are trying to accomplish in our foreign policy. [Ivshyna] Of course, there are also certain people in Romania who disagree with this and demand a radical solution. What is your attitude toward them? [Iliescu] We are trying to solve all these problems through dialogue because there are also persons who maintain that the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was not only antidemocratic but also illegal and that we must reestablish the rights of all states and nations proceeding from the historical realities and on the basis of the legal principles governing relations between states. At the same time, as I have already said, one must take into consideration the prevailing realities because nothing good can come out of any other approach. [Ivshyna] The approach suggested by the extremists is very dangerous. [Iliescu] Yes, because it would upset the entire situation in Europe. Such problems exist not only between our countries but practically between all countries. Let us just take Ukraine for example. You have similar problems with the Slovaks, Poles, Russians, and so forth. [Ivshyna] That would be tantamount to opening a "Pandora's box...." [Iliescu] Germany also has such problems. I am referring to Koenigsberg that has become Kaliningrad and so forth. If one starts delving into this problem, there is going to be no end in sight. Therefore, I believe that the only realistic approach to the problem is a political one that takes into account existing realities. All efforts should be made to create a good climate for relations between states. [Ivshyna] You said that you do not speak Russian very well but I see that your Russian is very good. [Iliescu] I have some difficulties in speaking it. [Ivshyna] I would like to ask you how you assess the economic situation in Romania. It seems to me that you started from a very low level, under very harsh conditions, and have now advanced to creating the mechanism of a market economy, whereas Ukraine has probably reached the "critical point" regarding its problems right now. Your experience would be very useful to us, particularly since you recently held consultations with the opposition that has expressed its dissatisfaction with the government's activities. How do you assess the current efforts to promote the process of reform? [Iliescu] There are two aspects to economic life. On the one hand, the difficulties created by the "overthrow" within the country; that is to say, the very rigid and centralized framework and system of economic management of the past was destroyed overnight, at the start of 1990, something which has led to a number of hardships in the development of economic relations within the country. This is one of the aspects. The second one is the collapse of our system of international economic relations particularly with our neighbors -- members of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance -- and the entire space of the former Soviet Union that was our main partner and a very important source of raw and energy materials as well as an important market for the sale of our industrial products. This has been primarily reflected in the fall in industrial production. At this time, our industrial enterprises are operating at half their capacity, something which is obviously creating great social hardships, particularly due to unemployment and inflation. [Ivshyna] The number of unemployed has reached almost one million in Romania. Is this true? [Iliescu] Yes. It is about one million. [Ivshyna] Has it reached the figure of one million? Or maybe even exceeded it? [Iliescu] Yes, it is maybe more than a million. However, as early as the first half of 1990, we started taking steps to open up our economic system and redress our economic situation by giving impetus to the private sector. At this time, the private sector is playing quite an important role in our economy, with a share of more than 30 percent of the labor force. There are over 400,000 private enterprises: The first ones appeared in the trade network, then they extended to services. Now, there are also several small and medium-sized production enterprises. The aforementioned sector is already playing a very active role in the economy, contributing to a reduction in the level of unemployment that otherwise might have been even higher. At the same time, we have been implementing economic reform since 1990, proceeding from an early study on the structure of our economy. That study also represented a first attempt to put together a single strategy for economic reform. We set up a group of experts and economists from various fields, including experts in macroeconomy, who elaborated the general outline of this economic reform: The liberalization of all elements of economic relations and the restructuring of the entire economy, industry, and so forth. It is on this basis that we have taken certain measures in the direction of privatization. The large-scale privatization process is being implemented at a slower pace. We have reorganized industry in its entirety. Some 6,000 industrial enterprises have been reorganized and turned into commercial companies that, in turn, will be transformed into private enterprises on a share-holding basis. However, this process will last a long time due to a shortage of capital for the purchase of those shares. However, in order to facilitate this process, 30 percent of the social capital of these enterprises has been distributed free of charge to all citizens over 18 years of age in the form of value bonds, while the government plans to turn these bonds into shares in 1994. About a third of the 6,000 enterprises will be privatized in 1994. Measures have been taken to liberalize domestic and foreign trade activity as well as prices. This has been a more difficult process; it resulted in the emergence of a number of social problems during the first half of 1993. The entire system of taxes and revenues has been changed with the introduction of value-added-tax that plays a new major role in relations among economic units. This was one of the more radical steps taken in 1993. We also did quite a few things toward laying the foundations of a market economy system, but there is obviously quite a lot still to be done in this respect, hence the new measures envisaged in the government's program. I believe that we will solve some of these problems in 1994 and this will enable us to place our economy on new foundations. [Ivshyna] What is it that upsets the opposition so much that it is demanding a change of government now? [Iliescu] The opposition will always find something to be upset about and will always try to change the government. This is obviously the case with all societies. However, this is not the main problem. The most important problem is the people's discontent; this has its own valid reasons that are linked to the outcome of this "involution" of our economy. By that, I mean the decline in production, inflation, and unemployment, which are causing many hardships for the people and lie at the root of all this discontent that the opposition is obviously trying to exploit. We hope that 1994 will be the year that will see the normalization and revival of our economic activity. We have already had several positive signals in 1993 since we have managed to stop the decline in production; the industrial activity curve is hovering at the "zero level," something which will create the basis of the economic recovery that we are counting on in 1994. In agriculture, we have also had three very difficult years because of the drought. This year was the first one with good crops. Of course, we were faced here with other hardships too, since the cooperative farm system had been disorganized. That was due to the reaction of the peasants after years of brutal interference by the state in the life of cooperative farms that, actually, were not cooperative at all. Hence the reaction of the peasants against the cooperative farms as such, but this has led to other hardships as well. Nevertheless, certain positive trends have already emerged. The peasants are beginning to associate without coercion in order to carry out agricultural work communally, to use jointly the available agricultural technology and the irrigation system, and so forth. Therefore, we hope that, in 1994 and in the coming years, prospects will be created for our agriculture that will enable us to achieve a normal situation. The agricultural sector should play an active role in our economy. Likewise, regarding our exports, we have reached a negative foreign trade balance in the past three years, meaning that imports have increased rapidly while exports have decreased. This has had a very negative impact on our economy and has led to the depreciation of the national currency. In the last three months, we have made certain progress in the sphere of exports. We hope that this will give further impetus to exports in 1994, since this is an important prerequisite for our economy. Consequently, there are certain positive elements that have marked 1993 and we want to develop them further in 1994. [Ivshyna] Many people recall that, a few years ago, foreigners who came to Romania were not able to see neon advertisements and public lights but only a poor market, with only occasional street lighting. We would like to know how you have managed to do away with this energy crisis, so to speak. [Iliescu] This issue has both positive and negative aspects. First, the decrease in industrial production has reduced energy consumption in industry. This has created conditions for improving energy and fuel supplies to the population that had to suffer a lot in this respect in the last years of Ceausescu's regime. [Ivshyna] Did you extract more of your own oil or did you take other measures as well? [Iliescu] No. Simply, the industry has started to consume less, hence my statement about a positive aspect associated with various negative elements. [Ivshyna] As far as we are concerned, this problem of energy resources is a painful one in Ukraine. What is the situation in your country? Do you use your own resources or do you resort to imports? [Iliescu] We are importing crude oil, for instance. Our national production of crude oil is only 6-7 million metric tons per year while we consume some 15 million tons annually. Our refineries have a capacity of 35 million tons. Therefore, we are not even exploiting our refineries to full capacity since we have lost some major suppliers such as the Russian space, Iraq, Libya, and Kuwait and we do not have the necessary financial means to extract more crude oil. Hence, we are limiting ourselves to refining some 15-16 million tons per year. [Ivshyna] When you talked about the serious changes that have occurred in your country, you obviously referred to not only the changes in the economic structure but also those in the political sphere. [Iliescu] The biggest progress of all has been made in the political sphere. The economy is registering a slower pace in this respect. [Ivshyna] I would now like to raise the issue of security, namely how one should fill the "security gap" that has emerged after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. I am not referring to "bloc" matters but I would nevertheless like to know your opinion on the way in which Romania intends to ensure its security in the future. Do you plan to become an unconditional NATO member or do you have other alternatives? For instance, what is your opinion about our president's initiative on creating a security zone in East Europe? [Iliescu] Today, the problem of security is more of a political than military nature. It should reflect all the progress made on our continent in view of the new political relations that have been established between all the countries on this continent. Therefore, we have become actively involved in the CSCE process and we believe that this institution is an important political framework for expanding political relations between all CSCE countries. At the same time, we look toward other international bodies that should radically change their content, such as NATO and the West European Union [WEU], with a view to ensuring that all our countries are included in this framework. We speak out against any discrimination on this matter. There is some talk on whether to include only certain countries in NATO while others are going to be left out. I believe that, if NATO is to become a broader framework for cooperation, then the problem should be broached in the same way for all the countries in our zone. That is why we supported both the initiatives to create a new framework of cooperation with our countries -- there is a partnership and cooperation council at NATO and the WEU -- and the new U.S. initiative Partnership for Peace that advocates a nondiscriminatory approach to all the countries in our region. Generally speaking, we also appreciate the initiative of Ukrainian President Kravchuk as a further possibility of cooperation between the countries in Eastern Europe; an initiative that takes into consideration both the West and Russia so as not to create elements of tension among our countries but to create a general climate of understanding among states. [Ivshyna] It seems to me that you are treating your opposition quite kindly. I would like to know your opinion about the results of the elections in Russia. [Iliescu] There are two aspects there. On the one hand, you have the general results on the adoption of the Russian Constitution with their positive aspects, since the Constitution creates possibilities for the development of the democratic forces in Russia. We hope that these forces will become stronger as this is important both for Russia and for the overall climate in our region, Europe, and the world over. At the same time, there are also certain signals that make us wonder: Zhirinovskiy and all those extremist forces as well as those longing for Russian imperialism whose activities pose a real danger for all domestic forces in Russia but also for our countries. However, we hope that the democratic forces will manage to remove this danger. [Ivshyna] Yes, this worries us too, since we keep being reminded of tragic things regarding a greater Russia and so forth -- something which is rather dangerous if we just think of Germany in 1933 -- at a time when our nations are going through painful changes in the economic and social spheres. Regarding cooperation zones, I would like to ask you another question in connection with the sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia. Since both Romania and Ukraine have had to suffer from the embargo, how do you think that our countries could be compensated for the damage incurred by observing this embargo? [Iliescu] We pin no great hopes on compensations as such. Of course, we acted and raised this problem with all the relevant bodies, including the Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, but we have no great hopes of any real compensation. There is another thing that is important, namely to search for a radical solution to the Yugoslav problem and to find political solutions to all those problems. This primarily depends on Yugoslavia's internal forces and the newly emerged states that themselves have to find solutions to their own problems, something which would lead to the lifting of the sanctions imposed against the internal forces there, sanctions which cause suffering to all innocent people. We also have to suffer, those who are neighboring on the region. I believe that nobody stands to gain from the continuation of this abnormal situation. We hope that political solutions will be found to these problems by establishing normal relations between our countries. [Ivshyna] Mr. President, how do you view the fact that all the West's plans for reestablishing peace in former Yugoslavia have borne no results? [Iliescu] It is very easy to create tension and conflict, but it is very difficult to normalize the situation. I believe that the problem has not always been tackled in a realistic way within Yugoslavia itself, where the internal forces have failed to make the necessary efforts to ensure a normal evolution of the changes that have occurred in Yugoslavia. At the same time, neither have the international bodies treated Yugoslavia's internal problems with adequate understanding and I believe that such an approach has been quite dangerous not only for Yugoslavia but also for the stability of our entire region. [Ivshyna] Mr. President, I would like you to talk about a specific sphere, namely your government's official policy on the issue of guaranteeing the rights of national minorities. I realize that this humanitarian problem is quite important for both our countries. [Iliescu] We have tackled this problem from a political point of view. I believe that we have created the constitutional and legal conditions for all national and religious minorities to become freely involved in the development of our society. We have created conditions for them to be represented in the political bodies. All national minorities are represented in our Parliament, not only the Hungarians, who are the largest minority and have the highest percentage of representation, namely 39 representatives in our Parliament. The smaller minorities also have their representatives in Parliament and in local administration. We have also created conditions for them to be able to develop their culture and specific features in all directions. We consider this a political necessity, in view of the conditions prevailing in our country, while being aware of the fact that this problem is being treated differently in other countries. For instance, many Western European countries do not even have the notion of "national minorities," as the minorities are considered citizens of the respective country and members of its national structure. Take France, for example: If a person is a citizen of France, then he is French. [Ivshyna] This approach has its positive and negative aspects. [Iliescu] For France, there is no such thing as a "French German," but just a "Frenchman." The Germans in Strasbourg are bound by the status of the citizens of that city, hence they are members of the French nation. However, we have a different historical tradition and we have always treated this problem in another way. Our Constitution provides the necessary framework for solving the problems of the national minorities. There are two elements to which one should pay great attention. There are certain separatist trends that are concretely expressed in such slogans as "territorial self-determination on the basis of ethnic criteria." This cannot lead to normal relations between people. How can we isolate the Hungarians living in the center of our country, actually in two counties where they represent the majority of the population? You see, there are Romanians and other nationalities living in those counties as well. Such an approach would lead to a dangerous tendency of isolation and separatism. We view as equally dangerous the desire of certain circles to patronize minorities living on the territory of other states. This could lead to tension in relations between states. In our political activity, we attach great importance to monitoring these two trends that we obviously reject. [Ivshyna] You are distancing yourself from them? [Iliescu] We are in favor of using the national minorities as a binding element between neighboring states and not as an element of creating tension in relations between our countries. [Ivshyna] From press reports, I learned of a sad and undesirable incident that occurred during the protest demonstrations recently held in front of the Russian Embassy in Bucharest in connection with the Ilascu trial [trial of a group of Moldovans headed by Ilie Ilascu, official of the Christian Democratic Popular Front of Moldova, sentenced to death by a court in Tiraspol, Dniester region]: Hooligans destroyed the busts of Russian writers, including Shevchenko. I would like to know your reaction to this incident and whether the busts will be restored. [Iliescu] There can be no doubt at all that we are against such demonstrations organized by some very vociferous groups that are in a minority. From a sentimental viewpoint, I might understand their motivation, but one cannot approve of such deeds. [Ivshyna] As far as Ukraine is concerned, Shevchenko is not only a monument but also a symbol. [Iliescu] The same as Eminescu [classic Romanian poet] is for us. [Ivshyna] I would like you to tell us something about your life outside politics. What else do you do? [Iliescu] Right now, I have no time for anything else. Politics takes up all my time. As a matter of fact, I have no free time left at all. [Ivshyna] Do you like your work? [Iliescu] Of course. Otherwise, I could not do anything. [Ivshyna] Do you have a large family? [Iliescu] No. But I have a lot of brothers and nephews. I live just with my wife. We do not have any children. [Ivshyna] Do you have time for travel? Maybe you like to go hunting or fishing. [Iliescu] No. I have not had time for such things during the last few years. [Ivshyna] Let us make a small incursion into history. It is obvious that your destiny as a politician has obviously blended with the destiny of other personalities and prominent people. What was your relationship with Ceausescu, for instance? [Iliescu] Not very close, although I worked with him directly for some six months in 1971, when I was secretary of the Central Committee [of the Romanian Communist Party]. Until then, we had pretty good relations because, at that time, he was one of the people who worked for openness in our political activity. That was a good time -- the 1960's; I mean, when one can say that Romania was at the forefront of the political, cultural, and economic openness as far as the countries in the East were concerned. In Romania and Czechoslovakia, people were talking for the first time about economic reform, market economy, and merging the plan with the requirements of life. A national conference on this subject was even held in 1967. However, the intervention in Czechoslovakia [Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968] was followed by a period of involution not only for the countries where Soviet troops were deployed but also for Romania. The political tension that emerged at the time was used by Ceausescu as a pretext for a new kind of policy based on the personality cult and on a hardening of the political regime. In 1971, I was in direct contact with him and our differences came to the fore. This happened after a visit he paid to certain Asian countries -- to China and particularly North Korea. Afterward, he removed me from the political leadership.... [Ivshyna] Nevertheless, what is your opinion about him as a man? [Iliescu] He had an intuitive intelligence, otherwise he would not have been able to advance so far, but he had a limited education and culture; actually, he was quite a primitive man. When he got hold of power and began to dominate political life, all these primitive trends came to the fore, that is to say the characteristics of a man who wanted to control and know everything. [Ivshyna] This is an explanation that makes you understand such a phenomenon better. You see, many postsocialist countries are faced with a common danger, namely the danger of nostalgia for the past. What is your opinion on this? What kind of politics should one implement so as to prevent people from developing these feelings of nostalgia? [Iliescu] This is quite a difficult thing to accomplish at such a time as this, when the economy has had to suffer a lot. The Romanian revolution occurred as a reaction of the people against very difficult living conditions. Right now, the situation for some people is even worse than then. The transition is creating such an amount of discontent that some people are beginning to think that it was better before, despite the dictatorship, since they at least had secure jobs and, although they lived modestly, they enjoyed a certain security. But now, when there is unemployment and inflation and the commodity prices keep going up with every passing day, certain people have become melancholic and are longing for the past. Such a danger exists and it can compromise the very idea of reform. Therefore, we are doing our best to make headway along these lines, but it is no easy thing to accomplish. We must get through a very tough period and must openly tell the people about the hardships inherent in the transitional period. [Ivshyna] However, your meetings with the people have become rarer of late. Maybe it is not so comfortable to meet the people at a time when they are having such thoughts, to talk to them about unpleasant things, and tell them to be patient and work.... [Iliescu] No, it is not easy to do that, but it has to be done, and I must say that most of the people realize what is happening, although life is quite hard for them. On the other hand, there are also people who are exploiting such moments; I am basically referring to certain political forces and trade union leaders who are paid to do that. [Ivshyna] What should one do to ensure that the government ship can sail on without being hampered by populist pronouncements? [Iliescu] It is necessary to engage in a frank and constant dialogue with the people and tell them everything openly. When you are frank with the people, they are ready to understand you, even though it may be quite difficult for them to do this. [Ivshyna] I had prepared a few more questions for you but I do not want to take up too much of your time. I would like to thank you for this discussion and ask you to say a few words for our Ukrainian readers. [Iliescu] I would like to take this opportunity to convey my best wishes and my feelings of friendship to the readers of your newspaper. I would also like to express the hope that we will manage to cover this difficult road together, that we will create new and good living conditions for both our peoples, and that we will develop traditional good-neighborly relations between our countries. [Ivshyna] Of course, it is very nice to have relations of friendship. Thank you.
