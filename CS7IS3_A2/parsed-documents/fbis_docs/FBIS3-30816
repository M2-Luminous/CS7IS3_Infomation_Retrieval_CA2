"The president has immediately taken the opportunity to point to the crisis in mutual relations within the coalition and also to the imperfection of the constitutional solutions," Siemiatkowski said today on Radio ESKA. According to the Alliance spokesman, "the president returned to his idea of a strong presidency, which proves that the coalition crisis had been watched closely."
