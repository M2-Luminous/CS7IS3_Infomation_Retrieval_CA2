It's known the great amount of kerosene is in the Batumi port and it's impossible to deliver it to Armenia because of the situation at the Georgian roads. So, Azerbaijan has an additional chance to earn using the situation. According to the data SNARK News Agency possesses, the price for the Azerbaijani kerosene is in 1.5 times more than the price for the fuel which could be brought by planes from Russia and in 2 times more than the Irani kerosene price. Azerbaijani could use the acquired currency to go on with the military actions in Karabakh, so, can this way be considered as the accepted one. Besides, such deliveries are the violations of the "Freedom Defense Law", accepted by the USA Congress which prohibits the USA Government to finance Azerbaijan because of the blockade course he accepted in respect to Armenia and Karabakh.
