He has already been there three times, his most recent visit ending in Beijing last Friday. And his meetings with Mrs. Wu Yi, his Chinese counterpart, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, have a touch of complicity, rather like school friends meeting again after the long vacation. This did not prevent Robert Urbain from giving Mrs. Wu Yi a short expose on the beauties of democracy and giving her a list of political prisoners drawn up by Amnesty International. Last year, the minister remained silent on the subject of human rights, not without prompting some criticism...in Belgium. The minister is pursued by his public even on the other side of the world! Despite these admonitions which are generally frowned upon by China, Mrs. Wu Yi had no hesitation in giving the Belgian-Luxembourg Economic Union (UEBL) a "good report" with regard to the development of trade. According to her figures, bilateral trade increased by 39 percent last year, reaching $1.4 billion, of which $786 million were Belgian exports (in other words up 71.4 percent). This Belgian trade surplus is due (according to the Belgians) to Chinese industry's insatiable demand for new and imported materials. But China also tried to inundate the European markets last year at any cost, believing that this year would serve as a reference for fixing the European single market's import quotas: This hope was dashed, the reference years stop at 1992, and Mrs. Wu Yi was strongly critical of the European Union (EU), even reserving the right to take "any measures" necessary to protect her country's interests... Economic Growth of At Least 9 Percent This Year Mrs. Wu Yi's only criticism of Belgium is the (high) prices and especially the reduction in credit from Brussels to fund its purchases of Belgian technology. Before 1989, the year of the Tian Anmen Square [as published] massacre, it amounted to 400 million Belgian francs, it was then reduced to 200 million, before increasing to 230 million last year, providing finance for only 40 percent of Chinese purchases... Indeed, China is trying increasingly to have its development paid for by other countries, even if its means repaying the (reduced) interest over very long periods, whereas the industrialized states prefer to allow the capital markets (and the client states) to fund infrastructure projects. A trial of strength has therefore started between China, which intends to impose its preconditions as the only country in the world to maintain strong growth (at least 9 percent this year), and the GATT signatory countries who are trying to guard against "development for free." Robert Urbain gave an indirect response to the Chinese expectations, stating that the ceilings on the pledges of the National Export Guarantee Office (providing state guarantees for contracts signed with China) for China had just been doubled, making it possible to considerably increase the cover for exports by Belgian enterprises operating in the Celestial Empire. Alcatel Bell, and ATEA Confirm their Presence Foremost among them is Alcatel Bell with its new telephone exchange factory in Pudong, Shanghai: A Belgian loan of $125 million is imminent and, when it reaches cruising speed at the end of this year, it will become the biggest factory of its kind in the world, with a production capacity of 5 million lines per year, with a significant proportion of the components being imported from Belgium. In the same niche, ATEA, a subsidiary of Siemens, is preparing to export exchanges worth $133 million to China. Finally, among other promising Belgian developments, we should mention Ahlers, the shipowner, which, after setting up an initial joint consulting enterprise, is waiting for the go-ahead to set up "Asco," a Belgian-Chinese maritime company, in the port of Shanghai... Finally, Robert Urbain's visit, which also took place in Shanghai and Suzhou [as published] (another large coastal city), made it possible to show what the minister calls the "growing interconnection" of the two countries' economies, in particular with the holding of the 13th Belgian-Chinese joint commission meeting devoted to the funding of projects some of which have already been mentioned. This public mission is announcing at least three more visits by industrialists scheduled to take place between May and September. Logistics Entrusted to the Chinese Administration? These visits are being organized by Fabrimetal (with the Bank Association) and by the Antwerp chamber of commerce (with the Kredietbank). They will provide an opportunity to make the essential visits to Beijing and Shanghai, but also to less usual cities like Dalian, Chongching, Nankin, or Xian. [as published] Unfortunately, according to several Belgian sources in China, these missions, to reduce their organizational costs, tend to do without the support of local expatriates and to entrust their logistics to cumbersome Chinese administrative departments like the CCPIT (Central Commission for Industrial Promotion), thus depriving themselves of contacts and services which would be very useful to novice businessmen arriving on Asian soil...
