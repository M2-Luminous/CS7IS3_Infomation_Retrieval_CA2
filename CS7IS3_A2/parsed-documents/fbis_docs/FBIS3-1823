Before this, the Hong Kong Government published the part of the budget relating to public expenditures, which shows that the total budgeted expenditures for the next fiscal year will reach as high as HK$146 billion, representing a substantive increase of 6.3 percent over the current year's budget, or breaking the principle that the increase in expenditures must not exceed the rate of economic growth which the Hong Kong Government has pursued all along. In view of this, many people in the community are worried whether the new fiscal budget to be introduced soon will further deviate from the traditional financial management principle of making both ends meet, and whether money will be spent extravagantly for reasons other than economic ones. Judging from the newly released expenditure figures, this worry is completely reasonable. Although the authorities have argued insistently that the growth in budgeted expenditures has slowed obviously, Legislative Councillor Lau Wah-sum, a former financial official of the Hong Kong Government, argued that the authorities do not include the operational funds in the government expenditures because they attempt to "prevent" people from seeing the limitations of a 5 percent growth in expenditures. As history unfolds, the original intention that government expenditure should not be higher than the local economic growth rate was intended to avoid stimulating inflation. However, after Chris Patten -- a former politician -- assumed the governorship, the first fiscal budget under his administration leadership "discarded the old and introduced the new," setting a precedence of allowing the growth in public expenditure to be higher than the economic growth rate. What is noteworthy is that the forthcoming fiscal budget probably will push the proportion of public expenditure to another new height. According to estimates by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, the Taxation Society, and people from accounting circles, the deficit in the new fiscal year will reach HK$10 billion. The huge deficit will be due mainly to the sharp growth of many large infrastructural and capital expenditures. It is believed that the government will continue to run a deficit over the next four years. In other words, spending extravagantly in the good days of the transition period may mean bad days after 1997 and may lead the future special administrative region into dire straits. Although the government seems to be running an increasing surplus, this sharp surplus increase -- in all fairness -- is derived from the unexpectedly "satisfactory" income from the sale of land and from the stock market boom. Unfortunately, it is impossible for this kind of income to remain steady and regular in the long run. Moreover, the policy of pushing up land prices leads directly to a sharp rise in property prices and to high inflation, making it indescribably difficult for mortgage-paying residents and leading to a daily decreasing quality of life. The saying runs "one who does not look far ahead will find himself face to face with immediate trouble." Faced with an uncertain political environment in the remaining years of the transition period, in view of the periodic fluctuations in economic development and the possible influence on Hong Kong's economy that the British side's obstinacy regarding the political system will have, the Hong Kong Government surely has the responsibility to consider the long-term interests of Hong Kong people, bear future needs in mind, stick to the policy of making ends meet, and retain a sufficient financial capability to cope with contingencies. Otherwise, the prosperity bought by spending extravagantly now may change into trouble for Hong Kong people in the future, once they encounter an adverse situation. In the case of welfarism, many Western countries have stumbled over this, so it is important for the Hong Kong Government to draw a lesson from this. Generally speaking, sticking to the financial management tradition of making ends meet is an important factor contributing to the Hong Kong miracle. The Basic Law also provides that the fiscal budget of the special administrative region must uphold the principle of making ends meet. For this reason, there is a need to warn the Hong Kong Government that it should not play a game of figures by formulating a deficit budget with expenditures much greater than income so as to mislead the community.
