FR940304-0-00067 FR940304-0-00019 Cyanea copelandii ssp. copelandii , which has been collected only twice on the southeastern slope of Mauna Loa near Glenwood, was last seen in 1957. It is difficult to adequately survey the area because of vegetation density and the terrain. This population, located on State-owned land, was sighted recently enough that it is still considered extant and contains an unknown number of individuals (HHP 1991f; Thomas Lammers, Field Museum, pers. comm., 1992). This taxon often grows epiphytically and is typically found in Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 2,200 and 2,900 ft (660 and 880 m) (Lammers 1990). Associated species include tree ferns (HHP 1991f). The major known threat to Cyanea copelandii ssp. copelandii is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the single known population. Using sterile type material, Rock (1957) named Cyanea carlsonii to honor Norman K. Carlson, who first saw the taxon (Degener et al. 1969). Carlson cultivated a plant of the taxon in his garden, from which Rock later described the flowers and fruit (Rock 1962). Recently, St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987) placed the genus Cyanea in synonymy with Delissea , resulting in the new combination Delissea carlsonii , but Lammers (1990) retains both genera in the currently accepted treatment of the family. He also considers the taxon to be a subspecies of another species, resulting in the name C. hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii (Lammers 1988). Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii of the bellflower family, a palm-like tree, grows 9.8 to 26 ft (3 to 8 m) tall and has alternate stalkless leaves 20 to 31 in (50 to 80 cm) long and 3 to 5.5 in (8 to 14 cm) wide. Clusters of 5 to 10 flowers have a main stalk 0.6 to 1.2 in (1.5 to 3 cm) long; each flower has a stalk 0.2 to 0.5 in (0.5 to 1.2 cm) long. The hypanthium is topped with five small narrow calyx lobes. The magenta petals are fused into a one-lipped tube 2.3 to 3.1 in (6 to 8 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.4 in (0.6 to 1.1 cm) wide with five down-curved lobes. The purplish-red berries are topped by the persistent calyx lobes. This subspecies is distinguished from ssp. hamatiflora , the only other subspecies, by its long flower stalks and larger calyx lobes. The species differs from others in the genus by its growth habit, its stalkless leaves, the number of flowers in each cluster, and the size and shape of the corolla and calyx (Lammers 1990). Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii is only known to have occurred at two sites on the island of Hawaii, on the western slope of Hualalai and the southwestern slope of Mauna Loa. These two extant populations, located on privately and State-owned land at Honuaulu Forest Reserve and Keokea, are about 28 mi (45 km) apart and contain approximately 19 individuals (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, HPCC 1991c1 to 1991c3). This taxon typically grows in 'ohi'a-dominated Montane Wet Forests at elevations between 4,000 and 5,700 ft (1,220 and 1,740 m) (HHP 1991g1, 1991g2, Lammers 1990). Associated species include kawa'u, pilo, and Myoporum sandwicense (naio) (HHP 1991g1). The major threats to Cyanea hamatiflora ssp. carlsonii are competition from alien plant species such as banana poka, grazing and trampling by cattle, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (HHP 1991g2; Carolyn Corn, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (Hawaii DLNR), in litt ., 1991). Based on sterile specimens collected on the island of Hawaii during the United States Exploring Expedition of 1840 and 1841, Gray (1861b) noted Cyanea grimesiana var. ? citrullifolia . Rock collected the plant in 1955 in the company of Herbert Shipman, after whom he named it as a species, resulting in Cyanea shipmanii (Rock 1957). St. John (1987b, St. John and Takeuchi 1987) placed the genus Cyanea in synonomy with Delissea , resulting in Delissea shipmanii , but Lammers (1990) retains the species in the genus Cyanea .
