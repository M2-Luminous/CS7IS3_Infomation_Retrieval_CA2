Both sides have made threats and neither wants to give in. Today, DPRK Ambassador to Angola Kang Sun-yong called the press to comment on the problem. Reporter Antonio Alves compiled this report: The Patriot missiles which the United States recently set up in the Korean Peninsula and the pressure that it has been applying on the DPRK through the United Nations to have that country's nuclear installations inspected, have irritated the DPRK even more. [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording in Korean, with passage-by-passage translation to Portuguese] Our country is a sovereign country. Though it is a small nation, if the United States should use its might to exert pressure on us, we will confront the Americans and counter their machinations. [end recording] The DPRK has long been on alert and its people are only waiting for one blade of grass of their territory to be touched. [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording] If they start shelling the Korean peninsula, they will disappear forever. [end recording]
