After spending several days and weeks contemplating the one issue that interests you so very much -- an issue you ask me about each and every day -- last night, I came to a decision. That is when I wrote a letter addressed to all ministers of state. This letter was sent to all ministers early this morning -- first by fax, and then followed by the original. The letter says the following: I must begin by stating what I have said many times: The current cabinet members are not only exemplary officials, but I have also developed a close friendship with each of them. Nevertheless, circumstances of which you all are aware have prompted me to take this action, which I would have preferred to avoid. After thinking about this issue, I have concluded that I must reorganize my cabinet. In other countries and for other countries, this is a frequent procedure. For me, however, this situation cannot be described in terms of my personal feelings. Therefore, I, as president of the Republic, ask that you resign from your post as minister of state, thereby enabling me to have the chance to appoint a cabinet which, under the circumstances, would better serve the interests of the Republic of Panama. Because I am not naming a new cabinet at this time, I would be most grateful if you could remain in your post and attend to your duties, for which you will have my support. I thank you in advance, and I reiterate my friendship. Now, before taking your questions, I would like to answer two... [pauses] some of them. First, you probably are wondering when I will appoint the new cabinet. The answer is I do not have a deadline for appointing a new cabinet. This is an issue I will think about constantly over the next few days, and I will make an announcement to the media when I decide on the new cabinet. The second question I am sure you will ask -- indeed, I want to save you the trouble of asking it -- is whether I already have some candidates to fill the posts. The answer is no; I do not have any names to give you officially. This whole time I have been mulling over this issue. I have thought about some people, but I have not made a decision. At this point, I am unable to give you any names. I will announce all of the names when I select my new cabinet. I will now be glad to take your questions, but first I must say that nearly all of the ministers have tendered their resignations. All of them are exemplary citizens who are my friends. I appreciate them very much. This is a situation that, as I said before, is normal in some countries. I never like making cabinet changes, as you are well aware. [Unidentified moderator] We will now begin the question and answer period. We will begin with colleague Luis Alberto Henriquez of RPC Radio. [Henriquez] Good morning, Mr. President. First, I would like to ask this: What is the objective of your new cabinet? Will the new ministers be members of your party of [word indistinct]? [Endara] You are all aware of the reason. It is a situation we have been experiencing for a number of days. You have all awaited anxiously for me to make a decision. I told all of you that at the opportune time... [pauses] I first told you I was mulling over the matter. Then I told you that at an appropriate time I would inform all of you together, as I am doing now. The reasons are obvious. These are the changes that have taken place within the political scene. I would have preferred that these situations did not affect my government, but as in any government or any democratic government in the world, political changes have repercussions within the government. As to whether all of the cabinet members will be members of my party, I reiterate that I have not made a decision on the names of the people I will pick for my cabinet. In principle, it is not my intention that all cabinet members belong to my party. My intention is that independent individuals and those from some other parties should participate. This is my intention, but I have not made the final decision.
