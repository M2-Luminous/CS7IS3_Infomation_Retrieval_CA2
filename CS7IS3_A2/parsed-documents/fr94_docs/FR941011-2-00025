ACTION: Receipt of applications for scientific research permits (P368D and P132B). SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, P.O. Box 450, Moss Landing, CA 95039&hyph;0450, (Principal Investigators: Drs. James T. Harvey, Daniel P. Costa, John Calambokidis and Ms. Dawn Goley) and PRBO International Biological Research, 4990 Shoreline Highway, Stinson Beach, CA 94970 (Principal Investigators: William J. Sydeman and Sarah G. Allen) have applied in due form for permits to take marine mammals for purposes of scientific research. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Both applications and related documents are available for review upon written request or by appointment in the following office(s): Permits Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Highway, Room 13130, Silver Spring, MD 20910 (301/713&hyph;2289); and Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213 (310/980&hyph;4016). Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on these requests, should be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1315 East-West Highway, Room 13130, Silver Spring, MD 20910, within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set forth the specific reasons why a hearing on this particular request would be appropriate. Concurrent with the publication of this notice in the Federal Register , the Secretary of Commerce is forwarding copies of these applications to the Marine Mammal Commission and its Committee of Scientific Advisors. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The subject permits are requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq .), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .), the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222), the Fur Seal Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1151 et seq .), and fur seal regulations at 50 CFR part 215. (P368D) Moss Landing Marine Laboratories requests a Permit to incidentally harass an unspecified number of species of the suborders Mysticete, Odontocete, Pinnipedia, and the southern sea otter during aerial and shipboard surveys, behavioral observations (resulting from acoustical studies), photographic identification and tagging (radio tags and/or TDRs). Mysticetes (except Northern right whales), Odontocetes (except killer and pilot whales, northern right whale dolphin, Dall's and harbor porpoise), and California sea lions will be opportunistically tagged with a VHF and/or TDR. Acoustic signals (0.5&hyph;20 kHz) will be recorded and monitored continuously while conducting shipboard surveys. The study area is off the California coast where the marine mammal fauna is diverse and abundant, with seasonality of occurrence for many species. The primary objectives are to determine the general ecology and behavior of marine mammals off California, and secondarily, determine the effects of the Acoustic Thermometry of Oceanic Climate Project (ATOC) signals on the ecology and behavior of marine mammals. The applicants are not seeking a permit to take marine mammals using ATOC-type sounds but to study the ecology and behavior of marine mammals using various methodologies and while studying the effects of a sound source. (P132B) PRBO International Biological Research requests a Permit to flipper tag and/or mark up to 2900 Northern elephant seals ( Mirounga angustirostris ) on the South Farallon Islands and at Point Reyes National Seashore annually. Up to 50 elephant seals may be retagged annually. During the tagging and marking activities, and during opportunistic collection of dead prematurely born northern sea lion pups, up to 100 harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina ), 1200 California sea lions ( Zalophus californianus ) and 70 northern sea lions ( Eumetopias jubatus ) may be incidentally harassed.
