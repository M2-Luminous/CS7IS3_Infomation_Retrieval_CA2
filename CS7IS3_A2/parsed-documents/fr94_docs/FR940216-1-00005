FR940216-1-00005 FR940216-1-00002 Third, in contrast to the criterion for Presidential action under Exon-Florio, i.e., that the foreign party acquiring control might take action that ``threatens to impair the national security,'' the criterion for undertaking an investigation of transactions involving government controlled entities is that there could be an effect on the national security. The term ``foreign government'' has been broadly defined for purposes of these proposed regulations to include any government or body exercising governmental functions, and includes but is not limited to national as well as various regional and local levels of government. It is important to note that the definition is not limited to the particular levels of government that are specified in the proposed regulation, and that other governmental bodies, including supra-national entities such as the European Union (including its component parts), are covered by this regulation. For purposes of the mandatory investigation provision, the proposed regulations define the term ``engage in'' as used in the phrase ``seeks to engage in any merger, acquisition or takeover *␣*␣*'' to mean ``seeks to acquire control through.'' The purpose of this regulation is to clarify that the mandatory investigation provision would not be triggered in cases where a foreign government controlled entity is a passive participant in an acquisition by a foreign person. The Committee believes that this reading is supported by the legislative history, and particularly floor statements made by members of Congress who sponsored this particular amendment. See, e.g., Cong. Rec., Sept. 18, 1992, pages S 14050 through 14053 (comments of Senators Exon, Sarbanes and Riegle); and Cong. Rec. Oct. 3, 1992, page H 10986 (comments of Representative Collins). Drafting Information The principal author of this document is the Office of the Assistant General Counsel (International Affairs). However, personnel from other offices of the Treasury Department and from other agencies that are members of the Committee participated extensively in its development.
