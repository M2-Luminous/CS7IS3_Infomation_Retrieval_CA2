Commenting on a letter 'Arafat sent in response to a letter to him by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, chief of the Hamas political bureau, the source said: We in the Hamas Movement were astonished by the way 'Arafat replied to our letter in which we asked him to return to national ranks and make the courageous decision to withdraw from the negotiations. We believed the horrible massacre of worshipers in Hebron would shake 'Arafat to his foundations and prompt him to reconsider and withdraw from the negotiations. However, nothing of the kind happened. 'Arafat attempted to absorb the overwhelming popular indignation against his collapsing policy. By saying in his letter that a deviation from his and the PLO's policy is a deviation from the national consensus, 'Arafat seems to be saying that the majority of the Palestinian people are outside the national consensus and that he regards only himself and his capitulating minority as the entire Palestinian people. This is gross contempt for our people and their fighting forces. It appears 'Arafat is unaware of the pulse of the indignant Palestinian masses who are angry with him and his capitulationist policy, and his shaky stand against the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The PLO's conditions for returning to negotiations are flimsy and cannot be compared with the size of the massacre. Yet 'Arafat and his cohorts would soon decide to resume negotiations the moment their U.S. master makes a decision to this effect. We ask 'Arafat to step aside and resign his leadership of the Palestinian people because he represents only himself and an isolated group that is oppressing our people. SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes herewith the verbatim text of 'Arafat's letter in answer to the letter sent by the chief of the Hamas political bureau as disseminated by Palestinian embassies and press agencies: I have read your letter on the deplorable massacre perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers, with the participation and support of Israeli Army units, against our steadfast, pious people who were kneeling in prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the city of Khalil al- Rahman [Abraham]. God said in his clear book of wisdom: But those who are slain in the way of God, He will never let their deeds be lost; soon will he guide them and improve their condition and admit them to the garden which he has announced for them. [Koranic verses] This is the time for unity, solidarity, and unity of ranks and not for division and differences. We are now in need of unity and cohesion more than ever before because we are waging a very fierce battle to find a drastic and comprehensive solution to the problem of settlements and to disarming the settlers and to ensure international protection for our people. The souls of our pious martyrs, all of our martyrs, are beacons to light our path in order to enter Palestine raising the banners of Jihad, struggle, and victory. Our direction is holy Jerusalem, the first of the two qiblahs, the third holiest mosque, and the capital of our independent state. We are potential martyrs on the way to Palestine. Then give the glad tidings to the believers. [Koranic verse] Palestine has returned to the political and geographical map, thanks to decades of Palestinian people's jihad and struggle on all levels and forums. The savage and deplorable murders committed by the fanatic extremists are a desperate attempt to prevent our people from reaching their national aims of ending the Israeli occupation and saving our Islamic and Christian holy places from the yoke of occupation and restoring our people's inalienable national rights, including their right to return, to exercise self-determination, and to establish their independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. Palestine is the focus of our attention and the dearest place to our hearts. It is the bride whose dowry is paid by the lives of our men. Struggle and jihad will continue to regain it and realize just peace for it so that our Palestinian people will be able to live in peace, justice, and stability. Everyone is asked to stand together behind the PLO, our people's sole legitimate representative, in its policy and methods that have been approved by the our successive national councils. To deviate from these policies is to deviate from the national consensus, causes great harm to our people's just cause. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. And we shall try you until we test those among you who strive their utmost and persevere in patience, and we shall try your reported mettle. [Koranic verse] We pray to almighty God to grant us one of the two favors: either victory or martyrdom.
