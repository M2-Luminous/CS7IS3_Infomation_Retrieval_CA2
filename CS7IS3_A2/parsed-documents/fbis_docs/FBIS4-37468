[Sheves] I would not call it "the White House team model," but I have definitely been trying to create a structure that will fit the direct election of the prime minister and the modus operandi of a prime minister elected in such elections. I have learned a lot from my meetings, talks, and friendships with people in the White House and the State Department. Once a year I meet U.S. administration officials, and next month I will be meeting the President's advisers and State Department officials. What I am particularly interested in learning from them is how to implement the platform the President presented in the election campaign. [Shehori] Some structures have not been successful, such as the follow-up team which collapsed. [Sheves] Not only did it not collapse, but it became stronger and its standing with the government ministries is steadfast. It consists of two branches: One follows up on the prime minister's decisions, which means working with the ministries on preeminent issues, such as monitoring the budgetary expenditures of each ministry. This work is done by one person, who once a month submits a report to the prime minister on the activities of all the ministries. A second team monitors how budgets are spent on interministerial activities. All in all we are talking about four employees. The second branch deals with the implementation of administrative decisions and the removal of red tape on issues such as road paving, construction, housing, land marketing, and the use of budgets in the Arab, Bedouin, and Druze sectors. There is yet another team, the national projects team headed by Yehezqel Har- Melekh, which deals with the transfer of industrial plants from the center of the country to development areas, the reclassification of settlement areas, and localized treatment of problematic areas. [Shehori] Is your goal to make the Prime Minister's Office a super ministry? [Sheves] I have never talked about a super ministry, but about an office liaising between all the government ministries. One of my sorriest conclusions is that the government ministries are a confederation of offices which require coordination on almost every subject. [Shehori] Do you enjoy the full cooperation of all the ministries? [Sheves] Most of them. From the Finance Ministry I only get partial cooperation. [Shehori] Why? [Sheves] Because the finance minister and I have different personalities and we have different views about many issues. [Shehori] If there is one common denominator to the departure of several officials from the prime minister's bureau, this seems to be their frustration over the compartmentalization and the lack of access to sources of information. [Sheves] Give me one example. [Shehori] Elyaqim Rubinstein, who was not let in on the Oslo process. [Sheves] So what? He was not the only one who did not know. Many cabinet ministers did not know either. Rabin and Peres wanted only a minimum number of people to know the details so that the negotiations could end successfully. I think it was the right decision. Gad Ben-Ari did a good job and for the most part people were satisfied with it. After two years he decided to move to another job -- head of the Jewish Agency delegation in the United States -- which suited him and his family better. Eli Rubinstein sees his future in the legal field and decided to pursue a purely legal career as the legal adviser of the defense establishment, but at the same time he continues to head the delegation to the talks with Jordan and is doing an excellent political job. Jacques Neriya reached the conclusion that it would be best for him, both financially and in terms of promoting his personal career, if he became the head of the Histadrut labor federation's international affairs department. His was one of the most successful appointments in this office in the last two years. [Shehori] Are there plans to fill the job left vacant by Hayim Asad as strategic adviser to the prime minister? [Sheves] No. He had also been supposed to head the national security team, but this did not come about. He never dealt with this issue. His is the only appointment I feel was a failure. Hayim Asad was not the right man for the job, neither in terms of his qualifications nor on the personal level. [Shehori] You have had confrontations with Ministers Ya'aqov Tzur, Avraham "Beiga" Shohat, and Binyamin "Fu'ad" Ben-Eli'ezer. [Sheves] I have had no confrontations with Tzur and Fu'ad. Tzur promised to appoint a friend of ours, Bentzi Weiner, as director general of the Agriculture Ministry but he did not keep his promise. Tzur does not deny that he made such a promise, and I am no longer angry with him. I got angry in the way friends do, but our dispute ended in September 1992. We work closely together. With Fu'ad I have had two professional, not personal, arguments. One was two years ago over the issue of highways and junctions and it all ended well, in a friendly and matter-of-fact manner. Our second argument was over the fact that I submitted a serious, authoritative, responsible, and learned study about the rise in the price of apartments in Israel in the past six months. He did not appreciate this fact very much, and I understand him. At the same time, there is cooperation between us and together we worked out the draft resolution submitted to the cabinet. As for Beiga Shohat, the issue runs much deeper. I have a serious argument with him about priorities. I greatly appreciate the macro achievements in the Israeli economy. The problem is with the micro-strategic issues, such as tackling the problem of housing in a timely and firm manner. [Shehori] Did you expect the prime minister to appoint you as a minister when Ramon quit? [Sheves] I did not expect it and I do not think he could. [Shehori] You had expectations in the political sphere, but in the end you have been left out of it. [Sheves] I have not been neutralized at all in the political sphere, the prime minister includes me in everything. I do not play a functional role in the negotiations because I am not a member of any delegation. I have never wanted to be a member or head of any delegation. I know I am not qualified for such a job because I have no experience in this field and this is a very professional area. However, I have assisted and I continue to assist on many issues in the political sphere. [Shehori] What are your aspirations? [Sheves] I will not run in the primaries, I have no plans to be a politician, I do not want to be either a member of the Knesset or a cabinet minister. I want to serve Rabin as director general of the Prime Minister's Office and to be successful in my job. I will take it from here; I do not plan anything in advance. I never planned to be the director general of the Prime Minister's Office.
