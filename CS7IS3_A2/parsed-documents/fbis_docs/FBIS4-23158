[Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or less attained its mandate having contributed to the decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the political liberation. [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South Africa playing? [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we came here about two years ago we never thought that the elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience in conflict resolutions. [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both for the OAU and for South Africa? [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country technologically and even politically. And so those experiences are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization, as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa, I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state -- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be able to interact with the rest of the continent because South Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a member of any other international community. So for South Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.
