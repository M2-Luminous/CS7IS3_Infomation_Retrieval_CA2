It also issued a circular on studying the works, in which it urged the trade unions at all levels to integrate the study of the works with that of Volume 3 of Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works. They should earnestly study and read the original works by bearing in mind the reality of trade union work, grasping the essence of the works, and applying the scientific theories to arm themselves, and directing their practice so as to bring about prosperous development in trade union work and the workers' movement in the new historic period. Attending the forum were Wei Jianxing, Yu Qiuli, several scores of cadres from the Federation, and the representatives of staff members and workers. Speaking at the forum were Yu Qiuli; Zhang Dinghua, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and first secretary of the Federation's Secretariat; Gu Dachun, former vice president of the Federation; Yang Chungui, vice president and professor of the party school under the CPC Central Committee; and Liu Li, leader of the operation group of the western district international affairs bureau under the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Bureau. They pointed out: In directing the grand cause of socialist modernizations, reform, and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always attached great importance on the working class and trade union work. His important expositions on a series of issues, such as relying on the working class wholeheartedly and bringing into full play the role of trade unions, represent his scientific summarization on China's workers' movement and trade union work. They also represent the most powerful ideological weapon to bring about the sound development of the workers' movement and trade union work in China and constitute the important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They contended: Earnestly studying and deeply exploring Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideology on the working class and trade unions is of great, practical, and far-reaching importance to deeply understanding the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to implementing in an overall way the party's basic line and its fundamentally guiding principle of relying on the working class wholeheartedly; to actively exploring a new way for the trade union work of socialism with Chinese characteristics; to vigorously creating a new situation in trade union work; to uniting with and mobilizing hundreds of millions of staff members and workers to closely rally round the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; and to uniting as one and waging arduous struggles so as to win an important and great victory in the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. In editing the publication of "Deng Xiaoping's Works on the Working Class and Trade Unions," the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has selected 55 works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to the expositions made by him on the working class and trade unions during the various periods. Of these works, those that first became available to the public include "The Outline of His Report Made at the Urban Work Conference Sponsored by the Southwest Bureau" and "The Issue on the Correct Relationship Between the Party and Mass Communities."
