FR940722-0-00133 FR940722-0-00019 4. Definition of Rural Telephone Company 193. As discussed above, we have adopted several measures to assist rural telephone companies in the broadband PCS service. We decide here the definition of rural telephone companies who are eligible for those benefits. As explained below, for this service, we shall depart from the definition adopted in the Second Report and Order and define rural telephone companies as local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. 194. As we pointed out in the Second Report and Order, 162 most of those responding to our tentative conclusion in the Notice concerning the definition of a rural telephone company contended that the proposed definition, which was based on the standard contained in Section 63.58 of the Commission's Rules, was too restrictive. A variety of more inclusive definitions were recommended. 163 Some commenters advocated a definition in which a company would qualify if it satisfied either of two alternative criteria based on population of communities served or number of access lines. 164 Others advocated adoption of a definition focusing simply on the number of access lines provided. 165 One commenter advocated a definition focusing exclusively on revenues rather than access lines, with the standard for rural telephone company status at annual revenues under $100 million. 166 In addition, some advocated a somewhat more restrictive definition. 167 162 Second Report and Order at ¶¶279&hyph;282. 163 See, e.g., comments of Saco River, Telephone Electronics, and Iowa Network (advocating amending the proposed definition merely by raising the population threshold to 10,000), and comments of Chickasaw (advocating definition including companies that predominantly, but not exclusively, serve customers in communities of less than 10,000 in non-urbanized areas). 164 See, e.g., comments of Telocator, TDS, NYNEX, NOTA, NTCA and Saco River (recommending a definition including companies that either provide service only within communities of 10,000 or less in non-urbanized areas or provide 10,000 or fewer access lines (and no more than 150,000 in conjunction with affiliates)); comments of OPASTCO (recommending defining rural telephone companies as those that either provide exchange service only within communities of 10,000 or less in non-urbanized areas or that provide 50,000 or fewer access lines; and comments of SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy (recommending a definition including companies serving communities of 20,000 or less in non-urbanized areas or providing 50,000 or fewer access lines (including lines provided by affiliates)). 165 See, e.g., comments of STCL, MEBTEL, CFW, Minnesota Equal Access Network, Rural Cellular Assn., Rural Cellular Corp., Rochester Tel. Corp, McCaw, DialPage, APC, TDS and Gulf Telephone Co. (suggesting caps between 25,000 and 150,000 access lines). 166 Comments of PMN. 167 See, e.g., comments of GTE (definition would apply only to companies that exclusively serve customers in communities of 10,000 or less in non-urbanized areas and that provide wireline exchange service to 10,000 or fewer customers). 195. Many commenters suggested limiting rural telephone eligibility to carriers serving communities with no more than 10,000 inhabitants, asserting that such a standard better comports with common notions about which telephone companies are ``rural.'' 168 A number of other commenters supported a definition of rural telephone company that would include a limitation on the size of the company. OPASTCO, for example, asserted that such a limitation would comport with the statutory mandate to ensure opportunity for rural telephone companies because ``the problem such companies face in the competitive bidding arena'' is as much a function of their size as of the rural character of their service areas.'' 169 NTCA similarly contended that small companies have shown the interest and commitment needed to fulfill the explicit statutory goal of ``rapid deployment of new *␣*␣* services for *␣*␣* those residing in rural areas,'' citing as support a report on the deployment of digital switching by small LECs. 170 Other parties suggested that we look to the unenacted antecedent of the Budget Act, S. 1134, in which a rural company was defined as an entity that either (a) ``provides telephone exchange service by wire in a rural area'' ( i.e., a non-urbanized area containing no incorporated place with more than 10,000 inhabitants), (b) ``provides telephone exchange service by wire to less than 10,000 subscribers,'' or (c) ``is a telephone utility whose income accrues to a State or political subdivision thereof.'' 168 See, e.g., comments of OPASTCO, Iowa Network, Saco River and Telephone Electronics. 169 Comments of OPASTCO at 5. 170 Comments of NTCA at 7&hyph;8. 196. In the Second Report and Order, we adopted a definition of ``rural telephone company'' that includes independently owned and operated local exchange carriers that (1) do not serve communities with more than 10,000 inhabitants in the licensed area, and (2) do not have more than 50,000 access lines, including all affiliates. 47 CFR §1.2110(b)(3). We stated our belief that a limitation on the size of eligible rural telephone companies is appropriate because Congress did not intend for us to give special treatment to large LECs that happen to serve small rural communities. See Second Report and Order at ¶282. 197. Several parties who filed petitions for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order argue that the definition adopted for rural telephone companies may be too restrictive given the capital intensive nature of broadband PCS. 171 We also note that NTCA argued in its comments in this proceeding that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to use the same criteria to define rural telephone companies in rules pertaining to different services, technologies, and industries. 172 Likewise, in an ex parte letter, OPASTCO states that by defining rural telephone company for purposes of broadband PCS as a local exchange carrier with less than $100 million in revenue, the Commission will properly capture in the defined class locally-owned telephone companies who are truly interested in providing services to rural areas. 173 OPASTCO notes that the ``same universe of companies'' that would fall under such a revenue threshold would be captured by a definition that includes all telephone companies having 100,000 or fewer access lines. 174 171 See, e.g., petitions of South Dakota Network (SDN), U.S. Intelco, NTCA, Rural Cellular Association and TDS. We note that similar arguments have been made with respect to other services. 172 See comments of NTCA at 4. 173 Ex parte filing of filing of OPASTCO, June 2, 1994, at 2; see also comments of PMN at 7&hyph;8. 174 Id. 198. Our challenge in establishing a definition of a rural telephone company for broadband PCS is to achieve the congressional goal of promoting the rapid deployment of this new service in rural areas by targeting only those telephone companies whose service territories are predominantly rural in nature, and who are thus likely to be able to use on their existing wireline telephone networks to build broadband PCS infrastructures to serve rural America. For purposes of our rules governing broadband PCS licenses, we believe that this goal can best be achieved if we define rural telephone companies as those local exchange carriers having 100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. We agree with OPASTCO that such a definition will include virtually all of the telephone companies who genuinely are interested in providing services to rural areas. This definition will encourage participation by legitimate rural telephone companies without providing special treatment to large LECs. Therefore, we will better achieve the congressional goal of providing service rapidly to rural areas without giving benefits to large companies that do not require such assistance. Rural telephone companies that satisfy this definition thus will be eligible for rural partitioning, as discussed above. 175 175 Such companies also will be eligible for special treatment under our cellular attribution rules for broadband PCS. See 47 CFR §24.204(d)(2)(ii).
