Ministers plan to amend the Criminal Justice Bill to impose stiffer penalties on those responsible for a rising tide of drug-linked violence in inner-cities. Involvement in trafficking and supply will be included alongside assault, theft, arson and resisting arrest as a specific offence under section 17 (2) of the 1968 Firearms Act. The change would close a loophole that allowed traffickers to be treated less severely when arrested while holding a gun than someone involved in these other crimes who was similarly armed. The clause now sets a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, an unlimited fine or both on conviction. The Government has indicated it will accept proposals drawn up by the Home Office's Firearms Consultative Committee, chaired by Lord Kimball. With the Criminal Justice Bill currently going through Parliament, the committee approached Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, directly on the subject rather than wait to issue its annual report on firearms legislation. Lord Kimball, a former Conservative MP, told the Home Secretary that his proposals would help "allay public concern" at the increased use of firearms in drugs-related offences. Such concern was provoked by the murder of Pc Patrick Dunne, 44, in Clapham, south London, last October. The community policeman is believed to have been the victim of one of a number of drugs gangs in London. Police believe armed drugs gangs have also been operating in Moss Side, Manchester, south London and in several other cities across the country. In October last year police discovered arms including a sub-machine gun and six pistols with a Â£85,000 drug haul in Coventry. Increasingly violent territorial battles between gangs has led to calls from police and politicians for action to curb their activities. Explaining the need to change the law, Lord Kimball said: "There is a danger there will be a public reaction which will create unnecessary problems for legitimate users of firearms. This is something we are hoping to pre-empt." There was support for the plans from Mr Peter Butler, Tory MP for Milton Keynes North East and a member of the all-party Home Affairs Committee. "It seems to be part of an excellent solution but I think there must be minimum sentences. "I think there has been a groundswell of public concern about drugs and violence and this does seem to address both issues." [passage omitted]
