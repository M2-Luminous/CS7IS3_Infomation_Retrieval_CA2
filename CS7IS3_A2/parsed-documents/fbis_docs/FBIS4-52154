Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Hata, who is on a tour of four European nations, said, "the remarks of Justice Minister Nagano were not appropriate. I frankly regret... I telephoned and reprimanded Justice Minister Nagano." "Justice Minister Nagano said his remarks were inappropriate and he would retract them. He said his remarks hurt the sentiments of many people and repents," Hata said. "I appointed him (as justice minister) because he is a man of noble character and has a sense of balance. I would like to accept his withdrawal of the remarks and apology seriously," he said. Asked whether he will dismiss Nagano from the post, Hata said, "I will avoid referring to resignation at this point. (The government) is conveying the real intention (of Nagano) to various countries and I hope (they) will understand," he said. Nagano said in a newspaper interview published Wednesday that Japan's role in the war was not aggression and the Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication." His remarks triggered an angry response from a number of Asian countries and he retracted them at a news conference Friday.
