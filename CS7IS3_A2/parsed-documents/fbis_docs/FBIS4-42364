But it wants Europe to start buying European rather than American. The 1995-2000 Military Programming Law "restores our confidence," said Serge Dassault, CEO of Dassault Industries and GIFAS president. "France is demonstrating its determination to preserve its armament industry." Nevertheless, the law also worries the aerospace sector, whose revenues (120.2 billion francs) dropped by 8.5 percent last year. Since the Military Programming Law favors ongoing programs, it potentially threatens research, where spending may fall by as much as 10 percent. "If we want to be able to develop new products within 10 years, now is the time to launch preparatory studies," argues Serge Dassault, who fears that "research teams and know-how may become scattered." Should this happen, firms will find it harder to remain competitive. And one government objective is precisely to boost competitiveness within the coming five years. However, this requires that firms be given some maneuvering room as far as jobs are concerned, Serge Dassault claims: "The government cannot ask us to avoid layoffs and to improve productivity at the same time." While he would like to see France adopt "an procurement system that would cover several years" instead of the current budgetary one, Serge Dassault wants above all to be able to compete with the Americans on two markets: the export market, and Europe. With regard to the export market, he requests increased government support, matching that provided by Washington or the Eximbank. As for Europe, he would like it to at least buy European at last. In the middle of the European election campaign, "we do not hear anything said about European defense or European preference," he notes sar. "Every time a government chooses to buy American, it is Europe that suffers." Repealing the `Buy American Act' For Serge Dassault, this is all the more important since on their home market the Americans are protected by the "Buy American Act." On the other hand, "every time a need emerges in Europe, the Americans show up. This is completely wrong." However, Mr. Dassault can only admit that manufacturers have no real power on this issue. Decisions "are up to the governments." And the interests of governments are not the same depending on whether they have or they do not have a domestic aircraft industry. This is why, for lack of a better solution, Dassault Vice President Charles Edelstenne, who maintains that "80 percent of combat aircraft in Europe are American ones," bluntly demand that the Buy American Act be repealed. Of course, anyone aware of just how fiercely the Americans have been protecting their aerospace industry will know that this has to be a purely formal demand. But it is also a way of setting the record straight, because, as Francois David, Aerospatiale deputy manager and GIFAS vice president, pointed out: "While the Americans do not speak about American preference, they do enforce it; whereas while we talk about European preference, we do not enforce it." possible to guarantee 50,000 jobs over 25 years.
