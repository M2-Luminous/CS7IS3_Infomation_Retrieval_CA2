The politicians are reacting with shock and alarm, and are demonstrating determination -- but they actually bypass the problem. They are competing for the most radical proposals on bans, tougher laws, and harsher penalties. And, in every other regard, they continue as in the past, until next time. This next time will come, no matter how intensively we try to prevent it. Admitting this has nothing to do with resignation or cynicism. It is virtually a precondition for any rational and successful action against right-wing extremism. Luebeck was already "the next time." That right-wing terror would be turned against the Jews at some stage could be predicted, at the latest since the wave of xenophobia in 1992. Now toughness is supposed to help against the so-called Republikaner: banning the party of the Republikaner, depriving Schoenhuber of his basic rights, banning Republikaner from exercising their profession -- the inventiveness is unlimited when the presentation of alleged panaceas is involved. And Schoenhuber is on the front pages of the newspapers day after day. What else could he wish for? However, this is not the only thing that must arouse skepticism. Even in the Social Democratic Party of Germany it is exclusively repressive measures against right-wing extremism that are currently being discussed. Using the methods of the right against the right -- can it work? In fact, all these proposals aim only at the symptoms. They divert attention from the reasons for the right-wing violence and for the election successes of the Republikaner, even though we know these reasons only too well. It is the increasing social injustice; it is prospects for life that have been destroyed by unemployment; it is the experience of helplessness toward a policy in which "solidarity" has become a foreign word. None of that can be found in the debate in Bonn. Certainly, it is not easy to admit that the failure of one's own policy has also contributed to providing fertile soil for Schoenhuber and others. However, we cannot avoid that. Above all, we cannot avoid a revision of this policy. Because as long as work, income, and housing in Germany are not distributed justly, there will be people who turn their frustration into hatred against all those who are different or who think differently -- no matter whether or not the Republikaner are banned. It is this not-wanting-to-realize, this always-being-surprised-again, which prevents rational dealing with right-wing extremists (and gives them ever new publicity). They is no "right-wing specter" that comes and goes when it feels like it. We will have to deal with them for a long time. Repressive means are suitable only when violence and instigation are involved. Of course, we have to prosecute violence relentlessly -- but still, in particular where young people are involved, we must not forget that harsh punishment causes rigid attitudes: In this field, too, the renunciation of prison reduces the quota of recidivists. Of course, we must consistently punish instigating people. A draft law in Lower Saxony to make the penal code more precise in this respect has been in the Bundesrat for a year now. It may be that we will have to add a supplement because of the terrible decision on the holocaust by the Federal Constitutional Court [which ruled that denying the holocaust occurred is not a punishable offense]. We do not need any new laws that go beyond that. They just make the Republikaner important. Of course, the constitutional protection service must watch the Republikaner, without any restrictions. And if the courts in Lower Saxony continue to prohibit us from watching them, we will have to amend our constitutional protection law. Of course, we will dismiss any teacher who causes right-wing agitation in our schools. But for that the disciplinary law is sufficient. The arguments with which we abolished the decree on radicals four years ago are today as correct as they were at that time. What is wrong with us that we want to give -- without any need to do so -- the Republikaner the publicity of protracted procedures for banning someone from his profession? What else would be the result of an application to ban the Republikaner other than providing them with a wonderful forum to spread their cynical way of thinking via all the media? I do not even want to speak of the practical difficulties and risks of such measures. However, even if we assume that an application to ban the party were to be granted by the Federal Constitutional Court, How are we supposed to explain to potential voters of the Republikaner that it is democratic to eliminate their party juridically since we cannot cope with it politically -- just in time for the biggest election marathon in German history? No. Ignatz Bubis [chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany] is quite right when he does not file a complaint against Schoenhuber. It is bad enough that Schoenhuber's well-calculated infamy has been spread by the media all over the place. He is just waiting for an opportunity in court to spread his anti-Semitic trash and "prove" it in front of benches crammed full of journalists. The right-wing agitators deserve a different way of being dealt with -- namely not dealing with them at all. I am not willing to engage in discussions on television with representatives of the Republikaner, because, no matter how such an event ends, it makes the Republikaner important. There they can present themselves in bourgeois decency, with equal rights and with an equal time to speak, and if I really want to deal with their ideology, then they are the ones that dictate the subject of discussion. I really do not know what is worse: The sympathy that a Republikaner functionary who is driven into a corner might arouse or Schoenhuber's comradely assurance that "we agree on all the important issues." The Republikaner know very well why they are trying to force participation in election debates on television by going to court. Certainly not because they fear any loss of popularity there. In my view, this too is part of the social ostracism of right-wing extremism. Not only Max Streibl's "private" meeting with Schoenhuber makes the Republikaner socially acceptable. The ARD [First German Television Channel] and ZDF [Second German Television Channel] are also contributing to this with their unfortunate decision about future invitations to election broadcasts. Anyone who brings the Republikaner into his program because he is also speculating on an increase in entertaining suspense is on the way to wishing for a situation like Weimar, just because it might be the background for exciting television entertainment. We have to deal with right-wing extremist thinking in a completely different place and in a completely different way. If it is correct that the majority of those who vote for the Republikaner just want to express a protest and do not really want the Republikaner to participate in government, then it hardly helps to take Schoenhuber's party apart with arguments. And it is equally unhelpful if we try to "catch" these people by increasingly adjusting our policy to the topics and contents of the Republikaner. It may be that such a swing to the right is rather to the liking of some conservatives -- I think Wolfgang Schaeuble knows very well where he is marching with his "new nationalism." What a difference from the end of the 1960's! At that time, when the NPD [National Democratic Party of Germany] was in the laender parliaments all over the country, Willi Brandt issued the slogan "Daring More Democracy" -- and put an end to the parliamentary existence of the NPD. And today? When was the last time that the Bundestag adopted a law that granted more rights, more freedom, and more democracy to the people? We had to amend the asylum law -- but no one is talking about a new citizenship law anymore. If it is true that the majority of those who vote for the Republikaner vote for Schoenhuber because they have lost trust in the functioning of our party system, our rule-of-law state, and our social market economy, then there is only one way: We must reestablish this functioning -- and not hurrying behind right-wing slogans until there is really nothing left of this democracy.
