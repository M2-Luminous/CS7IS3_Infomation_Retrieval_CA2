Koltsov, candidate for people's deputy of Ukraine for Electoral District 34: "And, As a Result, What?"] [Text] The president of Crimea appeared on Crimean television two days prior to the elections on 27 March 1994, splitting his speech into two parts: an official part and, appended to it, "the position simply of a citizen of Crimea." The official part expressed hostility toward elections in Crimea of people's deputies of Ukraine, and he said plainly in the "unofficial" part that he would not participate in this ballot and would take his ballot paper away with him. This was what 18 percent of the electorate did in Feodosiya, following the president's example. And, as a result, what? These events are quite serious and wide-ranging. It is impossible to step over them without making an attempt to comprehend this. Unfortunately, the president does not see the need for the creation of a "support group" of deputies from Crimea in the Ukrainian parliament. A candidate for deputy of Ukraine from Sevastopol, who had come from the Baltic, points out directly in this connection that the "Russian speakers" also decided there formerly to boycott the parliamentary elections and paid a cruel price for this. A powerful "counterrecoil" on the part of the western oblasts, where 85-90 percent of the population goes to the polls and elects at the first attempt fierce supporters of a strengthening of Ukraine's "independence" who see Crimea's policy only as "separatism that needs to be suppressed," can be seen at the present elections in Ukraine. In this atmosphere in the parliament of Ukraine, does Crimea not need a "first line of defense" in the form of its own deputies, who would oppose the adoption of extreme decisions? The president of Crimea quite recently supported the Kuchma-Grinev bloc uniting antinationalist forces in Southeast Ukraine. The bloc, which assembles judicious social forces in Ukraine, is being countered by Kiev officialdom, which is why a complex situation is taking shape. And under these difficult conditions the president of Crimea in fact changes his former position and does not consider it necessary to form a cohesive group of Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine reinforcing the Kuchma-Grinev bloc. I am inclined to think that in this case the president of Crimea has occupied a mistaken position, and it was not supported at the elections: 80 percent of people voted and did not carry their ballots away with them. The president's mistake can still be rectified at the second stage of the elections of deputies of Ukraine, activists of the Russia bloc being oriented toward support for the candidates for deputy of Ukraine--participants in the Interregional Reform Bloc (IRB)--of the Kuchma-Grinev bloc: It is the authors of the mistaken position who should be rectifying it. Otherwise the situation will get worse. The president of Crimea could, perhaps, need 23 Crimean deputies in the parliament of Ukraine more than as many additional deputies of "his" in the parliament of Crimea: It is simpler for him to sort things out at home. I consider it necessary to point all this out not on account of a desire to "force my way into power": The prospect of participation in the gloomy squabbles of the parliament of Ukraine is not particularly inspiring. But the truth is dearer....
