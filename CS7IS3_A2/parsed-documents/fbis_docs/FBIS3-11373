The initiative is being evaluated by the U.S. trade representative, the influential and incisive Michael Kantor, who less than a week ago had a harsh and unusual conversation with President Carlos Menem. The U.S. official is studying possible sanctions at the request of the powerful U.S. pharmaceutical industry due to the approval of the patents law here. The demand presumably implies (if it succeeds) the setting of quotas, the elimination of preferential import systems, and tariffs for several Argentine manufactured goods that might include textiles, steel products, petrochemicals, and leather products. The U.S. trade representative is precisely studying whether to term Argentina "a priority foreign country." This in fact means the following: The Democratic administration's Commerce Department is beginning its evaluation to immediately apply every type of trade reprisal. The request is contained in a confidential document CLARIN had exclusive access to. In the document, influential U.S. business people ask that Argentina be qualified an "offensive" nation on the question of trade because they believe Argentina is "resisting" the implementation of an adequate policy in the intellectual property field. Adequate, of course, for U.S. industry interests. The two demands are really contradictory. Bilateral trade is frankly negative for Argentina. The deficit amounted to $2.4 billion in 1993. Despite all of this, the U.S. corporation known as the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association [title in English] (PMA), which was created to lobby [preceding word in English] for the powerful multinational laboratories, demands sanctions. These are the words that are used in that secret paper [preceding word in English]: "In sum, we believe that the following four countries are so offensive in their practices, policies, and actions, and that they continue to resist efforts to improve their respective intellectual property measures that they do not merit being named as foreign priority countries: Argentina, Brazil, India, and Turkey." The pharmaceutical industry of the north does not stop there, and it suggests the implementation of Resolution No. 301 with which the United States threatened Japan in the trade war declaration. The letter is only signed by Gerald Mossinghoff, who holds the post of PMA head. It is exactly two pages long. A copy of the document is to be found in the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires. This is not a secret to the government. CLARIN also has been able to detect the presence here of three PMA representatives. They have been here since 15 March. They have contacted top members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. Between today and 17 March they will hold meetings at the Foreign and Economy Ministries. They are three PMA heavyweights -- Warren Wells, vice president for Latin America, and directors Lesly Ackerman and Bruce McPhil. These businessmen also are demanding a total ban against Argentina's access to the common market formed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The document states precisely: "Other Latin American countries have expressed their wish for access to NAFTA. The PMA believes that even before negotiations for this access begins, the U.S. trade representative must be sure that the region's national laws on patents must comply with NAFTA's standards regarding intellectual property." In this case Argentina will remain out of NAFTA. Or, at least it will not figure in the first list of countries that Clinton will make known in May. The PMA groups 30 large multinational enterprises. It invoices $70 billion a year, which is the exact equivalent of one-third of Argentina's GDP. On 11 March, Kantor himself, in a surprise move, told Menem that Argentina must approve a new law on pharmaceutical patents within 45 days. Government House insists that Kantor's attitude and language were a discourtesy toward Menem. And they really do not know what to do. They are willing to negotiate. Argentina wants something conclusive in exchange, but there are doubts whether it will be possible.
