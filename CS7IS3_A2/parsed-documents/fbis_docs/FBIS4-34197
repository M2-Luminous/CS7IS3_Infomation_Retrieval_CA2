He said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape because its policies are very bad." Di Tella confirmed the possibility of a personal meeting between President Carlos Menem and Castro. He added, however, that "conditions are not right" following the harsh speech by Castro yesterday. Di Tella said: "Yesterday, in the boat (that transported the presidents to a luncheon) they were together and they chatted. The same thing may happen again." Di Tella quickly added, however, that a formal meeting is unlikely because conditions are not right. "Castro's position does not encourage anyone to speak seriously," the minister said Di Tella talked with Argentine journalists covering the summit at this city's convention center at noon today. He recognized that the Argentine Government felt "very bad" about Castro's speech at the end of the ceremony yesterday. Foreign Minister Di Tella, who does not hide his deep differences with Castro, said: "To say Cuba is being persecuted and that their entire situation is the consequence of U.S. persecution is like living on the moon." Di Tella said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape because its policies are very bad." The minister added: "The U.S. embargo, which the Cubans call a blockade, prevents them from purchasing from the United States, but not from Canada, Mexico, or Europe." Regarding the situation on the island Di Tella said: "Their economy is a mess because of their policy that the state directs, contracts, and rations everything." Di Tella stressed: "Cuba needs a qualitative change toward democracy and a change toward a market economy -- which started to appear but too timidly -- because the situation is on fire." He said: "There is no point in talking about Cuba's entry into the Inter-American system until these changes take place. We expect Cuba to join the system later. I hope Castro will introduce those changes; if not, I think the situation will end dramatically." The foreign minister said: "We do not want Cuba to be reincorporated into the OAS before it accepts democracy," because the organization "is a democratic club." Di Tella thus answered criticism by Castro against his counterparts on 7 June for not pronouncing "a single word against the United States' criminal blockade" and for not reiterating the demand to democratize the island. [sentence as received] "We respect your opinion and you should respect our opinion," said Castro during an impromptu speech last night when answering the insistent call of various presidents, among them the Argentine president, to introduce democracy in Cuba.
