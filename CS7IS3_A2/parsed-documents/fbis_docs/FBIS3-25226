The government did not give any details about the nature of the violence. Interior Minister Combevi Agbodjan said on national television that "in certain cities and villages," of the Haho Prefecture (98 km north of Lome), CAR militants have "accused" President Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters of not having voted for their candidate. Questioned by AFP, CAR deputy general secretary, Mr. Togoatta Apedoh Amah, denounced this "provocative act" by the RPT which is trying to justify a repression against the activists of the opposition before the second round of the legislative election slated for 20 February. At the end of the first round on 6 February, the opposition, represented in the second round by CAR and the Togolese Union for Democracy, was running neck and neck with the RPT, the former sole ruling party. The minister also called on traditional rulers "who are making every effort to create a climate of hatred in their villages" to remain neutral while awaiting the second round of elections. He also called on political party leaders to "better control their activists" so that the second round of election would take place "in as good an atmosphere" as the first round.
