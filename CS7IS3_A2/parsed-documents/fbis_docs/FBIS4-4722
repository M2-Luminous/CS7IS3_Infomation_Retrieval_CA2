FBIS4-4722 "dreas065_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 South Korea Officials Criticized for DPRK Issue Confusion Officials Criticized for DPRK Issue Confusion SK0504070494 Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean 5 Apr 94 p 5 SK0504070494 Seoul TONG-A ILBO Korean BFN [From the "Reporter's Eye" column, by Pak Kyong-kyun] [Text] Even if the confusion were created on purpose, it is difficult to imagine any more confusion resulting from the series of extremely inconsistent remarks made recently by high-ranking government officials over the North Korean nuclear issue. In a news conference on 29 March for reporters from home and abroad during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in China, Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae made remarks which amounted to saying that "the United States cannot apply sanctions against North Korea without China's cooperation," which were contrary to the atmosphere the government was trying to induce of China joining sanctions against North Korea. This was followed with Ambassador Hwang's flurry to withdraw his remarks. Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide for foreign affairs and security, also tried to mitigate the public stir caused by Hwang's remark by saying that "Ambassador Hwang's remarks were a mistake," but that came only after we had lost face on an international scale. Even before the swell of Ambassador Hwang's remark had been quelled, another bout of confusion took place domestically on the evening of 3 April. Attending the discussion session between ruling party and opposition lawmakers at the Academy House in Suyuri, Seoul, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong revealed that the government may consider amending its policy on realizing a South-North envoy exchange prior to North Korea-U.S. talks. On the morning of 4 April, however, Chong Chong-uk said that "Vice Minister Hong's remarks reflect his personal opinion only" and strongly denied the remarks by saying that "It is absolutely false." During a monthly morning meeting, Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, also expressed extreme displeasure by saying: "It is true that people who lack experience have made some verbal mistakes." Even Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting Japan, stressed: "There is no change in the government policy that the envoy exchange should be realized before the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks." Within the space of one day, the minister and vice minister of one ministry were saying almost the exact opposite thing. In February, Minister Han also experienced having to withdraw his remark that "he would consider a flexible method for deciding on a date and form for an envoy exchange" because of strong opposition from the other offices involved, such as Chongwadae [presidential office], the National Unification Board, and the Agency for National Security Planning. Even with the issuance of a statement by the UN Security Council president, our policy on North Korea remains in disorder with inconsistent remarks being made by government officials irrespective of rank. Not to speak of public criticism, one worries about how our negotiation partner, North Korea, must view this panorama of confusing developments in our policy on the North Korean issue.
