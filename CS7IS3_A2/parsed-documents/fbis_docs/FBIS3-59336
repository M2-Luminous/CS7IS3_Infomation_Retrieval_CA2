Zhu Rongji recalled all loans that did not conform to regulations within a definite time limit. Actually credit that conforms to regulations also is out of control. Bank loans cannot be decided by banks. They must be in accordance with the mayor's directives. All new projects have "gravy" added. No one is responsible for repayment. The first of the three "draconian" measures that Zhu Rongji devised when he appeared on the scene to rectify the economy was to require all local banks to recall all loans that did not conform to regulations before 31 August. It is estimated that this involved 160 billion yuan. By the beginning of September, Zhu Rongji had extended the date for the recall of the loans to the end of this year, because only 20 percent of the loans that should have been recalled actually were recalled in August. How has 100 billion or 200 billion been loaned out? In addition to the loans that do not conform to regulations, there are the regulation bank loans. Why has bank credit gone out of control in the past year or so? There are a few specific facts here from which we can view the credit investment situation. People On All Sides Contending for a Sum of Money Since last spring and summer, localities have been contending one after the other to take on projects and economic development regions. Those who are equipped come forth as well as those who are not equipped. The banks faced with so many "hungry monks" and "so little gruel," are often in an awkward situation. Sometimes they have no choice. They can only treat everyone alike. This situation has occurred in a certain region. Three large enterprises urgently needed a large loan to replace equipment. When they suddenly heard that the bank had a sum of money, the three almost simultaneously crowded in to contend for the loan and none would relent. Finally, the bank had no choice but to give in to the quarreling and divide it equally "one bowl of gruel to a person." Logically, whom to give loans to and whom not to give them to should be decided by the banks themselves after a detailed proof of the use to which the borrowing unit would put the loan. But this is actually very hard to do. In one area this type of incident occurred. The bank decided to give a loan to a rather efficient baby food factory, but the mayor decided to give the loan to a refrigerator factory with rather serious losses, because it was a key enterprise in the city. Ultimately, the bank could only shift the abacus beads to the refrigerator factory. A township enterprise in a certain locality, because its products were of high quality and had a good reputation and it strongly broke into the international market, earned $2.55 million in foreign exchange annually. But because the factory's current equipment was limited, it urgently needed a sum of money to replace its equipment. If its equipment were replaced, it could more than triple its production capability and it could earn at least $7.1 million in foreign exchange. But just because it was a "township enterprise," it ran all over and still could not borrow the money. Much Gravy in the Budget, Black Holes Know How Much The money is the state's and everyone spends the money. So, in the investment budget of almost every new project there is quite a bit of "gravy." Increasing the "gravy" in new projects has become a "legal" method for a great many units and regional leaders to seek state funds. "Am I not doing the unit (or region) good? In any case, I am not filling my own pockets." City A is constructing a large luxury hotel and needs a new type of decorative material. The unit in charge of construction budgeted for 8,486 meters, but after repeated detailed calculation by technical engineers of the department concerned, it was determined that they could get by on 842 meters. The reason was quite simple. After the fact, the leaders concerned laughed and said, "We intended to do a little something else with that bit of money." A certain county was constructing a key middle school and budgeted several 10,000 yuan. But with careful accounting by the department in charge, no matter how many times they figured it, it was nearly 40,000 yuan. When that county's education office was asked, the head of the office boldly and self-assuredly said, "So, that was money to invite guests, send gifts, make connections, and do public relations!" Consider that this cost also must be borne by the state. The state's money is constantly sliding down innumerable "black holes" in this way. Stop and Start Projects and Stop and Start Development Zones The so-called stop and start projects stop and start construction. Stop and start projects also can be said to be a characteristic of China. Stated a little more clearly, it is the product of the cleverness of local leaders or unit leaders in contending with the banks. A few years ago, quite a few of these stop and start projects were stopped. By last spring and summer, the stop and start projects were finally "successfully completed." But new stop and start projects also appeared. According to statistics from March of this year, in 1992 there were a total of 88,531 new capital construction starts by state units throughout the country, a 19 percent increase over 1991. The average planned total investment for each project is 3.38 million, a 45.7 percent increase over the previous year. Because the excessively fast growth of these new starts spurred the rapid growth in the need for investment, it caused the prices of related capital goods to continue to go up. Some exceeded market demands, but "they could prohibit them, but it was hard to stop them." Actually, "stop and start projects" are nothing compared with the "stop and start development zones." Since last year's wave of layer after layer of development zone started, it has seriously impacted on current economic development. The greatest problem with the development zone craze is, whether they are prepared or not, everybody comes forward. The provinces come forward, the localities and cities come forward, the counties come forward, and even the townships come forward, to the point that whether or not they can "be developed," that many cannot be attended to. Presently, there are more than 6,000 of various types of development zones throughout the country. A 300 million yuan investment is required to do the "seven connections and one leveling" on one square kilometer. Of this 300 million yuan, the state normally invests 100 million and for the remaining 200 million they must go to the bank themselves for a loan or raise the money themselves. (Actually, it is still the state's money.) Not to have 450 billion for 15,000 square kilometers of development zones throughout the country is unacceptable. But where does the state go to find so much money?! The total of more than 700 billion annual national capital construction investment is all used to make development zones, and it is done for six years. In these six years, it cannot be used for anything. If I Cannot Pay Back, What Can They Do To Me? "One must pay back the money that he borrows." This is justice. But today in the mainland debtors are extremely relaxed. The wife and children live in the house and use the car, the electricity, and the telephone; eat, drink, and sleep, and it has no affect---after all, it is all the state's money. A certain steel enterprise group to put up a new steel rolling plant borrowed 30 million yuan from the bank. Because of a policy error, they did not roll a single piece of steel. When they had to pay back, they did not have a single cent. What could they do? In any case you cannot make a deduction every month from the factory head's 400 yuan salary. Ultimately, there was no way. They could only transfer the factory head to a municipal economic committee as vice chairman to act as an official in another place. As to that 30 million yuan, who knows. . . . . . A certain township even exceeds this joke. The township borrowed 2 million to construct a silkworm station and a base to raise silkworms. For various reasons, the situation failed. When the loan expired and the bank came to press for repayment, the township head concerned could not be found. That afternoon a call came from the county procurator saying that the township head, carrying a bed roll, had come to "report." He claimed that if they wanted money, he did not have it and would have to give up his life. What could be done? After all you could not shoot him. That evening, the township head was let go by the county magistrate. Specific debtors are this way. So, what about the officials who gave the approval at that time? Now it is even more difficult to find them. Why? Because they have changed office. The mayor of a certain city approved this type of loan. But over a year later, this mayor had gone to be a vice chairman in the People's Congress. There is a saying, if he is not at his post, he does not run the government. If I am not now in charge, go find the new mayor. Whenever this time comes, it is the person in charge at the bank that has the greatest headache. When he first loaned the money the person who borrowed it bowed and scraped and wanted to call him "grandpa." Now when it is time to pay back, he becomes the "grandpa." No matter how much you run around and press him, in any case he does not have it. The person in charge at the bank jokes that he is "the grandpa turned grandson."
