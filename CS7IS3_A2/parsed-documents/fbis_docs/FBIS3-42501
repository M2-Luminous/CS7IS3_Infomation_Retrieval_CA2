It has been announced that defense expenditures will be increased, despite the runaway budget deficit. Latvian military men are happy: So far the organizational development of the Armed Forces has been sputtering for strictly financial reasons. To be sure, helpers have come along. Germany sent the uniforms of the former GDR Army, a little bit of materiel, and naval cutters. This country is paying a great deal attention to the Latvian Army. The German military attache has handed a present to Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis--two sets of high-grade video and audio equipment which are used in the conduct of military inspections. Experts from Paris have visited in order to learn what assistance France could provide. Riga requested assistance on the issues of communication, transportation, military medicine, the Navy, and other spheres. Military instructors who have trained Latvian "Zemessardze" ("militiamen") have come from Great Britain. The Minister of Defense of Belgium has offered army materiel, weapons, and other resources released as a result of reductions in the Armed Forces of Belgium. Finally, the Swedes and the Danes have provided continuous assistance: this includes consultations, materiel, and monetary subsidies. The Americans are sympathetic: a military delegation has just visited Latvia. In the words of Latvian Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis, a report has been submitted to the National Defense Council analyzing where a military threat to Latvia may originate. The content of the report is not yet known. Meanwhile, newspapers have been writing about Russia in a harsh tone, shaping their own concept of a possible threat and potential enemy. According to the Constitution, President Guntis Ulmanis, Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces of Latvia, also heads the National Security Council. But, of course, the Ministry of Defense plays first fiddle. Latvian military commanders in the upper echelon combine the experience of "green berets" and participation in the war in Afghanistan; at issue are both the Minister of Defense and the Commander of the Defense Forces. Current Minister of Defense Valdis Pavlovskis (who turns 60 this year) is a civilian. However, he has decent combat experience: He reached the rank of Captain in the U.S. Marines. He commanded a "green beret" unit in Vietnam. As he told journalists, he "taught guerrilla tactics" at an officer academy in the United States. Valdis Pavlovskis speaks Latvian with a slight accent: He was born in Riga, but spent his entire life in emigration. Pavlovskis was active in organizations coming out against the occupation of Latvia by Soviet troops. He returned to the Republic during the national rennaissance period and soon took the position of deputy of Talavs Jundzis, the first Minister of Defense of independent Latvia. Jundzis, one of the activists of the People's Front, now heads the Baltic Center for Strategic Research. Valdis Pavlovskis was elected a Deputy in elections to the Saeima [parliament] this summer on the ticket of the governing party The Latvian Way. In an interview Pavlovskis complained that Balts abroad have had to make a great effort to explain to the world why the governments of Baltic countries did not even try to offer resistance to the Red Army in 1940. In the words of the Minister of Defense, if something similar recurs, we need to show to the world: we are capable of fighting for our freedom. Commander of the Defense Forces Dainis Turlais voiced a similar point of view during a conference: "Our main task is to protect the country against an aggressor at least for a few days so that the public of the world and its organizations will be able to respond to the conflict." The order discharging Colonel Dainis Turlais from the Soviet Army was signed by Marshal Shaposhnikov. Turlais, the former Chief of the Operations Section of the 40th Army (he fought in Afghanistan for three years), gave up a promising career in Russia, discontinued studies at the General Staff Academy, and returned to Latvia to build its armed forces. Dainis Turlais is 43; he is energetic. The new, old-style Latvian uniform fits him like a glove. In Turlais's opinion, the Defense Forces of Latvia should consist of 10,000 people. Attention should be focused on border guard formations. Rifle battalions within the country should assist them if necessary. However, the security concept and the defense plan which is now being developed will still change because literally the last few weeks have compelled many changes in the concepts of the Latvian military, who are inspired by the support of NATO specialists. For now, Latvian military cadres are being trained mainly within the Republic. The Academy of National Defense of Latvia is housed on the premises of the School imeni Biryuzov, one of the best in the former Union. The academy is headed by Valdis Matiss, likewise a former colonel of the Soviet Army: He headed a department at the Frunze Academy. The current military attache of Latvia in Russia, Gunars Alksnis, headed a Department of instruction at the same academy. Tactical intelligence is his specialty. Latvian officers are also invited to study abroad, but poor knowledge of foreign languages is an obstacle. Incidentally, the language problem also surfaced during joint exercises of the defense forces of the three Baltic states: In what language are commands to be given so that everybody would understand--not in the Russian language of occupation, really? The Minister of Defense of Latvia ordered that the system of commands and organization of communications adopted in NATO be mastered this year. Only citizens of Latvia are drafted for service in its armed forces. However, some are not in a hurry to do their patriotic duty. They evade the daily round of the army and desert their units. Drinking and dedovshchina are flourishing. They have already become the reason for fatal accidents. Here, two border guards shot each other; there, a young guardian of the border, after firing at his comrade, went further away from the post and shot himself. The taunting of new recruits in a convoy regiment ended in tragedy: young soldiers driven to despair by outrages in the unit decided to flee. Three Latvian boys tried to cross the border in order to hide out in Russia, but the Latvian border guards apprehended them. Some junior commanders were relieved from their positions following an inquiry. Incidents in the Defense Forces are dwarfed by the "glory" of the dashing "Zemessardze": loss of weapons, murders, drunken disorderliness. The "Zemessardze" are a peculiar structure. "Patriots make up the militia"--this is how Girts Kristovskis, recently Militia Chief of Staff (currently Minister of Internal Affairs) characterized his comrades. Activists of the People's Front and more radical organizations of that time became "Zemessardze." The trouble is that patriotism is no substitute for training and discipline. For a long time members of the militia in spotted camouflage smacked of "Makhno's guys" possessed by the national-patriotic idea. To be sure, attempts have been recently made to give them a more or less civilized appearance. At any rate, there are fewer scandals associated with these people, who are armed and very dangerous. Evaluating the year 1993 in an interview to the newspaper DIENA, the Minister of Defense observed: "The relationship between the Defense Forces and the militia has improved perceptibly. It is now much easier to find a common language to achieve common objectives." Latvia was the first among the republics of the former Union to introduce alternative service, but soon gave it up. It was ineffective, and control was lacking. Labor service was introduced, but it is virtually defunct, too. There is unemployment in the state, and those who draw benefits for months do not have enough slots to use their energies. The Ministry of Defense has developed new rules for induction into the military service: It is envisioned reducing the number of categories of individuals ineligible for the draft. However, the plan is to reduce the duration of service to one year, with the exception of those who will have to master advanced materiel. How many soldiers are there in the Latvian Army? According to data from the newspaper NEATKARIGA CINA, at present the Defense Forces have 1,500 soldiers and 150 officers. Six hundred soldiers and 30 officers serve in the naval forces. At the border, 338,000 [as published] soldiers and 340 officers are in the service. The Navy consists of 15 vessels (nine are at full readiness). The Air Force has two An-2 planes and two L-410's (one is in operation). There are six helicopters. The Latvian Army has to date been using mainly former Soviet weapons. A batch of Czech assault rifles has been purchased. Head of the Cabinet of Ministers Valdis Birkavs stated that Latvia, like Estonia, intends to buy weapons from Israel. Since the beginning of the year the armed forces of the three Baltic states have noticeably stepped up coordination of their actions. Preparations are underway for joint exercises of rifle companies; in February they will be held in Estonia, in July--in Lithuania, and in October--in Latvia. As Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission Aleksandrs Kirsteins said, pooling their efforts will make it possible for the Baltic states to create a powerful echelon of defense against a potential aggressor.
