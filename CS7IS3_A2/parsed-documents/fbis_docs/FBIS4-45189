The procedures are the same: corruption of police and public servants, terrorism against those fighting it, and social donations to obtain accomplices in the society. During the final phase of consolidating its power, there is the assassination of judges. The drug traffic has set up its activities in the border towns, the final stopping places leading toward drug consumption in the United States. The unequivocal phase in Tijuana is that of the struggle between two rings to seize exclusive control over the traffic. To establish their supremacy, the phase includes corruption of judicial authorities. Tijuana, currently governed by the PAN [National Action Party], as it was in the past by the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party], is the obvious territory for entrenching the drug traffic's power, because of the land and sea routes to the United States. This situation is the one associated by the attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades, with the general features of the crimes preceding the one now attracting the public's attention. That precedent, with its tragic continuity, is explained by the goals sought by the two rings fighting for Tijuana. Initially, during the 1970's, Felix Gallardo, now imprisoned at Almoloya, Mexico State, was the leader of those now comprising rival groups: Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero Palma"; Joaquin Guzman Loera, "El Chapo Guzman," also imprisoned; and the Arellano Felix brothers, who are fugitives. The ring moved from Sinaloa to Guadalajara, where its members operated as a cartel, unquestionably associated with the group in Cali, Colombia. The scope of its operations has included the states of Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sonora, and Baja California. Insofar as organized crime is concerned, it is a vast domain. This is the cause of the violence for gaining power, with the principal chiefs imprisoned. [passage omitted] The latest incidents have been the confrontation in Tijuana on 3 March of this year, and the murder of Federico Benitez Lopez, public safety director, who went to the airport based on an anonymous tip concerning an alleged bomb on that site. The last two episodes are identical from the standpoint of the criminals' deployment and their brutality toward their victims. It is a war to the death for criminal power in Tijuana, with the complicity of police and state authorities, as one infers from the incidents on 3 March, particularly, and on 28 April. What occurred in March is public knowledge: Commander Alejandro Castaneda Andrade and six agents under his orders were riding in two PGR [Attorney General's Office] vans toward a residence in which it was suspected, with reason, that a meeting was being held by the Arellano Felix ring, when several vehicles drove by in tandem. Andrade and agent Arturo Morales caught up with the last one, ordering the driver to stop. The response came with shots fired at them pointblank. Andrade was killed, and Morales seriously wounded. Shots were fired from the van following Andrade, and the agents managed to overcome four survivors. Three died, and another, wounded, was taken to the IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] hospital. Within minutes, State Judicial Police agents and Tijuana municipal police whose help was requested by the federal forces arrived on the scene of the attack. The state [deputy] attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara (whose detention has evoked protests from Governor Ruffo Appel and from the PAN national leader, Carlos Castillo Peraza), was accompanied by the agent from the State Public Prosecutor's Office, Carlos Guerrero Zermeno, and other police agents. Playing their last card against the federal police, the latter took with them Ortiz Lara, and one of the four in custody, later identified as Ismael Higuera Guerrero, aka "El Mayel," from the Arellano Felix ring. At that point, two persons emerged from another van, firing at the federal agents, one of whom was seriously wounded. All those who were in custody disappeared. Jesus Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police member, was captured later. Remanded for these acts were the deputy attorney general, Ortiz Lara; the State Public Prosecutor's Office agent, Guerrero Zermeno; five State Judicial Police group chiefs; and a commander from the Public Safety Directorate. The remand was based on "probable guilt of the commission of four crimes, and others that may result from the investigations." It is known that, when Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara was summoned regarding the incident, he displayed an amparo, which explains why the subsequent order for his capture, executed on Wednesday of this week, came from the Second Unified Court of the 15th Circuit in Tijuana. The criminal under arrest, apparently protected by Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara, escaped from that town. These facts, part of a criminal process, do not authorize anyone, much less the governor of Baja California Norte, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, to describe as irresponsible the historical comment made by the attorney general of the republic concerning the drug traffic in Tijuana. Those records explain that there is a criminal organization here, with networks in other countries; and that, consequently, from Sicily to Colombia, Honduras, or Bolivia, their procedures are the same: subjugating the police and judicial authorities with bribes or terrorism, to create the legal vacuum and to have their crimes left unpunished. [passage omitted] One cannot infer from Diego Valades' statement any political intention other than strict application of the law, based on demonstrable facts. If the Second Unified Court of the 15th District issued the order for the deputy attorney general's detention, the arguments for ordering it must have been irrefutable, according to law. Hence, it is inexplicable that Ruffo Appel, in his complaint, omits this fact that, in itself, refutes the political interpretation. It is a legal procedure for preserving peace and the rule of law in Tijuana. The governor's verbal attacks unfortunately coincide with Carlos Castillo Peraza's correct statement, claiming: "It is of little use to build and consolidate the necessary governability (the action of Attorney General Diego Valades), when confronted with the challenges that such events pose for all Mexicans." The best service that could be given to the Tijuana cartel would be to dispute a legal act with senseless political interpretations. No one, even if he should propose it in an agitated state, could take the PAN to task publicly for incidents in which it obviously is not an accomplice, such as the governor defending the deputy attorney general, not as a public servant but rather as a fellow party member. If the deputy attorney general is innocent of the charges brought by the Attorney General's Office, why does the governor consider the others captured (the agent from the State Public Prosecutor's Office, Guerrero Zermeno, who accompanied the deputy attorney general at all times, five State Judicial Police group chiefs, and a Public Safety Directorate commander) to be blameworthy? He did not even mention them in his protest. This case in Tijuana is not a minor one, because it reveals the confusion besetting the country. Legal proceedings are being disrupted to prevent an understanding of the real situation. Therefore, the action of the Attorney General's Office is seen as a political maneuver to discredit the PAN; whereas the facts prove that the undeferable intention is to fight, in Tijuana and throughout the country, against the legal vacuum that would heighten the drug traffickers' power. The dilemma is between the law and coexistence with organized crime.
