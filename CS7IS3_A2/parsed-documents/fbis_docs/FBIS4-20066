In an interview broadcast by TV3 yesterday evening, the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president gave his assurance that CiU [Convergence and Union] will continue to support the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in Spain's governability, provided that the government fulfills two conditions: Continue with the current economic policy and "convincingly nip in the bud" all the corruption cases. According to Pujol, who came out in favor of avoiding actions that could lead to dissolving the Cortes and bringing forward elections, "because we have never behaved opportunistically," the government's activity to this effect should follow two paths: the judicial path, which, in his opinion, could be the most effective, and that of a parliamentary committee of enquiry. Both at the end of a meeting with the CiU deputies in the Congress of Deputies held in Arenys de Mar to prepare for the general policy debate that begins next Tuesday [19 April], and in the television interview, the Generalitat president asserted that it is the government itself that must resolve the corruption cases, although he specified that his group will support the Felipe Gonzalez cabinet's initiatives aimed at clarifying the scandals at issue and maintained that "it is the Socialists and the prime minister who must take the decision to clean up their house," because "we cannot clean up other people's houses." The meeting between the prime minister and the Generalitat president -- a private dinner arranged by the two men by telephone a few days earlier -- was described by official circles at the Generalitat president's office as "just another meeting -- because it is normal that in this legislative term they should see each other more often than they used to, in view of the greater cooperation that exists -- at which matters connected with the negotiation on the impetus for autonomy and the change of economic policy were reviewed," and at which it is not denied that the corruption cases were also discussed. Nevertheless, the same sources specify that the meeting -- at which, according to Pujol, economic matters took priority -- took place in a "very good" atmosphere, and "was not prompted by the Rubio case." However, CiU sectors close to the Generalitat president believe the meeting "is of a somewhat special nature" -- especially since it is only two months since the last official meeting, 10 February, also at the Moncloa Palace -- prompted by the political situation in which Spain currently finds itself. The analysis that Jordi Pujol has made privately over the past few days with those closest to him is that although CiU is prepared to support a stable government, as the cabinet headed by Felipe Gonzalez has thus far been since the last election, it is not prepared to do so with a government weakened by the latest corruption scandals. Within this framework, the Generalitat president believes that for stability to remain guaranteed in Spain, the prime minister must tackle the situation resolutely, internally and externally, and act firmly in order to restore confidence in the government and its credibility. "To the Bitter End" In fact, the approach is one that Pujol reportedly explained personally to Gonzalez, who, for his part, reportedly wished to learn from his interlocutor what stance CiU intends to maintain at an especially delicate moment with respect to the support it gives the government. During his television appearance, Jordi Pujol appeared hopeful that the government will adopt urgent measures and will know how to react "against this cancer that must be thoroughly and rapidly eradicated," since Felipe Gonzalez assured him that he intends to go "to the bitter end" in clarifying all the matters reported. This led him to maintain that "we can avoid the Italian phenomenon," because "we are not too late." The Generalitat president denied -- following the lunch with CiU deputies in Madrid, Antonia de la Fuente reports -- that the prime minister asked him for any kind of special support, and asserted that he does not believe that CiU could pay dearly for supporting the PSOE in the current circumstances, since "we are supporting not the government but an economic policy that we believe is the one needed in order to emerge from the crisis." Pujol added that he deems it very unlikely that a censure motion against Gonzalez could be submitted, because this "should be constructive, and the current situation is not sufficient for that," and, in any event, he concluded that "if anyone wants to submit a motion of censure or no confidence, he will, and we will see."
