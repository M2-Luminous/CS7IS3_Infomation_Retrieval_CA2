ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On August 6, 1992, USEPA received maintenance plans and a request from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) for redesignation of Coshocton, Gallia, Morgan, and Washington Counties from nonattainment to attainment for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). USEPA is proposing to approve the maintenance plans and redesignation request for Morgan and Washington Counties and deferring action with respect to the submittal for Coshocton and Gallia Counties. DATES: Comments on the request and the proposed USEPA action must be received by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: William MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the materials submitted by the State and the February 9, 1994, technical support document are available at the following addresses for review: (It is recommended that you telephone John Summerhays at (312) 886&hyph;6067, before visiting the Region 5 office.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (AE&hyph;17J), Region 5, Air Enforcement Branch, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Summerhays, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590, (312) 886&hyph;6067 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Under section 107(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, USEPA promulgated designations of whether each area in the country was attaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). (See Federal Register of March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962), and October 5, 1978 (43 FR 45993).) Included among these designations were nonattainment designations for SO 2 for Coshocton, Gallia, Morgan, and Washington Counties in Ohio. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 provided for both continuation of preexisting SO 2 designations and new criteria and procedures for redesignations. These criteria are discussed in the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' published at 57 FR 13498 on April 16, 1992, and in a USEPA memorandum from John Seitz to the Regional Air Division Directors entitled ``Redesignation and Maintenance Plan Requirements for Nonattainment Areas,'' dated September 4, 1992. On August 6, 1992, USEPA received a submittal from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) requesting redesignation of Coshocton, Gallia, Morgan, and Washington Counties from nonattainment to attainment for SO 2 . This submittal also included air quality data summaries and daily coal sampling data for the four major power plants in the four counties. A subsequent submittal dated July 30, 1993, provided stack test data for one of these facilities and indicated that stack test data for the other facilities would be sent shortly. II. Review of State Submittal Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the amended Act provides that redesignations of areas from nonattainment to attainment can be approved only if five criteria are met: (i) USEPA determines that the area has attained the NAAQS; (ii) USEPA has fully approved the relevant implementation plan; (iii) USEPA determines that the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions resulting from implementation of the applicable implementation plan and applicable Federal air pollutant control regulations and other permanent and enforceable reductions; (iv) USEPA has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of Section 175A; and (v) the State containing such area has met all requirements applicable to the area under Section 110 and part D. These criteria and the extent to which these criteria are satisfied are discussed individually in the following subsections.
