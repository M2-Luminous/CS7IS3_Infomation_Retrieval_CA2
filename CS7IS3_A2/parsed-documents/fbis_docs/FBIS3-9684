After Milan Knazko and Jozef Moravcik, the post of the head of Slovak diplomacy has been assumed by Eduard Kukan. He is a man with 30 years of diplomatic experience. He worked at several diplomatic missions abroad, most recently as Slovak ambassador to the United Nations. SMENA asked Kukan for an interview in connection with his appointment. [Gandel] Minister, what are the priority issues for Slovak foreign policy? [Kukan] The highest priority in Slovak foreign policy continues to be integration into Europe, the gradual incorporation and assimilation into European political, economic, and security structures. That is the main task on which we must concentrate. At this time, another priority is the reinforcement of good relations with neighboring countries. It is the duty of every state to maintain good relations with all countries and with its neighbors, in particular. We do not choose them; they are here. If neighbors are interested in living in a good relationship and peace, they should both be interested in maintaining the quality of relations. I see yet another priority in the need to help the economic development of Slovakia. A functioning economy is the main task of our new society, and, in this respect, our foreign service should help solve the economic questions. An orientation is also necessary toward the image of Slovakia that--I do not wish to go into details--is not always the best. The reasons for this situation are rather complex, and our foreign policy wants to be more active in the direction of making this image--I do not want to say favorable, but perhaps objective, so that they do not beat us for what is not our fault. This roughly sums up my priorities. [Gandel] How do you intend to implement them? [Kukan] Regarding integration into Europe, we cannot wait. It is a truly urgent issue. We signed the association agreement with the European Union and want it to be ratified by all of the Twelve before the end of the year. I say Twelve because, if we do not manage to get it done before the end of the year, there might be not 12 but 16 of them, and it would take that much longer. Hence, we are interested in seeing this agreement go into effect. In this context, I would like to bring up the issue of the stability pact in Europe. This is a very topical issue, and I am convinced that the development will show the need for Slovakia to pay great attention to this issue. Regarding relations with neighbors, I would like to emphasize that Slovakia is interested in the development of good relations with Hungary. We want to create an atmosphere that would be propitious for a dialogue--that is, a discourse between the two partners. Both partners must be willing to conduct it. It must be emphasized that it should be relaxed, composed, and free of emotions so that we can discuss how to solve the problems. I am convinced that such an atmosphere will eventually lead to results. The same applies to the relations with the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, and Ukraine. As far as the economic profile of our foreign policy goes, the question of the efficiency of cooperation with the Slovak Economics Ministry will have to be solved. At our embassies abroad, we also have employees of the Economics Ministry whose work is not always sufficiently specified. We will endeavor finally to find a conceptual solution to these questions so that their activity is oriented toward specific tasks that would help the Slovak economy. [Gandel] You spoke about our relations, and, in this context, I would like to ask something. Your Budapest counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, said on Hungarian Radio on its Sunday [20 September] program that the statements made by new Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik are encouraging, and he expressed the opinion that a historic Slovak-Hungarian settlement could now take place. How do you understand his pronouncement? [Kukan] That is such a vocal, eloquent expression--a Slovak-Hungarian settlement. In my perception, it is more on the pragmatic level. I have no idea what Mr. Jeszenszky meant by Slovak-Hungarian settlement, but apparently it was the return of Slovak-Hungarian relations to a constructive plane without the extreme politicizing of some issues. I see it rather more realistically. Our new government is interested in dealing with and solving specific problems in relations with our neighbors. I would prefer a path of gradual steps, from simple to more complex ones, because I believe that some problems could be solved quickly without any real difficulties. That could bring us to further, more substantial issues. I repeat, this requires willingness and an accommodating attitude from both partners. [Gandel] Which country do you believe you should visit first and why? [Kukan] You know, I inherited the foreign affairs sector, and certain trips and foreign political activities have already been arranged. It is in the interest of my credibility that I comply with these obligations of the Slovak Republic. The first trip should be to Poland on 8 April. It is a previously arranged affair. I should meet my Polish counterpart there. I am not certain, however, whether developments will bring something else before then. So, to your question why, I reply that it was discussed and agreed upon earlier. I believe we have really good preconditions for maintaining good cooperation with Poland. No doubt, goodwill is not lacking on either side. [Gandel] During the government of Vladimir Meciar, criticism was heard that Slovakia is too East-oriented. Which direction would you like to emphasize? [Kukan] I believe that this issue is blown up abroad in the West European and U.S. media. The orientation of Slovakia is quite clear. As I mentioned earlier, we are interested in integration into the European security, political, and economic structures. That speaks for itself. Of course, we are interested in developing our relations with Ukraine and other partners in the East. It is normal and natural. I believe that we can very well "score points" economically there. When I said that these issues are sometimes blown out of proportion, I could give an example from my experience in New York, where our contacts with Russia and Ukraine were used as follows--ah, just look, Slovakia wants to return to the old times, etc. In this respect, the actual situation must be explained. In my opinion, any thinking person must understand that it is advantageous to have a neighbor in the East who offers good conditions for the export of our goods and represents a large market on which we can establish ourselves. No additional speculation is needed. It is completely unnecessary.... Our orientation is obvious--toward Europe, toward the European Union, and, at the same time, using the opportunities offered by cooperation with other countries as well. [Gandel] Which of the problems of the Slovak Republic were most obvious to your partners in the United Nations? [Kukan] They were the things that were also most discussed at home: the problems of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, its status, what the Slovak Government is doing to solve this issue in accordance with international norms. These were the questions that most often popped up in conversation. There was also freedom of the press--that was observed very carefully. I will also give you an example, however, of how the U.S. media treated the case of Trnava University, particularly the beginning of the affair. The U.S. reader has never learned that the problem has been solved. Therefore, we have argued and contended that the U.S. media, which claim to be objective and fair, should always bring their work to the end. Our colleagues have also carefully followed the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros issue, in which they are well versed. These were the three main areas that were most discussed. [Gandel] Among the most burning problems of Slovak diplomacy are certainly the vacant ambassadorial posts. Your predecessor, current Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, once said that they would be filled by the end of March of this year. Several weeks ago, State Secretary Jan Lisuch spoke about the end of June. A consensus of three entities is needed for the approval of ambassadorial appointments--the Foreign Ministry, the government, and the president. In this context, when leaving the post of the head of diplomacy, Jozef Moravcik declared that it was a long way from the ministry to the presidency. Now the situation should be better in this respect. When do you believe it realistically possible for the ambassadorial posts to be finally filled? [Kukan] Personally, I believe that the filling of the ambassadorial posts is a very important issue. The absence of ambassador to Washington for 14 months--that was not good, to say the least, and I am not going to go into details. Every country perceives its partner through the prism of whether there is an accredited ambassador in that country. On the basis of whether there is an ambassador, they judge the amount of interest in mutual cooperation. You mentioned some dates. I would prefer not to speak in a definite time frame. I know that my predecessor and the state secretary share with me the opinion that the ambassadorial posts must be filled. For practical reasons, however, a precise date cannot be set. You actually said that the authorization of appointments takes a while. I assume that it will be faster now and that it will be settled. Nevertheless, you know that we ask the country to which we are sending the ambassador for agreement. This sometimes takes three or four weeks, sometimes even longer. Therefore, I believe that it would not be proper to speak about specific dates. I can confirm, however, that I have spoken about it with Prime Minister Moravcik, who agrees that these questions must be solved immediately, regardless of the six-month term of office of the new government. We do not want to solve it at any cost. We want the ambassadors to be people who will represent Slovakia well. [Gandel] In this context, I would ask: Would you let us know the name of your successor in New York? [Kukan] I do not know. For the time being, my deputy, Peter Tomka, who has the rank of ambassador, has taken over the position. It is not a permanent solution because he is the Slovak Government's commissioner for the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros case at the International Court in The Hague. I left New York in a hurry, so I have not yet thought about who will get the post of ambassador to the United Nations. It is desirable, however, that he be there in September, when the General Assembly starts. [Gandel] It is known that Eva Mitrova is to become Slovak ambassador to Budapest. To date, she has worked as ambassador to the Council of Europe. Do you believe it is appropriate for an ambassador to leave the post where he or she worked only briefly, just long enough to establish contacts, and transfer to a new place to start again practically from scratch, and may I also ask who is to replace Mrs. Mitrova in Strasbourg? [Kukan] Of course, if the situation permits, it is in the best interest of the government for an ambassador who has established himself or herself somewhere, set up contacts, and begun to be productive for the government to stay there as long as possible. Life is not a straightforward affair, however, and it can happen that an ambassador who has good contacts at one location is needed elsewhere. I believe that this is so in the case of Mrs. Mitrova. Relations with Hungary are so important in our foreign policy that not having an ambassador there would be rather harmful to our objectives, particularly if we speak about the peaceful matter-of-fact dialogue we want to conduct with the Hungarian side. Hence, we really need an ambassador in Budapest. Regarding the successor to Mrs. Mitrova--we are a little further along there than we are in New York--we have some names, but it is not yet at such a stage that I can give them to you. [Gandel] How would you assess--I would term it--the sincere message of greetings sent by U.S. President Bill Clinton to the new Government of the Slovak Republic? [Kukan] I believe that the message is quite clear and favorable, and that it expresses full trust in the new government and a willingness to cooperate constructively and in a matter-of-fact way with this government. I have also received a letter of greeting from my U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, and I can say that it was not just a diplomatic message but a very personal one. Warren Christopher wrote that he knows what I have been doing and assures me of very effective cooperation. I must tell you that it felt good and that it encouraged me tremendously. I have received similar messages--from Klaus Kinkel, for instance--that were also not of the commonplace type that are sent in traditional diplomacy, those two or three phrases that one can say even if awakened at midnight. They were real messages, which took into account the Slovak situation and the specific person; they were messages actually addressed to me, Eduard Kukan. I must admit that it truly encouraged me very much.
