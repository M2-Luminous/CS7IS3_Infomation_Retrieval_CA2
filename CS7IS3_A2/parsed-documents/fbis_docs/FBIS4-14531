It is very regrettable in any case, but especially because it happened today [on third anniversary of referendum on Georgia's independence]. It is a pity that Georgia has once again made itself infamous. I have already been told that various versions of events are being transmitted on all radio stations: that the authorities have been overthrown; the Supreme Council has been imprisoned; and what not. I am saying this not only for the benefit of the Supreme Council but for the benefit of the people who voluntarily or maybe unintentionally participated in this incident. I would not say that this could happen spontaneously. I do not think it would be honest if I did not say the following: I have certain claims against Shota Kviraia, against individual leaders, and the collegium of the ministry. You know that the minister had been ill for some time before he met the collegium. Then the leadership of the ministry went to the city police department and an agreement was reached that everyone would do his own job. There may be certain foundations for claims put forward by Davit Zekidze and then again, there may not. All this requires checking. It may be remarkable by itself when it is alleged that an operation has been carried out and big money has been taken there, but this requires investigation, this should be confirmed. These sort of things are said about other people too. Why am I saying this? Whatever the background, whatever the nonconformity, whatever the facts in the possession of the head of the police department of the capital city or any other, there is no justification for what has happened here. Actually, this means the ruining of what has been built for years by the 1,000-strong collective. Any kind of assessment can be given. If we say that this was an attempted coup d'etat -- if the Supreme Council says so -- the lawyers will try to substantiate this. There may be a different assessment, like an attempt to disperse the Supreme Council, as Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Mikheil [not further identified] said. Perhaps an armed raid can better explain what has happened. Whatever we call it, it is a shameful stain in our history. [passage omitted] There has been quite a lot to reprimand Zekidze as well. I think it should be sufficient for the chief of the city police to be fired, that the city prosecutor was killed, and nothing has been revealed so far. The manager of the tobacco factory has been killed and the case has not been revealed so far. Hundreds of examples like this can be listed -- a lot of kidnapping and the like. But on the other hand, this is a collective that will have to implement all edicts, and I am sure that the young people who came here today, through being misled or with some other excuses -- will accomplish any task given by the state. [passage omitted] Notwithstanding all the good I have said about the activities of the city police and its head, I believe the Supreme Council has to pass a very serious resolution and a strict assessment. Raiding the Council building is absolutely inadmissible. [passage omitted] Certain concern has been expressed over the current tense situation on Georgian railways. About six or eight weeks ago I met a delegation of engine drivers. The meeting was very good, humane, friendly. They are having hard times, like everyone, although their salary is five and even six times higher than that of a worker of any other sphere. The only thing we have managed, the only help we have been able to provide, was this: Using some income the railway is getting from transporting various goods we were able to purchase foodstuffs that we sold for coupons to engine drivers and some other leading specialists. This is all the state is capable of doing today. I know the railway people are listening to this and I want to appeal to them. I want to tell them that to go on strike and stop transport today means that famine will begin in Tbilisi, famine will begin in Kutaisi. I have told you that wheat is being delivered to Georgia. We have overcome the most serious crisis, but stopping the railway today means dumping the state in even a graver situation than now. There is a similar movement in the Metropolitan [subway]. We have to help them with everything the city and the state has, but we will not be able to give them what we do not have. Therefore, I appeal to them myself and on behalf of the Supreme Council to cope with the present hardships and not to desert their area of work. I cannot help speaking about a very delicate issue. We approved a candidacy of the head of our security service yesterday. We put our trust in him. I do not know who declared or how it was declared that he was involved in some agency network. I would like to appeal to everyone. We should not speak of anything of which we are not convinced, of which we have not seen with our own eyes, or about which we have not received any documents about. He was approved by 149 votes in the Supreme Council yesterday. I do not know when and how it was said, but please do not commit a sin. I am not addressing the Council now, I am addressing those who are listening. The same sort of thing is very often said; I mean, they say so much money has been spent there. Of course, such things happen, but as the people say, the one who does commits one sin and the one who blames commits a thousand sins. In a country like ours it is not necessary to further aggravate the situation by blaming each other in excess. Two deputies have strictly put forward an issue of having an agents' network, the people involved in the network examined. No one is going to conceal its existence. Every state has it. The old authorities had it, and they had it deformed, and this service apparently still exists today. It exists in every democratic state. While a state exists this will be one of its attributes, a source of information. If the Council decides, I will not object to it at all. However, one thing should be taken into consideration. There must be two or three people whom we trust most of all, those who will not take the information out into the streets. [passage omitted] Those who will be chosen for this task should be the conscience of the nation and the people. [passage omitted] If these two or three people find something that is essential and causes a certain suspicion, we will get down to discussing what to do next. [passage omitted] I cannot help expressing my gratitude to every one of you; to everyone who has given a sound assessment to the incident; to everyone who expressed their reproofs towards the head of state and other structures, because in all this, one subject was guiding, the one that showed that we have to be together in ordeals like this and always because we are building one country, one state. I cannot imagine anyone here who could be against democracy, against constructing a democratic state. We are united by national and people's interests. We are reminded of the necessity for unity by the Abkhazian tragedy. You know very well that we were ruined by the lack of true unity and elements of treachery. We are reminded of the issue of unity and togetherness by events that took place in Western Georgia. These have been becoming manageable lately and will hopefully become history soon. We are reminded of the issue and the necessity of unity by the hard days we are living in now; I mean, the most difficult social situation, the most complicated situation, hardships every family is facing. And if we remain together we will be able to manage something, we will be able to ease the hard fate of these people and come closer to the days when Georgia's territorial integrity is restored. I am sure this will happen. Whichever road we choose -- this one or that one -- it will lead us to this great aim provided we are unified. This does not rule out differences in ideas, heated discussions in the Supreme Council. We will sometimes feel offended or sorry. We can sometimes feel angry. Someone can slam the door. All this is not very good but the Council is unified in the main and essential thing. We are together in a struggle for one, integrated, democratic, and independent Georgia and I would like to thank you for this. Thank you.
