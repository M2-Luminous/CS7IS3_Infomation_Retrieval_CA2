This meeting was held at the initiative of the Novosibirsk branch of the AKB [joint-stock commercial bank] Vostokinvestbank and the Siberian commercial bank Aurum. All aspects of banking activity were examined at the conference. The participants were compelled to do this, in particular, by the recent decision of the government to establish a minimal authorized capital in the amount of 2 billion rubles [R], with subsequent quarterly adjustments. To date, more than 70 independent banks and branches have been operating in our oblast. On the average, their authorized capital is about R300 million. The level of work of the banks is very different, which can also be judged by the rating that is regularly established by the main administration of the Central Bank of Russia for Novosibirsk Oblast. Lately, the demands on the banks to provide services on an international level are becoming more and more persistent. Also, competition is increasing. Therefore, the problem of improving the quality of banking services is becoming more and more critical, and it is unattainable for many without bank mergers. This was also the main question that the bankers discussed. Two concepts of future development were proposed at this meeting. Boris Dudarev, the chairman of the board of the Aurum Bank, proposed an amalgamation under the aegis of Moscow organizations. The second concept, proposed by Pavel Mityakin, the director of the Novosibirsk branch of the AKB Vostokinvestbank, was based on regional interests. But they, in the opinion of the leadership of Vostokinvestbank, are closer to the eastern regions than to the western regions (the main bank, Vostokinvestbank, is in Vladivostok, and it has various ties with states of the Asia-Pacific region; it is a member of the global international financial telecommunications association, and its capital authorization is more than R12 billion). The bankers have not adopted a final resolution yet.
