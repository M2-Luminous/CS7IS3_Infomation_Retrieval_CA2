He warned that his organization will retaliate to every terror attack by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or the Islamic Jihad with murders, in Israel or abroad, which will be similar to the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The man who will carry out the act will never be caught. He will commit suicide to sanctify God's name.
