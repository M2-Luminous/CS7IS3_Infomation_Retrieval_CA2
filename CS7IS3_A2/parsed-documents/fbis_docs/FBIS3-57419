As a deputy of the State Duma, he may not simultaneously be in state service, Colonel-General Volkogonov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent today. "In consultation with Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaydar, we decided that I should stay in the Duma, because the "Russia's Choice" group I belong to is relatively small," Dmitriy Volkogonov said. In addition, he will continue work in the three presidential commissions researching into cases of missing foreign citizens and of Russian Federation citizens who disappeared in unexplained circumstances outside the former USSR, and into the use of and declassification of the presidential archive.
