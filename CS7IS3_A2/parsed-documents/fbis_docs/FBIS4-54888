Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] is the third of the former Yugoslav republics to embark upon a fundamental restructuring of the security system. So far it has only been done by Slovenia and Croatia. The announced separation of intelligence and counterintelligence functions into separate and relatively independent structures (the Intelligence Agency and the Directorate for Protection of the Constitutional Order) will create the institutional prerequisites for beginning a process of dispersion of the enormous real power that accumulates at the very top of the ministry. During the period of monism that power was not transparent, since the ministerial (at that time secretarial) armchair was reserved for quiet and obedient "soldiers," loyal to the state and party leadership. Later things changed, and today it is not by chance that it is thought that the head of the ministry is probably the most influential figure in the country after the three in the state leadership (the state president, the president of parliament, and the prime minister). How will that power be distributed? The government, in the draft laws on internal affairs and the Intelligence Agency, is offering an interesting formula for the method of selection and dismissal of the directors of the Agency and the Directorate, and especially for the subordination of responsibility of these people and structures. As we know, the minister of internal affairs is selected by the Assembly, and he is answerable to the cabinet and in a specific way (the institution of interpellation) directly to the parliament. The director of the counterintelligence service (the Directorate) will be appointed and dismissed by the government, but at the proposal of the minister. Logically, he will thereby also be responsible to the latter. The author of the law is proposing that the head of the intelligence service (the Agency) be appointed and dismissed by the republic president, but subordination to the cabinet is also envisioned. The Agency will thus be responsible to the government, which will be able to demand accountability from its director. Furthermore, the head of the intelligence service will adopt regulations on the organization and systematization of jobs only with prior consent from the government. There is no doubt that this formula is consistent with the spirit of the constitutionally (and realistically) established semipresidential system in Macedonia. A similar solution exists in Croatia, for example, where the counterintelligence service is part of the Interior Ministry, but the intelligence under the control of these services in all countries depends on the basic characteristics of the system. In "pure" parliamentary regimes, for instance, the members of the intelligence-security families are under the control of the governments and the corresponding ministries, and it is often the practice that their activities are coordinated by interministerial committees. So far the solution offered by the government has not aroused any interest whatsoever on the part of parliament and the broader political public. It is symptomatic that only the idea arises somewhere in parliament and that the appointment and dismissal of the Directorate's director are to be under the jurisdiction of the head of state. To say the least, this is a surprising proposal. It would be natural for the deputies to fight to have that authority come either from their chamber or at least from the government that they elect. It might thus be logical that they would challenge a solution according to which the state president appoints and dismisses the director of the Intelligence Agency. If the efforts of some deputies to establish direct subordination of the heads of these structures to parliament as well (parliamentary oversight is another matter) are perhaps an understandable, if not justified "reflex" on the part of the deputies, then the proposal that the head of state be given greater powers, of course, demonstrates a lack of understanding of the essence of the formula offered. It is not coincidental that the republic president's jurisdiction to appoint such an important figure in the security community is limited by the Agency's clearly defined subordination to the government. Actually, the mutual limitations are the point of this solution. The formula is constructed in such a way that it complicates any possible attempts at rapid, ill-considered, and frequent changes of the people in leading positions at these services, all in a situation of disagreement or open conflicts within the government (between coalition partners, between the premier and individual ministers, and so forth), in cases of conflict between the government and the republic president, or possibly between the government and the minister of internal affairs. Thus, for example, the government could hold the director of the Intelligence Agency responsible for a specific situation or occurrence, but that does not mean that the state president is obligated to accept it and dismiss that person. Conversely, if the president decides on such a step without or even against the will of the government, the latter, even if it does not block the selection, can at least hamper the functioning of the president's new protege. Or there is this situation: The minister can hold the director of the Directorate responsible, but the government does not have to decide to dismiss him. Conversely, if the government replaces the head of the counterintelligence service without the minister's consent, the latter can block the selection of a new director by dodging the obligation to propose a new candidate, or by proposing someone who will not suit his fellow cabinet members. These complications are unnecessary at first glance, and even dangerous, but they are actually extremely useful, since if it were not for these "handles," it could easily happen, in the event of political infighting within the government or in the state leadership and, in general, in confused general political conditions, that confusing changes and coups in the leading positions of these services might also result. In that way the services could be utilized in political quarrels among coalition partners, and even induced to engage in unhealthy mutual competition. In the developed democratic world, such cases of quiet "wars" between a state's security services have been recorded, and they usually end with serious scandals with serious consequences for the state's security as well. It is precisely for that reason that these services need to be protected from major political upheavals. The formula that has been offered will create a situation in which changes in the leaderships of these services will be feasible only in conditions of relative political stability. Admittedly, certain shortcomings of these solutions can also be noted. In the first place, it can easily be assumed that formal jurisdiction over the intelligence service will probably be ceded by the head of state to one of his special advisers for security issues. That is customary in presidential regimes. With the increase in the head of state's real power, the power of his adviser (or team of advisers) will also be increased, something that is not exactly in the spirit of the regime, which, however, is basically a parliamentary one. In the second place, in a situation of assumed chronic political instability in the state leadership, there is a risk that the heads of these services may become detached from real control by the government and the republic president, and that new centers of political power may thus be promoted. There are no ideal solutions, however, and one must also rely on the corrective factor of parliamentary and also public oversight. It remains to be seen how, after the anticipated adoption of the laws, this part of the Interior Ministry's transformation will be carried out in practice. The experiences to date from the division of leading positions in state institutions among the coalition partners suggest the assumption that things will not go smoothly this time either. Whatever happens, that is also part of the entertainment called politics.
