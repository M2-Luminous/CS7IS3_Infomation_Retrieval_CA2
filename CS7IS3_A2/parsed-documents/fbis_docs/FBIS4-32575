The prime minister described this figure as a breakthrough. According to him, the other macroeconomic indicators are just as positive. This result, which defines the CSU's original estimate (growth of 0.5 to 2.0 percent) considerably more precisely, comes from the processing of more complete data, CSU Deputy Chairman Ivan Sujan told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. However, the current figures are also preliminary and may be further revised in an upward direction, he emphasized. The reason for this, according to him, is mainly the unfinished processing of the documents containing the customs statistics for exports. Roughly half the increase can be ascribed to the extraordinary decline in GDP in the first quarter of 1993, with which the first quarter of 1994 is being compared. As a consequence of the anticipation of the new taxation system and the breakup of the federation, retail sales and construction work rose exceptionally in the last quarter of 1992 and, on the other hand, inevitably fell in the first quarter of 1993. The other half of the increase in the first quarter of 1994, however, obviously signals the expected economic recovery and an actual GDP increase at a, for the moment, "filtered" year-on-year rate of 1.5 to 2.0 percent, said the CSU deputy chairman. All of the elements of aggregate demand contributed to the increase. Households' consumption increased in actual prices by 8 percent and investment by 6.8 percent. The reduced base from the first quarter of 1993 also manifests itself here, however. The increase in domestic demand amounted to 9.2 percent; in foreign demand, the decline in exports (caused chiefly by another reduction in exports to the Slovak Republic) was more than compensated for by the significant increase in the export of services. Aggregate demand rose by 8 percent. Nevertheless, in the Czech Republic, there is still a not quite satisfied "hunger for imports," brought about by their restriction under central planning. A substantial part of the increase in aggregate demand is therefore swallowed up by this increase in imports, and only the smaller portion is left for the GDP increase, says I. Sujan. However, this phenomenon is, according to him, temporary and signals the possibility of a substantial acceleration in the increase in the GDP in coming years. The share of industry in the formation of the GDP is gradually conforming to the share normal for market economies; it amounted to 42.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994. In 1993, given a decline in industrial output of roughly 5 percent, the GDP, in essence, stagnated. During the first quarter of 1994, the decline in industrial output came to a virtual halt, and, therefore, it is no surprise that the rate of the increase in the GDP is roughly four points higher, says Sujan. Apart from the changes in industry, the rise in the output of services, construction, and trade has also played a role in GDP activity. The GDP, like the majority of economic indicators, is also influenced by regular seasonal fluctuations. After their influence has been filtered out, the GDP, in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the average for 1993, is 2.3 percent higher and, compared with the average for 1992, is 2 percent higher. The seasonally adjusted GDP in the first quarter of 1994 is, however, still roughly 18 percent lower than the average for 1990. The CSU wonders, however, whether there really has been such a major decline between these years. That is to say, it is necessary to take into consideration the real effect of the so-called gray economy, which official statistics cannot ascertain at the moment. According to some estimates, it generates 10-15 percent of the GDP, and its output since 1990 has increased by up to 50 percent. This would mean an increase in the established GDP level of 5 to 7.5 points. Another problem is that the price increases during transformation are not reflected in simple price increases alone but partly in an improvement in the quality and range of goods. The influence of the statistically unascertained part of this activity may be of the same extent as the gray economy. This would mean, according to Sujan, that the decline in the overall real product since 1990 was, in fact, much less and was in the range of 3 to 8 percent.
