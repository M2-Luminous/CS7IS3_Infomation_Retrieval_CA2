"According to specified data, the budget was endorsed at 194.4 trillion rubles for expenditures and 124.4 trillion rubles for revenues. The top limit of the budget deficit was estimated at 70 trillion rubles, or 36 per cent of budgetary expenditures. A decision was adopted to look into the problem of more rational use of funds envisaged as financial aid to subjects of the federation," Dubinin said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. However, leader of the Russia's Choice faction Yegor Gaydar believes that the approval of the federal budget by the State Duma means that a negative tendency which appeared in spring, 1994 will continue to develop. The essence of this tendency is a step-by-step increase in subsidies, growing expenditures envisaged by "investments and subsidies" articles with simultaneous cuts in social allocations, in particular, for culture, science and education. In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS prominent Russian economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said that the federal budget in its present form will not change anything and the situation in the country will be the same as it was before. "Lawmakers do not realise that the budget is the money of all citizens which should be correctly used to prevent the situation from getting worse," Yavlisnkiy said.
