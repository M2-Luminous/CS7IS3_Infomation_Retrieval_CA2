The circles' proof of the existence of the undeclared split is that one ministry does not know what another does, and that some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] ministers are trying to free themselves from the so-called "Sanaa grip," especially as some of these ministers have for several weeks been living in Aden and other southern governorates. Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has confirmed the statement attributed to a Foreign Ministry official to the effect that the ministry had no prior knowledge of the Omani oil minister's visit to Hadhramaut last Sunday [26 December] -- a visit during which he held talks with Yemeni Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Husaynun. The official newspaper AL-THAWRAH published this statement yesterday, saying that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry had received a memorandum from the Omani Embassy, seeking assistance to allow the "private" plane carrying the Omani minister to land at al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut. The statement also said that the ministry had known nothing about the visit, and the same applies to Transport Minister Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad's travel to Cairo to attend the Arab transport ministers' conference. Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the statement in question was made in reply to Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas statements about the two visits when he "confirmed" the Foreign Ministry's knowledge of them. A General People's Congress source has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the oil and mineral resources minister and the transport minister (who represent the YSP in the present coalition government) did something unusual. The source added: It is logical and natural for all foreign contacts with fraternal or friendly states to be conducted via the Foreign Ministry, because it is the country's main contact channel, as is the case in all states. [passage omitted] Sources following the situation have linked what happened to recent reports about continued attempts by a number of YSP ministers, especially those who have for several week been living in Aden, to free themselves from "Sanaa's grip." The sources said that these ministers' nonparticipation in regular government meetings since the Aden meeting held in October -- even though most of these meetings are chaired by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas -- is evidence of their wish to make their own independent decisions, be it with regard to internal policies concerning their ministries or even matters concerning Yemen's relationship with other states.
