While condemning the dastardly and despicable act on behalf of the government and the people of Pakistan, the prime minister in a statement issued in Islamabad last night, said the incident reflects religious intolerance which nowadays has been directed toward the Muslims of Palestine, Bosnia, and Kashmir. While condemning this tendency toward religious intolerance, she said Pakistan considers it as nothing but unreasonable steps taken at individual and collective levels. Pakistan has taken note of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's appeal to convene an emergency session of the UN Security Council and as a member of this body, Pakistan will give full attention to this serious matter. The prime minister urged the members of the UN Security Council to make use of the tenets enshrined in the UN Charter and to implement the UN Security Council Resolution Number 242 and 338, and other resolutions on Jerusalem.
