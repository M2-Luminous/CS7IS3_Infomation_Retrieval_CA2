The National Election Committee (NEC) checked the 342 invalid votes cast in the 6th constituency (Gyor-Sopron County, W Hungary) in the run-off elections on May 29, and found 68 to be valid. The revision was initiated by MDF candidate Gyorgy Rasko, who finished ten votes behind AFD candidate Gyula Varga in the run-off. Of the 68 votes found valid, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor Simon of the Hungarian Socialist Party, and 16 to Varga. Thus Rasko took over the first place with 9416 valid votes from Varga, who had 9406 votes. On Thursday evening, the NEC also examined the approx. 27,000 valid ballots in the constituency, and the recounting affirmed Rasko's victory. If the Supreme Court does not pass a different judgement after revising the case at any possible request, then Rasko will represent the 6th constituency in Parliament. SZDSZ delegate to the NEC Ferenc Salamon has told MTI, "The SZDSZ candidate is not likely to turn to the Supreme Court for supervision. So the National Election Committee will surely annouce the official final results of the May 29 second round of the elections at its Monday session. Therefore, the MDF is almost certain to have 38 seats in the 386-seat National Assembly, while the SZDSZ will have 69."
