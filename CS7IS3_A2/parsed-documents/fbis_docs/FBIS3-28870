On the same day, a "P-3" anti-submarine patrol plane which took off from the Yokosuka base of Japan staged a strike exercise above the waters of South Korea, making low- and ultra-low altitude flights. On February 8 and 9, large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of the South Korean puppet Army kicked up a row in various areas of Paju County, and Chorwon and Yonchon Counties of South Korean Kangwon Province adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line, firing at random artillery pieces and large-calibre machine guns and automatic rifles. The frenzied play with fire of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets is a grave challenge to the unanimous desire of the Korean people and the world peaceloving peoples for peace and detente on the Korean peninsula.
