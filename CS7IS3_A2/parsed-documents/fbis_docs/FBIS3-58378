[passage omitted] Armando Pires, our special envoy, reports. [Pires] [passage omitted] During a meeting with Portuguese journalists, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva described as historic the decisions made at this summit. Cavaco Silva welcomed the American decision to keep Europe as one of its defense priorities, and said he believed the summit had eliminated the areas of disagreement between NATO and the WEU [Western European Union]. The Prime Minister said the conditions have been created for both NATO and the WEU to dedicate themselves fully to the peace operations entrusted to them. One of the decisions Cavaco Silva described as historic was the Sixteen's approval of the Partnership for Peace plan. An evolutionary process, according to him, which will depend on its interpretation by the East European countries. As is known, the document was not all the Polish, Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovaks wanted, but Cavaco Silva explained this with the need not to isolate Moscow in this process. [Begin Cavaco recording] We had an Iron Curtain which was destroyed, and we must not do anything now which would represent moving an Iron Curtain further east. The main advantage of this Partnership for Peace is nondiscrimination. It does not discriminate between any country belonging to the CSCE, it promises (?peace to all), and I think it would in fact be a mistake at the moment to discriminate against Russia or Ukraine or Belarus, or any other country. It is open to all countries which want to commit themselves to the strengthening of security in Europe. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Pires] In the last part of this press conference, Cavaco Silva expressed the satisfaction of the Portuguese Government which, following Spain's example, wanted this Brussels summit to voice its commitment to the defense and security of the Mediterranean. Europe is today affected not only by the waves of immigration caused by the regional conflicts spreading in the region, but also feels the danger caused by the political and military instability in the so-called European southern flank. Cavaco Silva revealed that a high-level group was set up to study the situation in the southern Mediterranean.
