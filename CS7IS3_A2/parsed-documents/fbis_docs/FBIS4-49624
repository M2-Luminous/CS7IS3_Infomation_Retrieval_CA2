FBIS4-49624 "drchi089_v_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 TAIWAN Government Protests Media Restriction Government Protests Media Restriction OW0605185094 Taipei CNA in English 1324 GMT 6 May 94 OW0605185094 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Benjamin Yeh] [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Friday [6 May] protested to Mainland China over its restriction on the number of Taiwan reporters that will be allowed by Beijing to cover the trial of the four men charged with robbing and killing 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and crew members on Qiandao Lake. "It simply doesn't make any sense to impose such restrictions," Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said one day after mainland authorities made the decision to allow only 30 Taiwan journalists to cover the case. The four men charged in the crime -- three for murder, arson, and robbery and one for complicity -- will stand trial on Tuesday. Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said SEF had conveyed a complaint to its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS). SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of official contacts. In the complaint, Li pointed out, SEF said it could not figure out why the mainland wants to restrict the number of Taiwan journalists when it had previously indicated Taiwan journalists would be freely allowed to cover the case. "That abrupt change has caused extreme discontent among the local mass media," Li said. SEF Deputy Secretary General H. Y. Hsu is scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Mainland China on Sunday to look into the mainland's investigation into the incident. The group will comprise relatives of the victims, lawyers and forensic experts. Hsu also called on the mainland to re-think its restrictions on news coverage, saying that only by clarifying the lingering doubts surrounding the deaths can fragile cross-strait ties be patched up. Beijing at first insisted that the tourists were killed in an accident, and refused to allow the victims' relatives to board the pleasure boat on which the tourists perished. Taiwan reporters were also barred from the scene. Mainland authorities did an about-face on the issue, however, after Taiwan threatened to put a stop to private exchanges between the two sides, which began in 1989. Beijing's handling of the case touched off an uproar here, and led President Li Teng-hui, in an unusually strongly worded statement, to call the Beijing regime a group of "bandits," who should have been overthrown by the people a long time ago.
