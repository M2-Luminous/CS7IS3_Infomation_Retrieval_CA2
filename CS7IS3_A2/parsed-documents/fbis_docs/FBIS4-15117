Korotchenya explained his reluctance to ballot with the fact that "currently the most important for him is to focus attention on work in the executive secretariat." "Undoubtedly, I am grateful to those who trust me as a potential head of state, but I am convinced that the most prepared man for this post among the candidates is the present Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich," Korotchenya said. In his opinion, Kebich, "an experienced manager and predictable politician, pursuing the consecutive policy oriented to an economic union with Russia, has big chances to head the country." Korotchenya said that tonight he leaves for Moscow to meet with Chairman of the Council of Heads of CIS States Boris Yeltsin. It is expected that the two men will specify the draft agenda of the Moscow summit scheduled for 15 April. Besides, Korotchenya plans to report to Yeltsin about the fulfillment of his order to prepare the Moscow summit of presidents of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Russia on the settlement on the Karabakh crisis. IF Note: As a member of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group, Korotchenya visited Baku, Yerevan and Nagorno-Karabakh from 31 March to 2 April. In his words, "the leaders of both sides involved in the conflict agreed in principle" to discuss the document on ceasefire and to hold talks on the final settlement of the Karabakh problem. The subject of peacekeeping efforts of the CIS parliamentarians was raised at a meeting between Korotchenya and UN Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday. Butrus-Ghali proposed to register the Commonwealth Charter in the UN Secretariat in the next few days. Ghali said that this will enable "all countries of the international community to learn better the principles, goals and tasks of the CIS, and its structure." Ghali linked the need for the registration with recent giving the observer status at the UN General Assembly to the CIS. Commenting on the results of the talks, Korotchenya informed about the agreement "to establish stable business contacts between coordinating structures of the Commonwealth and the UN Secretariat." In Korotchenya's opinion, "Butrus-Ghali's proposals open good opportunities for studying and using the experience of the UN in the activities of the CIS."
