But officials are declining comment on whether there was any evidence to indicate that a single group was behind the two blasts. Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of five people on Wednesday [2 February], one day after a bomb tore through the Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two people, one of them seriously. The minister said investigations were continuing and that investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any details. The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on Jan. 26 at the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven people, one of them seriously. The common features of the two bombings were that both occurred at establishments screening X-rated moves and the nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the projection rooms. More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with the same technique that was used by the extremist underground group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said. "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could have learnt the technique." Jaysh Muhammad is believed to comprise mostly of Jordanian volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990. Eighteen members of the group were found guilty of carrying out or plotting attacks against government officials, security officers, state buildings and foreign diplomats as well as liquor stores and night clubs in 1992. Eight of them, including two in absentia, were sentenced to death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large, were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn. Jaysh Muhammad was at one point alleged to be the "military wing" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood has categorically denied any such link with the group. According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan, Jaysh Muhammad was set up by hardliners who belonged to the Brotherhood who were disillusioned with what they saw as the leadership's moderate approach and confining the group to the mainstream political process in Jordan. The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Brotherhood, has denounced the Jan. 26 bombing saying violence was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films that many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian society.
