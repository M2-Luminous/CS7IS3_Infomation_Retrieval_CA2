The defense minister also said that a considerable amount of the mechanical equipment used in the military exercises, which begin this month, will remain in the country after the exercises conclude on 20 August. Nevertheless, said the ranking military officer, the importance of the exercises is the work experience that our troops will gain. [Begin Corado recording] Certain pieces of equipment will remain in the country, and some will be kept by the U.S. Army because they are quite expensive and can be used for joint exercises in other Latin American countries. However, we will have gained experience from working with highly skilled military engineers. As you can see, the projects completed during the first phase are of very good quality. In my opinion, the most valuable part of this experience lies in the knowledge our soldiers will gain from working with U.S. engineers. [end recording] Gen. Corado explained that the Army's new organic law will broadly reconcile the role of the Armed Forces with the spirit of the Constitution. He said the internal readjustment process is growing increasingly positive. [Begin Corado recording] I have been informed that [words indistinct] have been sent to the Supreme Court of Justice. As I already told the president of the Republic, we will adhere to any court decision that opposes the continuation of these joint exercises between the U.S. Army and the Salvadoran Armed Forces. However, as long as a resolution to that end is not issued, we will continue the operation until 20 August when the second phase ends. [end recording] The defense minister argued, among other things, that the unconstitutionality appeal filed last year with the Supreme Court of Justice, which opposes the presence of U.S. troops in the country, is not hindering the military exercises. Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court decision favors the appeal, the exercises will be suspended within the framework of respect for the Constitution. For the time being, however, the exercises in El Salvador will continue, Corado said.
