During his time in Rio de Janeiro and Juiz de Fora, Franco demonstrated his mercurial temperament by assailing journalists, cancelling speeches, bypassing official security procedures, and commenting to his friends that he wants to quit the presidency and settle down in Minas Gerais. Unlike former President Jose Sarney [1985-90], Franco does not like the ritual of the presidency -- the set of formalities with which the president must necessarily comply. He made a point of displaying this over the past 10 days. As one of Franco's aides noted: "He likes to be treated like an ordinary citizen." How can a president behave like an ordinary citizen or overlook the damage this may cause the country at an especially delicate moment? During the same week that Franco insisted on behaving like an ordinary citizen, the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Supreme Court removed those guilty of corruption from office. The Legislative and Judicial Branches thus recovered part of the credibility they had lost. The president's trip to Rio de Janeiro and Juiz de Fora was seen in Brasilia as a lack of interest in power. "The Executive Branch must exhibit an element of peace in the institutions," said Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia], the PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Franco was holed up meanwhile at the Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro avoiding his main official duty at this juncture, namely to negotiate the passing of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic package in Congress. He did discharge some less important duties, such as installing two new ministers -- Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo and Culture Minister Luiz Nascimento Silva. These appointments do not seem to have been preceded by substantial politico-partisan negotiations. He also met Deputy Roberto Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco], who resigned as government leader in the Chamber of Deputies because he disagreed with the economic plan. Free from the rigid structure of rules and protocol at Planalto Palace, the president ate pizza in the early hours in Rio de Janeiro and played piano during the evening in Juiz de Fora. Thus began one of the most astonishing weeks in his 15 months at the head of the presidency. Franco arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 9 December. The following day he participated in a ceremony at the War College. Before sunset he left the Gloria Hotel on his first rebellious foray of the week. Accompanied by Minister Mauro Durante, secretary general of the Presidency, and his nephew Ariosto Franco, the president took to the road. After a nearly two-hour drive he arrived at his apartment on Rio Branco Avenue in downtown Juiz de Fora. By virtue of his post, these trips must be made by plane, the presidential plane, or by car -- an official car in a motorcade. The government delegation, meanwhile, remained at the Gloria Hotel. The absence of an armed escort for the head of state was instrumental in causing the first major incident of his weekend. Franco left his apartment of Juiz de Fora at 1600 local time on 12 December to visit his former mother-in-law, Zila, some 10 km from downtown Juiz de Fora. Realizing he was being followed by the press, Franco ordered the driver of his Monza car to go faster. The driver ran a red light. Arriving at his destination, Franco kicked the car door open. He lunged at reporters, snatching the camera parasol of Rede Bandeirantes Television and grabbing the flash from an O GLOBO photographer. "Have you no respect for others?" growled the head of state. "Please clear off, this is private property," he added. This was Franco's second incident with the press in Juiz de Fora. On All Souls' Day, he charged at a Rede Globo Television cameraman filming Franco's visit to the tomb of his mother, Italia Cauterio Franco. According to Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "This behavior shows he is a tortured man," adding: "There is no excuse for this behavior." Politicians have always been aware of the president's oscillating behavior. But he has never exhibited it with such force as he did over the last few days, thus increasing the number of those who fear a disruption in the democratic system of government and those who fear Franco will resign. During an improvised news conference, Franco told journalists: "If we manage to weather these three coming months (until the end of March, by which time presidential candidacies will have been defined) in democracy, respecting the Constitution, and if I manage to hand over power to my successor, I will be satisfied with myself." The fact that the president included democracy in his conditional sentence strengthens the conviction of those who exemplify the idea of sutlers. According to a group of friends and politicians, the fear the president may resign -- which could trigger an institutional rupture -- is also based on other indications. A friend of the president from Brasilia said: "I talk with him every day and he always says he is tired and going home." Franco talked about this issue the week before he went to Rio de Janeiro. His friend from Brasilia made the following interpretation: "It does not necessarily mean resignation but these are the real feelings of a man tired of power who lacks a private life." His resignation is, however, possible. In his political career, Franco resigned only once, when he left the presidency of a CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] on nuclear energy under the Geisel administration. Every other time he held public office, with the exception of one of the two times he was prefect of Juiz de Fora, he talked about resigning every time he faced a crisis. During the electoral campaign, he threatened to leave Collor's electoral ticket three times. During the presidency he talked about it when he completed one year in office. In an interview, he admitted he was thinking of resigning. Doubting that it was possible, leading politicians checked the Constitution to find the legal alternatives to a presidential resignation. Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul] was asked by military advisers about this possibility. The Constitution establishes that Congress must indirectly choose a name to complete the Collor/Franco presidential term. In the Chamber of Deputies, some deputies already have their candidates, among them, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party--Parana Sate]. This is not the first time -- and will not be the last -- that the president has shown his lack of patience with the job and his inability to move the pieces of the political game at a time when Congress is weak. Two months ago when deputies and senators installed the budget CPI, Franco told them he would not oppose an agreement to hold early elections. The governor of Ceara, surprised by the president's remarks, returned early from Washington -- where he signed agreements with the Inter-American Development Bank -- to meet Franco. The governor suggested that Franco should fill the political vacuum created by the accusations against congressmen. "Better not," said Franco, "it may seem opportunistic." For a group of the president's direct advisers, his apathy has become an undeniable element. For example, the week the budget scandal emerged, Franco prepared a 12-page speech that was to have been delivered on radio and television network for 18 minutes. One individual involved in this project said: "It was a speech to fill the institutional vacuum." The president would have said: "The people have ethical values," unlike some deputies and senators involved in the accusations. Franco also was to have talked about education and other projects. One adviser said: "He cancelled the speech because he was afraid of touching members of the government." Two of his ministers were on the list to be investigated. Following this first cancellation, the president cancelled two other speeches. In a week characterized by Franco's outspoken behavior, the government also revealed its lack of political course because of what the president did not say. In Rio, for example, Franco canceled his participation in the ceremony to award swords to the Naval School marines on 20 December. It was officially said that the president's presence would not be necessary. The truth is that Franco did not attend because he had prepared a dramatic speech calling for a moderation of radical political positions. Franco feared that his speech during a military ceremony would be interpreted as something coordinated with the position expressed by the Army chief of staff the week before. Franco was unaware beforehand of the speech by General Benedito Leonel, who referred to political issues. His absence at the military ceremony seems to have contributed to calming things down after the crisis that emerged the week before. By issuing only a simple declaration supporting the finance minister since the economic plan was announced two weeks ago, the president cooperated with the criticisms made of the economic team. Under pressure from the lack of political support from Planalto Palace, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso already is thinking of carrying out the stages of the plan ahead of time. For example, he could introduce the URV [Real Value Unit] on 1 January, 30 days before the initial date. Economist Edmar Bracha, the minister's special adviser, told a friend in confidence that he has become the main target of criticisms of the plan, and that he may leave the government next month. According to the presidential advisers, the president's desire to resign reportedly came from a double disappointment in addition to complaints from his family. In the political field, he reportedly is disappointed with several people he knows whose names are being investigated by the budget CPI. In the economic field, Franco reportedly realized that nothing else remains for him to do except support Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan. "Fire him to do what?" asked Franco during a recent conversation with a congressman. He admitted: "I don't have much time." For example, Franco disagrees with the dollarization proposed by the minister and does not want to suggest breaking up oil and telecommunications monopolies in a constitutional reform. Therefore, he had to swallow the two measures. "I am personally against breaking up those monopolies, but I will not oppose the measure if Fernando Henrique Cardoso proposes it," Franco told journalists accompanying him to Brasao restaurant in Juiz de Fora, where he had dinner at 0100 on Friday after his speech at the Viana College graduation ceremony at his daughter Georgiana's graduation from law school. The family complaints come from the president's two daughters: Fabiana and Georgiana. During his conversation with journalists at the Brasao restaurant, the president was asked to request Faviana's opinion, as an economist, about her father's government. "Her comments are unpublishable," Franco said. "This is why I have a sociologist instead of an economist at the Finance Ministry." Both daughters demand more attention. They have been to Brasilia only twice since their father took power. On one of those occasions the president complained about not being advised of his daughter's visit in time and because he was afraid his private life would be exposed. The most curious episode revealing Itamar Franco's rebellious attitude took place on Tuesday night. According to Attorney Jose De Castro, president of Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company], Franco told his security guards at bedtime that he would not leave the Gloria Hotel. The protection plan was deactivated and only one guard stayed in the 10th-floor corridor. At around 0100, Itamar Franco told the security officer he would go to Mauro Durante's room. But it was a lie. The president went to the lobby, where he met Castro. The couple walked past two cameramen sleeping in the entrance and went out. Franco jumped into Jose de Castro's car and drove toward the pizza parlor in Botafogo. Franco ordered a tomato and cheese pizza and drank two beers. Castro ate a tomato, cheese, and ham pizza and drank four beers. They were not bothered, not even by the couple kissing each other at one of the tables. "There was no one around us. I believe the youngsters doubted the president could have escaped from his hotel to eat pizza," Jose de Castro said amusedly. "We left the pizza parlor at 0230 and returned to the Gloria Hotel," Castro added. Less than 48 hours later the president repeated the scene at a Juiz de Fora restaurant. Twice after participating in his daughter's graduation ceremony Franco walked to the piano where professor Maria Tereza Laidersnaider, from the Music Conservatory, was playing classical and romantic music, cheering up the night at the Brasao Restaurant. At the end Franco played together with the professor. He is convinced of the success of changing habits and might repeat the experience in the coming weeks. "Many people complained that he stayed in Brasilia too much," Jose De Castro said. "Now he has gone to Rio de Janeiro and he will return." The Gloria Hotel presidential suite has 500 square meters, five rooms, a dining room, a sitting room, a bar, and a support kitchen. The walls are decorated with French silk, the sheets are of special linen, and towels are hand embroidered. The official cost is 50,600 cruzeiros a day. Besides increasing his visits to Rio de Janeiro, Franco's friends intend to work out a visit abroad. The official purpose would be unimportant because the real purpose would be to give Franco some 20 days of rest. Whenever he has to have a tete-a-tete with somebody, President Franco sits down on the person's right and stretches his neck up a little. This is an old habit of his that goes back to the time when he ran for governor of Minas Gerais in 1986. He told his friends then that he could not hear very well. During the election campaign in 1989, he began wearing a tiny hearing aid, strategically hidden under locks of hair, to be able to face the election marathon. The hearing aid disappeared after delicate microsurgery in Rio de Janeiro at the beginning of 1990. "His hearing is normal and is being checked by audiometric tests," states the president's physician at Planalto Palace, Carlos Alberto Farias. Besides this hearing deficiency, which has been totally overcome now, the president's health does not have major problems other than the ones common among 62-year-old people who have an exacting work schedule and high stress levels. The control of cholesterol levels, which is also common among people his age, obliges the president to follow a spartan diet. Franco takes vitamins A, B, and C, besides capsules of a vitamin complex recommended for people his age, in order to prevent possible stress crises. When he was a senator, Franco had hepatitis-A, which left him with a liver condition. The overtaxing situations the president has to confront by virtue of the post he holds do not affect him clinically. But they clearly disturb him emotionally, as noticed by some of his friends from Juiz de Fora and Brasilia. One of them says: "In private, he has never been different from the way he is at Planalto Palace." "Itamar has always been very insecure and prone to outbursts of anger. Sometimes he argued with me on account of the most insignificant thing and the next day he behaved as if nothing had happened," says Lisle Lucena, with the authority of somebody who had a love affair with the president for four years. Franco is a veritable romantic in his dealings with women. He cannot restrain his jealousy, he writes poems, and sends roses on special events. Lucena comments that Franco did not want to become "emotionally involved" with his girlfriends. "That was the case with me; with Eleonora, Senator Jarbas Passarinho's daughter; and even with his former wife, Anna Elisa, who asked for a divorce because Franco did not share anything with her," Lucena said. His usual comment: "I wish I could change everything for a net and a straw cigar," repeatedly mentioned by the president as the subject of jokes by many, including some of his old friends. "He is of Casa Jose Silva's type. Take three and pay for two," jokes a Juiz de Fora legislator. At parties, he hates to be called president and when someone makes the mistakes of calling him that he begs: "Please, call me Itamar." Franco gives Palacio da Alvorada employees the same provincial treatment and rejects the most human temptations. He detests shrimp, lobster, and codfish. He loves Minas Gerais cheese and never rejects a Campari -- his only alcoholic concession besides the traditional draft beer in Juiz de Fora's bars. He is a real frustration to gourmets because of these gastronomic restrictions. His private cook, Helio Antion Alves, is lauded only when he cooks chicken with okra or bug bear Minas' style. "He only likes the usual steak with rice, beans, and cold sweet potatoes," complains Alves. Every morning the cook and housekeeper Raimunda Teles prepare the indispensable presidential vitamin composed of papaya and orange. The habit of leaving at the most inappropriate moments is explained by Franco in a simple way. "I am like a bird who does not sing when he changes. I need privacy and isolation," he told a friend after scaring off the photographers in front of his former mother-in-law's home in Juiz de Fora on 12 December. "The day we started dating he was surprised when I asked him about his car. He went to pick me up on foot and we ended up going out in my Volkswagen," Lisle commented. When his former girlfriend did not want to drive and the couple could not go out, Franco would say: "Then we can sit on the sidewalk and talk."
