A. Zhitnikov, its deputy chairman, in the FRG. It discussed matters of further collaboration, participated in preparation of a new document that deals with various aspects of relations between the two countries in this direction. Our Bonn correspondent, R. Kolchanov, took advantage of this opportunity to interview A. A. Zhitnikov: [Question] What is the extent of humanitarian aid and how large a part is Germany playing in it? [Answer] Humanitarian aid to Russia is coming from more than 60 countries. Last year, we received about 500,000 tons of foodstuffs, as well as many drugs and medical equipment both along government lines and from hundreds of private organizations. In the first half of this year, the volume of food aid alone constituted a million tons. Germany's share is quite appreciable. Let me mention such major organizations as the German Red Cross and CARE-Deutschland. Of course, we have expressed our most sincere appreciation to all donors who have to exert much effort to collect and transport food. [Question] The aid is intended primarily for the socially depressed population strata in Russia.... [Answer] According to our estimates, they constitute 30-35 million people: pensioners, invalids, large families, refugees who have left their homeland because of conflict situations. [Question] Humanitarian aid is usually given for a specific, short period of time, but the factors you have mentioned will apparentlyprevail, regrettably, for a long time to come in our country. Shall we seek aid in the future also? [Answer]In the difficult transitional period that Russia is experiencing, millions of people are in need of social support. The government is making an utmost effort to alleviate their situation, but we do not have enough funds. As of June, the deficit in the budget earmarked for social programs constituted about 150 million rubles, and this does not include health care or expenses related to migration. We are trying to bridge the gap at the expense of humanitarian aid. For example, deliveries, in the form of aid, of American grain will enable us to get about 25 billion rubles to support the needy. In this regard, we are negotiating with other governments as well. So that humanitarian aid to Russia is simply a necessity for the time being. [Question] Does it really reach the people for whom it is intended and to a full measure? [Answer]There are representatives of different departments, nongovernment organizations and clergy in our Commission. There are local humanitarian aid headquarters. Administration heads are personally responsible for its distribution. In recent years direct contacts are developing, and we are encouraging this: hospital to hospital, city to city, and foreign children's institutions to ours. [Question] Still, there are quite a few reports, including some in the German mass media, to the effect that some of the aid is being stolen and sold through speculative entities. [Answer] Humanitarian aid from foreign countries is handled in two ways: it is sent directly to the needy, or it is sold. For example, you cannot deliver grain from door to door, and the proceeds from it go to pensioners, students and school lunches. That was the case, for example, with the 155,000 tons of food received through the Commission of European Communities. In Moscow, the proceeds from selling it constituted 4.6 billion rubles and in St. Petersburg, 2.5 billion. The moneys went to the needy. We proceeded similarly with the 18,000 tons of American butter, 100,000 tons of Taiwan rice and several other forms of humanitarian aid. I should like to stress that, in principle, we coordinate our actions with the donors who deliver these products to us. Our aim is to have part of the humanitarian aid used ``for the future,'' for development of production. [Question] The Commission does not have its own shops. Through what channels is such aid implemented? [Answer] We are making a careful study of the capabilities of those who express the wish to participate in handling products received as aid. Sale is categorically prohibited without the Commission's special permission. The entire process is reflected in documentation, and we monitor it through the pertinent departments. [Question] Nevertheless, one can find products obviously received in the form of humanitarian aid in numerous stands loaded with alcoholic beverages and smoking materials. [Answer] We have checked this repeatedly. We learned that the products are offered to the stand owners by those who received them as aid in order to use the proceeds for other, more needed items. We are much more concerned with the instances of direct stealing. [Question] Is there much theft? [Answer]The losses from theft constituted about 35 million rubles. Of course, this is very sad and outrageous. But the losses related to selling items of humanitarian aid are much lower, as compared to the total aid which amounted to about 35 billion rubles last year, than in ordinary trade. It is nonsense that the commercial structures supposedly get rich from this aid. Anyone who sells products with our permission sets prices that are slightly below market prices for speedy sale, and is compensated only for inevitable expenses, for example, transport. The Commission, however, does not spend a single ruble of deductions from humanitarian aid to maintain its staff of 18 people. [Question] However, you are the target of unfavorable criticism? [Answer] I wish to note that humanitarian aid is often used in Russia as an arena for political battle. What sins have not been placed upon us! However, recently, a commission of the Ministry of Finance Control Administration failed to find any abuses in our performance. [Question]I should like to hope that soon potentially wealthy Russia will no longer have to seek help in foreign countries.... [Answer] We are experiencing a very difficult period, but there is no turning back. The road ahead toward implementing reforms, with consideration of present needs and interests of the socially less protected strata of the population, should ultimately lead to success.
