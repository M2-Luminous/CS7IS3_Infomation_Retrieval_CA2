A communique issued today said Italy will also send first aid medical supplies in coordination with the World Health Organization. As announced Saturday by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, the head of the emergency intervention unit at the ministry's Department for Development Cooperation, Minister Vitaliano Napoleone, and Agostino Miozzo, a medical expert on the department staff, arrived in Sarajevo yesterday. The Italian surgeons will work in the main Sarajevo general hospital, the Kosovo Hospital, in conjunction with WHO and will be equipped with medical kits sent over. Ten days ago, the communique disclosed, Doctor Miozzo was in Sarajevo where he conferred with Bosnian authorities who requested pediatric surgeons and specialists in facial and jaw surgery, neurosurgeons, and those with experience in rehabilitation surgery and war wounds. Following the arrival yesterday of the doctor and the chief of the emergency unit, the two Italians made arrangements for sending twelve of the victims of the Saturday shelling to Italy, where they will be placed under the care of the Social Affairs Service of the premier's office. (Reported today in the central Adriatic port city of Ancona, near the Falconare Marittima Air Base, were preparations for the arrival of a Canadian Air Force Hercules C-130 transport plane with 15 of the people wounded in Sarajevo Saturday. Accompanying them on the flight, conducted for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, will be an unknown number of relatives of the victims. (The first six, all between ages 17 and 25, were scheduled to leave Sarajevo in the early afternoon and the second group some time later in the day, the Social Affairs Service and Italian Red Cross said. (It was also learned that an 11-year-old, Vladan Rajcevic, who was among those wounded in the marketplace, was still in critical condition in Ancona's Salesi Hospital where he is under treatment for a perforated lung. The boy's parents, Danilo and Retina Rajcevic, deaf mutes, arrived here yesterday.)
