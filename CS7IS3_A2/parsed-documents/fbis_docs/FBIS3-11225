Only in learning how to negotiate at the regional level, the Argentine senator said, will Latin American nations have the opportunity to "impose their rights and defend their production," including in a general manner the possibility of joining a free trade agreement, which should include not only North America, but all the Americas. "It is necessary for Latin America to elevate the sights of its negotiating capability when it is a question of imposing its rights and defending its regional production, where financial flows have the advantage over the flow of trade products," Rubeo added. "It is necessary," he added, "for Latin America to impose its competitive advantages in continuing the fight for our rights to trade regional production, without obstacles, in order to correct the region's trade imbalance, which continues to be financed with foreign debts." "The eventual joining of a more ample integration process that would link the entire American continent in the immediate future, for example the economic area that has been created by NAFTA, requires a capability for negotiations that can only be acquired at a regional level," he said. Rubeo termed encouraging the advances in the negotiations to bring in line the Andean Group, the Group of Three, the Latin American Economic System, and the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). The Argentine senator presented his discourse to some 30 congressmen from the 24 countries making up Parlatino, who began their meeting today to begin the work of the three new committees. The meeting, which is being held at the organization's permanent seat in Sao Paulo, will conclude 18 March. With the installation today of the Subregional, State, Municipal, and Provincial Affairs Committee; the Economic Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Debt Affairs Committee; and the Social Debt Committee, Parlatino now has 16 functioning committees. According to Rubeo there are now only two of the 18 committees left to be installed, while the Narcotics Committee has progressed most in its tasks. This committee has already prepared an extradition and repression treaty against illegal chemicals (precursors for the manufacture of drugs), which must be studied and voted on by the congresses of all Latin American nations so that it can be implemented. In his address Rubeo referred to the adverse social economic conditions that are being experienced by Latin America, which are a threat to democracy. The Argentine senator stated that the institutionalization of regional integration into trade blocs "expands the support bases of our democracies, and creates power resources for each subregion and for Latin America as a whole."
