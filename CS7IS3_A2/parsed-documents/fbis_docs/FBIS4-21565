The Minister remarked that this subject needs to be explained and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue that the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it. [passage omitted] The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section (C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13 are applied successfully to Iraq, it would be the beginning of their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet done anything on this score. The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons. We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a range of more than 150 km. The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also the machines and factories connected with their production. Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and would be in no position to produce anything. The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people -- will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one year. The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning, first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its ability for development, and its right to self-determination, which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles I mentioned. The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people, I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the United Nations and which are now considered documents of the Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said: Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850 kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was all. They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: We want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we told them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium from ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework, as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project, plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific research efforts that are connected to the program. Our position is the same as that of any other nation or state that is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the engineering support for them. The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993. They continued in September, October, and November of that year, and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we have the document because it is a now Security Council document -- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some figures, because we have them in our records and they are also documented with the Security Council. The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records, visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile: 10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30 al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the 24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want to see the documents. The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents, which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing these statements, although we had a signed document between us in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all requirements. When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided that he wanted more information and that what we had given him was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior of the others was really bad and provocative. The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from the United States for purely scientific research, not for biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private sector laboratories. Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have. Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile specialists. The minister said: The United States continued to play the same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for several weeks. The American lie was exposed. The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then they said: We want to see if these documents are original or recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments, although we are sure they are original. We will take them to inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said: Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected. I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior. They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we received information about possible leftover chemical weapons that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They located an object stuck into ground. They walked over cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode. When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell. I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully, and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are making a mockery of us. The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since 1991. The minister added: You may not have heard some of the remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence. The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted any justification in order to deceive the world about the aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen. The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have. You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures. Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing. They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and for what purpose. The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse. They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose. Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others, and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the monitoring system details. The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything. Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't you find out? You have the Special Commission and the experience. You have used everything, including espionage aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said: Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar. A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine, let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed. So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines, although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our minimum right. We have been patient with you until now. The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs. Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred? Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly, according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right.
