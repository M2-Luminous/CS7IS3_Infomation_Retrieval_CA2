The statement warned that if the Japanese Government authorities, far from showing a sincere repentance and making compensation for the past war of aggression and colonial rule, continue suppressing Korean nationals, they will face a stern judgement by the 70 million Koreans in the North and South and overseas. The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon denounces the high-handed suppression by the Japanese Government authorities and demands a proper apology and compensation, the statement stressed.
