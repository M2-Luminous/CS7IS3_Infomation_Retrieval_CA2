Dear brothers; you are our kinsfolk. You have our appreciation for holding fast to your dear and precious land. You have come to commiserate with us on the death of my mother, may her soul rest in peace. The Hashemite family has always had the privilege of being close to Palestine, its people, its cause, and their rights. The next generations will, God willing, follow the same path. If I say that, for us, you are family and brothers, I am stating a fact. I, and all of us here, thank you and appreciate your gesture. When you are in Amman, you are at home. I thank you for the kind words I heard from you. Please convey to all Arab brothers our love and appreciation. I hope we will be able to see you here among us more often. I beseech God that we are at the threshold of a new era under which the Palestinian people enjoy their rights on their national soil and in which all parties live in peace, so all concerned can lead secure, dignified, and free lives and build for the benefit of future generations what we have been deprived of. We take pride in our brotherhood. We will always be there for you. You are most welcome here. Give my greetings, love, and appreciation to all the kinsfolk and brothers on whose behalf you are visiting us to cheer us in our grief. In any case, such is life. What has befallen us is God's will and our fate. Thanks be to God, a lucky human being is one who leaves behind the memory of his good actions. We pray to God that we will have been among those who reached out and were generous toward others, so we may have a clear conscience and serve our kinsfolk and do all that we can to help both present and future generations. Once more, I thank you; May God's peace and blessing be upon you. I wish you a happy stay here among your kinsfolk and brothers.
