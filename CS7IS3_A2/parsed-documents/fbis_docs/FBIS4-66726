He said this abnormal situation is the result of the subsidies the government is paying to meet society's consumer needs. Rafsanjani said: Overall, the government is paying 600 billion tumans, or in other words, one-fifth of the total general budget, as subsidies. In this figure, revenues from oil sales that could have been obtained at the OPEC price ($13 per barrel) but were not, were not included. Rafsanjani noted that in Iran 1.4 million barrels of oil and 800,000 barrels of gasoil is consumed daily and provided to the consumer at the cost of production. He said: "We have no revenue from it" and that the money collected is only enough to meet the costs of refining, shipping, and distribution. Rafsanjani divided government subsidies into the "unjust" and "just" categories and said: The classes with high incomes use some subsidies in the same way that the low-income classes use them, and this is not "just." In the midst of this, the newspapers supporting continued subsidies write that since 80 percent of the people of Iran are living below the poverty line, 16 percent of the budget is being spent "in the right direction," and only 4 percent of it reaches the wealthy in the form of subsidies. In any case, the elimination of subsidies will mean that a new wave of high prices will engulf Iran's society. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: While in France the government has an annual income of $40 billion from energy, the Islamic Republic of Iran sells oil products to consumers at the cost of production, and it derives no revenue from it. Rafsanjani said: Not counting the price of oil, every year 600 billion tumans is spent on subsidies, and this is one-fifth of the nation's total budget. The president of the Islamic Republic said: Most of the subsidies are spent on basic goods such as wheat, sugar, vegetable shortening, rice, and meat. This comes to 300 billion tumans and is half the government's total subsidies. He said these kinds of subsidies are a kind of "oppression" to the nation because of the fact that they are used the same way by both rich and poor. "Unfortunately," he said, "we perpetrate this oppression that spends the public's money for people who do not need it." While enumerating the subsidized items, Rafsanjani said: The government pays 40 billion tumans to the Imam's Aid Committee, 40 billion tumans to the Martyr Foundation, 5.5 billion tumans to insurance for "vulnerable" classes, and 1.5 billion tumans to help former prisoners of war. He said this help is of the "just" type. He said the subsidies for bread and fuel are among the "unjust" ones, because both rich and poor use them the same way. Rafsanjani gives 21 billion tumans in aid for the government's pilgrimage trip, but he said nothing about whether that is just or not. The pilgrimage, according to the scripture, is incumbent upon those who are "able" to make it. On the other hand the Tehran media, which is opposed to eliminating the subsidies, wrote in criticism of what Rafsanjani said that in view of the fact that 80 percent of the people are below the poverty line, 16 percent of the subsidies reach the needy classes. The same newspaper writes, based on the president of the republic's analysis, in the new year one must expect higher prices and more pressure on the people (the same 80 percent) without anything being done to counteract this pressure. They conclude: "Of course if the elimination of subsidies leads to job creation and production, it is possible the people will welcome it." However, economic experts do not consider the creation of jobs and incomes for the vulnerable classes to be that likely in today's Iran.
