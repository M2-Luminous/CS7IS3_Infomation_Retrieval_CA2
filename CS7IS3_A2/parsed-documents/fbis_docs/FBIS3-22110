The objective of the project is the protection of the environment of the city, famous for its cultural and historical interest, including its excellent museum. The project will also have an education component. Thus far the "Lvia" Project has 690 employees. They are engaged in reforestation in the hills round the city, the improvement of roads, restoration of the "Rozafa" Castle, as well as work on hospitals, schools, libraries, and the city's museum. "There is a good beginning," the director of Caritas for north Albania, Gjon Markagjoni, told ATA, adding that in the future the project will also cover the district of [word indistinct] and the communes of Lac and Vau i Dejes. The additional activity will increase the number of the workers by several hundred. Three billion lira have been allocated by Italian bishoprics and the Italian Government to this joint undertaking. This sum will finance the Lvia Project for only several months, but, according to Markagjoni, the European Union will contribute to that project in the near future. The EU financing will permit the employment of additional workers and an expansion of project activities. Angjelin Muzhani, a Caritas representative, said that future plans for the project will also cover agriculture, especially vineyards.
