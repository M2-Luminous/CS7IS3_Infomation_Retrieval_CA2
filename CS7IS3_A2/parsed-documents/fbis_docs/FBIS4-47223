The migration processes occurring in the republic today and their prospects are described for PANORAMA by Gazis Yesmukanov, chairman of the republic Migration Department. "The Emigration Act was adopted in the republic in June 1992, and the need for the creation of a department to execute this law arose. Originally the department was called upon to assist the resettlement of those compatriots that were living abroad and that wished to return to their historical home. "Today, when the process of population migration is becoming a most urgent problem of the state, the department is dealing with problems of population migration as a whole. "The departure of significant numbers of the population from Kazakhstan had been observed as of the 1960's. But, this process has assumed considerable proportions in recent years. The migration result last year swallowed up, it may be said, the natural population increase and the influx of population into the republic: The population of Kazakhstan declined by 60,000. This phenomenon cannot be called normal, and it is with good reason that it is causing concern in the leadership of the republic. "The greatest outflow of the population is observed in such oblasts as Almaty, Mangistau, Pavlodar, and Karaganda, that is, in oblasts where industry is most developed. The population of German nationality, in the main, is leaving oblasts with a developed agriculture--Kokshetau and Akmolina." [Nartova] What, in your view, is the main reason for the population's departure? [Yesmukanov] Officers of the department conducted a special opinion poll in this connection. The results showed that the main reason for the departure of the majority of families is the economic instability, the uncontrolled prices, and the decline in the living standard. Practically all the people see no prospect of the situation improving. In addition, many are leaving to reunite with relatives that live outside Kazakhstan. According to the poll data, 25 percent of Russians and 70 percent of Germans are contemplating leaving Kazakhstan. Some 369,000 persons left Kazakhstan in 1992. But I should mention that a certain reduction in the numbers of those leaving was observed in 1993. A program with which we hope to contain and regulate the spontaneous process of population migration and to ascertain the reasons for the outflow of population, of the able-bodied population with higher education particularly, is being devised in the department at this time. [Nartova] You took part in the international conference on the problems of refugees in Moscow, tell us about it, please. [Yesmukanov] The conference was held during 6-10 June, and problems of refugees and involuntary resettlers on the territory of the former USSR and also the prospects of an alleviation of their position were discussed. It took place under the aegis of the International Peace Foundation, it was opened by Anatoliy Karpov, president of the International Association of Peace Foundations, and representatives of the UN High Commission for Refugees and also leaders of migration services of all 15 former republics of the USSR were present. As I have mentioned, the problems of the refugees are connected primarily with a violation of human rights and infringement of the rights of the individual on national grounds. Attention was paid to the flash points and the various conflicts flaring up increasingly on the territory of the former USSR and also to the significance of UN peacekeeping missions in these regions. The summary document was an appeal to the heads of all states for the adoption of all measures to ensure human rights and liberties and suppress all manifestations of aggressive nationalism and racial and religious enmity. [Nartova] Speaking of the containment of migration processes, were any agreements reached with Russia for it is there, after all, that the main flow of emigrants from Kazakhstan heads? [Yesmukanov] Truly, Russians constitute 52 percent of those leaving the republic. And much will depend on our relations with Russia. I visited the Migration Office in Moscow. It has accumulated much valuable experience, and we hope that contacts between our departments will develop successfully. In March 1994, Presidents Yeltsin and Nazarbayev signed a memorandum on the basic principles of the solution of questions connected with citizenship and the legal status of citizens of the Kazakh Republic living in Russia and Russian citizens living on the territory of Kazakhstan. The document specifies a number of measures whose preparation and elaboration are geared to the resolution of problems in this sphere. Work in this area is being performed currently both in Russia and in Kazakhstan. [Nartova] What, in your opinion, does the republic government need to do to reduce the number of emigrants? [Yesmukanov] Primarily, to improve the economic situation in the state and to stabilize prices first and foremost. It is then essential to make a number of amendments to the Language Act, including to adopt a provision on development of the Russian language.
