There have already been such attempts, and they came to nothing. As someone who has studied sociology, I consider that an accord, if it is possible, has to be the expression of the will of the specific social, political, and national forces which exist in society. Otherwise you can sign documents, you can even get on friendly terms with one another, but it won't bring accord because society itself will be endlessly upset by conflict. A mechanism therefore has to be found whereby this will may be expressed and formalized. I would think we need to three to five statewide priorities around which everyone could and must be united. Outside of those priorities, you may argue and counter each other all you like, but these three to five positions designed to preserve the state, implement reforms, and avoid local or large-scale civil clashes must be acknowledged by everyone. Eveyone talks about accord today, but the word is given different meanings. And everyone wants his understanding of it to be adopted. Therefore what is actually often involved here is not the securing of accord but a struggle to secure one's own position. We need to stop fighting for our own position and try to find expression for the will of the people to that accord. I think that the president's Message, where there is an attempt to give priority to strengthening the Russian state system, could be a basis for this. The government program could be a basis. And the memorandum adopted by the State Duma and the Federation Council appeal likewise. I have proposed before and do so now that there be convened an assembly of the peoples and citizens of Russia of which well-known figures from politics and culture, deputies, representatives of national movements, representatives of the regions, trade unions, and so forth will be members. And a memorandum, a charter of national accord, which will define priorities enabling civil peace to be maintained in the country could be adopted as the basis of all the documents I have cited.
