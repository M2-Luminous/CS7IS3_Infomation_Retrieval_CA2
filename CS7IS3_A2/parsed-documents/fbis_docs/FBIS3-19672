There we met with Maris Budovski, who is the president of the Assembly of Baltic Countries. [De Fossa] How long has there been cooperation between the assemblies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania? [Budovski] The Assembly of Baltic Countries as such only dates back to 1990, but our cooperation is much older than that. In 1919, the united military forces of Estonia and Latvia fought the Red Army. Subsequently, there was cooperation between the foreign ministers of the three states. However, I would like to point out that, while we were able to resist Soviet totalitarianism, it was mainly because of our traditions, our folklore. This may be a unique phenomenon. The dance and singing festivals have brought together, and continue to regularly bring together, tens of thousands of participants from our three countries. This has contributed toward binding us together; it is something that could perhaps be called the "singing revolution." A Council of Ministers for the Baltic States? [De Fossa] Is there cooperation between your governments? [Budovski] The ministers cooperate with their counterparts in the other Baltic states. This is especially true today with the defense ministers. During the session held in Tallin late last year, the Assembly of Baltic Countries adopted a resolution calling on the governments of the three Baltic states to set up a Council of Ministers for the Baltic States. We also organized joint maneuvers. Of course, we only have very limited military resources, but in doing so we wanted to express our wish not to see a repeat of what happened in 1940. [De Fossa] What are you expecting from the Benelux? [Budovski] We are looking for cooperation because we have common interests. I am thinking, for example, of cooperation in terms of harbor facilities. We have excellent harbors, which are very well equipped. So do the Benelux countries. Why do we not organize a union at this level, given the importance of the East European market and the fact that the gauge of our railroads is the same as that used in the Benelux countries? [De Fossa] You have already established close relations with the Nordic countries. [Budovski] Yes, these are very warm relations. We have a sea in common, the Baltic. In 1992, together with the Council of Nordic Countries, we concluded an agreement which is helping us resolve very specific problems. In the energy sector, Russia often demands prices which are higher than the market prices. Consequently, we are turning toward the free market and we are thinking that as far as energy is concerned, we will undoubtedly find a solution in Norway. [De Fossa] Why are there still Russian troops in Estonia and Latvia? [Budovski] The Russians do not want to answer that question. [De Fossa] How many are there? [Budovski] There are still 2,500 Russian troops in Estonia and some 11,000 in Latvia. Sometimes the Russians say that this presence guarantees Russia's security, and sometimes they put forward the argument of the cost of social support measures in the event that these troops are repatriated. Another argument they use is that their presence is supposedly required to defend the rights of the Russian minority in Latvia. In fact, many Russians themselves are wondering why they are still in our country. Yet Russia cannot manage to renounce its imperialism. The Russians feel that they have been invested with a mission vis-a-vis us: They think they have to save us! There is a preliminary agreement concerning the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. However, one part of Latvian public opinion feels that the signing of an agreement is not necessary given the fact that the presence of these troops is unlawful. As for the Russians, they say that it is not their army, but rather the army of the now defunct Soviet Union which is responsible for the occupation! In fact, we were colonized. They wanted to eliminate us, and that was the doing of officers who are now retired and still living in the Baltic countries. [De Fossa] So for you the war is just now ending. [Budovski] For us, in fact, the war has not yet ended because there are still foreign troops on our soil.
