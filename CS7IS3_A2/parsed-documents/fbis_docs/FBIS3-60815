Speaking to the "Mykonos" Investigation Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, he used this description to make a fine differentiation regarding the dangerousness of Iranian Kazem Darabi. Darabi is currently on trial at the Berlin Higher Court for having been, as an agent of the Iranian intelligence service VEVAK, the wire puller of the attack which killed four leading Kurdish-Iranian opposition politicians on 17 September 1992. According to Annussek's assessment after the deed, his office considered Darabi worth being watched before the attack, but he had not been assessed as a "practicing terrorist" -- that is why his observation was ignored for months. Eckart Werthebach, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], also did not have "such an assessment of Darabi as a dangerous terrorist" until the day of the attack. In the meantime, doubts about this assessment of the situation by the security organs are mounting. The security organs might have come to different results and could have protected Sadegh Sharafkandi, chairman of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan in Iran, and his three associates better if they had better coordinated and exploited their own sources. Thus, as early as on 16 April 1992 Kazem Darabi's foreigner's file was "urgently" requested by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA]. According to a BKA letter, which has been obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG, at that time the officials were investigating, upon request by the chief federal prosecutor, several persons "on the suspicion of attempting to bring about a dynamite explosion and of attempted murder." The chief federal prosecutor's office did not want to tell DIE TAGESZEITUNG about the background of the investigations, but the fact that Darabi's foreigner's file was requested leads to the conclusion that he was considered a suspect by the investigators. At this time his foreigner's file was checked in the Senat's internal administration, but none of the officials involved suspected anything as a result of the request. In the Committee Greens Deputy Renate Kuenast is trying to clarify the background of a BfV report, according to which at the beginning of 1992 several persons, including a Kazem D., in a Hamburg mosque prepared attacks on Israeli institutions in the FRG. The curiosity of Kuenast's colleague from the Free Democratic Party of Germany, Rolf-Peter Lange, is also directed at a list with about a dozen names of persons who were classified by the BKA as dangerous in the field of foreigners' extremism in Germany at the same time; this list once again included Darabi. Even though the BfV told their colleagues in Berlin already in January 1992 that they had suspended the monitoring of Darabi's telephone and had recommended that the Land Office initiate operative measures, these measures were not initiated. Allegedly, it was impossible to find an interpreter who spoke Persian. Telephone monitoring was approved only two weeks after the attack. However, even during this "security gap" in the months before the attack, the scene did not remain unobserved, as it has turned out now. In an internal note to the chief federal prosecutor (Az.: VC 11-247-S-350 070/93), the BfV reports: "In addition to Darabi and his Berlin scene, members of the Iranian intelligence services were also directly involved in the preparations for the attack. Thus, members of the Iranian intelligence services were in Germany before the attack and spied out the site of the attack as well as escape routes." The eight-page document by the BfV also reports on the intensive contacts that Darabi cultivated with Iranian diplomats in Germany. Thus, he had ties to Hassan Djavady, who worked at the Iranian Embassy in Bonn until October 1989. According to the note, he is "an employee of the Iranian intelligence service MOIS, who was responsible in the FRG for, among other things, the observation and spying out of the Iranian opposition." According to BfV findings, this task was "taken over by MOIS employee Morteza Gholami, who works at the Iranian Embassy in Bonn." In addition, Darabi also has contact with members of the Iranian intelligence service in Berlin. As the BfV noted, on 24 April 1991 Darabi received "the order by Consul Mahmud Amani-Farani, who works at the Iranian Consulate General in Berlin, to collect information about a member of the `Association of Kurdish Students Abroad.'" Because of this spying order, the BfV think that "one has to assume" that Aman-Farani "is also working for an intelligence service." "Apart from the consul general," Aman-Farani is Darabi's most important contact in the Iranian Consulate General. According to findings by the Iranian opposition alliance "National Resistance Council," the Iranian intelligence service has meanwhile found ways to keep in regular contact with Darabi in prison. This week Javad Dabiran, the spokesman of the Resistance Council, voiced a number of accusations against individual diplomats. According to Dabiran, he wants to give the missing evidence for these accusations to the German security authorities. As Dabiran said, the wire pullers are sitting on the third floor of the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, where there is the department of the VEVAK intelligence service. Until two weeks ago, this department was headed by Alireza Haghighian, who, camouflaged as an Embassy attache, is the highest-ranking VEVAK agent in Germany. In the meantime, he has returned to the intelligence service headquarters in Tehran. In addition, Dabiran accuses two Embassy second secretaries, Ali Dschafari Meschki and Hamidreza Ghalibaf, of having "dealt intensively," as VEVAK agents, "with the case (of the Mykonos murder -- the editor)" over the past weeks. The opposition politician claims that one of the agents who are responsible for keeping contact with Darabi is a certain Farhad D. Already in 1982 D. was involved, together with Darabi, in an attack on opposition students in Mainz; according to BfV findings, he has "ties with the Iranian intelligence service." Together with Bahman B., the two are "among the leading functionaries of the `Union of Islamic Students in Europe [USIA].'" The USIA is a "collection pond of the followers of the Iranian regime in the European countries." According to the BfV report, B. has worked "for the Iranian intelligence service MOIS" since about 1989. His wife reportedly works at the Iranian Consulate in Berlin. These intensive activities of the Iranian diplomats were probably not unknown to State Minister in the Chancellor's Office Bernd Schmidbauer, the supreme head of the German intelligence services. According to Dabiran's assessment, the "Mykonos" case played a decisive role in Schmidbauer's contentious talk with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Fallahian. Actually, on Thursday Schmidbauer should have answered questions of the Investigation Committee about the role that the "Mykonos" case played in his contacts with Iran. However, the appointment was canceled, since he had allegedly not yet received permission by the Cabinet to make a statement. Another appointment for questioning him has now been made for January.
