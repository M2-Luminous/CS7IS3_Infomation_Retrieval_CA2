The delegation returned last night, and today the head of the delegation briefed reporters on the high-level contacts during which matters pertaining to the activation of Armenian-Iranian ties were discussed. Mr. Arutyunyan said that the construction of the bridge [over the Araks River] will also start on the Iranian bank of the river. A new highway to Tehran is being planned, in which the Armenian workers will participate. Agreements were concluded on expanding the volume of future work. The Turkmenistan-Iran-Armenia power line was also discussed. The sides considered it necessary to activate the border trade. However, at present, the most important issue is regulating the border crossing for civilians. The Iranian side was also interested in Armenia's information on the Iranian plane crash. Taking this opportunity, Mr. Arutyunyan also briefed us on the information available to him. [Arutyunyan] In order to assess and arrive at conclusions at least the following six questions must be answered: 1. What should the relevant Moscow services have done but failed to do? As already documented, 50 minutes into the flight from Moscow airport, the plane sharply lost altitude by 400 meters because of [words indistinct] near [name indistinct] settlement. It refused to return to Moscow airport and continued its flight. It must be clearly determined what the technical condition of the plane was before departing Moscow [words indistinct]. 2. What should the relevant services in Georgia have done but failed to do, or did them incorrectly? This too must be determined, because according to records, the air traffic controllers contacted the plane and gave it instructions and fixed its coordinates. There are points here that need to be further clarified. There is a need for a specialized investigation of these records. 3. What should the relevant Armenian services have done but failed to do, or did them incorrectly? According to our information, the Armenian services were in constant contact with the Georgian services and with the plane through a Russian plane [words indistinct]. We must find definitive answers to all these questions. 4. What could the relevant Karabakh services have done but failed to do? 5. What should the relevant Azerbaijani services have done but failed to do [words indistinct]? 6. And finally, what should have been done but was not done properly or was done incorrectly by the plane's crew [words indistinct]? A final conclusion can be reached only after finding answers to these six questions. Having familiarized itself with our position and [words indistinct], the Iranian side concluded that the investigative work should continue to find answers to all these questions, and based on these answers, to arrive at a conclusion without any intention of using this accident for political purposes or for [words indistinct]. [Gazaryan] At the end of the news conference, the Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan replied to reporters' questions.
