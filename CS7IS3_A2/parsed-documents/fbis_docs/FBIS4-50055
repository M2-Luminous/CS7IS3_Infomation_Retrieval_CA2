The conference reported on the situation emerged since the implementation of the new financial and tax system, set forth some policies and methods for solving some specific problems, and studied and arranged the next-step financial and tax work. Liu Xilin, vice governor of the provincial government, made an important speech. On the provincial economic situation, Liu Xilin pointed out: Since the beginning of this year, according to the requirements and arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, our province has grasped favorable opportunities, deepened reform, expanded the scale of opening up, promoted development, maintained stability, and continued to promote the development of the national economy on the basis of the faster economic growth rate of last year. A good rural economic situation rarely seen before has emerged. The investment scale is controlled strictly within the plan. The construction of key projects is further strengthened. The scale of opening up has ceaselessly been expanded. Noticeable progress has been made in inviting businessmen, bringing in foreign capital, and developing foreign export trade. Revenues have been increased. The credit scale has been expanded. The financial situation is stable. However, worries still exist. The industrial production growth rate was changed from the faster development in 1993 to a slow speed in the first quarter of this year. Thus, great difficulties have been added on enterprises, enterprises' economic results tend to decline, and the burdens on price hikes are rather high. On the issue of how to treat the new situation and new problems cropping up since the implementation of the new financial and tax system, Liu Xilin pointed out: The general situation over the past four months has been good since the implementation of the new financial and tax system. No bigger fluctuation has been created by the reform of the tax system. The increase in the revenues has been maintained. Affected by the fact that the implementation of the new financial and tax system is related to the readjustment of the interests of various fronts as well as an all-round and integrated structural reform, it is unavoidable that different trades, enterprises, and products have different burdens and different changes. Besides, the new tax system should embody equal tax burdens and the state industrial policy requirements to promote equal competition. Some enterprises that used to rely on the protections of tax reductions and profit concessions for development will lose their preferential conditions. Simultaneously, the industries that should be readjusted according to the state industrial policies and the enterprises with unreasonable economic scales, poor quality, and high production costs will naturally come across serious challenges and difficulties. We must be sober-headed to treat the problems in this regard. We should also understand that problems of this or that kind still exist in course of implementing the new system due to the fact that the new system is being replaced by the old one. Some large and medium-sized enterprises' tax burdens rise by a big margin. Meanwhile, with the strain on capital, the decline in economic results, and the changes in markets, enterprises actually have great difficulties. Both the state and the province have paid full attention to this and have studied or are studying measures to solve the problems in this aspect. Liu Xilin particularly pointed out: Although the financial and tax revenues have kept on increasing since the implementation of the new financial and tax system, the situation in the implementation of the new situation is not ideal enough. The revenues in the first quarter of this year increased by 10.5 percent over the same period of last year and accounted for 15.7 percent of the annual plan. The industrial and commercial tax revenues in this period increased by 3.4 percent and accounted for 14.3 percent of the annual plan. The financial and tax situation is comparatively grim. This aspect is related to the current economic situation. Simultaneously, the people have prejudice against the new financial and tax system. A very important content of the new system is to guarantee the 1993 vested financial resources of the localities. Although the consumption taxes belong to the central revenues and the value added taxes are divided between the central financial department and the localities, the central financial department do not obtain the portions covered in the base figures of consumption taxes and value added taxes. That is, the portions covered in the base figures will totally be obtained by the localities. If the localities do not reach the 1993 levels this year, the state should reduce the 1993 base figures. In this way, both the balance between this year's revenues and expenditures and the development of the province as a whole and all cities and counties will be affected. It is extremely wrong that we continue to follow the habitual methods of putting the collection of the local fixed revenues before that of value added taxes, as stipulated in the previous old system. This must be changed. The governments at various levels, all departments concerned, and enterprises should seek unity of thinking, comprehensively implement the new financial and tax system, realistically strengthen the collection and management of tax revenues, try every possible means to support production, specifically carry out the system for responsibility for fulfillment of fixed work, and ensure a balance between this year's revenues and expenditures. The provincial government urged that the financial and tax departments at various levels should foster the idea of supporting production and positively promote increases in production and revenues. Particularly in the course of reforming the financial and tax system, we should realistically strengthen the coordinate service for enterprises, help enterprise resolve practical difficulties, timely implement the state financial and tax preferential policies, and study ways for solving some specific problems. The financial departments at various levels should mainly concentrate turnover funds on the current industrial production. The tax departments should find out ways to reduce burdens for the enterprises with special difficulties according to the "tax law" and timely report to higher levels the problems that cannot be solved by themselves. According to some state tax policies and in line with the provincial specific situation, the conference defined 13 specific policy measures for supporting the development of enterprises.
