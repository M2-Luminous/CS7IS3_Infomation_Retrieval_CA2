In this context, the U.S. Senate resolution on the ratification of START I is more comprehensive and prescient. However, given the present situation of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shevtsov emphasized, it would be the most realistic thing if the nonproliferation treaty implementation had the following sequence: Meeting conditions that are included in the treaty so that START I obtains validity, exchanging ratification instruments, and then commencing the treaty's practical implementation, which would result in the complete removal of nuclear weapons from our territory.
