FBIS4-48820 "drafr103_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Justice Minister: `No Amnesty Without Disclosure' Justice Minister: `No Amnesty Without Disclosure' MB2705103394 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1011 GMT 27 May 94 MB2705103394 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- While there would be no Nuremburg trial, revenge or witch-hunt of those who committed human rights violations in the past, he wished to give the assurance that there would be no cover-up or sweeping under the carpet, the minister of justice, Mr Dullah Omar, said on Friday. Speaking during debate on the president's state of the nation address, he said: "There will be no amnesty without disclosure." (applause) It had to be made possible for all South Africans to come to terms with the past with dignity. The Constitution laid down certain conditions for amnesty for the period from October 1990 to October 6, 1993, and the last official cut-off date mentioned had been December 5, 1993. The post-December 6 period was not covered by draft legislation now being prepared, Mr Omar said. A proposed commission of truth and reconciliation should avoid any connotation which suggested revenge or a witch-hunt. Amnesty should be accompanied by acknowledgement and disclosure. Ordinary crimes will not be covered, and victims should receive reparation and compensation. Mr Omar said the views of all parties represented in the government of national unity would be taken into account in the process, as well as those of parties not represented. The ANC's opposition on the death penalty remained and legislation would be presented in due course. In the meantime, the moratorium on the death sentence would remain. Mr Omar said he spent sleepless nights thinking about the 400 people sitting on death row in South Africa (including the former self-governing territories), and this matter would have to be dealt with "expeditiously". Just so would the question of children in prison. This problem was compounded by many children not having homes or parents to go to, and by the fact that many juveniles had been convicted of extremely serious crimes of violence. "I cannot see them being released to places where similar crimes could be committed," Mr Omar said. Violence against women also had to be addressed. He concluded: "Much work needs to be done to ensure that justice becomes truly accessible to all our people." At the start of his speech, Mr Omar said he shared the joy of others at the "scourge of apartheid" having been removed from South Africa's society. But, he warned, "we should not be carried away by the euphoria of the moment." His one great apprehension was that in five years' time someone might write about the country: "not yet uhuru [Swahili for freedom]." For this reason, the reconstruction and development programme had to succeed.
