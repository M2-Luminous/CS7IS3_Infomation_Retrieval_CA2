According to exclusive information available to AL-'ARABI, the reason is this: The Sudanese opposition radio station has begun its transmission and is now heard in Khartoum. The Sudanese Government holds Cairo responsible. However, according to information, the opposition radio is being hired from an overseas country for $500 per hour, is transmitting to Sudan through satellite, and Cairo has absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact, Egypt had rejected numerous requests from the Sudanese opposition to allow the radio to transmit from Cairo, and this has worsened the relations between the two sides for several months. The radio was launched by the personal efforts of some academic and military elements independent of the Sudanese opposition group. Those elements tried to activate the opposition in light of the poor performance of the National Sudanese Grouping as a result of disagreements between the Ummah Party and the Sudanese Communist Party over the grouping's internal structure. The disagreements also led to differences between the two main parties, the Ummah Party and the Democratic Unionist Party [DUP], and this necessitated the presence of DUP Chairman Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani in Cairo to try to contain the crisis. The danger of the opposition radio, which began two hours of transmission daily, is that it ends the isolation of the Sudanese citizen and obstructs the regime's media hegemony. This is a threat to the regime itself, especially given the worsening domestic problems. [passage omitted]
