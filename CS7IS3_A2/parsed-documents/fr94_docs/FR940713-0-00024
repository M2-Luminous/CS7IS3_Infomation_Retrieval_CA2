SUMMARY: This document corrects errors in the final regulations for the Federal Family Education Loan Program published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1994 (59 FR 25744). The document published on May 17, 1994 contained various corrections and technical changes to the final regulations published on December 18, 1992 (57 FR 60280). However, several amendments included in the May 17, 1994 document did not reflect the publication of intervening amendments. This document therefore corrects the May 17, 1994 final regulations by removing these amendments. EFFECTIVE DATE: This correction is effective May 17, 1994.
