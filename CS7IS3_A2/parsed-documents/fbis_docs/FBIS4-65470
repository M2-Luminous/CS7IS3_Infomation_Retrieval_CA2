"That criticism is completely wrong in that I do not oppose EU membership in principle. And I do not feel that I oppose it at all," Vayrynen says. He also denies that a power struggle is going in the Center Party between him and the party's chairman, Prime Minister Esko Aho. "I am not competing with Esko Aho in any way at all, of course. He is party chairman; I am not, and I am not trying to be. I am a member of the Eduskunta from Uusimaa Province, and he is from Vaasa Province. No power struggle between us is even in sight. It's just that we have disagreed on certain issues. And at least to some extent, those differences of opinion show up on the issue of EU membership." Impossible Subsidy Package Vayrynen is therefore denying that he opposes the EU, but he reiterates that he is very skeptical about whether it is sensible to join on the terms that exist and according to the timetable currently in effect. "But I have not yet decided what I will do if it turns out that membership cannot be postponed." Vayrynen's proposal that the matter be postponed has been met generally with the comment that no such alternative exists. "Assuming that the agreement as it now stands is rejected in one way or another, will its supporters then feel that the issue is settled, or will they propose new negotiations the very next day as a way of making membership possible? As a rule, the latter is what happens. And that, too, would result in a postponement," Vayrynen replies. So if the possibility of postponement exists for the supporters, then that same possibility also exists according to Vayrynen's model, he says. Vayrynen's criticism of the EU agreement is based on the fact that we will have to follow a very short timetable in introducing unrestricted free trade in the food economy without any corresponding move by the EU to even out the differences arising from the fact that we have a cold climate, a short growing season, and other natural conditions. On the contrary, the EU has arrangements favoring those countries enjoying the best conditions for production. "And when I have tried to get it clear in my mind how the Finnish farmer and food industry will be able to compete under such conditions, frightening prospects open up." He points out that there is sizable overproduction in the EU and that the GATT agreement requires that the EU reduce its agricultural exports considerably. The big producing countries expect to partially compensate for that by conquering new markets in the new member countries. The fact that Finland is being given the right to use its own money to subsidize agriculture does not make things any better. "Finnish taxpayers would then be forced to compensate not only for the disadvantages due to climate but also for the distortion caused by the fact that the EU's common measures will compel it to subsidize production in the strong producing areas. ``My opinion is that we will be incapable of paying enough in subsidies to support our own agriculture and food industry.'' Not Worn Out Following the presidential election, in which he was defeated in the first round, Paavo Vayrynen has not had any major political responsibilities. At one point he seemed to be thinking of challenging Esko Aho in the election for party chairman at this summer's party congress. Above all, he wanted to be chairman of the party's Eduskunta group. All of this has been viewed as part of a power struggle between Vayrynen and Aho. He claims, however, that he did not consider running for party chairman. "But I did think about the matter after being questioned about it," he admits. Vayrynen sees nothing strange about the fact that he did not inform Aho of his ambition to become group chairman. "Questions of that kind are discussed with the chairman of the Eduskunta group because what they involve is an election within the group. And it has not been the custom to discuss them beforehand with the party chairman," he says. "As far as I am concerned, there would have been no reason not to discuss the matter with Aho as well if the opportunity had arisen. I don't know why (group chairman) Kalevi Mattila did not take the matter up with Aho." Nor does Vayrynen share Aho's view that he should not have given up the post of minister of foreign affairs a year ago. "In view of the conditions existing at the time, that was the only possible solution. I knew from personal experience what it was like to be a potential candidate for president. It was very difficult to work in the government, and I wanted to be able to pursue my election campaign very freely. From the standpoint of the campaign, it was a good solution. ``On the other hand, one can speculate as to how the EU negotiations would have turned out if I had been involved in them. My position now is that we should have continued the negotiations. We should have stuck to our principal negotiating objectives and not have signed an agreement on these terms.'' Vayrynen does not yet see himself as a worn-out pensioner. "You would think that in a party as big as this one, there would be something for me to do -- something that I would also consider meaningful." The general opinion is that Aho has now won a decisive victory in the struggle between him and Vayrynen. Vayrynen does not share that view. He admits, however, that there have been problems in his relations with party chairman Esko Aho. "I don't see it as being a matter of a power struggle. Aho is indisputably party chairman. I am not thinking of challenging him, nor do I see anyone else in the running to become party chairman." [passage omitted]
