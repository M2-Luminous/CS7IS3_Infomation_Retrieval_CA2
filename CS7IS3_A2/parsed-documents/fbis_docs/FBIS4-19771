He was expected to adopt a different approach after the demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul on Sunday [10 April]. Many people believed that Erbakan would warn those who gathered under the Prosperity Party's banner and created incidents. They believed so because Erbakan supported "peace and brotherhood" in the statements he made during his election campaign. A move by him to warn the supporters of the Prosperity Party who prefer to call for war and engage in hostile activities instead of upholding the concept of peace and brotherhood and the militants who acted on behalf of the Prosperity Party would be in line with the principles Erbakan defended. But he did exactly the opposite. He supported the militants by saying that they are "members of our population." He described their "terrorist activities" against the state-owned buildings, political parties, and international establishments as an "uprising." He also described the administration in Turkey as a "terrorist" and "servile" entity that serves as a "colonialist subcontractor." What was more confusing was his statement on "bloodshed." According to Erbakan, an unchanging fact is as follows: The Prosperity Party will come to power. The problem is whether the transition period will be "nice and smooth or bloody." The people will make the decision. Who are the people who will make that decision? Will it be the aggressive individuals who were described by Erbakan as "within the ranks of his people"? Obviously, over 90 percent of our people, including most of those who voted for the Prosperity Party in the local elections, have been disgusted by the aggressive activities. Would anyone other than aggressive individuals support the idea of a "bloody" change of administration? Who else would prefer a state of "bloodshed," which Necmettin Erbakan described as "one of the two options" in Turkey? The speech Erbakan gave two days ago should be read often. No other meaning can be given to it. If the Prosperity Party cannot come to power in a nice, smooth manner, that is, in a democratic way, it will do so through "bloodshed," that is, through an "uprising" similar to that which took place on Sunday.... It will definitely come to power one way or the other.... Considering the meaning of Erbakan's speech, President Suleyman Demirel and all the other political party leaders moved to act yesterday. They were justified in doing so. They warned him in a way that he could and should understand them. Erbakan claimed after he met the speaker of the Turkish Grand National Assembly that his remarks were distorted. Obviously, he reverted to the position he held prior to the local elections. He said: "We support peace and tranquillity." The broadcasting of his speech two days ago by the television networks has confirmed that his remarks have not been distorted. His revelation yesterday was probably prompted by the reaction to his remarks, which has made him realize that he did something wrong. Of course, trying to correct a mistake is a positive approach. But which of the two revelations Erbakan made is true? Which of them reflects his true intention? It is becoming harder to establish that.
