Russian Federation Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan reported this to an RIA correspondent. He said that the level of emigration has doubled as compared with 1989. From what the minister said, thousands of skilled workers, specialists, and representatives of creative professions are leaving the country, which may have a negative effect on its intellectual and labor potential. "The `brain drain' process from fundamental science, the defense complex, and sectors which have found themselves in the most difficult situation in the period of the restructuring of the economy, is generating particularly great alarm." At the same time, the minister noted that the influx of refugees into Russia, which has assumed a "steady and constant nature," is growing.
