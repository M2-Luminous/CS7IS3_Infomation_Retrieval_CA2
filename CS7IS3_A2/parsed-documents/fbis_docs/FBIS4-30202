The deaths were recorded at an average of one every day, or at least five every week. Death was caused by strong vomiting as a result of herbal medicine taken by drug addicts to cure heroin addiction. The dead were then cremated inside the compound of the monastery. No proper records of the deaths were kept. According to the report, the Interior Ministry, with cooperation from the European Community, or EC, will on 30 June dispatch a group of 323 Hmong and lowland Lao refugees back to Laos. The EC has cleared a site in Bokeo Province as a settlement area for the refugees, and will provide them with supplies for farming. The project is part of the UNHCR program of repatriation for the Hmong and lowland Lao refugees.
