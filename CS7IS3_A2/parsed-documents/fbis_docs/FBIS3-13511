Leader President Saddam Husayn learned about and explained this to April Gelaspie, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, in late July 1990. The economic and political conspiracy al-Sabah had coordinated with the U.S. Administration and the CIA to subvert the entire Iraqi national system, as clearly established in Kuwaiti documents, had already pushed Iraqi-Kuwait relations to the maximum state of tension, poisoned the entire political atmosphere in the region, and encouraged al-Sabah to go ahead with their plans. The al-Sabah defense of the dividing line, which British colonialism had created with the stroke of a pen by its political resident Percy Cooks, was not the least of their aims in stirring up the conspiracy and trying to establish a fait accompli in the Iraqi side of the "patrols line", which the Arab League had defined during the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis in the sixties; the line which the president considered a determining factor for those violations. The al-Sabah set up on the Iraqi side of that line oil installations, border posts, and farms, as also mentioned in his excellency's talks with Gelaspie. Given the al-Sabah's mobilization of their armed forces and the insistence on prejudicing Iraq's national and political honor, and the fact that Kuwaiti economic and U.S. political plotting had reached a serious stage, Iraq had to respond equally by moving its forces and using its legitimate right to foil the new plot, after its political efforts from 1989 until July 1990 met with deaf ears and strong stubbornness. Those efforts were wasted when al-Sabah did away with Arab fraternity and cooperation and resorted instead to the spirit of hostility and fighting. It also became clear to Iraq that al-Sabah's attitude was not just a stubborn stand to carry out their wishes within Kuwait's limits, but a coordinated stand with the United States and its allies to plan a new war and to achieve what the plot of the Iranian aggression could not achieve. The aim of the new war was the same as that of the Iranian war, which was to push Iraq to scientific, industrial, and social backwardness, weaken it before the growing Zionist power, and force it to make political concessions which would restrict its free, independent course, end its advancement plan, and compel it to make concessions on its national soil and resources and stop opposing Camp David and its effects and any other similar step leading to the liquidation of the Palestine question. Those were the demands the U.S. Administration had declared openly more than once, on an official level and in the U.S.-Zionist propaganda and news media. What Iraq already knew was confirmed by the official correspondence between the director general of the State Security Department in Kuwait and the Iraqi interior: There was agreement and coordination with the CIA that al-Sabah and Washington would work together to put pressure on Iraq at the highest levels, pressure which would exploit Iraq's economic conditions after 8-year war. This was clearly mentioned in an official statement dated 22 November 1989 which Iraq deposited with the United Nations, which also considered it a correct, unblemished statement and included it among its documents That agreement and coordination explain Jabir al-Sabah's arrogance and haughtiness in insisting on going to Jeddah under his own terms and asking Sa'd al-Sabah not to listen to anything else, because, as he said, "this is the opinion of our friends in Egypt, Washington, and London." The position taken by Jabir and Sa'd was also that of the the United States, and Zionism, of course. The al-Sabah were used as pawns on the conspiratorial chess board. As for Husni Mubarak, who used his good offices as a coverup, he played the mean role of escalating the tense, critical situation to the point of explosion, as ordered by those hostile quarters. This was obvious when he conveyed to Jabir al-Sabah an incomplete version of what the leader president confided to him when he said: "So long as the talks remain between Iraq and Kuwait, then I will not use force. But brother Husni, do not say this to the Kuwaitis since it will only make them more arrogant." The words conveyed by Husni that "Saddam Husayn will not attack Kuwait" were a clear plot to encourage the al-Sabah to go ahead with their hostile stand to spark off the U.S.-Zionist plot. Due to the reassurance generated by Husni Mubarak's remark, Jabir al-Sabah went ahead with his conspiracy. His recommendations to Sa'd al-Sabah in his talks with the vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council during their famous Jeddah meeting on 30 July 1990 were stubborn, like a solid, jagged rock. Husni Mubarak's remark, plus Jabir al-Sabah's determination to ride the conspiratorial train, which was backed by U.S. engines and military might, was the main reason for the failure of the Jeddah talks and al-Sabah's defiance and threat that international forces would compel Iraq to respond to their demands. That was the visible part of the conspiracy, which had other hidden parts. The political observer could not but note these serious, major developments, especially the political propaganda campaign which Western governments and world Zionism had waged in the media against Iraq in general and leader President Saddam Husayn in person since 8 August 1988. The aims of this propaganda were summed up by a U.S. Congressional delegation led by Senator Dole in April 1990, as follows: Iraq should revise its scientific program and industrial advancement on the pretext that it threatens Iraqi interest and peace in the region; stop making threats to the Zionist entity, although it threatened Iraq; and contribute actively and constructively toward the current peace process between Israel and the representatives of the Palestinians. Those exactly were the hidden reasons behind al-Sabah's insistence on riding the train of the oil conspiracy, which steamed off with U.S. motivation and Zionist instigation under the slogan of demanding: 1) Demarcation of the border according to the new violations. 2) Payment of debts! In all cases, the aim was one, namely, enforcing the demands of U.S.-Zionist policy as summed up by Senator Dole. But what was not secret to analysts, and it must not remain secret to anyone now that the war took place with the 30-state aggression, was what the hostile circles had decided, which was to push Iraq to the state of the blockade it is in now. This blockade actually began with the decision of the U.S. Congress earlier in 1990 to cancel the food deals with Iraq. This was followed by the imposition of the scientific and technological embargo, whether or not the war took place, rather whether we behaved in a manner that befitted free men, or followed the path of defeatism and cowardice. What was required in all cases was to stop Iraq's advancement project and thus affect people's progress and prosperity, spoil the peace and victory the Iraqi people enjoyed after 8 August 1988, and block the growing popularity of Iraq which, with time, would become a popular unity base. This was what the imperialist states and Zionism had feared because it meant foiling their infinitesimal plan against the unity of the Arab homeland, ending the divisions, and consolidating the march of confrontation against Zionist aggression and its settler arrogance. That was what Iraq had achieved in a striking manner, particularly after 8 August 1988. Therefore, al-Sabah's insistence was not spontaneously based on a balance of power or a demand for legitimate rights. Any observer could easily see that al-Sabah's small size and challenge was no match to Iraq's new weight. The fact is, the insistence stemmed from the opinion of Egypt, Washington, and London! Consequently, the Jeddah talks had to fail, and Iraq found itself compelled to crush the den of sinful plotting which sought in every mean way to involve Iraq in a war of starvation and humiliation, similar in results to what we are in now, especially after Iraq had proved its competence in the armed war against the Zionist entity in 1973 and against Iran from 1980 to 1988. The al-Sabah were in no position to engage in one percent of such a war and still remain on their thrones, even for a few hours. On 2 August 1990, while the Arab foreign ministers were meeting in Cairo, Husni Mubarak, to quote Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal, was reading a situation report prepared by his office with the cooperation of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and General Intelligence. The main points and recommendations of that report were as follows: - Iraq's entry into Kuwait was a blow to Egyptian interests on more than one level, both with regard to its direct interests and its leading position in the Arab World; a position which the Egyptian Government was determined to hold on to, even if in the disgraceful Camp David abyss. - It was necessary for Egypt to mobilize the entire Arab world in order to exercise maximum political pressure on Baghdad. This could be done through a meeting of Arab foreign ministers. The report, which gave tacit approval to U.S. intervention in advance, also reached other conclusions. It said, verbatim: - It is better for U.S. intervention in the crisis to be carried out, step by step, otherwise it will give Iraq the chance to arouse the Arab public, which was what the U.S. Administration had actually done throughout the six and one-half months before the military aggression. - A clear message must be sent to the Zionist entity asking it not to get involved in the crisis to avoid complicating matters, making the solution difficult. This point was made several times and recommended for implementation. While Husni Mubarak was reading these recommendations, which seem to have been drawn up before 2 August 1990, Tel Aviv radio was lamenting the loss of "fraternal Kuwait." The Zionist entity was holding contacts with Washington to coordinate on how to face the situation, especially since Tel Aviv had its own aggressive plan against Iraq, which was to have been implemented before July 1990 if it had not been for the deterrent Iraqi threat made by leader President Saddam Husayn in April 1990, and had it not also been for Washington's fears about its "vital interests" in the region in case of an outbreak of war sparked by Zionist aggression. The Zionist entity's cabinet held an emergency meeting in the same afternoon to discuss urgent matters. Thus, the Zionist entity and Husni Mubarak seemed to be pursuing the same line, carrying out the economic plot by armed force under the cover of double-dealing and the policy of selective revenge At the time when the Zionist entity was hoping military action against Iraq would be carried out by the big powers on behalf of the small states, contrary to previous practice, Husni Mubarak was preparing the atmosphere in the lobbies of the Arab League to find a "legal" cover for the entry of U.S. forces and its allies in the Arabian Peninsula, which would be the base for aggression on Iraq. Without such a base, the United States would be fighting a war similar in results to the war in Vietnam, according to Bush and his followers. Wiping out the Vietnamese complex had been Bush's obsession for some time. It occupied a significant place in his inauguration speech. In fact, he often mentioned the subject after 2 August 1990 and during the armed aggression. Husni Mubarak gave him this priceless opportunity when he violated the Arab League Charter by resorting to a formal vote instead of the unanimous vote required by the charter in such cases. That was his biggest crime against the entire nation, as certified by all Arab delegations. Egyptian Housing and Reconstruction Minister Hasaballah al-Kafrawi was very clear in his statement to AL-MUSAWWAR on 29 March 1991 when he admitted the importance of the treacherous role played by the Hafr al-Batin allies and the sinful aggression they committed against Iraq, and therefore the Arab nation. He said, verbatim: "Were it not for the position taken by Husni Mubarak, there would not have been any Kuwait or UN Security Council resolutions today. Kuwait, the Gulf, and Saudi Arabia would have complained to the Security Council and entered into endless complications and interpretations, as in the case of the Palestine question, which has been in the United Nations since 1948, and will be, perhaps, forever. Were it not for Mubarak also, the United States -- the biggest power in history and in our modern world -- would not have been able to intervene under any excuse. And if it did, there would have been another Vietnam or a Crusader war. The one who gave it legality was President Mubarak! And the one who made King Fahd invite the U.S. forces was President Mubarak." There is no doubt then that Husni was the one who gave legality to the United States and the allied forces to intervene. Whoever claims that Egypt's role was marginal does not understand the course of events. Egypt was the one that created the Gulf war and the one that returned Kuwait. This dirty role the Egyptian housing and reconstruction minister boasted about was, in fact, a treasonous role that Husni Mubarak played, and is still playing, for Washington and Camp David. As for the story about the United States canceling Egypt's debts, which amounted to $7 billion, those debts were actually repaid from Arab oil money, not by the U.S. Treasury, according to a decision by war criminal Bush and other members of his coalition and agents.
