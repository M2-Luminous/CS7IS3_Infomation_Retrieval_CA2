Insurance premiums will be borne by individuals and entitles while a new practice of paying premiums will be employed. This was revealed at a meeting held by the China People's Insurance Company today. The social security system reform mainly covers the setting up of an individual pension account for urban workers with the pension premium being calculated in proportion to one's wage and shared by the employee and the employer who hired the worker. The paid premium is registered in the worker's individual account and the amount the worker has to pay in the period to come will increase gradually to a level that the employer should share. The public expenses and medical care system for the workers is also under reform with the aim of creating a medical insurance system covering individual medical accounts and social insurance funding for serious illness. The money used for the present medical system with its expense jointly shared by enterprises and the governmental department will be divided into two parts, one part for the establishment of a social insurance fund for medical expenses for serious illness suffered by workers while the other part is for the setting up of an individual medical account for general spending on medical care. The scope for unemployment insurance will expand to gradually create a better unemployment insurance system to cover workers of state-owned, collective and privately-owned enterprises and those employed by the Chinese partner in foreign-funded enterprises. Under the current social security system, beneficiaries are restricted to workers of government organs and state-owned enterprises as well as a handful of residents suffering great difficulties, making up a mere 30 percent of the total labour force. The money needed for the system will be mainly funded by the state and raised by enterprises themselves. Owing to its national situation, China cannot afford high welfare spending and instead should practice fund-raising by individuals in a bid to ease the burden on the state and enterprises. In rural areas peasants must maintain the practice of supporting their family elders at the present stage.
