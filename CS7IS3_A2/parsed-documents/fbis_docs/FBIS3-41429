There was more interest in the sustained development of the planet, that is for the conditions in which human life develops and for the rational consumption of the earth resources, than in the effort to preserve animal species and ecologic systems. This attitude caused discomfort among some non-government organizations which fear that the UICN may become a bureaucratic entity similar to other international forums in its efforts to establish a dialogue with industry and commerce. The UICN considers the growing membership of indigenous, agricultural, and cattle farmer groups favors strong action in favor of the preservation of traditional resources and development, which should be gauged according to the capability of each region. Experts say the industrialization process of developed countries should not be repeated, given that they have devastated most of their territories. Experts instead favor a development method that will protect the resources of each area and take advantage of the traditional knowledge of local inhabitants. Experts from the five continents nonetheless greeted the unity shown by some national delegations in face of their need to present their proposals before the UICN as well as the capacity to unite like some regional blocs have done to strengthen their position. The resolutions were presented by government and non-government members of the UICN. Of the 159 proposals, about 50 were withdrawn or dismissed. The Spanish delegation managed to get its proposal to establish the Mediterranean Regional Office headquarters in Spain accepted. The coordination of activities in the Mediterranean basin will thus be managed from the Iberian peninsula. The UICN groups together 600 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), 100 governmental agencies, and 67 member states. For the voting power to be balanced, NGO's and states are granted one vote while agencies (on condition they do not represent a member state) are given two votes. Experts were of one mind about the importance of UICN meetings in providing useful dialogue between governmental and nongovernmental groups, since every motion before the assembly must be passed by consensus following a debate. The influence of the UICN over governments has enabled some NGO's to successfully request UICN help to urge their countries' authorities to abide by ecological regulations accepted by the international community. The European group, however, was somewhat reluctant to discuss governmental issues that are deemed to fall under the jurisdiction of the European Union (UE), like questions pertaining to the GATT. Biodiversity, the exportation of toxic waste, and environmental education were among the subjects mooted at the general assembly as well as internal issues, UICN actions before some governments, sustainable development, the conservation of different species, and the management of natural resources. No agreement was reached on a resolution that sought to regulate UICN's action over the World Bank and other international financial organizations due to the amendments introduced by a group of NGO's. Following a heated debate on the law on the hunt of large cetacea, two resolutions highlighting the ban on whaling were passed. The minutes and resolutions of the 19th UICN General Assembly will soon be published and distributed among its members.
