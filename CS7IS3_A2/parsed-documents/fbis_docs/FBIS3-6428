On 14, 15, and 16 March the communist Vietnamese puppets continued their assault on the Pailin region from the south and the north using tanks, artillery, and infantry troops. 2. We destroyed four of the raiding forces' T-54 tanks on 14 March; one at Treng, two at Sdau, and another at Kamping Puoy. 3. We killed 60 infantry troops of the communist Vietnamese puppets on 15 March and wounded several others, who were dragged away by their comrades. We seized 85 firearms, including AK's, B- 40's, RPK's, SKS's, and AR-15's. 4. At 1030 on 15 March, we hit a communist Vietnamese puppet plane over Chineang along Route 10. The plane was forced to turn back hastily and land at Battambang to avoid becoming another of the many carcasses on the Pailin battlefield. The people have a great predilection for the wreckage of the communist Vietnamese puppet planes; they make good knives, pots, and pans. 5. We hit them hard on 16 March, killing 49 raiding troops, wounding 60 others, and destroying another T-54 tank. In sum, over these three days of fighting we destroyed five T-54 tanks, killed 109 raiding troops, and wounded 60 others.
