FR940719-2-00067 FR940719-2-00041 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;533&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Application May 13, 1994 Take notice that on May 6, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;533&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon an undivided 30 percent interest or, alternatively, an undivided 100 percent interests in its ``San Salvador System'' and its ``La Rosa/Mustang Island System'' from interstate commerce. Tennessee proposes that the abandoned undivided 30 percent interest or, alternatively undivided 100 percent interest, would be transferred to Tennessee's indirect intrastate pipeline subsidiary, Channel Industries Gas Company (``Channel''). Tennessee states that the primary proposal to abandon and transfer an undivided 30 percent interest in these to Channel is based on discussions with, and at the request of, its customer that currently utilize these facilities. Tennessee proposes that Channel would operate all of the San Salvador and La Rosa/Mustang Island Systems under either the primary 30 percent or the alternative 100 percent transfer option. Tennessee identifies the facilities that it proposes to abandon as follows: The ``San Salvador System,'' which comprises all of Tennessee's facilities at and upstream of Station 1, is comprised of approximately 600 miles of various diameter pipeline facilities. It includes Tennessee's Station 1 and the San Salvador Line, which runs from Agua Dulce, Texas, south approximately 98 miles to the vicinity of Edinburg, Texas. The San Salvador line is comprised of a 26-inch diameter pipeline and a looped 16-inch diameter pipeline. Appurtenant to the San Salvador Line are: a 12-inch diameter pipeline 53 miles in length running from Duval County, Texas west of Station 1; 1 24-inch diameter pipeline 20 miles in length running south from Station 1 to Endinburg, Texas; five 12-inch diameter pipelines totalling 82 miles in length; and approximately 200 miles of smaller diameter pipeline facilities that connect into the San Salvador Line at numerous points in southern Texas. Tennessee states that there is no line compression on the San Salvador pipeline facilities other than at Station 1. The ``La Rosa/Mustang Island System'' interconnects with Tennessee's 100 Line approximately 42 miles downstream of Station 1, and extends from that point in a southeasterly direction approximately six miles, where it crosses Channel's ``A&hyph;S Pipe Line.'' From this crossing, the La Rosa/Mustang Island System continues southward into Corpus Christi Bay and Offshore Texas (in state waters). This system is comprised of: the ``La Rosa'' line, consisting of six miles of 10-inch diameter pipeline in Refugio County, Texas; the ``La Rosa-Mustang Island'' line, a 12-inch diameter pipeline 32 miles in length from Refugio County south into San Patricio County, Texas and on into Corpus Christi Bay; and an additional 22 miles of smaller diameter pipelines that connect into the La Rosa and Mustang Island lines in Refugio County, San Patricio County, and Offshore Texas. Tennessee's primary proposal is to transfer a 30 percent undivided interest in its San Salvador/La Rosa facilities to the capital of Channel at a net book value of approximately $5.2 million. Tennessee proposes, in the alternative, to transfer 100 percent of its San Salvador/La Rosa facilities to the capital of Channel at a net book value of $17.2 million. This $17.2 million net book value represents approximately 1.3 percent of Tennessee's rate base. Tennessee states that: (1) there will be no diminution in service to Tennessee's shippers; (2) Abandonment will increase utilization of the San Salvador/La Rosa facilities and enhance competition; (3) Abandonment will improve aggregation of supplies for Tennessee; and (4) The flexibility goals of the NGPA are better served. Tennessee notes in its application that Channel's intrastate rates and operations are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas, and that Channel also provides open-access transportation service in accordance with section 311(a)(2) of the NGPA pursuant to rates authorized by the Commission. Channel Industries Gas Co., 13 FERC Â¶62,042 (1980). Tennessee states that the Commission would retain jurisdiction over the rates charged by Channel for transportation on these facilities in interstate commerce pursuant to section 311 of the NGPA. Tennessee's proposals are set forth more fully in its application, which is on file and available for inspection at the Commission. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before June 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
