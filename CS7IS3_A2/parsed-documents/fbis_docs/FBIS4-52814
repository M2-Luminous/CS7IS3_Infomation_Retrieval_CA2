Despite adamant denials by his aides and the retired politician himself, persistent speculation on a Kim comeback is having repercussions throughout the country, with some political pundits already predicting the dawning of "a new era of two Kims." These observers believe there may be a new round of politics pitting DJ, as Kim Tae-chung is popularly called, against President Kim Yong-sam just like in the old days. Meanwhile, talk like "crippled" and "DJ rules from behind the veil" is used to describe Yi Ki-taek's questionable leadership of the Democratic Party. Outwardly Yi Ki-taek is maintaining a stony silence about such speculation. This is quite a change from the recent past when he observed that Kim Tae-chung could comment on any political issue, if he so desired, as a member of the party. In an emotional farewell shortly after his defeat in the 1992 presidential election, Kim Tae-chung declared that he was retiring from politics for good. Nevertheless, he said he would like to retain his membership in the party for the time being. In a recent interview with a provincial newspaper, Kim said that even if he wanted to make a comeback, he would not ride on the back of the Democratic Party or any faction. Hounded by reporters to clarify the remark, Yi lost his temper and retorted: "What do you want me to say?" Yi was said to have ordered his aides not to comment on this question, either. Yi's silence is probably due to his precarious position: He can neither deny nor confirm the speculation that Kim, despite his own denials, used the newspaper interview to extend a feeler on his comeback, placed ever so gently and ambiguously in the political arena as well as in the minds of the general public. Yi has already declared his intention to run for president in 1997, and it is common knowledge that he was counting on Kim Tae- chung to muster powerful support for him when the time comes. Hence his silence, as he would be most affected if the 69-year- old former DP chairman attempted a comeback. Many political observers are looking no further ahead than the next presidential election. Yi Ki-taek's status as the leader of the No. 1 opposition party is already being eroded by the rumors of a DJ comeback. In fact, Yi's chairmanship of the Democratic Party has always been shaky at best. He has been able to manage the party, some claim, only by riding piggyback on the DJ followers' faction. By coincidence or design, however, DJ's followers -- or the Tongyo-tong faction as they are called -- are increasingly asserting themselves, expressing "displeasure" whenever Yi Ki-taek states his intention to run for president in 1997. But rumors of a DJ comeback are not working entirely against Yi Ki-taek. The Yi camp believes that the more people talk about DJ's return, the more difficult it would become for Kim to make an actual comeback. Kim's and his aides' denials of the rumours are apparently being made out of a similar belief. And if DJ's comeback proved difficult under the present circumstances, the partnership between Yi and Kim -- however awkward it may be -- would be maintained for some time.
