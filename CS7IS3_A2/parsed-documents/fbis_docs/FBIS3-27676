He said that the Chinese side will surely make a necessary response. After attending a private activity yesterday (24 February), Zhang Junsheng said that the Sino-British talks on arrangements for the 1994-95 elections have been thoroughly ruined by the British side and the fact that the British side takes this action now moves it farther and farther away from the road of Sino-British cooperation. As for cooperation between China and Britain in other areas such as livelihood-related questions and the airport issue, which Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten hopes for, Zhang Junsheng said: The foundation of Sino-British cooperation has been torn down by the British side. If the British side imagines that nothing has happened, it is, I am afraid, deceiving itself and others. Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said that the British side has violated the principle of confidentiality regarding the Sino-British talks by unilaterally publishing the contents of the talks without mutual consultations, and that the so- called White Paper published by the British side does not fully reflect the talks. Before the opening of the large carnival "Joy at Kennedy at the End of the Spring Festival" in the western Hong Kong branch of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong in Western District last night (24 February), Zhu Yucheng made a response to the British side's publication of the White Paper on Representative Government in Hong Kong. He said: What the British has published is precisely what it has admitted it to be; that is, it is not all the contents of the talks, but only part of the contents adapted and compiled by the British side. The contents are not all facts. The Chinese side will surely make a response. He said: The Chinese side stated before that it was all right to publish all the contents of the talks and that the Chinese side would agree to the end on this question. The Chinese side will respond to the British side's impractical actions which are misleading public opinion. Zhu Yucheng said: The British side notified XINHUA only yesterday morning that it would unilaterally publish the contents of the talks. It was very late. He criticized the British side's termination of the talks in the 17th round while saying repeatedly that the door to the talks was still open. He said that this served to deceive the public and mislead public opinion. As for the British argument that it did not consult the Chinese side before publishing the contents of the talks because it wanted to avoid wasting time, Zhu Yucheng said it was unrealistic. He maintained that there would have been time if the two sides had wanted to carry out talks.
