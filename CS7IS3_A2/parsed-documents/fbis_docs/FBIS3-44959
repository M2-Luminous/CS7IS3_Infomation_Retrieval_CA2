Sung] [Text] A senior government official has denied accusations he cancelled a visit to Beijing because of the row over calls for civil servants to brief China's Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). A senior Chinese official said yesterday the Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu had called off a scheduled business trip to Beijing to avoid further confrontation over his presence in the Chinese capital. The incident fuelled Sino-British tensions over this week's sensitive invitation for Hong Kong government officials to brief the PWC. Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said Siu had cancelled a prearranged visit to sign a civil aviation agreement with the mainland. But Siu rejected the claim, saying arrangements had not been finalised and he had not decided whether to go or not. "I have not given any indication of when I will visit China, and certainly as far as the signing of the agreement is concerned it will probably be by the director (of Civil Aviation) and his team," Siu said. Lu maintained the visit had been called off and accused Governor Chris Patten of confusing politics and the economy, a criticism which he has repeatedly directed at China. "He (Patten) has been all along talking about the separation of politics and economy. Now he himself is mixing up the two," Lu said. But Patten went on the defensive and said there were hidden motives behind the invitation. The Hong Kong government rejected an invitation this week for Siu to brief the PWC on the controversial Airport Corporation Bill. It is believed the invite has political motives and signals the start of a fight for control of the Hong Kong bureaucracy before 1997. A government spokesman also rejected a media report which said civil servants who accepted the PWC's invitation would be committing an act of treason as "absolute nonsense". He said many officials could retain contacts with the PWC on an informal basis. Patten said yesterday there were hidden motives behind the invitation, arguing the PWC already had access to government officials through their many members involved in the Airport Consultative Committee, the Legislative Council and the Provisional Airport Authority. "I think one has to take this particular request with a pinch of salt and ask some questions about the motive, Patten said. Patten reiterated the two sides should use the established channels for communication. "I very much hope that we can get through this stage of adjectives and words being thrown at us and get on with the business of cooperation," he said.
