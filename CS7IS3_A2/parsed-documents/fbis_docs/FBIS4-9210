Also attending, the announcer notes, are six heads of state, nine prime ministers and deputy prime ministers, five speakers and deputy speakers of parliaments, 12 foreign ministers, 12 general secretaries of international organizations, 20 other ministers, ambassadors, members of the diplomatic corps, political personalities, and businessmen. The session is also attended by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. At 0815 GMT the session is opened by Jean Paul Carteron, who speaks in French with simultaneous translation into Romanian. He thanks the guests for attending this "important forum, whose activity is devoted to developing and boosting international cooperation," and the Romanian leadership, President Ion Iliescu, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and the chairmen of the two chambers of Parliament, for the "extraordinary work they have done, without which we would not be able to meet here now." After praising Bucharest and Romania as the "beacon of Latinity," Carteron greets "Chairman 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres," who have "used this occasion to continue their negotiations to further the peace process." He outlines the main issues on the agenda, including the "Black Sea, the Balkans, Central Asia, and the North-West and South-West relationship in the Mediterranean basin" as well as the "free trade exchange and its contribution to overall political stability, regional cooperation, the European Union, the Partnership for Peace scheme, and preventive diplomacy." Referring to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, he says "hope has not yet been vanquished, since hope is so necessary now, if do not want to fall prey to despair." He invites President Iliescu to take the floor. At 0830 GMT Romanian President Ion Iliescu begins his address in Romanian. He welcomes in particular "Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Shim'on Peres, who have been negotiating since last night. The negotiations were resumed this morning, and we hope that this is a positive sign." He proceeds to review Romania's history, reiterating the country's "long standing European vocation and awareness." In this context, the emphasizes the importance of Transylvania as "the cradle of the Romanian nation's formation, culture, and civilization," adding that, throughout history, "Romania's disadvantage has been its geographical placing at the confluence of the interests of various empires competing for domination in this region." Returning to the present, Iliescu says that Romania is going through a "historical stage of profound and complex changes on all planes," adding that "the bases were laid for a democratic society and the state of law, which are reflected in the country's new Constitution." He points to the "difficult process of the restructuring of the national economy -- a most complex and painful process, with social costs, which is taking place against the background of economic crisis." He says that the interest of all political forces in Romania in this "difficult transition period" is the same, namely to "consolidate democratic accomplishments and ensure the development of the Romanian economy, on new, efficient, and dynamic bases." Referring to the "deepening economic gaps at the world level, which are hampering the access of all countries to the benefits of the contemporary technological progress," he says that this is bound to lead to tensions, "including social tensions in the developed countries themselves" and to a "further polarization of wealth and poverty at the world level, which can provoke a new mass migration of hundreds of millions of poor people from Africa and Asia toward the rich countries of Europe and North America." Iliescu emphasizes that the "fate of Europe, of those from the west, center, and east of the continent is the same, provided that we achieve an optimal framework of partnership among equals, not of subordination of the weak to the powerful." He adds that the "political and military barrier that separated our continent should not be replaced by an economic one." Referring to the Partnership for Peace, he says that Romania is "looking with interest" to this scheme, which is meant "to ensure equal security for all states in the region and avoid discriminatory approaches, capable of generating new sources of tension at a regional level." At 0843 GMT Catherine Lalumiere, acting secretary general of the Council of Europe, begins her speech, in French with superimposed translation into Romanian, by thanking the Romanian authorities for having organized the forum and praising the "long distance covered by Romania" in the past four years along the road of democracy. "You have even managed to tame this enormous palace, the megalomaniac's palace, which is a masterpiece of the Romanian people's toil." She then proceeds to discuss the "deep changes" currently taking place in Europe and their "particularly positive impact" on the rapprochement between East and West Europe, designed to achieve the "establishment of a common European home, as President Gorbachev called it, which should stretch all the way from the Atlantic up to Vladivostok." After assessing various trends currently under way in Europe, Lalumiere points out a number of "unavoidable" problems related to the transition period in East Europe that still need to be solved, such as the Western assistance granted to those countries, the democratization of their societies, the establishment of the rule-of-law state, and the fundamental changes in the people's mentality. She also refers in passing to other negative aspects, such as the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" in Russia, the hardships faced by Ukraine, various obstacles raised to "political and economic reform" in the former communist countries, galloping unemployment, low living standards, popular discontent, and so forth. On top of all this comes a "crisis of values" determined by the loss of the "system of reference, which the vanquished Marxist-Leninist ideology represented," and the "fascination with the consumption society," which causes a run for "easy money." She stresses that the changes are not over yet and that there will be "many turning points this part of Europe will have to face yet." For instance, "Russia's opening to Europe is an accomplished fact, but the question remains what will happen in Russia after the latest elections," because that country seems to "oscillate between opening to Europe and returning to its own self." Catherine Lalumiere condemns the rise of nationalism in its extremist forms, noting that "almost no country has been spared this trend," which is manifest not only in Eastern and Central Europe but also in Western countries, such as Italy, Great Britain, Belgium, Spain, and France. Lalumiere emphasizes the need for "social justice and human rights," criticizing the widening gap between East and West, saying that "it would be a catastrophe if the iron curtain is replaced by a financial and economic curtain." She then proceeds to outline, in general terms, the efforts made in recent years by the Council of Europe to help solve these "huge problems, compared to which our means are totally insufficient." After pleading for the establishment of "coherence" among European countries and their international institutions and expressing her gratitude to the Romanian people, Lalumiere concludes her speech at 0926 GMT. She hands over the medal of the Council of Europe to President Ion Iliescu. The live relay ends at 0927 GMT.
