FR940830-0-00003 FR940830-0-00001 The costs of treating unprocessed cotton and cottonseed to qualify them for interstate movement is approximately $1.90 per bale of cotton and $0.13 per bushel of cottonseed. For the 3 most recent marketing years (1990&hyph;1992), the average price per bale of cotton received by farmers was about $284; the average price per bushel of cottonseed received by farmers was about $1.60 (USDA, ``Agricultural Statistics 1993,'' U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1993). Thus, the costs of treatment, seen as a percentage of value, range between 0.5 and 0.8 percent of the value of cotton and between 6 and 9 percent of the value of cottonseed. The majority of the cotton and cottonseed produced in the affected areas of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties is sold for processing, so the amount of cotton and cottonseed produced in the affected areas that will require treatment for interstate movement is expected to be small. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
