FR940527-1-00195 FR940527-1-00014 Under section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act, aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment system for FY 1992 through 1995 respectively, are to equal 90 percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis in each year. (See Addendum, Part III for a full discussion of the capital budget neutrality provision.) Currently, we project that in FY 1994 aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment system will be 93.05 percent of reasonable costs, or 3.05 percentage points higher than the 90 percent target. We also estimate an increase in capital cost per case of 5.70 percent from FY 1994 to FY 1995. To achieve budget neutrality in FY 1995, we estimate there would be an aggregate 2.24 percent increase in FY 1995 Medicare capital payments over the FY 1994 payments. We project that low capital cost hospitals paid under the fully prospective payment methodology will experience an average case-weighted increase in payments of 3.09 percent, and high capital cost hospitals will experience an average increase of 1.42 percent. For hospitals paid under the fully prospective payment methodology, the Federal rate payment percentage will increase from 30 percent to 40 percent and the hospital-specific rate payment percentage will decrease from 70 to 60 percent in FY 1995. The Federal rate payment percentage for a hospital paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology is based on the hospital's ratio of new capital costs to total capital costs. The average Federal rate payment percentage for those hospitals receiving a hold-harmless payment for old capital will increase from 17.05 percent to 20.04 percent. We estimate the percentage of hold-harmless hospitals paid based on 100 percent of the Federal rate will increase from 39 percent to 40 percent. The average hospital-specific rate payment per discharge falls from $151.74 in FY 1994 to $124.32 in FY 1995. A decline in the average hospital-specific rate payment per discharge from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is to be expected because of the reduction in the hospital-specific rate blend percentage and the 5.76 percent decrease in the hospital-specific rate from FY 1994 to FY 1995. We are proposing no changes in our exceptions policies for FY 1995. As a result, the minimum payment levels would be: •90 percent for sole community hospitals; •80 percent for urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and a disproportionate share patient percentage of 20.2 percent or more; or, •70 percent for all other hospitals. We estimate that exceptions payments will increase from 0.7 percent of payments in FY 1994 to 1.37 percent of payments in FY 1995. The projected distribution of the payments is shown in the table below: Estimated FY 1995 Exceptions Payments 1Type of hospital 1No. of hospitals 1Percent of exceptions payments Low Capital Cost 280 77 High Capital Cost 100 23 Total 380 100 C.
