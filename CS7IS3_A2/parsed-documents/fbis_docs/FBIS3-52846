FBIS3-52846 "drnes006_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-006 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 ISRAEL Peres: No Target Date for Withdrawal TA1001131694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1230 GMT 10 Jan 94 TA1001131694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Text] Israel will not withdraw from Gaza and Jericho on 14 April, the date set in the Declaration of Principles [DOP] with the PLO. This may be inferred from the remarks of Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who said today that there is no target date for the withdrawal. Rather, he said, there is an understanding that the implementation of the DOP will last four months after the agreement has been signed. Peres was asked whether that meant that the withdrawal would start toward the beginning of summer, and he replied: We will try to do it earlier. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 10 January quotes Peres as "voicing his confidence that progress will be made in the Taba talks and noting that the DOP cannot be implemented in one go."]
