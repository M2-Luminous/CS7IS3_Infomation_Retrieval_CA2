An Ordinary Russian Speaker Who Has Led Everyone Down the Garden Path"] [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who became a State Duma deputy on the ticket of the Agrarian Party and was elected speaker at the initiative of the communists, has definitely broken with the opposition. This week he announced that he would step down as deputy chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF]. Yesterday, the plenary meeting of the CPRF Central Executive Committee plenary meeting readily met his request. There are various opinions regarding Ivan Rybkin, current State Duma chairman and former second secretary of the Volgograd Oblast Communist Party committee. Some see him as a man coming from the people who has been elevated to the high post by sheer happenstance. "The milestones of my working biography are pretty simple," Rybkin said, justifiably so, in a recent interview. Indeed, the speaker has a typical agrarian-staff background: quiet work at the organization departments of first district, then oblast, party committees; and finally the Central Committee of the RSFSR Communist Party. It should be added that Rybkin's appearance is fully in line with his biography: a short stature, a quiet voice, pleasant manners in conversation, and a complete absence even of outward signs of willfulness, let alone charisma. Nonetheless, unlike most of his colleagues who have quietly settled down in all kinds of businesses, not only has Rybkin made a brilliant career by assuming one of the highest state posts, but he is by right considered one of the ten most influential Russian politicians. What appears to be more pertinent is another view whereby the role of a "gray politician," a "mediocrity," is just a role the State Duma chairman sometimes thinks necessary to play. Meanwhile, Rybkin did not seem a mediocrity at all at the Supreme Soviet, where he carefully but uncompromisingly criticized the "Yeltsin regime." Yet more proof of his firm political convictions is the fact that in October he was one of the last to have been escorted out of the burning White House at gunpoint. When Rybkin started talking about loyalty to the president and commitment to the course of reform upon having been "pushed through" by the communists and agrarians as State Duma chairman, the speaker's former supporters accused him of opportunism and "working for the democrats." However, those who are closely familiar with Rybkin are certain that no metamorphoses have occurred in him: "It is not he who is changing, but circumstances, and Rybkin is just adapting to the circumstances so as to work effectively." In fact, Rybkin can well go to the president (for whose impeachment he voted in September) with a bunch of flowers on his birthday, or to appoint Andrey Voykov, a democrat, who formerly was deputy chief of the presidential administration, as chief of the State Duma's staff. All this is essentially trifles, but Ruslan Khasbulatov's recent experience has shown fairly convincingly that it is trifles (inappropriate words or gestures) that can help one fall out with the president for good. As regards matters of principle, however, the speaker acts decisively and quite independently. After all, it is precisely Rybkin's staffers who quickly and promptly formalized the release of the "Lefortovo inmates," thus making it impossible for the president "to reverse" the amnesty decree. Clearly, Rybkin's apparently scandalous departure from the Communist Party leadership should not be overestimated. While heading the lower chamber, Rybkin has not become a pawn in the hands of the opposition. But seeing him as the president's man would also be ill-advised. He is playing his own game. His short-term program is quite clear: not to repeat the sad experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Ruslan Khasbulatov. As for his long-term program, many deputies believe that the wise and careful Rybkin with an image of "a mediocrity" may turn out to be a compromise figure suiting political forces as a presidential candidate who will be easy to manipulate in case of his victory. But what Rybkin himself thinks on the subject is still anyone's guess.
