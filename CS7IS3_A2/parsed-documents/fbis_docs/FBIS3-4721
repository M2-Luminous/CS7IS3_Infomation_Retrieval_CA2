We must increase the national competitive strength to stand out [potilsu innun] in the international arena. [passage omitted] Only those countries that have enough competitive strength can become a genuine self-reliant and independent country in the limitless competitive age. We should not stick to the past national sentiment. We must advance toward the future and the world, considering the past as a valuable lesson. [passage omitted] Our ancestors said that they would not punish Japan for its past crimes nor condemn its acts, while they were protesting the pitiless colonial rule. They also said they would not try to satisfy their grudge accumulated in the past. They were right. We should cooperate with Japan in a dauntless manner [tangdanghage] with confidence and national pride, and we should also win the just and fair competition with it, without fail. [applause] It is time for us to have a future-oriented view of history and to demonstrate our ripened national capacity. It is time to advance toward the world with a correct understanding of the new Japan, the new Asia, and the new world. Dear 70 million fellow countrymen: Without national reunification, the building of a self-reliant and independent country cannot be completed. The national division is a historic holdover from the past that must be cleared. Only when we destroy the wall of national division, will we finally be able to enjoy the true glory of the nation, and can we become a responsible nation that will make a greater contribution to the co- prosperity and peace of the world. Reunification should be achieved in a direction going with the trend of world history. The world is moving toward an era of openness and cooperation, putting an end to the era of distrust and confrontation. North Korea must realize that reform and openness is the only shortcut in making the nation one and guarantee the nation's welfare. [applause]
