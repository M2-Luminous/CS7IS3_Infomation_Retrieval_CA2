The ASAHI SHIMBUN and the MAINICHI SHIMBUN raised subscription fees last December and the YOMIURI SHIMBUN in January, all by 200 yen per month. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN raised its monthly subscription fee by 300 yen in February. The FTC suspect the four major dailies colluded in increasing the fees, the officials said. The Antimonopoly Law stipulates that a concerted price hike occurs if two of the top five firms in a sector with a market of 60 billion yen or more in which the top three firms together account for a share of more than 70 percent, raise prices of their goods within three months of each other.
