Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said this in Jakarta today in response to a statement issued by (Wu Chiaming), spokesman of the PRC Foreign Ministry, calling on the Indonesian Government to immediately curb the demonstrations by workers in Medan which led to anti-Chinese riots. The Indonesian Government's determination to deal with the riots was reflected in the remarks by President Suharto and other high-ranking officials who sought to take strong action against the rioters because the demonstrations led to destruction acts based on the sensitive SARA [tribal, religious, racial, and intergrouping conflicts] issues.
