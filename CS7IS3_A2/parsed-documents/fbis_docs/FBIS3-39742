The chairman of the Senate Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee, Xavier de Villepin, told AFP Leotard had noted that UN troops were lightly armed and confirmed that Sagaie tanks would be sent in the near future. The tanks, which are equipped with 90-mm guns, will be shipped to former Yugoslavia from the southern port of Toulon, he said. He emphasised that the tanks were to reinforce materiel for troops already on the ground and would not be operated by the troop reinforcements France has pledged. French UN troops in Bosnia are already equipped with this type of tank, which is the heaviest weapon in their armoury.
