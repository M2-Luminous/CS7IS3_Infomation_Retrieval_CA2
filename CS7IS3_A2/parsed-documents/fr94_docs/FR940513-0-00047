FR940513-0-00047 FR940513-0-00010 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 91&hyph;AWA&hyph;3] RIN 2120&hyph;AE46 Alteration of the Denver Class B Airspace Area; CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date. SUMMARY: On September 17, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area. On January 20, 1994, a correction to the final rule was published to correct certain airport reference point and navigational aid (NAVAID) coordinates for the new airport, and to reflect that the Denver Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) has been upgraded to a Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) facility. In view of further delay in the opening date of the new Denver International Airport, this action delays the rule's effective date indefinitely. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the Final Rules at 58 FR 48722, as postponed at 58 FR 60552, as corrected at 59 FR 2953, and as postponed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 17, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area. Subsequently, on November 17, 1993, a delay of effective date was published and on January 20, 1994, a correction to the final rule was published to correct an error in the coordinates for the airport reference point and the supporting NAVAID for the new Denver International Airport, and to reflect that the Denver VOR has been upgraded to a VOR/DME facility. Most recently, the FAA had delayed this rule until May 15, 1994. The official opening of the Denver International Airport has now been delayed indefinitely due to the automatic baggage system difficulties. Accordingly, the effective date of the alteration and correction of the related Class B airspace area should be delayed indefinitely. Once the opening date of the new airport is determined, the FAA will publish another rule indicating the effective date of this rule. Because the public needs to be made aware of this delay immediately, notice and public procedure are impracticable and good cause exists for making this action effective in less than 30 days. In consideration of the foregoing, effective May 13, 1994, the effective date of the final rule altering the Denver, CO, Class B airspace area (58 FR 48722; September 17, 1993), as delayed at 58 FR 60552 (November 17, 1993), as corrected at 59 FR 2953 (January 20, 1994), and as delayed at 59 FR 10744 (March 8, 1994), is delayed indefinitely. Issued in Washington, DC, on May 10, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
