In his words, the date was changed from February 18 because Boris Yeltsin has not completely recovered from his recent illness and because representatives of the country's regions think the message should be read on the eve of the expanded government meeting which is scheduled for February 25. The Council agreed with Filatov's arguments and left the debate of the Constitutional Court bill out of the Duma's February 17 agenda because the president's headquarters had to discuss numerous provisions of the bill with its authors, the Court. Filatov also informed the State Duma Council on the proposal, made by the president's headquarters, on the housing of the lower house. Two or three months after the repair in the Russian Management Academy building is complete the Duma can move into it and next fall, into the former Gosplan's building in Okhotny Ryad. A decision was made that this proposal should be discussed first by parliamentary groups and then by a plenary session of the State Duma. The lower house speaker Ivan Rybkin told the Council that President Yeltsin had decided to let former people's deputies of the USSR and Russia stay in their Moscow flats provided to them by the government.
