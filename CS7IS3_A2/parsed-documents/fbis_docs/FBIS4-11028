The minister also said that a survey of the participants was disclosed during the meeting [not further identified]. The survey revealed that Panama and Nicaragua are the countries with the worst economic growth forecasts. The survey also showed that those surveyed pointed out that the political stability of a country is the main factor to take into account when investing abroad. Cardenas underscored that during an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) assembly, U.S. officials attacked Panamanian regulations for fighting money laundering and drug trafficking. She added that this is because of the lack of information on the country's measures against these two scourges. The official pointed out that she defended herself from the constant attacks that some U.S. senators made during the meeting, because Panama's image abroad is not very clear.
