[Javier] Solana says that it was the most difficult negotiation in his life. He added that Spain had to fight alone to defend its interests, and that with this agreement our fishing fleet is truly integrated into that of the Community. In order to finish the enlargement negotiations a compromise still has to be found regarding the most difficult topic, institutional reform, the minority blocking vote. Concerning this issue, Solana hopes to reach an interrim and balanced formula. Over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. [Fernandez Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish foreign minister believes it probable that there will be an agreement next Tuesday [22 March] concerning the blocking minority because he hopes that a compromise formula will succeed. It will be somewhere between that of the other Community members who favor the figure of 27 votes to block a Community decision and the Spanish position which goes along with the 27 votes but wants to keep the figure 23 for certain topics as long as the 23 represent three countries with more than 100 million Community citizens. There are difficult days of negotiations ahead, days when Spain will be alone says the minister, Javier Solana, but the negotiations are going to be full of hope. [Begin Solana recording] We have a constructive spirit, we want to defend our interests and a certain type of European construction. But we are working constructively. If the others also work in this constructive fashion, I am sure we will find a solution. [end Solana recording] [Fernandez Cespedes] Javier Solana believes that Spain is now stronger after the fishing negotiation with Norway, a negotiation that has proved useful for Portugal too. He believes that we have met with the understanding and the respect of our Community partners and that we do not have to trumpet our triumphs as Norway does, because we are not under pressure of a referendum. [Begin Solana recording] We do not need that. We can speak clearly, without exaggerating or making a song and dance about it all. We have negotiated well, we did as well as possible. We tried to defend the interests of our country and I think we have managed to do so. [end Solana recording]
