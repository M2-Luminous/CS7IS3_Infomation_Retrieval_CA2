FR940830-1-00048 FR940830-1-00009 40 CFR Parts 122, 123, 131, and 132 [FRL&hyph;5061&hyph;4] RIN 2040&hyph;AC08 Proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of data availability and request for comments. SUMMARY: The purpose of this document is to announce the availability of three reports that EPA is considering as it develops the final Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (final Guidance) and to request public comment on the possible application of the data set forth in these reports in the final Guidance. The proposed Water Quality Guidance for the Great Lakes System (proposed Guidance) was published on April 16, 1993, in the Federal Register . Corrections to the proposed preamble and proposed rule text were published in the Federal Register on the same date and notices of additional reports and further corrections were published in the Federal Register on August 9, 1993 and September 13, 1993. The three reports being made available for public comment today are: ``Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests''; ``1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study''; and ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994.'' EPA wants to ensure that the public has an opportunity to comment on whether: the conversion factors for converting total recoverable metal criteria to dissolved metal criteria should be adopted in the final Guidance methodology for aquatic life; the fish consumption rates used in the development of human health criteria and values should be adjusted based on the results of the 1991&hyph;1992 Michigan Sport Anglers Fish Consumption Study; and the changes in the methodology for deriving Bioaccumulation Factors (BAFs) should be incorporated in the final Guidance. DATES: Written comments should be submitted on or before September 29, 1994. Comments postmarked after this date may not be considered. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Wendy Schumacher, Water Quality Branch (WQS&hyph;16J), U.S. EPA, Region V, 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604 (telephone: 312&hyph;886&hyph;0142). Commenters are requested to submit one original and four copies of their written comments. A copy of the reports identified in this document are available for inspection and copying at the U.S. EPA Region V, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, by appointment only. Appointments may be made by calling Wendy Schumacher (telephone: 312&hyph;886&hyph;0142). A reasonable fee will be charged for photocopies. The three reports are also available by mail upon request for a fee by sending a written request to the above address. Alternatively, copies of the three reports may be obtained for a fee upon written request or telephone call to the Educational Resources Information Center/Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education (ERIC/CSMEE), 1200 Chambers Road, Room 310, Columbus, Ohio 43212 (phone number: 614&hyph;292&hyph;6717). The report ``Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative Technical Support Document for the Procedure to Determine Bioaccumulation Factors, July 1994'' is also available for a fee upon written request or telephone call to the National Technical Information Center (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. The toll free number is 800&hyph;553&hyph;6847 and the local number is 703&hyph;487&hyph;4650. The NTIS Number is PB 94&hyph;202009. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth A. Fenner, Water Quality Branch Chief, (WQS&hyph;16J), U.S. EPA Region V, 77 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois, 60604 (telephone: 312&hyph;353&hyph;2079). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)) requires EPA to publish and periodically update National ambient water quality criteria. These criteria are to reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life and recreation. Section 118(c)(2) of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to publish water quality guidance for the Great Lakes System which includes guidance on numerical limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life and wildlife. The final Guidance will establish minimum water quality standards, antidegradation policies, and implementation procedures for waters within the Great Lakes System in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, including waters within the jurisdiction of Indian Tribes within the Great Lakes System. A. Results of Simulation Tests Concerning the Percent Dissolved Metal in Freshwater Toxicity Tests In the toxicity tests used to develop EPA metals criteria for aquatic life, some fraction of the metal is dissolved while some fraction is precipitated or bound to particulate matter. It is generally believed that dissolved metals are more available for uptake by aquatic organisms than the bound or precipitated metal fractions and thus more likely to exert a toxic effect. The present National criteria to protect aquatic life were developed using total recoverable metal measurements or measures expected to give equivalent results in toxicity tests, and are expressed as total recoverable. In the past, States and Tribes have independently made the decision to express their metals criteria as either dissolved metal concentrations or total recoverable concentrations when applying the National aquatic life criteria.
