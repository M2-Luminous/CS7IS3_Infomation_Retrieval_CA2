The main focus will be to provide a response to the issue of raising the consumption tax rate, which had been shelved, since the national welfare tax concept was brought up. An investigation was made as to how the tax reform might progress amidst turbid circumstances, including the fluid political situation. "Lead Tax Reform" "Ultimately, regardless of the political regime that is formed, only the government Tax Commission can lead the reform." These words were spoken by a certain senior official of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] on the morning of 13 April when speculations became rife about "Prime Minister Hata" succeeding Hosokawa. A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau states: "The final decision might be left to politics, but as long as there was a consultative inquiry, the government Tax Commission must naturally conduct deliberations to formulate a reply." Even if a Hata regime favoring tax reforms emerges, a political base in which a split has occurred might waver again at any time. In past tax reforms, the Liberal Democratic Party's Researach Commission on the Tax System played the leading role and the government Tax Commission had the supporting role. Replacing the inexperienced government which emerged with the inauguation of the coalition regime last July, the government Tax Commission took the lead in discussions and proposed the consumption tax rate hikes. However, from the yearend into early this year, the ruling coalition parties expressed great dissatisfaction about MOF leadership so the Tax Commission was forced to hide in the political shadows. Then came the sudden announcement of the national welfare tax concept in February. The MOF was criticized severely again for its high-handed action and, since March, it has cooperated patiently with the coalition parties' tax reform committee and adopted the strategy of laying the groundwork to present the government's "consumption tax rate hikes." However, the MOF posture is changing subtly because of the political instability. The situation is such now that the tax reform bill will not progress unless the government Tax Commission steps into the forefront. The Tax Commission had planned to time the presentation of its consultative reply with the end of the ruling party's tax committee deliberations in late June, but the possibility is strong now that the release date of substantive conclusions will be advanced to impose a framework beforehand on the ruling parties' tax reform deliberations. Tax Commission chairman, Hiroshi Kato, who shares the MOF's thinking, is "firm" that "moving deliberations forward is a national task regardless of the makeup of the political regime." Fact Is "Consultative Inquiry Was Requested" Justifications to push tax reforms are supporting that "firm" attitude. One justifying fact is that the consultative inquiry had already been requested when the prime minister announced his resignation. There are claims that since the prime minister announced his resignation immediately after the inquiry was requested, the deliberations themselves should be done all over again, but the MOF asserts that, "as long as was precedent when the prime minister requesting the inquiry and the prime minister receiving the reply have not been the same person, the government Tax Commission receiving the consultative request had every right to enter into deliberations." A senior official of the MOF Tax Bureau admits, "If Prime Minister Hosokawa had announced his resignation before the request was made to the Tax Commission, the schedule would have been disrupted greatly." Although it was a "close call," there is a world of a difference between receiving and not receiving the advisory request. Actually, since 5 April, when Prime Minister Hosokawa leaked his intention to resign to upper house councilors Shimomura and Nishikawa, the MOF is believed to have sensed the changes in the prime minister's position and maneuvered behind the scenes to "have him, at least, submit a request for advisory deliberations." On 5 April, a ministerial secretariat's senior official judged that "situation appears serious--the coming week will be critical," and started to gather information. The other justification is the revision of the fixed-rate tax reduction law. It was passed by the Diet in late March and, on that occasion, a "supplementary provision" was appended that income tax reductions would not be limited to the single fiscal year of 1994 but continued after 1995 on the assumption that drastic tax reforms will be carried out. Actually, though there is only an understanding that both the ruling and opposition parties agreed to carry out the tax reforms faithfully, the MOF is making maximum use of the supplementary provision, claiming "it has the responsibility to carry out a law decided by the Diet." The MOF adheres to that viewpoint in spite of the fact that at the time the law was passed, many remarked tauntingly that, "this is a strange law with the main provision limiting the tax reduction to 1994 and the supplementary provision mentioning the year after and later." After coordinating with the Prime Minister's Official Residence staff, the MOF incorporated this supplementary provision as an official commitment of "continued tax reductions" in the external economic reform plan announced in late March. The MOF views the tax reform plan as being well buttressed. Reform Is Uncertain The scenario could be disrupted if the political base wavers again, for some reason, forcing dissolution and general elections. If that happens, the government Tax Commission can suggest options but the political mechanism to consider them would be unavailable temporarily. For MOF authorities who were contemplating tax increases, the surprising support rate exceeding 70 percent recorded by the Hosokawa regime at the time of its installation was an unexpected reinforcement but the uncertain factor remains of what the support rate would be for the next regime. The MOF believes that the next government would be a "tax reform regime." However, the people hate tax increases. Looking back, many cases can be found where political regimes and parties campaigning for tax reforms lost elections. It is still unclear as to whether the next government can really carry out the reforms. [15 Apr 94 p 5] [Text] MOF Prepares Strategy Carefully--7-Percent Consumption Tax It it were "a measure to cope with recession" last year, then it is "a measure to cope with aging" this year. The government Tax Commission officials think that this year's key words for tax reforms should be different from last year's. The reason is that bright signs have begun to appear in the economy and the environment will now permit, accoding to Hiroshi Kato, Tax Commission chairman, "return to basic tax reform discussions on the best ways for the people to shoulder the burden of an aging society." "National Consensus" and Understanding From 5.1 persons in 1990 to 3.6 in 2000 and 2.1 in 2025--these figures show the number of workers (between 20 and 64 years) supporting a single person, 65 years of age or older. With the increase in social security benefits, the tax burden must increase but under the current tax system which relies excessively on workers' income taxes, the weight of the tax burden will be felt even more. This led to the concept that, through graduated structural easing of income taxes and increases in indirect taxes, "it is necessary to equalize the generational tax burdens" (Tax Commission's interim reply made last November). In its current deliberations, the Tax Commission will move another step forward and focus on the quantitative analysis of the people's tax burden required in the future. With the understanding that a national consensus was obtained to increase the ratio of indirect taxes, i.e., consumption taxes, the commission will even take up the concrete question of the rate of tax hikes. The commission's deliberations will be focused on the scenario of increased people's burden in the future revealed in late March by the "welfare vision for an aging society discussion group" (unofficial discussion group of the welfare minister). This vision, which was revealed officially after detailed adjustments between the MOF and the Ministry of Welfare, was actually so designed that it will lead to a set conclusion. It might be said this is a schemed calculation to yield again the tax rate of 7 percent which Prime Ministger Hosokawa mentioned as a "rough estimate" in his national welfare tax concept. If this scenario is viewed as the "most realistic case" (Tax Bureau senior official) to upgrade pension payments and medical services and improve nursing and child care, with respect to the future social welfare system, the ratio of the social welfare burden in the national income will rise from 13 percent in FY93 to between 15 and 15.5 percent in FY2000. Keeping pace with this, the tax burden ratio of social welfare benefits will increase from 4.8 percent in FY93 to 6.5 percent in FY2000. Including other charges (20.8 percent), separate from social security benefits, the entire tax burden ratio will rise from 25.6 percent in FY93 to 27.3 percent in FY2000. Calculated on the basis of FY93 national income, that would be an increase of more than 6.1 trillion yen in the tax burden. The sales tax revenue was 6.822 trillion yen in FY93 (revised budget base) and converted to sales tax ratio, the tax burden increase would be approximately 2.7 percent. To obtain a round figure, the simple calculation is to add 3 percent to the current consumption tax ratio and round it off at 6 percent. Vision Includes Social Assets The MOF must incorporate tax increase measures to make up for future income tax reductions. This is the reason why the MOF (Tax Bureau senior official) is asserting that the "minimum level of the consumption tax rate should be 7 percent," which includes an addition of little over 1 percent to the tax hike of little less than 3 percent mentioned in the vision. The basic plan drawn up by the MOF is already incorporated in the vision. At the press interview following the second general meeting of the Tax Commission, chairman Kato stated, "The welfare expansion project is not limited to such matters as nursing care and includes public works investments for road improvements, etc." It was a statement indicating that consideration will be given to the tax burden of not only the welfare vision but of a wide range of financial demands that will arise in the future. This is also related to the "external economic reform outline" of late March which stipulated supplementary additions to the basic public works investment plan to spend a total of 430 trillion yen over a 10-year period from FY91 to FY2000. The reason is that the outline mentions that securing adequate revenue sources had been the preconditon to the inclusion of supplementary additions. Is it possible to finance through tax hikes all of the steadily expanding fiscal demands, such as securing revenue sources to cover anticipated income tax losses for augmentation of the welfare program and providing for supplementary public works investments? In that case, "the consumption tax rate might climb to 10 or 15 percent" (Tax Commission official). However, such sudden tax hikes are not likely to be supported by the people. Hesitant About Reassessing Expenditures To gain the people's support, a certain official states, "it is necessary to bring up the idea of conducting a radical reassessment of the expenditure structure which is being slanted to vested privileges by politics persuaded by special interests." However, the MOF is perplexed that "legally and realistically, the Tax Commission was not given the function to delve into and consider concrete details involving expenditures." The said ministry knows through experience that it is difficult to cut expenditures dominated by vested interests. Increasing taxes while shelving the idea of reassessing the rigidified expenditure structure--if deliberations have to proceed under these conditions, the ideal of "creating a tax system to cope with an aging society," which the Tax Commission touts, might simply fade away.
