(Hidetoku Inoyama, president) has developed a new combustion method that doubles the efficiency of the processing of gaseous materials such as silane that are exhausted in semiconductor production processes. Combustible gasses and air are introduced to the waste gas from outside and the combustion temperature raised to increase the combustion efficiency. Recently, since silane is diluted and then exhausted at semiconductor plants, the amount of waste gas is large, and large combustors have become necessary. In contrast to this, this new system is said to be appropriate for semiconductor plants, since with it a combustor of half the size can be used with the same volume of waste gas. Toyo Sanso has plans to incorporate this technology into a waste gas processing system and put it on the market in the near future. The new combustion system developed by Toyo Sanso is technology for setting up a three layered pipe in the combustor, in which waste gas for processing silane, etc. flows through the innermost part, hydrocarbons through the layer outside that and a mixture of air and combustible gasses in the outermost layer. The combustor has also been improved to make for a construction that reduces heat loss. By optimally controlling the mixture ratio of air and combustible gasses, the combustion temperature is raised, and the combustion efficiency is improved using less combustible gas that with conventional combustion methods. At the same time, the problem of incomplete combustion is solved, and combustion exhaust no longer contains harmful materials. Silane is an easily combusted gas, but at semiconductor plants recently, it is diluted with nitrogen and the like to a concentration of several percent silane in order to prevent explosions or fires. Because of this, the gas to be processed is not easily burned, the amount large, and large combustors have become necessary. Silane, which is a compound of silicon and hydrogen, produces silicon oxide with combustion, and silicon oxide powder grows in a mushroom shape at the tips of nozzles and closes them off. With Toyo Sanso's combustion system, this problem is solved by controlling the high-temperature combustion so that it takes place at a distance from the nozzle.
