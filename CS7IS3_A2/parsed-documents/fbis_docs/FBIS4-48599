The two men met at Westbrooke, the president's official residence, for about one-and-a-half hours. "I am happy with the candid and harmonious manner in which we addressed this issue. We are discussing it as a very important and sensitive issue. I'm sure that with the good relationship between ourselves, we can address the matter to the satisfaction of all," Mr Mandela said. President Mandela said both he and Chief Buthelezi would now refer the matter to their respective organisations for any decision. "I am satisfied with the progress which we have made. It now depends of our organisations," he said. Chief Buthelezi said he had explained to Mr Mandela that the land in question had been transferred to the KwaZulu government three years ago. The government had then decided to transfer the land to different Zulu tribes living in the area as communal land. "There is nothing new in this. There is no hanky panky. It is insulting to suggest that the land was given to the king." He accused the media of "trying to drive a wedge between the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]". The two leaders also discussed the allocation of cabinet portfolios to the IFP and the siting of the KwaZulu/Natal provincial capital. Chief Buthelezi said the location of the capital should be put to the people of the province in a referendum. He said the IFP accepted the fact that it would not get the health portfolio as initially indicated. The ANC's Dr Nkosazana Zuma has been appointed minister of health. The chief, who was accompanied by deputy minister of security services Joe Matthews and Prince Gideon Zulu of the Zulu royal house, responded angrily when a journalist asked whether the land transfer may be repealed. "It seems to me you don't want peace in South Africa," he said.
