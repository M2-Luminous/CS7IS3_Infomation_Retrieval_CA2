FR941220-0-00002 FR941220-0-00001 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 225 [Regulation Y; Docket No. R&hyph;0843] Revisions Regarding Tying Restrictions AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is adopting a final rule amending the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y to permit a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary to offer a discount on its product or service on condition that a customer obtain any other product or service from that company or from any of its nonbank affiliates. Thus, the final rule would generally remove Board-imposed restrictions on tying when no bank is involved in the arrangement and the products are separately available for purchase by the customer. The Board believes that the amendment will relieve bank holding companies of a competitive disadvantage, promote efficiency in the delivery of services, and provide benefits for consumers. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 23, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gregory A. Baer, Managing Senior Counsel (202/452&hyph;3236), or David S. Simon, Attorney (202/452&hyph;3611), Legal Division; or Anthony Cyrnak, Economist (202/452&hyph;2917), Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. A bank engages in a tie for purposes of section 106 by: (1) Offering a discount on a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the condition that a customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any of its affiliates; or (2) allowing the purchase of a product or service only if a customer purchases another product from the bank or from any of its affiliates. Although section 106 applies only when a bank offers the tying product, the Board in 1971 extended section 106 to products offered by bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. 12 CFR 225.7(a). On July 27, 1994, the Board proposed an amendment to conform the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y more closely to section 106 and its focus on banks. 59 FR 39709 (August 4, 1994). The proposed amendment would permit bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied products are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries_in other words, when no affiliated bank was involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available for purchase at competitive prices. If the package arrangement included a product offered by an affiliated bank, the proposed amendment would not apply (although the arrangement might qualify for another exception adopted by the Board).
