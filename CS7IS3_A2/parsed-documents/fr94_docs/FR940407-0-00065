FR940407-0-00065 FR940407-0-00014 The EPA intends to review EIP's submitted as plan revisions based on the general SIP review requirements contained in sections 110(k), 110(l), 182, and 187 of the Act, as applicable, and associated Agency policies. For statutory programs, the Agency intends to review the plan revision and either approve or disapprove all or part of the revision within 9 months after the date of the State's submission of the plan revision, consistent with section 182(g)(3) and 182(g)(5) of the Act. For discretionary EIP's, Agency action on plan revisions submitted for review will be taken according to the same schedule as is applicable to any other type of plan revision. An EIP submitted as a plan revision will be deemed to be approved only upon an affirmative decision by the Agency. B. Definitions The definitions in today's notice include many terms drawn from the Act or other regulations or guidance documents, as well as new terms relating to EIP's. Key new terms are discussed below. 1. Economic Incentive Program Consistent with section 182(g)(4)(A) of the Act, for purposes of today's rulemaking, ``EIP'' is defined to mean a program which may include ``State established emission fees or a system of marketable permits, or a system of State fees on sale or manufacture of products, the use of which contributes to O 3 formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar measures.'' In addition, the Act expands this definition to include ``incentives and requirements to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures identified in section 108(f).'' For purposes of this rulemaking, this notice classifies EIP's into three broad categories: emission limiting, market response, and directionally-sound. This categorization is based on whether a quantifiable emission-related requirement is directly specified as an integral element of the program or whether the program depends upon marketplace decisions, in response to a program's incentive, to produce the intended emission-related objective of the program. Further, the categorization is a function of whether the results of the program are quantifiable. Emission-limiting strategies directly specify limits on total mass emissions, emission-related parameters (e.g., emission rates per unit of production, product content limits), or levels of emissions reductions relative to a program baseline that are required to be met by affected sources, while providing flexibility to sources to reduce the cost of meeting such limits. A marketable permits program (i.e., emission trading with source-specific mass emissions limitations, or caps) is a primary example of such a program. If every affected source in such a program complies with its emissions cap (taking into account both emissions generated by the source as well as any emissions trading), the program will necessarily achieve the specified emissions limits. A market-response strategy creates one or more incentives for affected sources to reduce emissions, without directly mandating emission-related requirements for individual sources or even for all sources in the aggregate. An emission fee program may be an example of a market-response strategy. In such a program, each source might be required to pay a fee on each unit of emissions. The response to the incentive, in terms of actions which affect emissions levels, will be determined by each source according to its abatement opportunities, costs, and other factors. Thus, each source has flexibility in determining its ultimate level of emissions (within any constraints imposed by other regulatory requirements). A consequence of programs based on market-response strategies is that actual emissions from affected sources may differ from the pre-implementation projected emissions level even if every affected source is in full compliance with the EIP requirements. This added degree of uncertainty in program results must be accounted for in designing such a strategy (see paragraph III.D.6.). Directionally-sound strategies do not yield quantifiable emissions reductions creditable towards RFP or attainment demonstrations. Such strategies may be included in an area's attainment plan, without credit, or in a maintenance plan if the strategy contributes to the area coming into or maintaining attainment. Emissions reductions from such programs are not creditable towards RFP or attainment demonstrations because the program lacks one or more of the basic program elements, such as a quantifiable program baseline or adequate emissions quantification procedures. However, a State may want to pursue such a strategy as a part of their overall program to attain and maintain the NAAQS. Directionally-sound strategies must not be used as the primary basis for any statutory EIP submitted pursuant to sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), and 187(g) of the Act. A number of different types of incentive strategies have been identified upon which EIP's could be based. Appendix X contains descriptions of different types of strategies, together with a listing of the TCM's included in section 108(f) of the Act. There is not, however, in all cases a direct correspondence between a type of strategy and the regulatory categories described above, since program design details can in some cases make a difference in the extent to which program results are quantifiable or dependent on market response.
