But, with the birth of the Czech state, even civil defense is getting a totally new look. We spoke of this with General Major Zdenek Zezula, engineer, who was put in charge of the Czech Republic Civil Defense Authority midway through last year. [Lenk] Government Resolution No. 126 decided to radically change the civil defense system. Can you comment on the changes? [Zezula] Government Resolution No. 126 was adopted in March of last year and, in the months that followed, some portions of the resolution were fulfilled. However, that cannot be said of the task that called for working out a new concept of civil defense by 30 June. The concept was such that the minister characterized it as casting the existing status in concrete for an additional two to three years. That is why, when I took on the job on 1 July, I first had to answer the question where civil defense would belong at all. Was it to be part of the Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Interior, or would it be a totally independent ministry? Following intensive negotiations, the view finally arrived at indicated that it would perhaps not be suitable for civil defense to currently leave the Ministry of Defense. But it would have to be created as a completely autonomous system so that, in the future, on the basis of political decisions, it could be transferred elsewhere at any time. That is what we based our subsequent work on when we proposed to the minister that certain steps be taken and when he accepted these proposals. One of the first and fundamental steps was the requirement that the military aspect of civil defense, which cast doubt upon the position of civil defense in the eyes of foreign countries--that is to say, the fact that military rescue regiments were subordinated to the General Staff--had to be changed very rapidly. [Lenk] It is precisely this that was probably in conflict with the Geneva protocols.... [Zezula] You are right. It was a legacy of the previous developments and the mission of civil defense at the time. It was therefore decided that the transition would be accomplished as of 31 December 1993. And this was successfully done. To take over regiments is one thing, but to do it in such a manner that the regiments would not recognize the fact that someone else was in command, particularly from the standpoint of their material, financial, and other support, was a matter that, at that time, literally kept me awake every night. Suffice it to say that we had to actually create an entire logistics system at the same time that, in the final analysis, must be capable of taking care of not only the regiments, but also the entire nonmilitary portion of the civil defense system. [Lenk] How did the mission of the regiments change on the basis of their altered subordination? [Zezula] Basically, the mission did not change. The regiments are perceived as central forces and resources of civil defense that should be used if local regional nonmilitary portions of the civil defense system prove unable to liquidate the consequences of disasters, catastrophes, and other extraordinary events in times of peace. [Lenk] I am coming to the nonmilitary civil defense components. What kind of fundamental changes will they undergo? [Zezula] I would say that it involved, speaking symbolically, yet another somersault. And it was much worse. Initial work on the project began sometime last year, in the spring, when the civil defense leadership promised the heads of okres offices that okres civil defense staffs would be done away with. I learned of it while mapping out the situation sometime in mid-August, and I was horrified to find out what was being done in that regard and what the views were as to how the system should function at all in the future. Moreover, there was a decision that the steps would have to be accomplished by 31 December. But we managed it. In August, the appropriate materials were dispatched to the government, and then in September the materials were forwarded to the Defense Council of the state. The council recommended that the material be finalized, and, in November, Government Resolution No. 660 made the change possible. It was a fairly stressful situation because we had to eliminate the okres civil defense staff order of battle as early as September so that we could let people go within the time limits stipulated by law. [Lenk] In place of the civil defense staffs, there are sections for the protection of the population at okres offices and municipal offices. What will they be doing? [Zezula] Essentially the same as the okres civil defense staffs were doing. [Lenk] You have in mind the building of shelters, the creation of stockpiles, training... [Zezula] Yes, perhaps even that. But the whole problem lies elsewhere. What is involved here is the fact that, although the chief of an okres office has the responsibility for civil defense, he had no one in his office to solve such problems. The civil defense staffs stood outside, and relationships were highly complex. So it was said that, if the chief of the okres office is responsible, let him have someone subordinate to him who can work on these matters. [Lenk] But, in this case, there can be no military personnel. [Zezula] No, the sections for the protection of the population will actually not have a single soldier. [Lenk] And what will the relationship be between your office and those sections? [Zezula] We shall direct them methodologically. That is because their mission will in fact be identical with that of the civil defense staff, which functioned here until now. There is an entire scale of functions--communication, warning, protecting the population, training, maintenance, etc. [Lenk] So you would like to say that those "popular" alerts at factories and offices and in schools, where, as the saying goes, there were monthly idiotic actions involving gas masks, will continue? [Zezula] You know, perhaps you will not believe what I am about to say to you, but I have received material from the United Nations having to do with requirements for the civil defense of the population, and, if we were to conduct ourselves in accordance with this material, we should have to expressly intensify our activities. [Lenk] What kind of threat is there anyway? Military, civilian, some other kind? [Zezula] Of course, also military threats. But civil defense today, as can be seen from the supplemental protocols accompanying the Geneva Agreements, is something altogether different. Briefly stated, what is involved is that civil defense be capable of making maximum use of its resources to benefit the population in times of peace--that is to say, in the case of disasters, catastrophes, etc. So that you should understand what I am saying, this is precisely the kind of activity that was perceived by the former civil defense system as an odd job. And there is absolutely no reason why our resources should not be utilized in peacetime. [Lenk] What then is ahead for civil defense this year? [Zezula] First of all, we are working on the Civil Defense Law, the principles of which should be presented to the government sometime in the fall of this year. At the same time, work is going on regarding the concept of civil defense; at the present time, interministerial estimating procedures are under way. The concept is to be presented to the government for discussion in the first quarter of this year. [Lenk] Will the Civil Defense Authority be scheduled for transfer out of the Ministry of Defense, after all? [Zezula] For the next two to three years, the situation is unequivocally given, which was also stated by the chairman of the Defense and Security Committee in parliament: The system of civil defense must be created within the framework of the Ministry of Defense but as an autonomous system. That is, thus, our principal task. We are even initiating the reorganization of regiments into rescue formations; that is what they will now be called. We are moving the regiment from Varnsdorf to Rakovnik because it is supposed to be involved in protecting the population of western and northwestern Bohemia and cannot get there at all from Varnsdorf in the winter. We are also resolving the problem of identifying the military portions of civil defense so that it would be clear that this is not an army--we will have different uniforms with our own emblem on them. So much for the military component of the civil defense system. The nonmilitary component is faced with a complicated task--the activity involving the separation of the civil defense functions from okres offices must be started, which means that, for example, we shall have to train all those people who entered the system at the okres level.
