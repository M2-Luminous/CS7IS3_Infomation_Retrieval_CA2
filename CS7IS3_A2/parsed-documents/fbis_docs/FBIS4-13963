FBIS4-13963 "drnes080_q_94001" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Bangladesh Opposition Demands New Elections; Strike Enforced Opposition Demands New Elections; Strike Enforced BK2604062194 Hong Kong AFP in English 0542 GMT 26 Apr 94 BK2604062194 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Dhaka, April 26 (AFP) -- A dawn-to-dusk strike called by Bangladesh's two main opposition parties demanding general elections under a neutral government crippled the capital city Tuesday [26 April]. Shops, schools, businesses and most offices shut down as activists from Sheikh Hasina Wajed's opposition Awami League party fanned out to enforce the strike, officials and witnesses said. Police stepped up patrols and guarded the office of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party. There was no report of violence in the city so far. The Awami League and the Jatiya Party of deposed Bangladesh president Hussain Muhammad Ershad called the strike to press the government to allow the staging of the next elections under a neutral caretaker government. The league, however, has exempted the port city of Chittagong and southern district of Bhola from the general strike. League MP [member of parliament], Tofael Ahmed, said the opposition was "preparing a common structure" for a caretaker government for supervising free and fair polls. "We will present it soon before the nation," he added. The league, Jatiya Party and the rightwing Jamaat-e-Islami have reportedly presented bills to parliament seeking constitutional provisions for such a government. Zia's administration has termed the opposition's demand as unconstitutional. Zia was elected in 1991 in polls supervised by a caretaker government, but the opposition charged her with rigging the ballot. Political sources said opposition parties were likely to unveil their plan for a caretaker administration later this month, and that they were discussing whether to boycott parliament's upcoming session scheduled to begin May 4. Zia has previously criticised the opposition-led protests saying they hampered her government's development efforts. Wajed said earlier this week that the Awami League will not sponsor strikes if the opposition was allowed to air its views on state-run television and radio stations. League officials said Tuesday's strike was withdrawn from Chittagong and Cox's Bazar sea resort districts for a local annual fair. It has been put off in Bhola because Zia was scheduled to open an power grid there.
