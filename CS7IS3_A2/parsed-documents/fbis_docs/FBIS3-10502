The Mexican Government will also express its disapproval of the construction of additional barriers at the border. During the Mexican-U.S. meeting to be held on Tuesday this week, the Mexican delegation will present its views regarding each of the actions taken by the U.S. delegation in the past few weeks. Rozenthal also denied that the military exercises announced by the U.S. Army to be conducted at Fort Bliss, Texas, pose a military threat to Mexico or that the exercises are in any way related to border or immigration matters. He added that at the end of this "high-level" meeting on immigration, authorities from the Mexican and U.S. consuls with offices along the border, in addition to officials from municipal, state, immigration, customs, and police organization, will participate in another session of the Liaison Mechanism for the Mexican-U.S. Border. During an interview, Ambassador Rozenthal commented that on this occasion the Mexican delegation "will have an opportunity to present its views" on the U.S. anti-migration policy, "an opportunity that was previously negated." "We were not consulted, only notified. For that reason, we will take this opportunity to present our specific remarks on those points," he said. Rozenthal added that he will meet with Doris Meissner, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization commissioner, to discuss migration and the use of border-crossing cards, measures the two countries will adopt as a function of NAFTA to facilitate the movement of businessmen among the three countries. Also, special importance will be placed on the human rights of Mexicans emigrating to the United States. In this meeting, the foreign secretariat delegation will present several proposals to control the entry of Americans into Mexico. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Mexico will have to show a personal identity document to prove their nationality. Rozenthal added, however, that the U.S. counterparts will be consulted prior to the enforcement of such an action. "We will not do anything without first asking their opinion, then we will take specific measures," he said, clearly alluding to the unilateral increase of Border Patrol police members, the application of new methods for the detainment of illegal aliens, and the construction by the United States of additional barriers at the border. The Mexican Government has rejected those actions not only because they hamper relations between the two countries but because Mexico's opinion was not taken into consideration. In today's meeting, Rosenthal will insist on a general solution of the immigration problem through full communication between the two countries, not through police actions such as those enforced by the U.S. Government. After presenting studies on the consequences of anti-migration actions on Mexicans living in the United States, Rozenthal's delegation will initiate legal actions on behalf of the Mexicans. Again discussing the U.S. Army's exercises in El Paso, Rozenthal said such exercises are conducted every year and that at no time has the Mexican Foreign Secretariat observed military actions related to border or immigration problems or the alleged deployment of military forces at the border.
