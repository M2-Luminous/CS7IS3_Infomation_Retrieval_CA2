Valentyn Landyk explained the necessity of acceding by the existence of customs barriers which "hamper the movement of commodities within CIS" as a result of which "Ukraine is losing market outlets". Deputy Minister of Economy Leonid Minin, and Mykhaylo Umanets, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the use of nuclear energy, who, in particular, referred to Ukraine's dependence on Russian nuclear fuel, supported him. Vice Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov, Minister of the Environment Yuriy Kostenko, and Ihor Podolev, the president's adviser on credit and financial issues, were resolutely against Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union treaty with the rights of a full-fledged member. Vasyl Yevtukhov reminded those present that earlier, when the issue on the accession to this union was raised, Ukraine made eight reservations which were to be taken into account. Ihor Podolev remarked that this treaty should be considered as a political rather than economic document and that it "gives nothing" to the economic integration. He also emphasized that it is possible to accede to the treaty only taking into account the current situation but not prospects for the future. In his opinion, such a union will be ineffective "because the CIS markets will not contribute to improving the quality of products". Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, also warned against this step in view of the negative consequences for the economic independence of Ukraine in 5 to 10 years time. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko reminded of the foreign political consequences for Ukraine in its relations with the West European countries in case it joins the treaty, in particular, in view of the signing of an agreement with the European Union on 23 March. He was inclined to the opinion that it was necessary to analyze the text of the treaty in detail. Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy agreed with the proposal made by Anatoliy Zlenko and proposed that this issue be considered later. On 25 March chief of the department for relations with the CIS countries at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Kostyantyn Petrov remarked during his conversation with a UNIAN correspondent that "talks to the effect that Ukraine should fully accede to the treaty have long been in progress, some people really believe that Ukraine will have more opportunities within a single economic space. However, those documents are being worked out so far which relate only to Ukraine's associate membership in the economic union." The final say, as Kostyantyn Petrov emphasized, belongs to the president.
