FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Project Manager, San Carlos Indian Irrigation Project (Joint Works), P.O. Box 250, Coolidge, Arizona 85228. Telephone: (602) 723&hyph;5439. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority to issue this document is vested in the Secretary of Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and the Act of August 14, 1914 (38 Stat. 583, 25 U.S.C. 385), and has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs pursuant to Part 209 Departmental Manual Chapter 8.1 A and Memorandum, from Chief of Staff, Department of the Interior, to Assistant Secretaries, Heads of Bureau's and Offices, dated January 25, 1994. The assessment rate is based on an estimate of the cost of normal operation and maintenance of the irrigation project divided by the project acreage. Normal operation and maintenance is defined as the cost of all activities involved in delivering irrigation water, including labor, materials, equipment and services for irrigation canals, dams, flow control gates, pumps and other facilities. DATES: The effective date of the annual assessment rate adjustment is October 1, 1994. The basic assessment rate was set at $35 for Fiscal Year 1994. This rate was set with the understanding that the BIA was implementing Public Law 102&hyph;231, which called for divestiture of the power division at San Carlos Indian Irrigation Project. That divestiture effort has been terminated and the costs associated with it have been removed from the assessment rate calculations. Pursuant to the Act of June 7, 1924, (43 Stat. 476) and supplementary acts, the Repayment Contract of June 8, 1931, as amended, between the United States and San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District, and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Order of the Secretary of the Interior of June 15, 1938, the basic assessment rate for the operation and maintenance of the Joint Works of the San Carlos Irrigation Project for Fiscal Year 1995 is hereby fixed at $30 for each assessable acre of land. The assessment is due and payable on or before the 15th of May prior to the fiscal year the assessment is for, as provided in the Act of June 7, 1924 (43 Stat. 475&hyph;476), as implemented by the Repayment Contract between the United States and the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District, (as supplemented on November 12, 1935 and May 29, 1947) and the Secretarial Order defining the Joint, District and Indian Works of the San Carlos Federal Irrigation Project, turning over Operation and Maintenance of District Works to the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District.
