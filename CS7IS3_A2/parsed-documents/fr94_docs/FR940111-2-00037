FR940111-2-00037 FR940111-2-00017 One commenter, a pretreatment program manager, expressed concerns and raised questions regarding the clarity of the pretreatment program procedures and the level of resources needed by the DENR to administer the pretreatment program: ``1. I feel DENR must elaborate and develop a procedure for entering into a joint powers agreement with a municipality in order for DENR to run a municipal pretreatment program. There is nothing in the submission that indicates the extent to which DENR will administer the program, especially if a large municipality requests the Department run their program. 2. Does DENR have the authority to flatly refuse to administer a municipal pretreatment program? 3. If DENR issues a SWD Permit to a POTW and mandates the development of a pretreatment program, can the POTW in turn request the State to administer the program? If so, what are the procedures for requesting that DENR administer the program? 4. Assuming the State becomes delegated, what is the timeframe for previously approved pretreatment programs to submit notice to the DENR that the POTW wishes to continue administering the program? 5. I honestly feel that if ONE of the larger POTW's [sic] request that DENR administer their pretreatment program, along with all of the other smaller POTW pretreatment responsibilities the state will assume, the Department will not have enough personnel to adequately administer this program.'' A second commenter proposed that the following be added to the administrative rules: ``74:03:26_A POTW that intends to discharge wastewater to a separate POTW which is under a different authority must submit a request for approval to the Secretary at least 90 days prior to discharge. The Secretary must evaluate the impact of industrial user wastes on contributing POTW and receiving POTW. The Secretary may choose one of the following options to protect both POTWs from significant industrial user discharges: (1) Require contributing jurisdiction to establish a Pretreatment Program in accordance to [sic] the requirements in 40 CFR Part 403.8(a) and the State provide direct oversight over program. (2) State implement a POTW Pretreatment Program in lieu of the contributing jurisdiction as set forth in 40 CFR Part 403.8(e). (3) Control all significant industrial users in the contributing jurisdiction directly by conditions established in 74:03:26:03 to 74:03:26:14 and the State of SD Pretreatment Program.'' B. EPA's Response to Comments ARSD Section 74:03:26:02 and Section V of the Program Description provide for development of a joint powers agreement in cases where a POTW required to develop a pretreatment program has requested the DENR to assume pretreatment program requirements. This request is to be made within 30 days of notification that the State has been delegated the pretreatment program or within 30 days of the facility being notified that it is required to develop a pretreatment program. In the latter case, this notification would be made either at the time of issuance of an NPDES permit with such a requirement or the conclusion of an enforcement action imposing such a requirement. EPA believes that any POTW can request that the State assume responsibility for a local pretreatment program, subject to implementation of an agreed-upon joint powers agreement. It appears that the DENR may refuse to administer a program only if no joint powers agreement is developed within forty-five days after notification of intent by the POTW. EPA agrees that the DENR should provide more detailed instructions to POTWs regarding the joint powers agreement process. This can be done at the time the POTW requests the DENR to administer its pretreatment program, since the procedures may vary somewhat depending on the extent and content of local legal authorities and procedures at each facility when the request is received. The DENR will be required upon authorization to supply whatever resources are necessary to ensure that all pretreatment program activities are fully implemented and enforced. DENR staff are knowledgeable about the resources required to implement a program. SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;120 provides for the DENR to collect annual fees from, not only the POTW for which it administers the pretreatment program ($35,000), but each pretreatment industrial user ($600 plus up to $1,600 per process line for analytical testing). These fees, plus any legislative appropriations, would be the financial basis for DENR administering the overall state pretreatment program and individual programs with which it has joint powers agreements. Regarding the proposed rule changes, EPA finds additional rules are not needed to provide the State the authority to require a POTW to develop a pretreatment program or to request that the DENR administer the program in lieu of the POTW. The State is not required to offer POTWs the option to develop or have programs developed at POTWs which do not meet the criteria contained in 40 CFR 403.8(a), as seems to be suggested by the second commenter's proposed rules. Conclusion The pretreatment program described adequately meets the requirements of 40 CFR 403.10(f). The Program Description outlines the process for joint powers agreements. EPA recognizes that the specific steps for developing joint powers agreements between the DENR and an individual POTW may vary according to the situation at each municipality. EPA will continue to play a significant review and oversight role in the development and implementation of joint powers agreements.
