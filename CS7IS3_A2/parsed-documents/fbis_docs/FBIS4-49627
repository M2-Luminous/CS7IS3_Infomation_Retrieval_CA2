Beginning July 1, more than 90 percent of all imports will be allowed to enter Taiwan freely, the board said. The board has drafted a "negative list" which will go into force July 1. Products on the list will either be prohibited from entering Taiwan or need import permits. With the exception of those on the list, all other products, accounting for 92.4 percent of the 9,305 items covered in the BOFT- compiled product catalog, can be imported into Taiwan freely, BOFT officials said. Products on the "negative list" make up only 7.6 percent of the total number of items covered in the official catalog, the officials noted, adding the list was designed mainly to protect some local industries, national security, public health and the environment. The "negative list" comprises 227 items which are totally banned from importation and 479 other items which can be imported with BOFT permission. Those items prohibited include intestines, rice, chickens, mushrooms and sugar, while those which need government permission before being imported include red beans, peanuts, [words indistinct], fruits, compact cars and motorcycles. At present, 2.4 percent of products are prohibited from import, 6.3 percent need BOFT permission, 9.5 percent require import licenses issued by banks authorized by the BOFT, and 81.6 percent can be imported freely. After July 1, importers of 764 items which are not on the negative list must still present certificates issued by relevant government agencies, the officials said. Those products include medicines, animal feed, pesticides, medical equipment and publications. Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 as a separate customs territory and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
