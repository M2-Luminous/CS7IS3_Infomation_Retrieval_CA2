The industrial strategy group chaired by the ONERA [National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research] president, government general inspector Marcel Benichou, handed over its report, "The Future of Industry-Related Industries," prepared at the request of the General Commissariat to the Plan. For one year, some 60 professionals of all kinds (government officials, manufacturers, union members, etc.) worked in groups on seven different themes. They thus worked out various strategic choices designed to adapt the French defense industry, which has already lost 25 percent of its personnel, to the geostrategic new deal. These choices should also enable it to go through the crisis without excessive damage. In the 244-page report, the group recalled the assets of the industry: the human potential represented by 230,000 direct jobs (plus 100,000 indirect jobs), a technological base, and first rate material resources. Its survival, they wrote, will require restructuring companies, making them powerful and able to export, and "mastering access to European markets." The latter will involve integrating the defense branch (which is not covered by the Rome Treaty) into the European Market, and adopting pragmatic rules for community exchanges together with a policy of reciprocity toward U.S. protectionism, rather than generalized "European preference." To ensure the survival of French defense industries, Marcel Benichou's group recommended adapting them along five lines: - Restructuring the industrial plant to make it fit the demand; the balance thus achieved might be as much as one-third lower than it was in the eighties, depending on the scenario considered: that would mean losing from 59,000 to 131,000 jobs (see table page 7 [not reproduced]). However, Marcel Benichou believes that prime contractors must retain their full design and engineering capacities in the subsectors preserved and still provide adequate workloads to their subcontractors, while subcontractors have to diversify into non-defense industries. Finally, the report recommends the creation of an interministerial fund to help small to mid-size companies and industries survive. - Accelerating the search for a new cooperation framework while eliminating the perverse effects of cooperation, such as administrative red tape and the law of "just return." Cooperation agreements should evolve toward capitalistic groups (the economic interest group setup is no longer adequate) and the integration of technological, industrial, and marketing resources into competitive groups. In addition, the creation of a European Arms Agency will make it possible to organize research, exploratory developments, testing centers, and programs on a European scale. - Rationalizing budget expenditures: for governments, this will mean adopting longer-term military programming laws and adhering to them more closely (even if they have to be revised halfway through); respecting program implementation schedules by avoiding costly delays and the simultaneous launching of many programs; and revising the bylaws of nationalized companies (or arsenals), which hinder management flexibility and marketing dynamism. - Technological adaptation: it will have to include increased consultation between civil and military departments and manufacturers, through technological groups set up to prepare sectorial plans and an advisory committee in charge of summarizing these plans. The report also identifies 24 technological sectors of critical importance for the future. Eight of these are top priorities and require full independence at French level: the nuclear sector, structural materials (including composites) and their implementation processes, micro- and nano-electronic components, propulsion systems, navigation equipment, signal detection and processing, mastery of signature and stealth-related technologies, and mastery of complex systems. Another ten are intermediate priorities and could be shared with WEU [Western European Union] countries, and the last six are lesser priorities and could be shared with non-WEU countries. - Improved marketing: this will require faster government decision-making and greater use of military resources for promotional purposes. Manufacturers should improve after-sales service by making greater use of government networks abroad. Finally, the report recommends the creation (by the government or by the industry) of a body responsible for training future industry or government agents.
