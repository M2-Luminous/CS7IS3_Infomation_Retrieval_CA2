According to the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the expenditures of government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with the government will be 56,294 billion rials[R], which makes up more than 70 percent of the expenditures. The economic correspondent of RESALAT reports that the budget of government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with the government will increase by 59.7 percent next year. The amount of the budget of government companies next year is projected at R50,034 billion; for-profit establishments affiliated with the government, R1,043 billion; and banks, R5,216 billion. According to this report, while in next year's budget the income of government companies and banks has been estimated at R47,937 billion, these units will have R52,300 billion in expenditures. In other words, government companies and banks will spend a total of R4,363 billion beyond their revenues. Government companies and banks will receive R7,313 billion in loans from domestic sources in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], and only R2,412 billion will be repaid that year. The national budget next year has been estimated to be R79,686 billion, of which R36,011 billion is from revenues gained, including those from oil, taxes, and special and other revenues. Of the revenues of the national budget, 27.7 percent is income from oil; 8.13 percent from taxes; 70 percent from government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with the government [percentages as published]. It is noteworthy that those items that have been included twice have not been deducted from the above-mentioned revenues. Next year, the government has projected R2,224 billion in special revenues in its general budget. Due to the procedures for the collection and payment in this budget, a need for more control and supervision is felt with regard to them. The general budget, which was set at R25,425 billion in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], will reach R36,011 billion in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with 41.6 percent, which is about a threefold increase over the final figure in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. Economic experts believe that, considering the failure to realize the projected oil revenues this year (1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]), the fact that there is no clear picture of price increases due to the continuing crisis in the world oil market, the deviation of members from production quotas, and the likelihood of Iraq's entry into the market, the oil revenues that have been projected on the basis of $14 per barrel must be evaluated and examined. The oil revenues, which in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] were in practice R5,133 billion, based on the budget law this year are set at R15,597 billion. This figure will increase to 22,096 billion for next year. Economic experts believe that since the tax figures ratified for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] have not yet been obtained, an increase in tax figures, at least within the existing mechanisms, will face problems with regard to collection next year. Taxes collected in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] amounted to R3,773 billion. This amount was projected at R5,409 billion , which did not materialize in practice. In 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], taxes have been projected at about R6,400 billion. Next year, from the source of the general revenues, R12,613 billion have been allocated to implementing developmental expenditures and R21,153 billion to developmental expenditures [as published], which compared to the funds ratified for this year (1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]) mark an increase of 30.2 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. [as published] The complete elimination of the single foreign currency rate as a result of setting the foreign currency for basic goods, oil products, medicine, and defense items at a floating rate and making up the difference through rial subsidies as well as changing the rate of tariffs on electricity, oil products, and telephone are other features of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, which were reported earlier by RESALAT. It is noteworthy that the government has projected R3,005 billion in subsidies for essential goods, R600 billion in subsidies for chemical fertilizers, R30 billion to make up the difference in the rate of foreign currency to publish textbooks, and R210 billion for recreational hajj pilgrimages.
