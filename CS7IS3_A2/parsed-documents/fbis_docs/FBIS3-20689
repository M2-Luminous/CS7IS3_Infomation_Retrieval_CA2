One of the sides would make a sacrifice and renounce its "first-born son," while the other would renounce its political strategy of an integral and nonunitary Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, any conciliation between two fierce opponents can only last a very short time, and as soon as the common threats recede, they, by the nature of their missions, will start plotting against each other's lives. This is why at the Second Congress of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] Dr. Tudjman simply had to put in completely different people that did not belong to either line. He recently pointed out that certain people belonging to the left and right of the HDZ hoped that the new inexperienced and plain center would fail. He added that it would not and could not fail. The same model for nominating the nine-member Presidential Council of the republic of Herceg-Bosna was used in resolving the conflict within the Croat corps in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Unfortunately, Boban's policies are not going with him. The well-informed say that he built his policies on admiring the Serbs, especially Karadzic, and belittling the Muslims and Izetbegovic. They say that he simply overestimated the Serb power, and completely underestimated the Muslim national element. He trusted Karadzic too much, almost worshipping him. He and Karadzic mutually encouraged their image of the state-forming and military incompetence of the Muslims. The consequences of this have been more than fatal to Croatia and the Croats. To what extent the war conflict between the Croats and Muslims arose from the policy of overestimating one side and underestimating the other will certainly be a subject of future research, but one thing is certain: If Boban had remained leader of Herceg-Bosna, NATO would have, after Sarajevo, started threatening the Croats because of Mostar. Boban was, with his policies, the symbol of success of the Croat-Serb relations, but also a hostage of Karadzic's success. Since he could not keep up with him in the military and propaganda terms, he had to step aside. Karadzic imposed the sanctions on Serbia, and Boban realized that he was going to spare Croatia that punishment if he withdraws. The most fatal thing for him was overestimating the power of the Herzegovinian Croats, and underestimating the power of the Church among the Croats. Since Boban has left, it is likely that the relations among the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina will become more balanced, as will the relations of the Croats with the Muslims and Serbs. The NATO decisions of 9 February will certainly have an impact on that. The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs will present Croatia with a difficult question: If the West is declaring war on the Serbs, can Croatia be left out? The other difficult question concerns the new U.S.-French plan, according to which the Serbs and Croats should provide about 37 percent of the territory for the Muslims. The result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy is the increasing insistence of the western world on the integral and internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The entire West now opposes what VECERNJI LIST presented as the only possible Croatian policy. According to the editorial in the 10 February issue, this policy consists of the following: "Let us not philosophize too much. What is, in a simplified sense, the issue? (this concerns the political implication of Dr.Tudjman's sentence "Mate [Boban], be as much a person from Zagorje as I am a Herzegovinian") On the other hand, Tudjman is offered an agreement with Milosevic, who is prepared to renounce his proteges in the Croatian UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], but under the condition that the accounts be squared in Bosnia-Herzegovina." It seems that this "squaring of accounts" will not be at the Muslim expense, and the issue of the UNPA's is raised as independent of the resolution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will the Croats continue to die by both Serb and Muslim hand? Alain Juppe's visit to Sarajevo and Zagreb was intended to persuade the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to reach a political solution. As far as the Serbs are concerned, they are left with ultimatums; "it is a question of dignity and honor," said Juppe, threatening the Bosnian Serbs. After all the events, Karadzic defends himself with absurdities, showing that any rational dialogue with him is impossible. He is a man who sees dummies instead of dead people. Any attempt to make an arrangement with him is senseless, and at the expense of the one who gets involved in a dialogue with him. Those who do not live in the damnation of lies should not negotiate with this tyrant. In this light, the policy that states that it would negotiate with the Satan himself if it is in the interest of Croatia does not stand a chance. The issue of Mate Boban crops up here. Karadzic could have made, or even indicated, a concession, and he would have spared him the resignation. The question is why Karadzic wrote Mate Boban off, not having given him a chance of political survival.
