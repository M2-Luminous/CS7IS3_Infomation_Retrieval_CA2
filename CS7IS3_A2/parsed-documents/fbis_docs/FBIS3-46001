Undoubtedly, state-owned enterprises must be given great credit for the prosperity of the Republic today and for the strong material base on which reform and opening up are being carried out. However, as economic structural reform deepens and the construction of a socialist market economy accelerates, difficulties encountered by state-owned enterprises in production and management have become increasingly acute. The heart of the problem is their slow growth in economic efficiency. For example, profits delivered and taxes paid by state-owned industrial enterprises grew a mere 1.1 times between 1980 and 1992, far below the 3.14 times registered by collective enterprises and the 33.5 times registered by enterprises of other types of ownership. There are some state-owned enterprises which are unable to grow or which even suffer large losses. It is true that the predicament of state-owned enterprises today was caused by the shortcomings of the unitary planned economic system which the country implemented for a long period. However, we must not deny that the heavy historical burden on the shoulders of state- owned enterprises is an important reason why the "dragon" cannot take off. Speaking at a national conference on restructuring the economy late last year, a principal responsible person from the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy made a resounding call: To change course in accordance with the requirement of a modern enterprise system, state-owned enterprises must resolve the question of their heavy historical burden in a unified way. This has struck a sympathetic chord in various quarters, particularly among the vast numbers of state-owned enterprises. Entrepreneurs generally agree that the call points to an important link in reforming state-owned enterprises and that the opportunity offered by reform should be seized to resolve this issue of the "burden" once and for all. How to unload the "burden?" It can be unloaded through reform and by approaching the problem from two directions, the state and the enterprises. An authoritative analysis carried out by a state department indicates that the historical "burden" on the shoulders of state-owned enterprises consists of four major thing, namely enterprises' debt burden; an inadequate accumulation to cover the social insurance of veteran workers; the transfer, unemployment, and rehiring of surplus personnel; and social undertakings carried out by enterprises. To lift state-owned enterprises' historical burden and to enable them to operate according to a new system, the paramount issue is to rationally adjust the structure of their assets and liabilities and to resolve the question of their debt burdens based on the need for fair competition in the market. The idea adopted by the departments concerned is to determine, on a case-by-case basis, the amount and ratio of the debts borne by enterprises as a result of the change from appropriations to loans, and to transform these loans into invested capital in the form of increased state investment. The question of other types of debts can also be resolved by a variety of means, including transforming creditor's rights into shareholder's rights. As to the difficult problem arising from shortages of accumulation to cover veteran workers' social insurance, it should be resolved by exploring new approaches to replace workers' insurance with social insurance and to do so in a unified manner. In the process of reforming the system of property rights through auctioning off state assets, carrying out mergers, and adopting a stockholding system, experiments may be conducted to appropriate a certain proportion of social insurance funds from state assets for use in covering veteran workers' social insurance. This approach can unload the "heavy burden" currently borne by the backs of enterprises while removing veteran workers' concerns about life after retirement. Surplus manpower is another difficult problem caused by the protracted implementation of a planned economic system. The current situation is that there are too many surplus personnel in state- owned enterprises, and the reform of the enterprise system and adjustment of the industrial structure will create an additional large number of surplus personnel. After analyzing this issue, an authoritative person hit the nail on the head with the remark: If the question of "excess employment" in state-owned enterprises is not resolved, fair competition between state-owned enterprises and other types of enterprises will become empty talk. To resolve this question, the state has decided that surplus personnel created in the course of enterprise reform should be transferred primarily to tertiary industries and that the state will give these preferential treatment in terms of taxes, credit, and real estate. At the same time, it encourages some workers to transfer to village and town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private enterprises. It also urges workers to themselves look for work. However, workers at state-owned enterprises, after leaving state-owned enterprises, should enjoy rights to and interests in social insurance and housing commensurate with their years of service. In resolving the question of enterprises carrying out social undertakings -- the fourth major difficulty encountered by state-owned enterprises -- the state has made clear the policy of gradually stripping enterprises of their nonproductive undertakings. Schools for dependents, logistical undertakings, and services operated by enterprises and other social functions undertaken by them for long periods should be hived off as soon as possible. Some of the hived off functions are to be taken over by governments, some by independent social organizations, and some by enterprises established solely for such purposes. The time will eventually arrive for the dragon to take off. Through restructuring and innovation, state-owned enterprises will surely be able to meet the various severe challenges of economic competition in the marketplace with a new image. State enterprises will certainly regain their magnificent image, like the dragon soaring to the sky!
