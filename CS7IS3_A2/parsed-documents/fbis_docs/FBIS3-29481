Jayakumar said yesterday. Singapore would have no objections if the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was to reach a consensus on the matter, he said. [passage omitted] Mr Jayakumar described as "not finalised" Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's plan to visit Rangoon. Mr Jayakumar's comments came after a U.S. congressman said he believed it would be "premature" for ASEAN to invite Burma if there were no talks between now and July between Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the military junta's key member Lt Gen Khin Nyunt. Bill Richardson (Democrat-New Mexico) was replying to a reporter's question during a press conference on Wednesday after he became the first non-family member to be allowed to meet Suu Kyi in Rangoon. By July, the charismatic Burmese leader also will have been under house arrest for five years, normally the limit allowed by Burmese law. Foreign Minister Sqn Ldr Prasong Sunsiri earlier spoke of the possibility of Thailand, as this year's chairman of ASEAN, inviting Burma to the meeting of the group's foreign ministers. He raised the possibility after the last ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in Singapore. Sqn Ldr Prasong yesterday described the meeting between the U.S. congressman and Suu Kyi as an indication of improvements in Burma. But he said it would be "Burma's affair" whether or not the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council kept Suu Kyi under house arrest until at least next year. The Thai foreign ministry wanted to see better conditions in Burma before moving to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN meeting. The release of Suu Kyi was among a number of improvements sought. But Thai foreign ministry officials expressed confidence that there was still time for ASEAN to decide on the matter. Senior officials of ASEAN would not rush into the decision but closely monitor the situation in that country, a foreign ministry source said. One senior foreign ministry source described the U.S. congressman's remark on the question as an attempt by a U.S. politician to dictate to other countries in international politics. Meanwhile, the Singaporean foreign minister said he would like to see Thailand and Singapore work closely for "ASEAN interests" in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group. Mr Jayakumar said there were no controversial issues between Thailand and Singapore.
