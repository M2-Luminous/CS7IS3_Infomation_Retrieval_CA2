A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the unilateral move involved "major changes to the operation of government departments in Hong Kong, which is detrimental to Hong Kong's smooth transition". Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang disagreed and said: "We do not see that there is any contravention of the Joint Declaration". Mrs Chan on Thursday unveiled a code of practice detailing what information the public would have access to, although the code has no legal backing. It is not expected to be fully implemented until 1996. The proposal, she said was "simply a further move towards making the whole machinery more transparent in accordance with the wishes of the community". A government spokesman said the measures would "contribute to a smooth transition by responding effectively to developing public expectations". He said: "It is premature to make specific judgments about the effect on the operation of government. But a central objective will be to improve the efficiency of the civil service and enhance the accountability of the Government." Supporters of the call for a freedom of information act rejected the measures as inadequate. Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said "the so-called package of measures to further enhance the public's access to information" involved major changes over how the executive branch would be operated. Those matters should be discussed by the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) in accordance with the 1997 agreement, he said. "The unilateral move by the British Hong Kong Government without prior consultation and agreement with China is unacceptable to the Chinese side," Mr Shen said. The Joint Declaration says the JLG should discuss matters relating to the smooth transfer of government in 1997. A senior mainland official insisted that the proposal would bring about a "major impact" on the existing internal operation of the Government. "To say the least, it will adversely affect the efficiency of the Government," he said. "At present, the Government can do whatever it wants to without having to publicise information. Under the proposal, it will have to prepare a set of information that the public can have access to. "We have to take on board the fact that there's only three years to go (before 1997). It will increase uncertainty if you bring about a lot of changes to the system." The official said the move was a government plan to institute changes to the system of the post-1997 government. United Democrat Martin Lee Chu-ming said he could not see any provision in the Joint Declaration that would not allow Hong Kong to set up a human rights commission and access to information rules. Mr Lee said China's reaction reflected a different interpretation of law. The party yesterday urged Governor Chris Patten to give the go-ahead for the access to information law. Legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai urged China to explain how the Joint Declaration had been violated. She said Hong Kong had been promised the principle of "one country, two systems" under which it should be allowed to introduce policies according to the society's needs.
