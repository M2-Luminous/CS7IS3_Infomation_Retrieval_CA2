His ROK visit will be a return visit to President Kim Yong-sam's March visit to China, and will be the first occasion for a Chinese president to visit the ROK in the history of ROK-Chinese relations. The ROK and Chinese Governments have continued negotiations on President Jiang's ROK visit since 1992, when the two countries established diplomatic ties and former President No Tae-u visited China. They have recently made a rapid progress in the negotiations and generally agreed to the principle that he will visit the ROK in November. According to the agreement, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will come to Seoul on 4 June to discuss with the ROK Government the details of President Jiang's ROK visit. While confirming Vice Minister Tang's planned visit to the ROK, a Western source in Beijing said on 26 May: "I understand that, during Vice Minister Tang's stay in the ROK, the two countries will discuss various pending issues, including the issue concerning President Jiang's ROK visit." The source also said: "It is highly possible that President Jiang Zemin will visit the ROK and Indonesia in succession." Regarding this, a high-ranking source of China said on 26 May: "There will be no problem for the Chinese leader to visit the ROK in the latter half of the year, in view of progress made in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." The source added: "The Chinese leader's ROK visit will serve as a remarkable turning point not only in the partnership between the two countries, but also in relations between South and North Korea."
