Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for external affairs, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor confirmed the significance of the agreement during their 20-minute meeting here, Japanese officials said. Matsunaga, former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., and Kantor are in Paris to attend a two-day ministerial conference of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that opened Tuesday. Financial services and intellectual property rights have been added recently to the three priority industrial sectors for the trade "framework" negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. The original priority areas in the framework talks are government procurement, insurance, and trade in autos and auto parts. Working-level talks on financial services began in Paris earlier in the day between Japan's Finance Ministry and the U.S. Treasury Department. This followed the resumption of insurance trade talks in Tokyo last week after a hiatus of three and a half months. Financial services talks focus on ways to expand access by U.S. investment advisers to Japan's pension market, deregulation of securities business in Japan and steps to facilitate international deals on financial services. On intellectual property rights, Japan and the U.S. will study how to protect patents involved in "reverse engineering" for computer software.
