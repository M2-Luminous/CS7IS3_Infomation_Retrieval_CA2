At present, the production and sale of gold in China is subject to control by the People's Bank of China, the central bank in the country and its import and export are limited by state control. In order to meet the needs of the market economy, the state will consider the establishment of specialized gold markets in which designated enterprises will be allowed to engage in gold trading in line with the needs of their production and the state will no longer offer gold materials for production purposes to such enterprises, gradually opening the gold market to the outside world and allowing gold to be traded in a free way. After a price adjustment for the buying and selling of gold, the state will abolish its favourable policies for the gold industry including policy-based subsidies, low interest loans and the exemption of tax. Under current circumstances, however, it is not suitable for the market for gold production and sales to be opened to foreign businessmen and the imports and exports of gold will remain under the mandatory control by the central bank.
