"It is a fact for all to see that since 1949 and since the implementation of reforms in China, tremendous progress has been made," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. Wu reiterated Beijing's opposition to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to link the renewal of China's most-favoured- nation status this year with "significant progress" in its human hights record. "Trade is after all trade," Wu said. "We are categorically opposed to any linkage of trade with issues irrelevant to trade." He also stressed that it was not for foreign countries to comment on China's human rights policy. "It is the Chinese government and the Chinese people themselves who care most about human rights ... and who have the right to evaluate human rights in China." Despite its overwhelmingly negative conclusions, the State Department draft report praised China for engaging in human rights dialogue with the United States and releasing some political prisoners. Human rights is expected to be the focus of a possible meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that might be held at the end of January in Paris, Geneva or New York. The issue will also be raised when U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen visits Beijing on January 19 for trade talks with Chinese leaders.
