Doctor Engineer Horst Lennertz, board member at Preussen Elektra, is convinced that the demand for power, and especially current, will continue to increase. To be sure, the consumption of current required for each individual application will be less, but the number of overall uses for electrical current will grow constantly. The electrical current requirements would have to be met by a mix of different primary power sources. For that reason, German electrical companies will continue to rely on coal- and nuclear-powered plants, but current will also be generated from wind and solar power. Lennertz is further convinced that "at best, such regenerative sources could reach from 10% to 20% of the total share." Dr. Hermann Scheer, a member of the Bundestag, takes strong issue: "There is absolutely no doubt that renewable power sources must eventually replace the sources that have been used to date." The president of Eurosolar has labeled the persistence of the electrical companies "structural conservatism." CO[.sub]2[/]-emissions will only be significantly reduced when regenerative power sources occupy a substantially greater share of the total supply picture. A comprehensive support program for photovoltaics would help effect a swifter breakthrough. "Structural changes take decades," Professor Ernst Ulrich von Weizsaecker believes and proposes his own long-term program. Were power costs increased annually by means of an energy tax by only 5%, but over a period of 50 years, neither the individual consumer nor any specific branch of industry would suffer. In this regard, the president of the Wuppertal Institute looks forward to an "efficiency revolution," by means of which the standard of living reached per energy unit could be increased by a factor of 4. Adolf Huettl, member of the board at Siemens, remarked: "In all of these ideas about energy in the future, the simple fact that the worldwide demand for power will double by the year 2000. Without new fossil fuel-based and nuclear-power-based plants, this demand cannot be covered. It is true that regenerative power sources will gain in importance in the developing countries. German industry, as an exporter, is ready for this. Although German industry possesses the technological competence, it can only be maintained if the technologies are employed at home as well.
