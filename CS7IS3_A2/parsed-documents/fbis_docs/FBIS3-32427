After congratulating Figueres on his election victory over Social Christian Miguel Angel Rodriguez in yesterday's elections, the president noted that "we have a country with the highest growth in Latin America" (6.5 percent last year), which has reduced poverty from 23 to 17 percent and has brought the fiscal deficit under control, according to official figures. "I feel that the new president will bring his own ideas to the government and will have his focus, but it is very unlikely that the trend toward national unity will be broken," declared the head of state, who will surrender power on 8 May. According to Calderon, the fiscal deficit projected for this year -- 1.5 percent of the GDP -- is five times less than that for 1990, when he assumed office from social democrat Oscar Arias, a fellow party member of Figueres. The president explained he hopes to meet in the next few days with Figueres to begin the transition process. Calderon, 44, and Figueres, 39, are two of the youngest presidents in Costa Rican history. They are both sons of two of the most prominent leaders and former presidents the country has had in this century, Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia (1940-44) and Jose Figueres (1948-49, 1953-58, and 1970-74). The two former presidents were adversaries in a civil war in which the father of the next president of Costa Rica came out victorious and which marked the beginning of the model democracy this country has today.
