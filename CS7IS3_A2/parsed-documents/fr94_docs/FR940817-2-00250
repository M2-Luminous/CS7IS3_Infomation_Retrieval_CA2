FR940817-2-00250 FR940817-2-00113 4.3.2.1. Functional observational batteries. Functional observational batteries are first-tier tests designed to detect and quantify major overt behavioral, physiological, and other neurotoxic effects (Moser, 1989). A number of batteries have been used (Tilson and Moser, 1992), each consisting of tests generally intended to evaluate various aspects of sensorimotor function. Most FOB are similar to clinical neurological examinations that rate presence or absence and, in some cases, the relative degree of neurological signs. A typical FOB, as summarized in Table 4&hyph;3, evaluates several functional domains, including neuromuscular (i.e., weakness, incoordination, gait, and tremor), sensory (i.e., audition, vision, and somatosensory), and autonomic (i.e., pupil response and salivation) function.
