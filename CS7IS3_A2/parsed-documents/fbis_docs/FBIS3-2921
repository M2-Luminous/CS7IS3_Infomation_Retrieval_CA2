"For the surging tide of migrating rural labor," he said, "we should not take a blocking method. Rather, we should provide guidance over the direction of its flow by way of market principles." The suggestion was made by Gu Shengzu, a member of the national committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and an economics professor of Wuhan University, in a speech he made here today at a general session of the CPPCC National Committee members. Professor Gu first dealt with statistics. He said: China at present has over 400 million rural laborers. With 100 million absorbed by rural enterprises, there are still more than 200 million surplus laborers in rural areas. Among the surplus laborers, 50-60 million have left their villages to form what is known as a tide of migrating rural labor. That means, at least, over 100 million laborers in rural China need job placement. Moreover, surplus rural laborers will increase by more than 10 million each year. In the 1990s, he said, the issue will become increasingly serious. A markdown of the comparative benefits of farming will drive a great number of rural laborers to move in search of jobs. By the turn of the century, he said, China will have an army of about 100 million migrating rural laborers. Gu said, rural labor has promoted the economic development of regions where they work. They have contributed to construction projects for the 1990 Asian games, expressway construction in Beijing, development of Shanghai's Pudong, the Chang Jiang Three Gorges project, and the economic takeoff of the Pearl River Delta area in Guangdong. At the same time, he said, the labor tide is having an adverse impact on urban traffic and social order. Gu suggested that urbanization of rural areas be taken as a main channel for the absorption of surplus rural laborers to slow down the pace of their flow into big cities and avoid a waste of resources caused by scattered industrialization. His urbanization program calls for letting 300 small cities absorb 30 million surplus rural laborers, each taking 100,000; letting 2,000 county towns soak up 100 million, each taking 50,000; and selecting 2,000 towns and building them into small cities to absorb 100 million. "We need an innovative way to solve the problem," Gu said.
