In recent weeks, the public has been bombarded with a overflow of advertising material and statements about the programs of the various parties, both by the media and by post, which is not exactly the ideal way of gaining information. To help our readers, we have therefore compiled, below, a comparative analysis of the individual election statements of the five relevant parties represented in the Parliament. While this comparison is by no means complete, it will nevertheless give an impression of what the various parties have to say on different topics. We have restricted ourselves to matters which are currently under discussion or which relate to fundamental social issues. Christian Social People's Party [CSV] Income Tax: Thinks isolated tax benefits are possible, if necessary; stands by tax rehabilitation for married couples and the family as opposed to the unmarried and wants Luxembourg to keep the lowest indirect taxation in Europe. Index: Is in favor of maintaining indexation in inflationary times. Prospect of negotiations with the social partners on index modulation for those on higher incomes if inflation soars. Shorter Working Hours: Rejects legal reduction in working hours; this is more a matter for unions and management at company level. Security: Wants to increase numbers of police by 200 and set up additional police stations. Ecotaxes: Wants to introduce ecotaxes (on sewage purification, packaging, carbon dioxide products and special waste); for products and goods for which consumer alternatives exist, the ecotaxes should be entirely or partially immunized in the index. Hospital Insurance: Has own model of compulsory hospital insurance (for domestic or hospital nursing). Pensions: declares itself in favor of closer link between the two systems. Pensions should be further matched to the development of wages and prices and contribution rates frozen at their current level. Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to protect the unborn child. Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg [LSAP] Income Tax: Wants to replace tax reduction for children by higher family allowance. Index: Wants to preserve index but advocates a maximum income threshold for index adjustment. Shorter Working Hours: In theory in favor of shorter working hours, which should chiefly be negotiated in a collective agreement. Security: Wants to introduce planned law on increase in numbers in police force up to the year 2000. Ecotaxes: Says yes to ecotaxes if they have a controlling or deterrent effect and are used for a specific purpose. Hospital Insurance: Wants to introduce compulsory hospital insurance which insures all those in need of care. Pensions: Aspires to the progressive adjustment of both systems, among other things by the introduction of a maximum pension. Protection of the Unborn Child: Wants to introduce a limit on the timing of abortion. Democratic Party [DP] Income Tax: Wants to lower direct taxation in a few isolated cases, make reclassification retrospective but increase indirect taxation. Index: No statement. Shorter Working Hours: No statement. Security: Wants to increase security forces and improve their training and organization. Ecotaxes: Supports the introduction of a system of specifically introduced ecotaxes. Hospital Insurance: No formal statement; consideration should certainly be given to hospital insurance. Pensions: Wants to critically analyze system of care for the elderly. Three principles govern: 1. Consideration of contributions paid in (for guaranteed minimum pension); 2. No overtaxation of working force people; 3. Long-term financial security. Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement. Green Alternative Party/Green Ecologist Initiative List [GAP-GLEI] Income Tax: Believe that there should be a system of more socially fair individual taxation. Index: In favor of standard basic amounts for index changes. Shorter Working Hours: Demand reduction in working hours to 35 hours per week in the short term. Security: Instead of one large central prison, want to create semi-open prisons. Ecotaxes: Say that products which threaten the environment and health should be subjected to an ecotax to make them unattractive to manufacturers and consumers. Hospital Insurance: Demand official hospital insurance, i.e. hospital allowance graded in accordance with hospital requirements. Pensions: Advocate a standardized pension scheme which insures everyone in their old age, irrespective of whether they are in employment or not, and which prevents the loss of social achievements. Protection of the Unborn Child: Want exemption from punishment for abortion. Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness [ADR] Income Tax: Declares itself in favor of an easing of the indirect tax burden and a stronger shift in the tax burden toward direct taxes. Index: No statement. Shorter Working Hours: Is in favor of voluntary reduction of the working week brought about by the social partners in companies. Security: Demands increase in numbers of police and extension of the prison. Ecotaxes: Would like to achieve a reduction in energy consumption through gradual introduction of a carbon dioxide tax. Hospital Insurance: Is only in favor of hospital insurance (within the context of health insurance) if it precedes pension reform. Pensions: Demands the introduction of universal insurance with equal rights and obligations for all those insured, in both the private and public sector, with the introduction of a minimum and maximum pension. Protection of the Unborn Child: No statement.
