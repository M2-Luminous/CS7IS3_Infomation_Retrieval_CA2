During a two-hour meeting at the presidential palace in Jakarta, Mr. Keating repeated Australia's disappointment with last week's closure of Indonesia's three leading weekly news magazines. Michael Maher reports: [Maher] In telling President Suharto that the Australian government was disappointed with the media bans, Mr. Keating pointed out that the magazine closures appeared to conflict with the openness which has occurred in the Indonesian economy. According to the Prime Minister, President Suharto took those remarks seriously and then replied that the banned magazines had put national unity and stability at risk. Mr. Keating said the matter wasn't pursued further in a two-hour meeting which dealt mainly with trade and issues related to the forthcoming Asia-Pacific economic forum leaders' summit in Indonesia. While demonstrators had threatened to stage more protests against the media clampdown during Mr. Keating's stay, there was little sign of such activity on the streets of the capital. [Announcer] Up to 21 demonstrators arrested yesterday are to appear today in the Central Jakarta District Court. They were detained when riot police broke up a demonstration against the banning of three Indonesian weekly magazines. A court official says there will be three separate hearings for the demonstrators who include the prominent poet Brendra. Indonesia's leading human rights group, the Legal Aid Foundation, says the 21 demonstrators are considered to have committed minor offenses under the law and could be dealt with summarily.
