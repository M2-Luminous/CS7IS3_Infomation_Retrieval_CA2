This document includes an appeal to former members of the Warsaw Pact and other European countries to participate in the program. The appeal of NATO member countries has been adopted at a difficult time, when some parts of the continent are sowing the seeds of conflict, and the majority of Central and East European countries are alarmed by the lack of structural mechanisms for security in this region. Ukraine believes that the proposal of NATO countries to implement the Partnership for Peace program is a timely and broad-minded step in the right direction which will enable all interested countries to begin practical work on concrete political and military cooperation with NATO. Ukraine sees great interest in the development of such cooperation, and will cooperate with NATO and its member countries to the full extent within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program. Ukraine embraces with understanding the NATO initiative, which does not draw new lines of partition in Europe, while leaving the door to NATO open and serving as an instrument to gradually expand the organization eastward. Ukraine thinks that NATO is able to play a serious role in developing a reliable and all-embracing system of European security; Ukraine is ready to make a considerable contribution to the development of new architecture of security. The active participation of Ukraine in the "Partnership for Peace" program will assist in this process.
