FMLN coordinator Shafik Handal and his aid Marcos Jimenez said during a news conference that "the destruction of the antennas" in the central department of San Vicente, 60 km east of San Salvador, "has put us in a difficult position" for Sunday's elections. The two FMLN leaders also charged that militants of the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] (rightist) have been waging a "dirty war" since Thursday, the day unidentified persons destroyed opposition propaganda posters and distributed "counterfeit propaganda." This Friday, unidentified persons issued death threats against Francisco Lima, a rich businessman and attorney, who is the vice presidential candidate of the leftist coalition to which the FMLN belongs. Handal reiterated that the FMLN will participate in Sunday's elections despite these difficulties, because "it has medium- and long-term objectives, and we do not want to give up the contest." The leader urged all Salvadorans to go to the polls. He noted that "it is very important to counterbalance ARENA and defend the rights of the poor." The FMLN forms part of the alliance that also includes the Democratic Convergence and the National Revolutionary Movement and supports the presidential ticket of Ruben Zamora and Francisco Lima.
