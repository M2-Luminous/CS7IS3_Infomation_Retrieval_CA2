"When one knows and remains silent, while continuing to support a regime that systematically eliminates its opponents, one is necessarily an accessory to the crime. Today I accuse President Mitterrand of being guilty, at the very least, of criminal conspiracy." Jean Carbonare does not mince his words and yet he does not sound angry. "Now that people are talking of bringing the perpetrators of this crime against humanity to trial, I ask the question: `How far must we go?'" A member of the commission of inquiry mandated in 1993 by the International Human Rights Federation (IHRF) to look into Rwanda's "death squads," Jean Carbonare is, quite simply, indignant. Being an expert in African affairs who has been following the situation in Rwanda for some 20 years, he does not understand why the Elysee refused to take proven facts into account. The IHRF report clearly showed how the militias operated; it spelled out their crimes and identified the persons responsible. It described how a "machine" was put together which could start laying the country to waste at any time: "As early as 1993, the machine was ready. All the government had to do to start the madness was press on the gas pedal. This happened on 7 April; it could have happened much earlier." Several times after the IHRF report was published, Jean Carbonare contacted French officials, especially the Elysee's African department. He says: "They told me that things were going to get better, that one had to be patient. They knew perfectly well what was happening in Rwanda, but they had taken sides. Shortly after our report came out, President Habyarimana, whom we identified as one of the death squads' sponsors, was received in Paris by President Mitterrand with full honors." Elysee Denies Charges Referring to a comment made to him by the Elysee about Rwanda's rebels, Jean Carbonare says: "The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front], we will crush it!" In other words: The Elysee is totally behind the Habyarimana regime. Asked about this yesterday, Bruno Delaye, the head of the Elysee's African department, denied saying anything of the kind. Jean Carbonare adds that "the French Army helped train those responsible for the slaughter. These were people who knew -- and so did our ambassadors -- that the systematic killing of opponents was being planned. According to our research, 10,000 to 15,000 people were probably assassinated between 1990 and 1993. We passed on this information. Why was there no response?" He "ruefully" notes that when the French Army intervened in early April to evacuate foreign nationals, "Rwanda's army and the militias hailed our troops. A few hours earlier, the very men who were welcoming the country of human rights, had started the slaughter." `France Should Keep Low Profile' Today, Jean Carbonare commends the initiative taken by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, but regrets that it looks like an attempt to patch up a self-inflicted wound. Today, France "should keep a low profile and steer clear of any military intervention, however well-meaning." France should also "listen" to RPF officials. "These people are quite wary about our country. They do not trust us at all. However, I still think that it is possible for us and them to talk on a basis of mutual respect." RPF leaders find it extremely difficult to moderate their men. Says Jean Carbonare: "RPF President Alexis Kanyarengwe told me he had to send to the rear many young men who had `gone off their rocker' after facing the horror during their offensive." Jean Carbonare tries to distinguish between "the RPF, whose members did commit a number of war crimes, and the other side, that of Rwanda's Government, its army, the militias, which are definitely guilty of genocide."
