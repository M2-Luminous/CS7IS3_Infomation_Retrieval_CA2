A company memorandum underlines the fact that the project won the international tender called by the ESA in which the major European aerospace corporations participated because of the originality of the solution proposed. The solution is based on the use of the Comau C3G 9001 controller while the decision to adopt an industrial controller to implement the new functions required by aerospace applications will guarantee reliable results. During the project the new controller is to be integrated in the CAT [Columbus automation testbed] robotic system, delivered by Tecnospazio to the ESA in 1992. This will permit ground tests of the operations programs of the space robot to be performed before they are carried out on board. DLR [German Aerospace Research Institute] is also contributing to the program with responsibility for installing the sensorized "hand," which it developed for the Rotex robotic experiment, in the new system. Tecnospazio, a European leader in space automation and robotics, is a consortium company established by Comau (Fiat group) and FIAR (IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry] Finmeccanica group).
