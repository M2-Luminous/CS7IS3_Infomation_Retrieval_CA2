FBIS4-28409 "dreas112_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 North Korea Student Group Denounces ROK `Suppression' Student Group Denounces ROK `Suppression' SK0806232994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1503 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806232994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The North side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) released a statement Tuesday bitterly denouncing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's harsh suppression of the leading members of the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and the South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon. Branding the suppression as an unpardonable challenge to patriotism of South Korean students who are devotedly struggling for independence, democracy and reunification and to the indomitable will of the youth and students in the North, South and overseas for reunification, the statement said: The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now making a sweeping roundup of 30 to 40 leading members of Hanchongnyon and the South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon including Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun and Chairman of the National Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun. The harsh suppression of patriotic students launched by the Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors around the second inaugural ceremony of Hanchongnyon is motivated by a sinister intention to stamp out the South Korean students' patriotic movement for reunification. The traitorous clique must look squarely at the situation, promptly scrap "the National Security Law," [NSL] an anti-reunification law of the old time, and stop at once the criminal roundup of the leading members of the South side headquarters of Hanchongnyon and Pomchonghaknyon they have launched by invoking "the NSL."
