"The three men have been able to talk, analyze this situation, and take the view that it must be left until 1999," Solbes told the Servimedia agency. However, in Solbes' opinion, it is not a matter of a "formal agreement." "It is an exchange of views," he specified. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was more laconic, but did not deny the talks' existence. Asked about this, he confined himself to stating: "I cannot confirm it." The Spanish economy minister pointed out that it is "enormously complicated" for some countries to achieve the aims set in the Maastricht Treaty. "We will have to implement Maastricht in accordance with the circumstances," stated Solbes, in whose opinion the decision to undertake or delay monetary union will have to be taken in 1996. That year, "there will be a major political discussion on Europe's future," he said. However, French President Francois Mitterrand and German head of government Helmut Kohl have assured Felipe Gonzalez that the European Union (EU) will not set the third stage of monetary union under way in 1997, as European officials connected with the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU] process confirmed to EL PAIS. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who took part in a Franco-German summit in the French city of Mulhouse yesterday, displayed a more ambiguous stance on the talks between the three European leaders, according to REUTER. Asked about this by journalists attending the summit, Waigel did not deny the report, which was also carried by the German FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG newspaper, and simply stated: "I cannot confirm it." Unlikely Date The Maastricht Treaty envisages that the third stage of EMU, which entails the adoption of the single currency, will begin in 1997, provided that there is a minimum of seven countries that fulfill the convergence criteria required. Mitterrand and Kohl promised Gonzalez not to take this step, even if there were that minimum number of countries able to do so. On the French side, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, who is also taking part in the Franco-German meeting in Mulhouse, asserted that he has no knowledge of any agreement between France, Germany, and Spain to delay the adoption of the single currency. However, senior French officials made it clear that they regard the date of 1997 as unlikely for adopting the single currency, in view of many Community states' problems in reducing their public deficits. Also during the meeting with Germany in Mulhouse, French Minister Alphandery rejected the conclusions on the future of the Community's labor market drawn up by a Franco-German committee of labor experts, in which they recommend extensive deregulation. Alphandery said that the text is provisional and does not commit the Paris and Bonn governments. In addition, Secretary of State for Finance Enrique Martinez Robles stated yesterday that Spain will not need to make a budgetary adjustment this year in order to reduce the public deficit, unlike in the past few fiscal years. Martinez Robles, who delivered a lecture on public finance in El Escorial, stated that the deficit performed better than forecast in the first four months of this year, and that it has fallen by almost 20 percent. In his opinion, the state budget for 1995 will maintain social expenditure and investment in infrastructures without increasing the tax burden.
