FR940811-2-00010 FR940811-2-00005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Docket No. 931249&hyph;2349; I.D. 072094C] Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of permit issuance. SUMMARY: NMFS announces the issuance of limited entry permits with ``Designated Species B'' gear endorsements for jack mackerel north of 39 North lat. in the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery off Washington, Oregon and California. This issuance is based on the results of an inseason survey assessing the intent of current limited entry permit holders to harvest underutilized species of groundfish. This action is intended to promote the full utilization of the jack mackerel resource north of 39 North lat. It provides for the needs of the limited entry fleet before making surplus amounts available to ``Designated Species B'' applicants, as required by Amendment 6 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and implementing regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994 until December 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to J. Gary Smith, Acting Regional Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN-C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Rodney McInnis, Acting Regional Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140; or Rodney McInnis at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Amendment 6 to the FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), approved on September 4, 1992, and implemented by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6, also called the ``Limited Entry Plan,'' is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing fleet by: (1) Limiting the overall number of vessels; (2) limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types; and (3) limiting increases in vessel harvesting capacity by limiting vessel length. Regulations at 50 CFR 663.37(3) state that the Fisheries Management Division (FMD), Northwest Region, NMFS, will receive and prioritize applications for ``Designated Species B'' endorsements based on seniority (number of years the vessel has fished for the designated species). ``Designated species'' are defined as Pacific whiting, jack mackerel north of 39 North lat., and shortbelly rockfish. To date, 29 applications have been received requesting ``Designated Species B'' permits for the harvest of assorted amounts of underutilized species (many applications were for multiple species; 23 for Pacific whiting, eight for shortbelly, and seven for jack mackerel). The FMD has surveyed current limited entry permit holders regarding their intent to harvest underutilized species in 1994. The survey indicated that an estimated 659,500 metric tons (mt) of Pacific whiting, 36,600 mt of jack mackerel, and 57,300 mt of shortbelly rockfish could be taken by the current permit holders. Based on the results of the survey, the FMD estimates that current permit holders will harvest the entire 1994 harvest guidelines for Pacific whiting (260,000 mt) and shortbelly rockfish (23,500 mt). The survey results indicated that current permit holders intended to harvest only 36,600 mt of the 52,600 mt harvest guideline for jack mackerel, leaving a surplus of 16,000 mt which can be made available to those ``Designated Species B'' permit applicants who applied for a permit to harvest jack mackerel in 1994. For this reason, the FMD is issuing ``Designated Species B'' permits to those applicants. The regulations state that ``Designated Species B'' endorsements will be issued based on vessel seniority (number of years the vessel has fished for the designated species) until vessel delivery commitments reach the harvest guideline or quota for the designated species. The amount of jack mackerel requested by ``Designated Species B'' permit applicants is nearly identical to the surplus amount. Therefore, all applicants can be accommodated, and there is no need to issue permits based on vessel seniority this season. The Regional Director concurs with the recommendation of FMD and hereby announces the issuance of ``Designated Species B'' limited entry permits for the harvest of jack mackerel caught north of 39 North lat. with groundfish trawl gear. Classification The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is based are available for public inspection at the office of the Regional Director, Northwest Region, (see ADDRESSES ) during business hours. This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.37(a)(3), and is in compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Dated: August 8, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19628 Filed 8&hyph;8&hyph;94; 2:48 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
