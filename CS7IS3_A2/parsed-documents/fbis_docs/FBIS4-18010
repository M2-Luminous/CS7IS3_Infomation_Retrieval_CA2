"I sensed the same fear during the meeting with Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev, and this is very dangerous. I warned him that I could not coordinate my economic actions with the incompetent people who led Ukraine to such a state. I know that Yukhym Zvyahilskyy is not a supporter of my economic concept and will never become one. This is why I asked Kravchuk to check the observance of the laws of Ukraine that delimit the powers of Ukraine and Crimea," he said. Replying to a question on the possible time of introducing the reforms in compliance with the decrees, Saburov said that he did not dare to affirm when these would get under way because they touch upon many structures in Ukraine, the National Bank in particular. Meanwhile, to implement the decrees on currency regulation and on banking activity, permission is necessary to licence the activity of not only Ukrainian banks but foreign banks as well. Saburov reported that he was not yet familiarized with the economic programs of Ukrainian economists, but "there will be no problems" as far as the coordination of actions with the future Government of Ukraine is concerned, "if the sides abide by the laws on the delimitation of powers and coordinate their actions on this very basis". The Crimean deputy prime minister resolutely rejected any connection between the introduction of economic reforms and the political situation on the peninsula. In his opinion, the mass media unjustly assessed "the fuss in high places during the election campaign" as political instability in Crimea. "It is normal for politicians to win over to their side. I believe that the tragic nature of the situation in Crimea is far-fetched in many respects. There is no Abkhazia here," he assured, and also emphasized the "gross violations by Ukraine of its own law on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea Republic, according to which all economic activity, including the signing of international agreements, is the prerogative of Crimea." Saburov spoke out for the necessity of setting up joint working groups of Ukraine and Crimea to conduct negotiations and work out the documents acceptable to both sides, "as this has been done by Russia and Tatarstan," and to search for a compromise, which "always requires a certain amount of courage." In reply to the question, "Who would you like to see as the president of Ukraine?", Saburov said that he had seen neither worthy politicians nor appropriate economic programs at the election in Ukraine." "They were blaming Russia, although one could at least see the differences between political forces there. As far as Ukraine is concerned, political life here is in embryonic state," he said. In Saburov's opinion, Leonid Kuchma and "insignificant, little-known persons, who represented the interregional Bloc of Reforms, gained victory only because they had a certain program and people were voting for it."
