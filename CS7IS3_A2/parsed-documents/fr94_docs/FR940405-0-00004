ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: A proposed rule was published on June 15, 1993, with respect to the debt management practices of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). This final rule adopts, with minor changes, the provisions of the proposed rule. Accordingly, this final rule sets forth the policies and procedures which ASCS will use to settle debts.

ASCS will also follow the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards with respect to administrative actions undertaken by ASCS to settle claims. This regulation is necessary to protect the financial integrity of many Federal agricultural programs by ensuring the Government will be able to collect, or otherwise settle, debts owed it by any person, organization, corporation, or other legal entity.
