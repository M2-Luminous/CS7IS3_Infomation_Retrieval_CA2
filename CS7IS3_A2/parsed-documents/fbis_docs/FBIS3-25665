One condition, however, is that they produce an opinion poll showing they have at least 2 percent support regionally or nationally. According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the electoral fund -- consisting of State funds and donations from the international community -- has been divided in two. One half is earmarked for pre-election campaigning and the other for parties gaining seats in Parliament afterwards. If a party produces a petition with at least 10,000 signatures instead of an opinion poll attesting to at least 2 percent support, it will be entitled to half the full money grant. A party standing regionally only, and showing a 2 percent or more support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. A party standing regionally only, and showing a 2 percent or more support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. If it can only raise signatures -- at least 3,000 are needed for a regional party -- it will get one-eighth of the amount. The second half of the electoral fund has also been divided in two, with 25 percent earmarked for parties which obtain one or more seats (they will get equal amounts) and another 25 percent to be distributed between parties in Parliament on a proportional basis depending on support. "In other words, the smaller parties, while they might get the same amount as the bigger parties initially, will end up with much less at the end of the election process," the IEC said. Aside from the fund, each political party is being funded by its own donors. The ANC, in particular, is receiving substantial assistance from foreign governments. Sources could not give a figure for the amount in the electoral fund, but it is expected that each voter will cost a party between R[rand]1 and R3 in campaign money. There are 22 million eligible voters.
