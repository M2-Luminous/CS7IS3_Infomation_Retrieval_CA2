[passage omitted] A special Jordanian military plane carrying an official delegation headed by Foreign Ministry Secretary General Nayif al-Hadid arrived in Beirut this afternoon and transported the body of the diplomat to Jordan. At the airport to see the body off were Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz and Jordanian Ambassador to Lebanon Fakhri Abu-Talib. The ambassador hoped the Lebanese authorities find the culprits and those behind them. He stressed that the Jordanian Embassy in Beirut will remain open. He said: [Begin recording] [Abu-Talib] I believe the Lebanese officials have made enough statements about the attack. I cannot add to what they said. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Do you believe the attack is politically motivated? [Abu-Talib] I believe there certainly are political motives. There are no personal reasons for the killing. Someone is trying to harm both Jordan's march and Lebanon's security. Those who planned and carried out the attack do not want stability and security for Lebanon, nor do they want Jordan to continue its current political line. But despite all obstacles and difficulties, we will not change our policy, and we will take a courageous and responsible position. [passage omitted] [end recording] For his part, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz made the following statement: [Begin Buwayz recording] As I said this morning, this is a loss for Lebanon. It is a stab at Lebanon more than Jordan. Those who try to harm stability and security in Lebanon are also trying to harm Lebanon's credibility in the political and security spheres. Of course, I will not forestall the investigations and point accusing fingers at any quarter, but certainly the tragedy reflects negatively on Lebanon above all. I express my condolences to the Jordanian officials and to the family of the victim, and I stress that the Lebanese Government will spare no effort in conducting investigations and finding the attackers.
