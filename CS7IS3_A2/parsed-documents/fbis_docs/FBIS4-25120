Until now Deng has backed Jiang as his successor to lead the collective leadership of China. President Jiang, however, has taken a conspicuously tough stance and has abandoned his conventional moderate attitude. Deng's response has been to "rebuke" President Jiang out of fear that his change of attitude could lead to a split in the CPC. It remains unclear when Deng issued his criticism of President Jiang, but the same source said Deng's accusation was that President Jiang was trying to form a "new Shanghai group." Early last year President Jiang appointed Ba Zhongtan, one of his confidantes, as commander of the armed police force. In response, Deng said: "Efforts should have been made to look for capable persons among the whole nation, without any attempt to build factions," adding that he had not been briefed in advance on the recent shakeup of the military and the police. President Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days beginning 26 April. According to the same Chinese source, Jiang visited the city with the aim of solidifying his power base. President Jiang served as mayor and secretary of Shanghai city from 1985 to 1988 and Ba served as commander of the Shanghai Garrison during that period. Deng named Jiang as general secretary of the CPC after General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted from power in the wake of the Tiananmen incident. Deng gave Jiang the post of chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission despite his lack of military experience. Jiang became president last March. Deng is believed to have approved of Jiang's rise in party and government ranks after concluding that, as a moderate, Jiang was the best qualified to lead the Chinese collective leadership in the post-Deng era. President Jiang has become so powerful that he has exercised his influence over the military and police shakeup. Deng told a March session of the National People's Congress: "We should not fear hyper growth." In contrast, President Jiang and Premier Li Peng, a conservative, insisted on curbing growth at 9 percent.
