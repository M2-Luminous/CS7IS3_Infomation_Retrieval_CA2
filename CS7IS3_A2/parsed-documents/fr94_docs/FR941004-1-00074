FR941004-1-00074 FR941004-1-00018 •First, both the Program Instructions (PIs) and this NPRM follow the statutory requirements closely. In the NPRM, we have sought to avoid detailed prescriptions or requirements for specific models of services in order to allow States, Indian tribes, and local communities significant flexibility. Instead, we have identified principles of effective family support and preservation services that should guide grantees and others in conducting their planning process and designing specific services programs that meet the needs of children and families. •Second, both the PIs and this NPRM focus on the statutory requirement for a five-year plan; they emphasize, for States and Indian tribes as appropriate, the opportunity provided by the law in making available 100 percent Federal funding for planning activities leading to the development of the five-year plan. In particular, they stress the value of a thoughtful, strategic planning process that includes broad consultation and involvement of State and local public agencies, nonprofit private agencies, parents and other consumers, representatives of professional and advocacy organizations, and community-based organizations with experience in administering programs for children and families (including family support and family preservation). •Third, while focusing on the development and expansion of services, the PIs and this NPRM highlight the opportunity provided by the statutory requirement for broad consultation and coordination of services. In particular, we urge States and Indian tribes to use this new legislation, the new planning requirements, and the 100 percent funding as a catalyst for establishing a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-focused services for children and families regardless of funding streams. Thus, the NPRM requires consultation and coordination both within the child and family services system and among the other service delivery systems providing social, economic, and health-related support to children and their families. •Fourth, we recognized that we could not expect coordination and collaboration across service delivery systems at the State and local level if we did not take steps toward improved coordination at the Federal level. We have been working with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), the Center for Mental Health Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Justice, and other agencies to explore and act on collaboration opportunities. An early example of this effort to support children and family services is the discretionary announcement by the MCHB to support the State's first year family preservation and support planning process. Another example is the joint funding of a training and technical assistance center that will focus on services integration among child welfare, maternal and child health, and mental health services delivery systems. •Finally, recommendations from the field influenced the development of our evaluation and training and technical assistance plans which are both aimed at supporting and strengthening effective service delivery for children and family services. G. Vision for Family Preservation and Family Support Services In passing the family preservation and support legislation, Congress recognized that new funding alone would not be sufficient to meet the goals of the legislation and Pub. L. 96&hyph;272. New or expanded services are just one element needed to improve the child and family service system. In order to ensure that services are part of a comprehensive, coordinated service delivery system that draws heavily on community-based programs in its design and implementation, States, Indian tribes, and communities are encouraged to use these new resources strategically to carry out major changes in the ways services are delivered and in the systems that deliver them. Based on the collective views of parents, practitioners, advocates, researchers, and others who shared with ACF their concerns and hopes for strengthening the American family, the vision States, communities, and Indian tribes are encouraged to develop is of a child and family service system that: •Keeps children and family members safe at all times; •Builds on the resources and strengths of families; •Offers a continuum of services to children and families that is family-focused, easily accessible, and respectful of cultural and community characteristics; and
