Kemp] [Text] Messina March 9 SAPA -- Police on Wednesday fired rubber shot at a group of African National Congress [ANC] supporters protesting outside a stadium where National Party [NP] leader F.W. de Klerk addressed his followers. The protesters, who claimed they were invited by local NP supporters to attend the meeting, had earlier toyi-toyied [protest danced] and chanted slogans as Mr de Klerk's motorcade entered and left the stadium. A small group of Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] activists chanted the slogan "kill the Boer, kill the farmer" shortly before the police opened fire. It could not be established whether anyone was injured in the shooting. Earlier, Mr de Klerk told about 300 supporters, most of them black, the NP was a party of peace and would ensure the rights of every South African. He accused the ANC of intimidating and threatening people in townships. "The NP will ensure that the policies of a new government of national unity will help build a better life for all South Africans," Mr de Klerk said.
