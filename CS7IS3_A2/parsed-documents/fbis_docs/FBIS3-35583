I think that we have normal relations. Serious people understand that the departure of one person or another has no significance since it is not just one person, or even two people, who implement the policy and do the work but the entire government. We have the president, the guarantor, and if we even move away we have someone to put things right. This will not affect our affairs, absolutely not. It is not just those two who worked. Everyone carries out his duties. The government does not consist just of two people. They had their own specific, narrow responsibilities.
