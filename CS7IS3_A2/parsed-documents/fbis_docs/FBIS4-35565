Jerusalem Detailed TA0206102994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 2 Jun 94 pp A1, A8 TA0206102994 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] [Excerpt] Israel promised the PLO that the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem will continue to exist and operate in an orderly fashion. This pledge was made in a letter sent by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres several months ago to former Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, who was to convey the letter to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. In the letter, Peres quoted from his Knesset address of 9 September 1993, in which he said that Israel would be committed to the "orderly functioning of the various religious institutions which exist and operate in the city" and that "coexistence in Jerusalem is a matter of mutual respect among all its residents and of the orderly functioning of the relevant institutions and systems." Peres noted the "social, religious, and other institutions" of each ethnic community in the city, as well as the existence of each ethnic community's separate educational system. 'Arafat asked Israel for the letter in order to preserve the political status quo in Jerusalem in anticipation of the discussions on the city's status in the course of the permanent arrangement negotiations due to begin in about two years. In response to his request, Israel sent the letter several weeks after the Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed in Washington. The letter's existence and contents were kept secret, and it was not publicized along with other documents attached to the Israeli- PLO agreements. A senior political element associated with the peace talks said yesterday that "the agreements with the PLO contain no secret addenda or secret letters. There is nothing secret in a speech delivered at the Knesset. We did not try to hide the letter, but no one asked us to make its content publics." According to this source, "'Arafat did not say that his recognition of Israel and the signing of the DOP were contingent on the receipt of a letter concerning Jerusalem." The senior political element said that the letter received by 'Arafat refers only to Palestinian institutions that operated in Jerusalem at the time of Peres' Knesset speech in September. According to him, Israel opposes the establishment and operation of new Palestinian institutions that are political in nature. "We will not touch the existing bodies, but we will not permit new ones to be established," he stressed. [passage omitted]
