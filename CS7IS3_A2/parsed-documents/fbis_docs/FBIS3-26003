All localities are now conveying and implementing the guidelines laid down by the conference. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the guidance of the basic party line, the conference studied and planned how to intensify and improve propaganda and ideological work under the new situation, following the guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and its third plenary session, as well as the principle that we must be firm in carrying out ideological and political work while proceeding with economic construction and opening up to the outside world. Thanks to the CPC Central Committee's kind attention and its direct leadership as well as the efforts exerted by comrades attending the conference, the conference became a meeting that has enabled the participants to understand the overall requirement, achieve a consensus of views, and clearly understand their missions; it was a democratic, united, efficient, and pragmatic meeting in which the participants discussed issues harmoniously and freely; and it was a meeting which has strengthened our confidence and encouraged us to press forward with high fighting morale. The historic meeting certainly will play a major role in ensuring and expediting the victorious development of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji gave important speeches at the conference. In his speech, Comrade Jiang Zemin expounded on the important significance of propaganda and ideological work during the new period and set the fundamental guidance and major missions for propaganda and ideological work. Pointing out that the party must intensify and improve its leadership over propaganda and ideological work, he placed earnest hopes on comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front. The speech is a programmatic document with important guiding significance for the party's propaganda and ideological work during the new period. Party committees and departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work at all levels must earnestly study and understand the document, achieve a greater concensus of views, obey the overall requirement, emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, heighten their morale, press forward, and earnestly carry out the guidelines and assignments in accordance with the Central Committee's requirements. The propaganda and ideological front is an important front during our socialist modernization drive. The CPC always attaches great importance to propaganda and ideological work. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed: "We must place ideological and political work in a very important position and accomplish it earnestly, and we must not slacken our efforts in this regard." He added: "All work on the ideological front must be strengthened." During the past two years, guided and encouraged by the important speeches which Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave in southern China and by the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive have entered a new stage imbued with life and vitality. The recent Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee made an overall and systematic planning for building a socialist market economic system, and the national economic conference has also provided specific plans for achieving a sustained, fast, and healthy national economic development. The overall requirement set for the party is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability. The new situation has presented a series of new assignments, new issues, and new requirements for propaganda and ideological work. Historical experiences tell us that the deeper our reform and the faster our development, the more necessary it is for us to intensify and improve propaganda and ideological work and to intensify our socialist spiritual construction. While the majority of comrades in our party are attaching importance to propaganda and ideological work and are quite firm in attending to this assignment, some comrades do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of intensifying propaganda and ideological work as well as spiritual construction. The problem of "being tough on the one hand and soft on the other" still exists in one way or the other when they do their work. During the course of spiritual construction, there are still noteworthy problems regarding party conduct and the general mood of society. This situation must be corrected immediately. To successfully accomplish their propaganda and ideological work, our comrades must understand the importance of propaganda and ideological work from the overall strategic requirement of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, understand the urgency of propaganda and ideological work from the historical assignment of deepening reform and expediting development, and understand the formidability of propaganda and ideological work from the real need of socialist spiritual construction. Doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work is not just a task of propaganda and ideological departments and workers of those departments, but is the task of the whole party, especially the party's leading organs at various levels. For a long time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has raised the call that the party's leading organs, in addition to grasping principles and policies and making decisions on the employment of important cadres, should devote their main efforts in ideological and political work. The principal responsible comrades of party committees at various levels should strive to overcome the thinking of considering propaganda and ideological work as a "soft task." They should firmly implement the principle of "grasping both material progress and ideological and cultural progress and placing equal emphasis on both," put propaganda and ideological work and the building of spiritual civilization on the party committee's important daily agenda, and effectively strengthen and improve their leadership over propaganda and ideological work. It is necessary to pay attention to studying and mastering the law of propaganda and ideological work, be good at closely linking propaganda and ideological work with economic work and other tasks, and use propaganda and ideological work to promote and lead economic construction and other work. We should constantly go into the midst of the propaganda and ideological front to investigate and study, sum up experiences, put forward methods, solve problems, show more concern, and give more support and help to propaganda and ideological work. From now on, in evaluating the work of leading cadres and leading groups, we should consider whether they attach importance to propaganda and ideological work and whether they are good at leading propaganda and ideological work as an important part of judging their political quality and leadership level. We should consider the results of propaganda and ideological work and of the building of spiritual civilization as an important part in evaluating the work of an area, a department, and a unit. To strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should have a contingent of workers armed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- Marxism in contemporary China [dong dai zhong guo di ma ke si zhu yi 3981 0108 0022 0948 4104 7456 0344 1835 0031 5030] -- who are loyal to the cause of the party and the people, and competent politically and professionally with good workstyle. We now have a several million-strong team consisting of theoretical, news, publication, and literary and art workers, and grass-roots propaganda and ideology workers, and this is a great army which is extremely valuable in promoting the construction of the two civilizations. The party and the people have great expectations for this team. Propaganda and ideology work is a very important and glorious job, but also a fairly arduous and rather painstaking job. This then requires our propaganda and ideology workers to have the spirit of making selfless contributions and arduous struggle. Perhaps our work will not bring material benefits to individuals, but it will bring benefit to the motherland and people; perhaps our names will not be among the list of names of heroes of the times, but our contributions will be compiled into the splendid annals of the great undertakings of hundreds of millions of people. Marx said: "If we choose a profession which could provide the most material benefits to mankind through our labor, then, the heavy burden will not overwhelm us, because we are giving our life for the people; what we feel then will not be pitiful, limited, and selfish delight, for our happiness will belong to thousands of millions of people....." This should become a motto for each of us propaganda and ideology workers. Our party, government, and people have always had great confidence in and lent vigorous support to propaganda and ideology workers, and the propaganda and ideology workers should be proud of that, increase their sense of honor and responsibility, justify the great trust placed in them by the party and people, and unceasingly create new outstanding achievements. In the glorious undertakings of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, propaganda and ideologicial work is the scaffold for constructing the large building of the two civilizations, the boost motor for the ship of reform and opening up to cleave the waves and move forward, and the bugle for advancing for the hundreds of millions in the construction army to scale a new height. At the beginning of the new year, the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core convened a national propaganda and ideology work meeting, and this greatly inspires and spurs on comrades of the whole party, especially all comrades on the propaganda and ideology front. We must seize opportunities, do solid work, and work hard to bring propaganda and ideology work to a new level so as to arm people with scientific theory, to guide people with correct public opinion, to mould people with a lofty spirit, to inspire people with works of excellence, and to make new contributions that win us new victory in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
