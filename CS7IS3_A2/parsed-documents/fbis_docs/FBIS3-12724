[Begin Rabin recording] I was aware that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad on the Palestinian side will do everything to intensify terrorism and kill Israelis--and I stress Israelis, and my intention is Israeli Jews and non-Jews. Furthermore, I was aware that there is friction, and there was friction, with settlers, particularly with the most radical--the members of the Kakh and Kahane Hay groups and their supporters. But I admit it was difficult to imagine that such a hideous murder would be perpetrated by an Israeli--and what is more, one who wears a cap. I did not imagine that there would also be an Israeli Hamas or Jewish Hamas. I appeal to the Palestinians and their leadership in Tunis: I understand the pain and the anger. Don't allow a lone Jewish murderer who killed Palestinian Muslims just for being who they were, during prayers, to destroy the prospect for peace. [end recording]
