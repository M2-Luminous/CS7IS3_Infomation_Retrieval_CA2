Concerning the situation in Yemen the daily `AL-YAWM' stresses that what is happening in sisterly Yemen, the continuation of the conflict between the north and the south, saddens every Arab Muslim. Despite Yemen's announcement that it will positively respond to Arab, Islamic, and international appeals for a cease-fire, the paper goes on to say, the war is still raging between the north and the south [of Yemen] and human and material losses on both sides are mounting. The ideal, logical, and only solution to the Yemeni conflict, the paper adds, is to stop the gun fire, to place the supreme Yemeni interests over personal interests, and to listen to reason in order to save what can be saved of human and material resources in Yemen. For its part, the daily `Al-MADINAH' notes that battles taking place in Yemen in the name of unity does not harm only the perpetrator, it also harms the whole world's view of Arabs. The paper says: While the world is seeing a trend toward integration through dialogue and the ballot box, the Yemenis are resorting to the sword instead of dialogue and to murder instead of the ballot box. The paper goes on to say: Many Yemeni people, on both sides, have fallen victim in the name of unity. Large economic installations have been destroyed in the name of prosperity that will come with unity and hundreds of thousands of Yemenis have been made homeless in the name of reuniting them. What kind of logic governs what is happening and what should the people believe? Is it what they hear about the noble objectives or the death, destruction, and displacement of people that they see? The paper says that the demand for an immediate cease-fire stated in the GCC ministerial council's communique and its emphasis on the impossibility of achieving unity by force is a clear message to the warring brothers in Yemen.
