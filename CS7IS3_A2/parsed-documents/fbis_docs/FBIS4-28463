FBIS4-28463 "dreas112_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 North Korea CPRF Secretariat Publishes Information No. 651 CPRF Secretariat Publishes Information No. 651 SK0306113594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1016 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306113594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] in its Information No. 651 issued Thursday stressed the Kim Yong-sam group's suppression of the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) must be stopped immediately and the illegally arrested patriotic students be released at once. Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group has launched a roundup campaign against Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun, former chairman of the organisation Kim Chae-yong, Chairman of the National Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun, former chairman of the committee Kim Pyong-sam and other hardcore members of the organisation, ruthlessly suppressing the righteous struggle of the students affiliated with the organisation, the information says: Hanchongnyon is a vanguard organisation of progressive and patriotic students who are courageously fighting for national sovereignty and social democratisation and national reunification in South Korea which has been reduced to a U.S. colony. All its activities are righteous deeds for the country and the nation, which can by no means be a target of fascist suppression. The CPRF Secretariat bitterly condemns the South Korean fascist clique's suppression of Hanchongnyon as an unpardonable anti-national criminal act to destroy the organisation now active as a vanguard in the movement for independence, democracy and reunification in South Korea and thus bar the advance of pro-reunification democratic forces and prolong the remaining days of the pro-American flunkeyist traitorous "regime". If the South Korean rulers persist in their reckless sword-brandishing against justice and patriotism, it will only precipitate their own destruction.
