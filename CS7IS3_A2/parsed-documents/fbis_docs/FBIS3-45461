This was an outcome the Chinese side did not wish to see. However, just like a popular saying goes: "The rain must fall from the sky, and one's own mother must remarry." There are things in the world that are independent of people's good wishes, and cannot be changed. The many tricks the British side has played since China set out the demand to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong are still fresh in people's memories! In the talks between the Chinese and British Governments on settling the Hong Kong issue, the British side continuously set out all sorts of ideas that ran counter to its promise, and the most famous ones were "exchanging sovereignty for the right to rule," and the demand on the Chinese side to refrain from stationing the PLA in Hong Kong, and so forth. All this naturally met solemn rejection from China. The talks lasted 22 rounds and two years, and eventually the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed. China hoped that the British side would abide by the Sino-British Joint Declaration like its Chinese counterpart during the transition period, but now it seems that the true nature of the colonialists will never change. Whenever there are some changes in the world situation, they will do everything they can to essentially prolong their rule in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has dished up his "constitutional reform package" under the pretext that it would give "democracy" to Hong Kong residents. However, he forget that the very title and power of Hong Kong governor is none other than a symbol of colonialism. Would it not be the greatest joke on earth for a Hong Kong governor to give democracy to people of the colony?! Only if he removes himself from office first. No wonder some public opinion in Hong Kong hit the nail on the head by saying: There is no democracy to speak of in a colony. Should there be democracy, it would not be a colony. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain why Chris Patten was in a hurry to change the existing system and pursue his so-called "constitutional reform" as soon as he arrived in Hong Kong. His objective was obvious enough, namely, to make arrangements for those people who could act on the order of their British masters in the three-tier framework. The funnier thing was that this Hong Kong governor should have forced such a body on the SAR [Special Administration Region] Government after 1997. Again, he forgot that this body of his, namely, the Legislative Council, the Executive Council, and the two municipal councils, are all components in the constitutional framework of the British Hong Kong Authorities. Naturally, they must be disbanded with the termination of British rights in administration and control over Hong Kong on 30 June 1997. That will be the inevitable outcome of China restoring its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Britain terminating its rule over Hong Kong. By then, Hong Kong's three-tier framework will be reorganized according to the stipulation in the Basic Law and the National People's Congress decision. That is the Chinese Government's solemn position, and it is not at all vague! Some British politicians like Chris Patten have continued their colonialist daydreaming. Regretfully, it is the end of the 20th century, not the 19th Century, and the sun of "Great Britain" has long set. The Chinese Government is no longer the government of the late Qing Dynasty. China has joined the ranks of world powers. It is precisely to redress national shame and to end the ugliest phenomena of colonial rule in modern history that China recovers Hong Kong. The world's peace-loving people support the Chinese Government's position. It is in vain for Chris Patten and his ilk to attempt to maintain their rule on the last colony no matter what tricks they play. Deng Xiaoping has longed foreseen how the British Hong Kong Government would act, and set out five issues that "the Chinese side does not hope to see surface" during the transition period, of which the fourth point was that it was hoped that the British Hong Kong Government would refrain from organizing a body on its own and force it on the Hong Kong SAR Government in the future. We should like to advise the British Hong Kong Government to return to the track of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law, the Sino-British understanding and agreement on the Hong Kong issue, and stop doing foolish things. The only way out is to cooperate in sincerity to ensure Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and steady transition. In actual fact, the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents do not agree to the ways of British politicians including Chris Patten. Even some figures with vision in British political circles and British entrepreneurs and businessmen have criticized those politicians, saying that those politicians were not thinking of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but of dusting their political cloaks with gold, and dressing themselves as "heroes." They do not know that such "heroes" are actually laughingstocks. You also know that it was the British side who first set out the "through train" issue. However, because the British side has set up hurdles one after another and it tabled part of the "constitutional reform package" in the Hong Kong Legislative Council when no Sino-British agreement had been reached, it thoroughly soured the talks. That being the case, the convergence of the constitutional system will be impossible, and there will be no "through train" for the three-tier framework. The stable transition of Hong Kong Government will be affected and the responsibility totally rests with the British side. Britain has ruled Hong Kong for some 150 years, and seized tremendous wealth from the island. Thus Hong Kong is where the great interest of Britain lies. That being the case, some British politicians are becoming somewhat muddleheaded, and believe that the merits of Hong Kong's prosperity today should go to them, which really is taking the merits that belong to Heaven as their own. Hong Kong's prosperity relies on the diligence and hard work of Hong Kong residents through all the generations, and the all-out support of all the Chinese people in the hinterland, especially in the dozen or so years since reform and opening up began. The economies of the two places are mutually beneficial, and are so close that they cannot be separated. China has already promised that it will continue to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. China has always been good to its word! If the British side is able to cooperate, that is fine, and we can ensure that its interests in Hong Kong will remain intact. Should it be otherwise, China will have confidence and ability, too, to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. China will not change its mind in recovering its sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. Neither will China change its mind in implementing the Basic Law, "one country, two system," and "Hong Kong residents ruling Hong Kong" after that date. By then, all things incompatible with the Basic Law will have to be overthrown, and British colonialism will disappear from Hong Kong. This is a historical inevitability!
