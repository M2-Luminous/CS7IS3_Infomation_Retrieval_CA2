A whole package of documents and first of all a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries was signed during the talks, he said. At a news conference on Saturday, Rakhmonov emphasised that the Tajik delegation had found understanding and interest on the part of the Pakistani side on all matters discussed. The Tajik leader devoted special attention to economic aspects of the talks, pointing out that the Pakistani Government favours closer economic cooperation with his country, particularly in hydropower engineering and road building. The discussion of the inter-Tajik problem figured prominently during the meetings between the heads of state, the Tajik leader said. The Pakistani side welcomed Dushanbe's initiative concerning a peaceful settlement of the conflict and forthcoming talks in Moscow with representatives of the opposition with the participation of Russia and the United Nations organisation, and measures to repatriate Tajik refugees as soon as possible. "We stated that we are prepared to launch a dialogue with any sober-minded opposition forces that are sincerely interested in the termination of the armed confrontation," Rakhmonov said. "We do not put forward any pre-conditions except putting an end to provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border and to terrorist acts inside the country and allowing an unhindered repatriation of Tajik refugees," he said. Speaking about the initiative proposed by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev to establish a Euro-Asian union, Rakhmonov pointed out that the idea merited attention.
