Interfax has learnt about the project providing for the test launching of the missile with a simplified version of a satellite. The project is to demonstrate real possibility of the missile for launching commercial loads with the minimal changes in the docking unit. Experts believe the missile may put into orbit the load weighing about 600 kilos and it could be used for implementing the existing programmes of satellite communication systems on the basis of low-orbit satellites. A representative of the Russian Space Agency who has a direct involvement to the implementation of the project with the use of SS-18, has told Interfax that so far the launching of the missile is in question because the Russian Military Space force, which control missile systems and space vehicles, has not OKed the project. The spokesman did not rule out the possibility that the problem would be raised at the talks on conditions of leasing the space center Baykonur and the military cooperation in Almaty that are to begin in a week (the Russian delegation will leave for Almaty on March 9) Missiles SS-18 are to be destroyed in line with the Russian-U.S. treaty START-2 before the year 2003. Now 104 SS-18 missiles are based in Kazakhstan.
