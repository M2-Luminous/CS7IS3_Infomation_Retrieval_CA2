FBIS4-22784 "jpusr046___94017" FBIS-USR-94-046 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 16 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Investment Fund Under Investigation Investment Fund Under Investigation 944F0589A Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian 16 Apr 94 p 1 944F0589A Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Lyubov Volkova: "That Means Someone Needs It: On Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves Once Again"] [Text] On 5 November 1993, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA [RG] printed a perfectly harmless article entitled "Do Not Count Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves," where specialists questioned the sincerity of advertisements of the check investment fund "Neft-Almaz-Invest" [Oil-Diamond-Invest]. As it became clear, however, the claim hit a sore spot, and the fund's managers proposed that the editorial office publish a retraction and compensate for moral damages with a monetary sum of 50 million rubles [R], and in addition threatened to sue the newspaper. And although instead of money and a retraction, they received an even more expositary article entitled "Ship the Diamonds in Barrels" (RG, 22 December 1993), for some reason they did not sue the newspaper. As it turned out, state offices had begun auditing the fund. As a result, the fund's license was revoked and criminal proceedings were instituted against its management. But several days ago events took an altogether different turn. On 11 April, the finding of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly Commission of Independent Experts on the audit of the activity of the "Neft-Almaz-Invest" check investment fund, the "Dante-Capital Management Company" and "Depositariya" [Depositary] was faxed to the editorial office. The first lines of the finding confirmed that the high Commission (with a capital letter) had been created at the instruction of the leadership of the State Duma Committee on Ownership, Privatization, and Economic Activity. And then over several pages came a complex denial of any violations by the fund. That was the Commission's finding. The fund works in accordance with Russia's laws and its charter and it operates efficiently. The fact of 572,700 missing privatization checks was not established. The Commission considers incorrect the claim of the GKI [State Investment Committee] employees that the "Neft-Almaz-Invest" ChIF [check investment fund] illegally issued and sold stock worth R11 billion. It also does not recognize the claim that the fund does not follow established procedures in keeping a stockholders' register and thereby does not protect stockholders' rights properly. The Commission believes that the GKI and the law enforcement organs have done serious damage to the cause of privatization in Russia, which should also be reimbursed by them following established procedures. Yes, RG rightly wrote, the bosses of investment funds easily imagined that a Soviet citizen would take any word spoken on television and in the press as the absolute truth. Despite the exposes in our newspaper, they were earnestly counting on catching even us journalists through our gullibility and using ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to influence the minds and feelings of Russians. In the Commission's opinion, journalists should have "saluted" and printed the finding after looking at the list of members of the Commission: "V. M. Simcher, academician, doctor of economic sciences, and chairman of the Commission; V. S. Martemyanov, State Duma deputy; Yu. M. Ruda, State Duma deputy; V. V. Grigoryev, expert, doctor of economic sciences, and docent; V. V. Ivanov, expert, candidate of economic sciences, and docent; A. V. Filippov, expert and department chief of the Control-Budget Committee under the State Duma; and A. K. Solodov, expert and auditor. A representative of the Procurator's Office of the city of Moscow, A. A. Bratchikov, and a representative of the RF Tax Policy Department Administration for the city of Moscow, Major A. P. Klishin, were enlisted for the Commission's work." But we decided to call the chairman of the Committee on Ownership, Sergey Burkov, at the State Duma. And it turned out that in the Committee they first heard of the Commission from MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Here is the text of the official announcement of the committee delivered specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The State Duma Committee on Ownership, Privatization, and Economic Activity states that the Committee did not make a decision to create a certain Commission To Study the Activity of the `Neft-Almaz-Invest' Fund. Moreover, this question was not discussed or even raised. If such a Commission was in fact created, the Committee did not authorize it to do the study. All the facts cited in this connection are only the opinion of certain deputies." Why was this needed, and who needed it? Sergey Burkov answered this question with the conjecture that a serious political game is underway and large amounts of money have been used. He promised to inform our readers of the details in a few days when the circumstances of the matter are cleared up.
