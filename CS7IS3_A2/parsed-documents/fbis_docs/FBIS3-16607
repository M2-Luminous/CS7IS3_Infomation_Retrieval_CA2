Russian and Latvian State Delegations Have Initialed a Treaty Under Which Russian Troops Will Quit Latvia Before 31 August 1994"] [Text] Russia and Latvia have initialed a treaty on the terms, dates, and procedure for the full withdrawal of the Russian Federation Armed Forces from the territory of the Latvian Republic and on their legal status during the withdrawal period. It has been learned from the results of the talks in Moscow that this will take place before 31 August 1994. Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, called the initialing of the troop withdrawal treaty a "victory for common sense." Apart from the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, the sides also initialed three important agreements concerning, in particular, the legal status of the radar station at Skrunda, social protection for the Russian servicemen and their family members temporarily stationed on and now leaving the territory of the Latvian Republic, and also social protection for the Russian military pensioners and their family members remaining in Latvia. Andrey Andreyev, the Russian delegation's executive secretary, explained to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that Russia will keep its radar station for four years, and an extra 18 months will be set aside to dismantle it. But the question of rental for the radar station remained open. In my view, the agreement on social protection for Russian servicemen and their family members should particularly single out aspects connected with housing. In particular, the Latvian side confirms the right of servicemen to sell apartments, to receive money for them, or to leave them to relatives or private persons: citizens or inhabitants of the Latvian Republic. As for the agreement on social protection for military pensioners and their family members, the most important point in it is undoubtedly that the Latvian side has found the political will within itself and agreed to grant to all servicemen who transferred to the reserve before 28 January 1992 (the date the USSR Armed Forces stationed in Latvia passed to Russia's jurisdiction) the right to reside in the Latvian Republic without hindrance. At the meeting which the two countries' delegations held it was confirmed in principle that they are prepared to sign a further eight interstate agreements. The sides will proceed from the premise that they can be signed in the event of a meeting between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the Latvian Republic. This could take place in the very near future.
