TISHRIN says: The Lebanese judiciary investigations have revealed that Israel was the party responsible for planning the Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre with the objective of covering its continuous crimes and brutal massacres in the occupied Arab territories, particularly the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. TISHRIN touches on Israel's attempts to restore its subversive and conspiratorial role in Lebanon by moving the remnants of its agents to infiltrate into the Lebanese arena and to storm the march of security and accord. TISHRIN says: The Lebanon of today is not that of yesterday, when Israel used to wreak havoc in it, and when Israel used to believe that by moving its tools in Lebanon, it could guarantee its free presence in southern Lebanon, dictate its conditions, and evade the peace requirements and the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution No. 425, which calls for a full [Israeli] withdrawal from southern Lebanon. TISHRIN says: Through its attempts to ignite the situation in Lebanon, Israel has proven anew that it does not at all like seeing Lebanon enjoying security and stability. When it plans to strike at the march of accord in Lebanon by perpetrating crimes and carrying out aggressions against Lebanese territory, Israel clearly shows that it is completely hostile to peace and stability in the region, and that it only seeks to achieve its hostile and expansionist objectives and to continue its occupation of southern Lebanon and the other Arab territories. TISHRIN adds: This is clearly shown by the fact that the occupation troops are in a continuous state of alert in southern Lebanon, and by Israel's ceaseless threats to Lebanon to expand aggressions on its territory, perpetrate massacres against its citizens, and endanger its sovereignty. Concluding, TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, the Lebanese government's determination to impose the supremacy of law on all sides was received with satisfaction and positive response by the sons of the Lebanese people, especially since attempts to involve Lebanon in crimes and bloodshed have been checked once and for all, and since it has become clear that Lebanon, which confronted and foiled previous Israeli challenges and plots resolutely and strongly, is now able to resume the march of security and peace and to strengthen its internal front. Lebanon will not go back on its plans to achieve accord, and the Lebanese people will not allow its enemies, the Israelis, its agents, or the remnants of militias, to disrupt its stability or to undermine its national and pan-Arab aspirations.
