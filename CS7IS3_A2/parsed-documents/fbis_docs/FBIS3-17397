The SNARK agency learned this from the Karabakh army press service. According to this report, Azerbaijani soldiers were also affected, because bombs of this type have a considerable effect over a wide area. It has also been reported that Karabakh's antiaircraft defense troops have prevented Azeri aircraft from delivering an air strike on Stepanakert. The information department of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has interpreted this increased activity on the part of Baku as an attempt to put pressure on the Karabakh side during the consultations on the Karabakh issue currently under way in Moscow.
