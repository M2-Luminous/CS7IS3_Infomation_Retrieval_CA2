Vance will suggest to the Greek ambassador and the Skopjean foreign minister that they follow a step-by-step approach to the issue. He will try to bring the two different views closer. Greece believes that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov must stop provocative acts and then discuss the name issue while Skopje wants comprehensive negotiations after the embargo is lifted. Vance is expected to suggest the following steps: A. That both sides assure that they will sit at the negotiating table and discuss every issue. (Both Gligorov and Papandreou have said that they intend to discuss the name issue. Each one stressed that he would try to persuade the other, not change his own position.) B. That the discussion be separated into time periods. This means that a discussion on the symbols and the Constitution may be held before any other issue is discussed. That a solution will be found on these issues and after a certain time period (months or even years) the name issue, which is the most difficult one, will be discussed. C. That a discussion first be held at the diplomatic level and then at the political level. This removes part of the significance that the political parties of both countries would attribute to the procedure. The procedure suggested is essentially the same that was followed during the New Democracy term, when a dialogue was held between the United Nations and ambassadors. The greatest problem so far is the Greek measures against Skopje. As long as the embargo is maintained, Skopje does not intend to negotiate. This is why the solution that Cyrus Vance will suggest looks like Columbus' egg [as published]. Both sides should mutually retreat, each one mentioning in their declaration that Greece will lift the embargo and Skopje will cancel its flag and reexamine its positions on the constitution and the borders. Therefore, tomorrow's meeting at the United Nations is considered critical because Vance will try to persuade the two sides. The truth is that not much effort is needed to achieve this. The problem is clearly a procedural one so that neither side is politically exposed in its country. The Appeal At the same time, the international community will increase pressure on Skopje and Athens. The United States is trying to show Gligorov that a lot depends on his stance if it is to help him during the elections in November. With the presence of U.S. troops, the United States will provide Gligorov with security. The United States is also asking him to retreat from intransigent positions. The European Union [EU] is still pressuring Greece, and for the first time in its history it appealed against the presiding country at the European Court. The European Commission will wait until Wednesday (the outcome at the United Nations) before deciding whether to finally refer our country to court. In court--which will confer behind closed doors because political, public order, and international tension issue will be discussed--our country will have to deal with great difficulties. Despite assurances by government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos that there are no penalties and fines are not imposed easily, some European politicians have already given the go ahead to the EU to impose economic sanctions against Greece. We are now in a strange situation: Our country, one of the 12, is facing sanctions within the EU and its only hope for a solution to the problem is through the United Nations, or to be exact, the United States.
