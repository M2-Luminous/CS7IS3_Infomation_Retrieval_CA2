Vice Information Minister Yi Kyong-chae presided over a related commitee meeting that agreed to keep a close watch on articles in local newspapers regarding next year's elections for regional governors and mayors, and to take strong administratitve action against publishing violations such as advance election campaigning or defamation. The committee, comprising directors-general of the Home and Labor Ministries, Prosecutor-General's Office, Office of National Tax Administration, National Police Agency and Office of Legislation, decided to act strongly against local dailies and weeklies carrying provocative and lewd articles and photographs. It will conduct a national survey on quasi-media twice this year and a comprehensive study of weekly newspapers and magazines, as well as closely monitoring insolvent publishing companies and areas with frequent reports on quasi-journalists. Through third-round surveys last year, the committee cancelled the registrations of two newspapers, stopped eight local papers from publishing and arrested 200 quasi-journalists.
