FR941031-2-00087 FR941031-2-00063 Computation Section 321(g) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994'' amended section 230(b) of the Act. As noted above, the amendment provided a technical change to the formula used to determine the OASDI contribution and benefit base. Under the revised formula, the base for 1995 shall be equal to the larger of the current base ($60,600) or the 1994 base of $60,600 multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. If the amount so determined is not a multiple of $300, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $300. Amount The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42, is 1.0086002. Multiplying the 1994 OASDI contribution and benefit base amount of $60,600 by the ratio of 1.0086002 produces the amount of $61,121.17 which must then be rounded to $61,200. Accordingly, the OASDI contribution and benefit base is determined to be $61,200 for 1995. Retirement Earnings Test Exempt Amounts General Social Security benefits are withheld when a beneficiary under age 70 has earnings in excess of the retirement earnings test exempt amount. A formula for determining the monthly exempt amounts is provided in section 203(f)(8)(B) of the Act. The 1994 monthly exempt amounts were determined by the formula to be $930 for beneficiaries aged 65&hyph;69 and $670 for beneficiaries under age 65. Thus, the annual exempt amounts for 1994 were set at $11,160 and $8,040, respectively. For beneficiaries aged 65&hyph;69, $1 in benefits is withheld for every $3 of earnings in excess of the annual exempt amount. For beneficiaries under age 65, $1 in benefits is withheld for every $2 of earnings in excess of the annual exempt amount. Computation Section 321(g) of the ``Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994'' also amended the indexing formula provided in section 203(f)(8)(B) of the Act. Under the revised formula, each monthly exempt amount for 1995 shall be the larger of the corresponding 1994 monthly exempt amount or the corresponding 1994 monthly exempt amount multiplied by the ratio of the national average wage index for 1993 to that for 1992. The ratio of the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67 as determined above, compared to that for 1992, $22,935.42, is 1.0086002. Section 203(f)(8)(B) further provides that if the amount so determined is not a multiple of $10, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. Exempt Amount for Beneficiaries Aged 65 Through 69 Multiplying the 1994 retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount of $930 by the ratio of 1.0086002 produces the amount of $938.00. This must then be rounded to $940. The retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount for beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 is determined to be $940 for 1995. The corresponding retirement earnings test annual exempt amount for these beneficiaries is $11,280. Exempt Amount for Beneficiaries Under Age 65 Multiplying the 1994 retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount of $670 by the ratio 1.0086002 produces the amount of $675.76. This must then be rounded to $680. The retirement earnings test monthly exempt amount for beneficiaries under age 65 is thus determined to be $680 for 1995. The corresponding retirement earnings test annual exempt amount for these beneficiaries is $8,160. Computing Benefits After 1978 General The Social Security Amendments of 1977 provided a method for computing benefits which generally applies when a worker first becomes eligible for benefits after 1978. This method uses the worker's ``average indexed monthly earnings'' to compute the primary insurance amount. The computation formula is adjusted automatically each year to reflect changes in general wage levels, as measured by the national average wage index. A worker's earnings are adjusted, or ``indexed,'' to reflect the change in general wage levels that occurred during the worker's years of employment. Such indexation ensures that a worker's future benefits reflect the general rise in the standard of living that occurs during his or her working lifetime. A certain number of years of earnings are needed to compute the average indexed monthly earnings. After the number of years is determined, those years with the highest indexed earnings are chosen, the indexed earnings are summed, and the total amount is divided by the total number of months in those years. The resulting average amount is then rounded down to the next lower dollar amount. The result is the average indexed monthly earnings. For example, to compute the average indexed monthly earnings for a worker attaining age 62, becoming disabled before age 62, or dying before attaining age 62, in 1995, the national average wage index for 1993, $23,132.67, is divided by the national average wage index for each year prior to 1993 in which the worker had earnings. The actual wages and self-employment income, as defined in section 211(b) of the Act and credited for each year, is multiplied by the corresponding ratio to obtain the worker's indexed earnings for each year before 1993. Any earnings in 1993 or later are considered at face value, without indexing. The average indexed monthly earnings is then computed and used to determine the worker's primary insurance amount for 1995. Computing the Primary Insurance Amount The primary insurance amount is the sum of three separate percentages of portions of the average indexed monthly earnings. In 1979 (the first year the formula was in effect), these portions were the first $180, the amount between $180 and $1,085, and the amount over $1,085. The dollar amounts in the formula which govern the portions of the average indexed monthly earnings are frequently referred to as the ``bend points'' of the formula. Thus, the bend points for 1979 were $180 and $1,085.
