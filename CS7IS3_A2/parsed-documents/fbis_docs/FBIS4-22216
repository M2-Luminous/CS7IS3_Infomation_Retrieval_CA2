Alyabyeva, under rubric "Politics": "LDPR: Local Version"] [Text] Many Chelyabinsk residents recalled the visit made to our city in July 1991 by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who at that time was pretender to the country's highest job -- the job of president. The city dwellers, who for the most part leaned "toward Yeltsin," met the candidate cautiously. At the ChTZ [Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant], where the meeting was held at an open area near the main entrance, people were openly unfriendly. In front of the rostrum from which the guest was speaking there was active counteragitation. People went up and down the rows, passing out a newspaper in which a well-known deputy of the Russian parliament of the time had asserted that "Zhirinovskiy's party is a bluff"... But then one observed the complete manifestation of Vladimir Volfovich's mastery at recruiting supporters for himself. He unerringly guessed what it was specifically that the audience was expecting from the visiting politician, and he formulated its hopes as clear and specific goals that he and his party were undertaking to achieve. The result? After the meeting, Zhirinovskiy was surrounded by a dense crowd. People stretched their hands out to him. People asked him for his autograph. And they asked: how do we get into your party? Many were ready to write an application on the spot... I myself was a witness to all of this. But no party cell was born in Chelyabinsk at that time. Nor did it exist a year later. For all the variety of the political palette of the oblast center, for a long time we did not have any organized liberal democrats. Following the first party congress, there were three more. Its managerial link, with its permanent leader, underwent ideological demarcations. Party rules were banned and were newly registered. And all of this was without people from Chelyabinsk. The "seeds sprouted" in the summer of 1993. And I think that that was not accidental. The fourth LDPR congress was held in the spring. Zhirinovskiy formulated his party's goal as follows: "In a year and a half we will be in power." Without regional support that goal obviously is unfeasible. That is why, it would seem, in addition to the fixed attention that the LDPR is paying to each specific category of Russians, an increased amount of interest is being shown to the territories. If not material support, the maximum amount of moral support is being given to party members here. Well, then, what about the Chelyabinsk organization? Who among us has gone farther in following Zhirinovskiy's slogans and has become part of his "hawkish" organization? The best-known person is the leader of the local "Zhirinovskiyites," Aleksey Yalovenko, a 43-year-old entrepreneur with two higher educations, who has "knocked about a bit" in production (Polet [Flight], the ChTZ), and who has worked as an economist. In the autumn he fought for the mandate of deputy to the State Duma in the Kalinin Electoral District. In the list of candidates to that Duma from the LDPR, he was No. 136. He was insulted when, in a newspaper report, I equated that place with the real rating of the Chelyabinsk organization in the party. When we were "ascertaining the relations" in the okrug electoral commission, I asked Aleksey Yalovenko a question: was he really counting of victory in that election? And the answer I heard was: no, but their organization intended to make active use of the campaign that had developed. They intended to use it for propaganda and agitation work to benefit the LDPR and its leader, Zhirinovskiy, as well as the local party organization. Properly speaking, it was for that reason that his personal agitational campaign was extremely modest against the background of all the others. (Incidentally, not many people know that something that was supposed at that time to become a powerful reinforcement of the young Chelyabinsk organization and its leader was a new pre-election visit to the city by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The day had already been set, and the auditorium for the meeting had already been leased, but the party leader's plans changed...) However, having given in the newspaper an announcement about his party and his telephone numbers, Aleksey Fedorovich admits that it a rare day or evening (he took the risk of giving his home telephone number) that passes without having someone call him. And they really say vile, insulting things to him. But, according to him, the people who call most frequently are those who share the LDPR slogans and who like Vladimir Volfovich's appeals. Well, then, what are we told by the results of the elections, of which we have actually had quite a few. Of those who chose slogans which, as early as the period of the pre-election campaign, were unambiguously branded as fascist ones. True, after the leader of Russia's Choice was summoned to the Court of Arbitration, comparisons of Zhirinovskiy with Hitler began to be published more cautiously, and historical parallels with the Weimar Republic proved to be more productive. But the ferocity of the time frames proved in this situation to be more beneficial for "Zhirinovskiy's party"... The election ended, the Duma began working, and on the basis of the mail and telephone calls to the editorial office one can judge that interest toward the LDPR, including the interest on the part of our fellow citizens, has not abated. So we decided to took a good look at the local version of the liberal democrats. With A. Yalovenko's permission I visited one of the meetings of the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization. What was immediately apparent, and even strikingly so, was the discipline. Discipline like that could definitely not have been encountered at every meeting of the CPSU with its democratic centralism. Who was absent, for what reason, who had failed to give notification, a rechecking of the list... There were twice as many cell members as had gathered that day in the recreation room of the ZhEK [housing operation office]. It turned out that, because of the crowding, it was impossible for everyone to fit into the one area at the same hour -- it was necessary to hold the meeting in two sessions. A. Yalovenko began to discuss his trip to Moscow, to the party's Central Committee, and I looked around at those who had gathered, among whom, incidentally, the roll call had revealed two newcomers, who had come here for the first time with the intention of becoming LDPR members. The overwhelming majority of the audience consisted of men, mostly between the age of 30 and 40. It turned out later that the people were entrepreneurs, employees, and laborers. The people who were absent were those emotionally unbalanced individuals who had already become the usual participants in many meetings of other public organizations and parties. Evidently it was partially for that reason that the meeting proceeded in a businesslike, successful manner. It was not until later, when I was standing at the bus stop, that I put all my impressions together. Yes, they had been people who had deliberately made their choice, who had come to the party in order to work and who were ready to work. They are the active opposition. Although I think that many of them, as members of the opposition, began with the usual grumbling about the messed-up production life, the production managers who had gotten out of control, the "stall businessmen" who were charging exorbitant prices... And the organization members themselves said at their meeting that people in the oblast had voted more eagerly for the LDPR in the areas of our industrial giants that periodically send their work on unpaid furloughs or with miserly payment for their forced days off. And I agree that these forced days off, to a large extent, are recruiting new LDPR members. And the headquarters of the local organization of that party in Chelyabinsk is not just anywhere, but in Traktorzavodskiy [Tractor Plant] Rayon: incidentally, Uraltrak has once again sent its tractor workers out on a two-week "furlough"... To tell the truth, when I looked at those people and listened to their statements, I thought: somehow Zhirinovskiy's cocky statements -- those that assured the party the unflattering comparison with fascism -- do not "stick" specifically to them. For that reason I wanted to speak a bit with several party members, and after the meeting I had the opportunity to do so. It was difficult to argue. But, for example, it seems to me that this is obvious: it is impossible to fit into a single program a promise to mothers that their sons will not serve outside the confines of Russia, that they will be returned from hot spots, and the obviously imperial vision of the future Russia -- as a minimum, the restoration of its borders as they were in 1917. But what about the "leap to the south," which even officially has been evaluated as an open appeal to war, for which a criminal case has been initiated against Zhirinovskiy? "Is it possible today to establish new boundaries without having Russian soldiers finding themselves in the role of conquerors?" I asked a woman who, it turned out, is a teacher who recently retired. The answer I heard was, "The point is not that the previous Russian territories will be won back, but that the economic conditions will force them to seek an alliance with Russia." "Well, then, what about the Russian soldier on the shore of the Indian Ocean, which has never washed Russia?" I asked her, giving an argument that, it would seem, is simply impossible to challenge. "What are you talking about!" the teacher said, giving me a surprised look. "That's simply an allegory!" I assume that, when she is all alone, that elderly woman and teacher still experiences certain doubts about the convincingness of her logic. But I deliberately quote this dialogue, which convinced me that it is not very productive to put the label of "fascists" on people so scathingly and disdainfully. Incidentally, it is rather easy to be convinced that the association of local liberal democrats has been born and is definitely not sticking to the "geopolitical" strivings of their scandalously well-known leader. The thing that has united people and that is bringing new members to them is primarily people's deep concerns about the real-life situation, when enterprises are in a fever, when prices keep going higher and higher, when crime is rampant, and the ruling politicians try to convince people that this is the only possible course for the country. There is nothing surprising about the fact that people who have lost their patience finally lose their hope of better times and are inclined easily to believe those who are decisive and energetic, who give simple recipes, infecting others with confidence about implementing them: "Just give me the power!" And when those decisive leaders mobilize that segment of our passive voters who, so far, have failed to trust either the creators of the present course or the opponents of that course, the power actually will easily prove to be in their hands. The wing of Zhirinovskiy's popularity, of course, has overshadowed the LDPR organizations in the outlying areas. But here -- and, once again, I am making my conclusion from what I heard and saw at the meeting -- people are not planning to live for this world alone. And even A. Yalovenko's statement to his fellow party members sounds noticeably discordant: "Do not think that the party is meetings and high-sounding statements. Our party is serious. But do not expect any rapid success. It is a year or two until that success, and no less than that. But today we need planned, methodical work..." It was precisely at that meeting that the first-priority tasks were discussed. One of them is the creation of a well-branched oblast organization. As of that moment, LDPR organizations were in operation in Zlatoust, Bakal, Troitsk, Miass, Sim, Magnitogorsk, and Kopeysk. In addition to Chelyabinsk. But there are also LDPR members in other cities, who entered the organization after addressing a statement directly to the Central Committee. The meeting planned to organize them also. And the task was posed not in general, but was assigned to a specific individual. Another task that was broadly discussed is the creation of a youth organization. I really heard a lot about adolescents who had been kicked out of clubhouses where the areas had been handed over to other occupants! It would seem that the LDPR is the organization that has hands long enough to reach them! In any case there are people here who are ready to take that specific job on their shoulders... Just as, incidentally, they are ready to organize a volunteer people's druzhina ("You can't fight crime with words; you have to help the militia!"). Of course, the liberal democrats in Chelyabinsk intend to fight at the election to the local agencies of power. And they are seriously troubled by the equating of their party to a fascist organization. They have even decided to devote the next meeting to ideological questions, to analyze exactly what fascism is, and why people are accusing the LDPR of being fascist. They want to develop their own system of counterarguments. Who knows, but maybe these reflections, if they prove to be as serious as the intention to improve Russian life, will yield an expected result... Will the Chelyabinsk LDPR organization then be able to further strengthen Zhirinovskiy's success? Meanwhile, as has become known, Vladimir Volfovich himself intends to make a visit to Chelyabinsk.
