In the interview, Eda stressed his stance to render decisionmaking procedures more flexible via such measures as public hearings on revision of the government's long-term atomic energy program. He also disclosed Japan's desire to construct the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER), a new reactor being jointly developed in Japan by Japan, the United States, Europe, and Russia. Following are questions and answers from the interview: [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion among the public that no change has been observed in the coalition's atomic energy policy since the period of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. What is your comment? [Eda] I have no intention to revise construction policies for plants' reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, or for policies promoting the fast breeder reactor [FBR] project. The coalition took over the LDP policies on these points. However, we are happy to hear the opinions of those who oppose the government projects. If a public hearing is held successfully, the next long-term atomic energy program will contain more flexible decisionmaking procedures. To make some significant changes in atomic energy policies, it is necessary to revise practices established during 38 years of LDP rule. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you progressing in establishing the coalition parties' consensus on atomic energy policies? [Eda] It is true the stances of the coalition parties toward the atomic energy policies are widely varied, and they have never had a uniform opinion on any subject in this field. Since atomic energy issues are evoking much controversy worldwide, it is quite normal that the coalition parties have various opinions on these issues. Even if there are differences in opinion, we can still go ahead. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is believed a revision of the government's long-term atomic energy program is badly behind schedule. What is your position on this? [Eda] The delay in revising the long-term program will not affect any projects. While construction of demonstration reactors for the new converter reactor and FBR will be slightly delayed, these have nothing to do with the revision of the program. The delay in the revision of the program is quite normal because this is a part of policy revisions following the political turnover. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What are the future goals of the science and technology policies? [Eda] While Japan has been growing smoothly, it is now facing a great recession. Science is a major tool to systematically overcome the present situation. Therefore, we must think about such drastic measures as building up information super highways and constructing an ITER in Japan. Economic policies should be discussed in line with the direction of science and technology policies.
