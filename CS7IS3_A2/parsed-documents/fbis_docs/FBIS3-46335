The Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress which starts tomorrow will examine and discuss three such regulations. These three regulations are: "Regulations on the Transfer of Real Estates in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province," "Regulations on House Renting in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province," and "Regulations on Real Estate Ownership Registration in Towns and Cities of Guangdong Province." The real estate regulation promulgated and put into force by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress last month was "Regulations on Real Estate Development and Management in Guangdong Province." According to the official of the people's congress, although four rules and regulations have been promulgated by the provincial government and people's congress in the past two years and more to standardize the real estate market, the question of lacking sufficient laws and regulations for real estates remains serious at present. The official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress gave examples to show that the question of the real estate transfer market is quite conspicuous at present. First, taking advantage of land acquisition, some grass-roots governments have acquired land from peasants at low pricse and then sold it to land developers at high prices to reap staggering profits. This has resulted in disturbances or fights with weapons. Last year, land acquisition in Huizhou City alone caused nine incidents of disturbances and fights with weapons, involving over 100 people each, wounding 20 cadres and over 100 people, and resulting in a direct economic loss amounting to 1 million yuan. Second, the question of illegal land transfer is serious in towns and townships. On one occasion, several square kilometers of land were illegally transferred in a certain village in Buji Town of Shenzhen City. Third, illegal sales and transfer of commodity housing are serious and such practice harms the interests of the consumers. Fourth, fraud in real estate transactions carried out by lawbreakers are often found. It is disclosed that the three regulations to be examined and discussed by the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress tomorrow will include detailed provisions on a series of issues such as the transfer, renting, and ownership registration of real estates.
