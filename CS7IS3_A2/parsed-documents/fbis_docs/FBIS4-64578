The European Unions's accession treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway require its approval, which is not a certainty, however. It is not so much being questioned by declared opponents to the membership of these countries but by the majority of frustrated members of the European Parliament, who are afraid that the Strasbourg assembly might never again rise from the shadowy existence of its fragmentary powers. For this reason, the rebels do not want to approve of the agreements this evening unless the governments promise them real parliamentary rights. They also fear that a group of 16 will not be able to achieve things that the Twelve have failed to accomplish. It is easy for the deputies to revolt, because they do not have to declare themselves but can simply press the "no" button. Since it is not a majority of votes cast that is required, but a majority of the total number of 518 members of the European Parliament, staying away from the vote is enough to prevent the passing of the agreements. "There is strong resistance against the acceptance of new members because it would entail a shift of the European focal point eastward and thus strengthen Germany's position," Ingo Friedrich, a member of the Christian Social Union, pointed out. They do not admit this, however, but pretend that they are worried about the further development of integration -- the "deepening" of the community. Thus, there is a great deal of hypocrisy involved, particularly among some of the French. During the negotiations about the Maastricht Treaty, Italy, the Benelux countries, and Germany vigorously insisted on a democratization of the community, that is on more powers for the Strasbourg assembly. Yet Paris and London were against it. French members who did not lift a finger at the time to increase the power of the European Parliament are now raising the objection that the Union should not be enlarged before it is "deepened." However, one cannot only speak of hypocrisy in Strasbourg. The overwhelming majority of MP's have indeed reason to rebel, because the governments even increased their fears during the accession talks. "Deepening before enlargement" was the motto under which the deputies wanted to advance the process of integration. The opposite seems to be the case now: Enlargement and gradually slower integration. They cannot silently accept that Great Britain has forced the partners to water down the qualified majority vote in the Council of Ministers of an enlarged community. Still, most of the deputies know that they must not prevent the enlargement if they want to keep the community together. Yet the question is how many are still interested and will participate in the vote. A total of 50 percent of the present deputies will not be returned to the parliament after the European elections.
