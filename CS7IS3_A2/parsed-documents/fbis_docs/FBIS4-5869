The comment came in response to a speech Thursday by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, in which he said domestic issues like government regulations should be taken up by the World Trade Organization (WTO), a forum to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. "Discussion in a multilateral setting will likely provide some solutions to issues like deregulation," Kumagai told a press conference. Kumagai, however, opposed a proposal that Japan, the United States and the European Union (EU) create a trilateral forum to discuss economic and trade affairs. In a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakech on Thursday, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan proposed such a forum. "Such a trilateral forum would only complicate problems," Kumagai said, indicating his view that issues like the Japan-U.S. trade "framework" talks should be basically held on a bilateral basis.
