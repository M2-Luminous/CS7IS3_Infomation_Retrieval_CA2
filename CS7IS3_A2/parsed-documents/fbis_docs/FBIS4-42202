The goal was to improve relations between the two neighboring countries. This has certainly been achieved. Concerning the civil war between the Islam-dominated north and the Christian minority in the south of Sudan, which has been smoldering since 1955 and broke out again in 1983, the Muslim head of state said that the government has brought large parts of the southern regions under its control. Only in some border areas is there still some fighting. The fact that the leadership in Khartoum is serious about pacifying the country is shown by the acceptance of the recommendations that were given in the course of the large conference in 1989, such as a "just distribution of power," as well as the "establishment of a federal system" into the government program. Thus, there are also representatives of the Christian minority among the cabinet members and high-ranking officers. The junta chief rejected accusations that the Christian minority is being suppressed massively as a "negative campaign in international media" against the "image of Sudan."
