They were the principal participants in formulating the strategy and philosophy for conducting the negotiations on settling the Bulgarian foreign debt. The president expressed his serious concern over the fact that they had left the Foreign Debt Commission. During the conversation, it became clear that the both of their decisions to resign were prompted by fundamental differences with the remaining members of the Commission. In response to Dr. Zhelev's request, both of them will meet with Prime Minister Berov.
