The foreign minister said that on several occasions the so-called protection of Russians' rights had been mentioned, and these are not the generally accepted human rights that are the case here but the rights of Russians. A threatening voice was used repeatedly in the course of the speech, firm and tough action was promised in protection of those rights. Russia did not make a reference to international law. Instead, she takes the liberty to interfere in the domestic affairs of others whenever she sees fit. Luik is worried about the Russian president's (?statement) that regarding relations with the West there have been concessions made unilaterally, [word indistinct] in respect of the state budget. It seems that the idea of dismantling the totalitarian war machine has been abandoned and it is considered important to restore it. [Words indistinct] that part of the speech devoted to Europe. The impression is that there is no desire to accept the standards that exist in Europe; instead, there is a desire to rework them. Such an approach is incomprehensible to Estonia. Estonia is fully satisfied with a Europe based on a market economy and a policy of consensus. It emerges quite clearly what Russia's interests are. It remains completely unclear, though, how Russia plans to consider other countries' interests, said Foreign Minister Luik.
