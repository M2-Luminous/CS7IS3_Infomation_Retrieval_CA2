FR940719-2-00042 FR940719-2-00018 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of Air Force Public Scoping Meeting, Plattsburgh AFB, NY The United States Air Force (Air Force) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of Plattsburgh AFB, NY. The meeting will be held June 14, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Plattsburgh High School Auditorium, 1 Clifford Drive, Plattsburgh, New York. The purpose of this meeting is to: (l) Identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support base disposal and reuse; (2) solicit comments on the proposed action; and (3) solicit potential disposal and reuse alternatives for consideration in developing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the Air Force will consider all reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state or local government agency; any federally-sponsored or private entity; or any individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Plattsburgh AFB. To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal alternatives to be included in the EIS, the Air Force recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming meeting or forwarded to the address below by August 1, 1994. The Air Force will, however, accept additional comments at any time during the environmental impact analysis process.
