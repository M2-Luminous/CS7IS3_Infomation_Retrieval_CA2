The sources added that as part of the exodus from Aden to Djibouti, a Russian ship carrying a number of families, including the families of some officials implicated in the secessionist plot led by YSP rebels against legitimacy, headed by traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, arrived at Djibouti port yesterday. The sources said the quarters that receive and accommodate these families deliberately disembarked some ordinary passengers and families from the ship for camouflage purposes and kept the families of ranking YSP figures on the ship until darkness as a security precaution and for fear of their being identified. The secessionist, mutinous leaders are sending their families abroad, leaving the Aden people and their families as well as the misled and helpless ones in the Armed Forces to face dangers alone and serve as human shields to secure these leaders' escape and reunion with their families after having become certain that Aden's fall is imminent and that they will fall into the hands of the forces of unity and legitimacy.
