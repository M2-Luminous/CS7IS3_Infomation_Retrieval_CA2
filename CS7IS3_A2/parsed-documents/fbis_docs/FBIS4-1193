W. de Klerk said on Monday [25 April] morning. "Contingency plans are in place for the election. We have high manpower levels and we will not allow the right wing or anyone else to disrupt the process," he said. Mr de Klerk, on his way from an hour-long cabinet meeting to a National Party caucus meeting before the special parliamentary session, was reacting to questions about the car bomb explosion in central Johannesburg on Sunday and its possible effect on the election. "We have achieved virtually full inclusiveness and are now dealing with a small handful of radicals on the right and the left. We have maximum security deployed across the country. This type of situation does offer a risk, but I can assure the public of effecting protection while voting." It is believed the brief cabinet meeting was used to discuss the possibility of amnesty for security forces, the car bomb blast and the events in Ulundi over the weekened where several people were killed while putting up election posters. Mr de Klerk said no decision had yet been taken on the indemnity, but added the cabinet would be meeting again later on Monday.
