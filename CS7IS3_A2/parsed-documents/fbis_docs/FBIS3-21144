If the reaction takes place at 550�C, almost all of the original freon is separated, and after five hours, a separation rate of approximately 70% can be maintained. This means the creation of a low-cost catalyst with a long life, which has been the problem with catalytic separation of freon up to now, and it opens the path to mass processing. Since freon is chemically stable, combustion decomposition methods have been used for separation processing. However, a Normal Pressure Fixed Bed Flow-Through Reaction Apparatus high temperature of 800�C is necessary, and after incineration hydrofluoric acid forms, so there are problems such as corrosion of the incinerator. Takita et al. focussed on catalytic separation methods that have low temperatures and developed a new catalyst. This is one in which zirconium oxide (33%) and chromium oxide (67%) are agitated in an aqueous solution of metal nitrates, the water evaporated off and the remainder fired at 500�C in an air atmosphere for five hours; after this, it is pressed and formed into fine spherical grains. In the freon separation experiment, an apparatus in which one part freon, five parts air and three parts water vapor were supplied to a pass-through type electric furnace was used, and the catalyst was set up in the center of the furnace. Using one gram of catalyst and introducing 18cc of the mixture (2cc of which were freon) into the furnace at a temperature of 550�C, 80% was separated into carbon dioxide, and the remainder was absorbed in an alkaline solution in the form of a small amount of hydrogen fluoride, etc. In addition, if the concentration of the freon in the mixture is reduced to 2.7% separation into carbon dioxide at a yield of 90% was possible. Prof. Takita said, "From here on we will set up a miniplant, and work on development of a long life catalyst and improvement of the separation rate."
