This was Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets's proposal to Cuban Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Soto [title as received], with whom he had a working meeting today. Oleg Soskovets said Russia was interested in selling a large batch of military helicopters to Colombia to fight the drug mafia. In a deal like this Russia could offer Colombia very competitive conditions. As is known, Colombia today is facing a need for this type of aviation technology. Cuba for its part has very close links with Latin American countries and also knows the situation on the local market and could offer considerable support to Russian firms trying to export their products to Latin America. Russians have so far had to try to operate on their own on the Latin American continent and often suffered losses as a result, Soskovets said. The interstate company RosCuba, set up recently, is playing an important role in promoting cooperation between Cuba and Russia in bringing Russian goods and technology into Latin America, Oleg Soskovets and his colleague Lionel Soto believe.
