They have signed a document which dictates the spirit of peace, forgive and forget the past, and an amnesty for all who committed crimes during the civil war. The document also guarantees a role for UNITA in a future Angolan administration. Carolyn Dempster called up UNITA's chief negotiator in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim. She asked him how significant this new agreement is: [Begin recording] [Valentim] Indeed, this subject of national reconciliation is very difficult and very complex, but we succeeded to adopt the general principle because there is a political willingness on the two sides, and also we must be very thankful to the mediation, to the observers who helped us to put down important principles that can reconcile, (?really), Angola. [Dempster] How soon are we likely to see the implementation of some of these principles? [Valentim] The two sides accept that the reconciliation is not a matter between institutions, it is a matter between Angolans to work together for common goals with the spirit of cooperation. Also it is important that we accepted that all violence should be condemned, every conflict should be solved peacefully, and also the two sides accept that the UNITA elements should participate fully in all levels of administration, political institutions, economic and other institutions. [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, (?a lot of) people looking at this would say, but what right does UNITA have to participate in a future government in Angola? After all you lost the democratic elections and the war that was waged was very much taken up by your leader, Jonas Savimbi. [Valentim] Yes, I want to say that we are the Angolans, we learn from history, from civil war in the United States, from other wars, that the most important is political willingness, and we are ready to finish the war. The voice that we will listen will be the voice of Angolans, they want (?really) the Angolans to live together. That is why we are ready to cooperate, to build up a new nation. [Dempster] Mr. Valentim, this sounds like very noble statements, but at the same time as you are making them and reaching some kind of agreement across the table on reconciliation the fighting is continuing, and if anything, intensifying. Now, what hope is there of reaching a point of a cease-fire in the near future? [Valentim] We are insisting every day to the mediation and observers to do everything possible to appeal to the two sides to stop the war in order that we should have real good environment, political environment for discussions. The two delegations, they don't agree to escalate the war in Angola, and the relationship between the two delegations is excellent. I want to say it clearly that we hope, with appeal of the Security Council and with the appeal made by President Clinton from the White House, our leadership in Huambo and Luanda, they will listen to the voice of reason in order to put down all this escalation of war in order to have peace in Angola. [Dempster] So, you are saying that the political discussion has to be finished before there is a cease-fire, or you are hoping that there will be a cease-fire before you in fact finish negotiations? [Valentim] Well, if it was my wish, it is really now to have de facto cease-fire before finishing all the political debate, no matter that it was agreed before in December that a formal cease- fire should only be declared after we finish all issues. But the personal willing of the UNITA delegation is that the fighting now should be completely finished with a de facto cease-fire on the two sides. [end recording]
