[Poptsov] In principle, the Supreme Soviet, in a purely legislative sense, did not have any kind of rights to the Russian Television and Radio company. The fact is that no one founded it--it was organized by a decision of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet. But this is not the same thing. Nevertheless, we began to sense deputy pressure as early as the Second Congress, just as it went on the air. A desire emerged among the deputies to be present on the air, then it grew into a desire to prevail on it, and in the end, into a desire to own it. The situation began to heat up. Here, of course, it was necessary to display a certain diplomatic ability, and at times elementary cunning. On the one hand, to offer parliament an opportunity to be present on the air in one way or another (pluralism for us is natural), and on the other hand--to remain true to the principle of protection of reform. We developed a certain formula of political behavior: We are supporters of the president, but we are opposed to his mistakes; we are supporters of the progressive forces in parliament, but opposed to the reactionary, conservative forces in it. When the situation got completely hot, we had recourse to the protection of the law. By taking advantage of precisely the fact that our company was not founded, we held a conference of the labor collective and elections of the leadership. What happened further is known. The appearance of the "Parliamentary Hour" already signified the stage of hand-to-hand fighting. I was absolutely convinced that this "hour" would bring only harm. Khasbulatov spoke more than once about this. Parliament was transformed into a kind of theater, and it lived according to the laws of the theater. But inasmuch as the actors were not professionals, the performance only repelled the viewer. I would not want our present government to make a similar mistake by trying to create its own television studio. Journalistic professionalism should not be confused with administrative professionalism. When a head-on attack was started on the part of parliament, I was faced with the task as the manager of the television and radio company to involve the president in the resolution of this problem. The president understood that the fate of reform and his own political fate, curiously enough, was in the hands of the mass media. Yeltsin reacted to the emerging situation instantly, and he issued several documents concerning the company. They were rescinded and suspended by parliament.... Then these absurd changes appeared in the Law on the Mass Media--concerning the oversight councils.... [Moroz] Was strong pressure exerted on you personally? [Poptsov] Of course. At that congress where the question concerning oversight councils was discussed, there was also an item on the agenda about my dismissal from the position I held. It is hardly likely that I would have been dismissed at the congress, but this was a strong move on the part of the deputies and initiators of that inconceivable decree of the congress on the mass media. I was practically the only one who could professionally and conclusively oppose them. They sensed this and took me out of the game. No matter what I said against the amendments to the law, this could be easily represented as my self-defense. It must be said that it was a brilliant move. Afterwards, a skirmish started with the faction "Smena--New Policy," Astafyev's group.... But when, at the very end of its existence, the Supreme Soviet sent a commission to the company, well, here, as the saying goes, the wounded were carried directly from the battlefield.... [Moroz] Do you expect the same kinds of encroachments on RTV [Russian TV] on the part of the newly elected Federal Assembly? How do you expect to build relations with it? The experience of the struggle with the Supreme Soviet will probably prove to be apropos? [Poptsov] The Federal Assembly is a legislative authority of a transition period. Part of the conclusions, attitudes, and world outlook in it will be from the past, and part--from the future. The Duma faces a very complex test: Behind it is the image of the past Supreme Soviet. If suddenly the relay of its meetings is repeated and the television viewer sees not only familiar faces, but also hears familiar speeches, when the deputies vie in insulting the president, the viewer inevitably will utter in response the fateful "Enough!" This will be the beginning of the end of the Duma. Therefore, I think that principles have to be developed that rule out a repetition of that past unreasonableness. There must be an edict, a strict rule, that would define the practice of elucidating the activities of the president, the government, and the Federal Assembly. This elucidation must go into the general information stream. Television, radio, and newspapers should have an opportunity, based on their professional understanding, to be at meetings of the government, the state, and so on, and throw light on these meetings in those instances when the journalists deem it necessary. [Moroz] A big "backlash" is taking place on television today in connection with the phantasmagoric results of the elections. Do you feel responsible for these results? [Poptsov] Both yes, and no. More--no. Because this is ridiculous--to blame everything on television. TV, radio, and the newspapers simply reflect events. This is first. And, second, we must subordinate ourselves to normative acts that regulate an election campaign. We were supporters of equal air time that was being offered to the candidates. But the electoral commission took the Western principle as a basis. We, after all, cannot live without imitation, forgetting that, in contrast to "them," our democracy is in its first stages. Blocs not only monopolized the airwaves--they also monopolized the form of exposition. They let loose a torrent of words onto the heads of the television viewers, over and above discussions, and over and above debates, and without any kind of critical commentaries. But now we are looking for culprits.... First of all, the former candidates themselves and their helpers should say to themselves: "We do not know how to do that which is called an election campaign. We do not know how to participate in the development of appropriate normative documents. We missed that moment when the president was preparing these edicts. We missed it! Everybody wanted to make himself secure! So that it would be convenient and cozy for himself. At the same time, it was forgotten that an idea does not develop in a comfortable situation, but in an uncomfortable one. It is necessary to have opposition for the birth of an idea. Of course, there is such a genre as advocacy. But this already simply requires oratorical skill. And so it has been disclosed: There are no brilliant advocates among the democratic figures. But Zhirinovskiy did not burden himself with ideas--and he succeeded in oratorical skill. He handles himself well in front of a camera. His weakness is when there are no television cameras. He is extremely vulnerable here. And more. We became more and more convinced: It is impossible to talk with everyone simultaneously. Zhirinovskiy appealed to different social groups separately. Gaydar is an excellent popularizer. But--among the intelligentsia. However, a leader must feel confident with any audience. Every leader has his own line, one induces laughter, another debate, and the third--concentration, he makes you think. Both the language and the style should change depending on the situation. [Moroz] Does it not seem to you that you also displayed inadequate persistence in order to organize a debate, commentaries, and the participation of a critically inclined anchorman on Russian Television and Radio? [Poptsov] Persistence is expedient until the adoption of a law. But when it is adopted, we are obliged to observe it. Everything happened rapidly. The periods allotted for the election campaign were limited, and everything created in haste suffers from mistakes. The normatives associated with information support are the best evidence of this. The law served the interests of the party. This was the first multiparty election, and a new degree of democratic development, and all the rest seemingly became secondary, including the interest of the voter as well. Incidentally, Russian radio proved to be more varied. Journalists took an active part in the programs--they asked sharp questions, although they also did this circumspectly, in view of the restrictive law. There were excellent debate programs. If we return to television programs, we were also preparing here for dispute and debate, and we readied the studio in five variants. A television debate variant, a press conference variant, and a cross-examination dialogue variant, "one on one." But the parties chose the monologue and the team self-representation variant. No one wanted debates and disputes. [Moroz] Did it not occur to you to show something just before the elections similar to Zhirinovskiy's film that was shown on the Ostankino channel? [Poptsov] We did have such work, but we abandoned it. It is impossible to do anything the day before in Russia. The unpredictability of the Russian character, among other things, is that frequently everything is done "for spite." According to sociological estimates, the film added 4 percent of the votes to Zhirinovskiy at a minimum. [Moroz] Sociologists say that the rapid increase in Zhirinovskiy's support started a week before the elections. This seems to indicate unequivocally: Television determined the outcome of the voting.... [Poptsov] This is a correct observation. It is precisely at that time that a definite drop occurred in the election activities of the democrats. It became clear that the government would not undergo radical changes. This diminished personal interest in the election campaign. You must not weaken in a distance race! Zhirinovskiy appeared for the last time on paid radio and television air time on 30 November; that is, more than 10 days before the voting. But for free air time, his party, like the others, drew lots. Russia's Choice was abundantly represented on our channel, but this did not add votes to it, because it conducted its agitation campaign both unskillfully and in an untalented way. In addition, it absolutely did not welcome criticism of its low-quality programs. Only at the very end did it wake up and understand that it was necessary to bring good polemicists to the fore. Chubays, of course, is the strongest polemicist among them. He is both a polemicist and an outstanding public speaker. But an understanding of this came too late. And, in addition to everything else, the democrats could not agree among themselves not only on the scale of the whole democratic movement, they were unable to come to an agreement even inside Russia's Choice. I do not know who on the Russia's Choice team was answerable for the election image, but the fact that there was no stage management there, nor psychological training, nor an elementary understanding of who your primary opponent is--this is unequivocal. But when the candidates of one bloc could not unite in single-seat okrugs, which led to defeat, this is already a signal concerning the obvious instability of the bloc in the future. They all spied on each other--God forbid that your colleague should become more popular. Russia's Choice was unable to carry through even a line of defense of the Constitution. "It broke down." We also do not like everything in it. But when preparations began for the referendum, we said on Russian Television: "That is all. The time to argue whether the Constitution is good or bad has passed. It is necessary now to explain to the people what is important in it, and to apply all our energies only to this." But the People's Choice candidates were engaged in a competition to the finish line, as if secretly, but they are kicking the Constitution, nonetheless. [Moroz] In June of 1996, a fascist could become president of Russia. This is no longer a fantasy, and it is not the delirium of a madman; it is an entirely tangible possibility. What does Russian Television plan to do in order to prevent this? [Poptsov] It is necessary to talk about what is happening in the country. What reform is giving, and how much it costs. Show the emptiness of Zhirinovskiy's promises. Well, he says: "I will make the Army strong." No one objects to this in principle, but what is behind this specifically? In what way does he propose to accomplish this? "I will bring Finland back into the Russian structure." But this already means blood. It should be explained what such imperial habits lead to.... It is necessary to say it this way: To unite with force--means to kill. [Moroz] Do you think that it is necessary to explain to television viewers that gibberish is gibberish? To react to each idiotic comment with a popular science program? "Children, we must not employ an atomic bomb against Japan.... This is not good.... This is inhuman...." Does it not seem to you that within half a year of such talk that the country will turn into a madhouse? [Poptsov] Well, you are presenting this in a rather overdone way. But in reality there is a rather serious problem here. Question: For whom is the mass media intended? LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, it is clear, is intended for the intelligentsia. But, after all, now all newspapers of a democratic persuasion have a claim on the same audience--the intelligentsia. And all television is working on it. The mass media somewhat imperceptibly lost the habit of talking in the language of the other classes. Therefore, one of the main problems is to find a field, but even better, several fields of a language that is understandable and accessible.... Not a primitive one, but a simple one that would reach people and touch them. Yet this is impossible without an understanding of the interests of one or another class, or one or another social stratum. [Moroz] Do you intend to put this into practice? [Poptsov] Of course. But here it is necessary to break the psychology of those who work in broadcasting. All anchormen now select as interlocutors only intelligent people who are communicative and educated. And this is understandable, but this is not the makeup of the whole society. A person should see himself on the screen. He is just like me, and his worries are just like mine. I believe him. [Moroz] What can you say with respect to the removal of Bragin from the post of chairman of the Ostankino television and radio company? I understand that it is not very comfortable for you to speak, but, still.... Does it not seem to you that he was made a scapegoat in connection with the failure of the elections? [Poptsov] I do not think that the elections played the main role here. [Moroz] After all, there were reasons to remove him earlier. But it was timed specifically with the elections and to that idiotic nighttime get-together in the Kremlin.... [Poptsov] It is both difficult for me to talk about this and it is easy. For the reason that I was against that kind of variant of a concluding night. I was an opponent of the film about Zhirinovskiy that was shown on the 11th. I do not want to say that I was consulted.... It is something else. In our country, unprofessionalism is not considered a defect. Democrats of the first wave fully copied and continue to copy the habits of past authorities. The main thing is "friend or foe," but professionalism is not even in third place, but in fifth place. As for what happened, Vyacheslav Ivanovich is partly to blame himself: Being a product of the rayon committee school, he apparently became accustomed to being guided by the principle "It is necessary!" He is appointed, then it is necessary. This is first. Second: He was appointed, as you will recall, under conditions of persecution on the part of Khasbulatov, and this formed in Bragin the impression that he was a fighter for democratic ideas and that therefore he was important. He identified his polemical fervor with the professional skill of a journalist. There was an interesting incident in my practical work. Somehow I was called up by Tyazhelnikov, at that time the first secretary of the TsK VLKSM [Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and was asked what the pay was for the work of journalists who work on the journal. I said: 250-300 rubles [R] per printer's sheet. Tyazhelnikov became indignant and noted that central committee workers write 50 pages of information and do this free of charge. Just about everybody was managing the journalists. In general, the fact that the decision on the appointment of Bragin was made under extreme conditions proved to be determinative. This is always a risky matter. This is the tragedy of democracy--a shortage of leaders, and a terrible hunger for them. I have in mind not only political leaders, but also professional leaders in various spheres. Democracy is doomed if it does not have a powerful professional layer in various spheres. [Moroz] You came to television from our environment--from the environment of writing journalists. Moreover, you are a writer and were for a long time the editor of a journal. What features in the general atmosphere of television and the psychology of the people grabbed your attention? I am personally struck by a kind of heightened complexity of many television studio employees. How can this be explained? [Poptsov] A person who has been on the air if only five minutes becomes half actor. And he already lives according to the laws of the theater. He requires praise and applause. And he gets very upset if there is none. It is like opium. A special kind of arrogance emerges: They know me, they will recognize me. But "recognize" still does not mean that they want to see you and hear you. It is on television as nowhere else that arrogance replaces knowledge and enlightenment. Further, television demands colossal expenditures of nervous energy, incommensurable with expenditures of energy on a newspaper or a journal. You perform twofold work on television: First, you prepare the program, and then you present it on the air. Therefore, nervous breakdowns here are much more frequent and apparent. And, finally, one more thing--television is cliquish. It does not accept people from the outside. This does not exist, for example, in the theater. A theater that does not replenish itself with new people is doomed. But if you take television--not only Russian Television--practically not one new name has appeared here in the last five years. Perhaps Leonid Yakubovich, the anchorman for "Fields of Miracles." A unique kind of television pomposity exists. Its most widespread manifestation: He does not understand anything about television. Although it is clear that television lives according to the very same laws as do the periodical press and theater, and that they are not partitioned off by a Chinese wall. But here, there is an effort to cut oneself off. Including from criticism.... Incidentally, television critics also do not make me happy. A haughty opinion--this is on the one hand, and on the other hand--slyness: How could they allow such an election campaign? Although they know very well that it was impossible not to allow it. However strange it may be, many critics are short on spectator attributes. Never rush to say that you saw more than the rest, do not rush with your conclusions to assert your dislike for the author of one or another program. There are a lot of personal scores in articles of this kind of reporting, revenge for past slights, which there probably were. ....All of this makes work in television very difficult. But the main difficulty is the lack of brilliantly talented people. Although there are not enough of them anywhere. [Moroz] What are you most dissatisfied with on Russian Television? [Poptsov] I am dissatisfied with the channel's slipshod work. I am dissatisfied with the fact that an enormous number of ideas die without ever being realized. An intensely negative attitude toward an idea exists if it was not you who expressed it. In such a case, all efforts are expended not on realizing it, but in a fight against it. No less dangerous is the untalented implementation of an idea that simply ruins it. There are a lot of excellent professionals here, obsessed people, but those tendencies that have appeared on television in recent years are too dangerous. I am disturbed, for example, by the neglect of such a concept as the profession of producer, and as the role of the artist. In its time, going live on the air caused a revolution in television; it disrupted the usual, it disrupted the exclusiveness, and the special theatricality. But we could not stop in time. Live broadcasting went on the attack and began to destroy television as an art. A whole category of television studio employees began to appear who think: "I am on the screen--and this is sufficient." The syndrome of "talking heads" appeared, from which everyone is going mad. Talk alone is not enough for television. It is also absolutely necessary to have a play factor, and there must be inventiveness and staging. I dream about a theater of social and political journalism, a story theater, a fable theater.... If you wish, a theater of economics. This is the only way to infect and capture the viewer. Other television thinking has to be developed. [Moroz] What can you say regarding the scandal surrounding Channel 4 and the prospects for closing our "Russian University Days?" [Poptsov] This simply cannot be, because it can never be. I have in mind the closing of "University Days." That is all we need! We will raise the whole country, if there will be need of this. As it is, reform has already crushed science, and it has crushed enlightenment, education, culture.... I have talked about this a thousand times. I spoke to everyone about this. To the president, to the prime minister, and to the deputies. I would put the question to the local powers that be in this way: "Yes, today we cannot provide you with resources. It is difficult. But we are giving you this channel. This is your channel, scientists. This is your channel, teachers. This is your channel, young people--an enlightenment and education channel." Even if it kills us, we will defend this channel. We defended it. We will not give up an inch. Any self-respecting state should have such a channel. This is a channel which, speaking in the fashionable idiom, should become the presentment of the Russian intellect. It is necessary to bring the channel up to snuff, to the necessary mark. We have already invested enough energy in it. As everywhere, money and time are needed. As for the remaining part of Channel 4, there, perhaps, there you can do what you want. Two concepts have collided here: Our "Russian University Days", or still another little Ostankino? It is all the same, but in its own small variant. A little less polished, a little more nonchalant, but, still, the same--politics, music, theater.... I see no need to repeat one and the same thing in 20 variants. Now, according to the edict of the president, NTV [Independent Television) will work together with us. They promise to amaze the world. We wish them success. And we will wait. [Moroz] At one time, you tried to arrange regular interviews with the president and his periodical speeches on television. Where did this idea get sunk--in Yeltsin's circle, or did he bury it himself? [Poptsov] It was possible to implement one-third of this idea in principle, but there is great resistance on the part of the president's circle. Indeed, Boris Nikolayevich himself is a very specific person. He himself is a reserved person by nature. Difficult to get used to. With a confused idea about his own positive and negative qualities. Someone suggested to him that he loses in extemporaneous talks. In reality, improvisation is his strongest side. Because he is a man of the people. He feels good and at ease in a crowd. In a free dialogue, he proves himself to be interesting, very original, and an interlocutor who is not devoid of craftiness and cunning. He is quick to react, and he has a good memory. In all of our practical work in television interviews with him, Yeltsin did not once ask me questions beforehand. We were simply able to come to an arrangement while walking: We will talk about such-and-such a subject. The president has a normal human reaction. He gets offended like a normal person. You can hear from him: I promised myself to hold a grudge against you for two weeks, but it is already a month today, and it is past the time, let us talk...." [Moroz] Do you associate with him frequently? [Poptsov] I try not to abuse this, but when it is necessary for me to discuss some questions, and if the president is not bearing a grudge against me, he is always ready to be contacted, and the conversation, as a rule, turns out to be very open and interesting. I do not recall that the president has refused to meet. [Moroz] Well, then, will there still be regular monthly speeches of the president on Russian Television? [Poptsov] I am confident there will be. And the last time we came to an agreement, and we scheduled a program. But then some kinds of events occurred.... Poptsov appeared somewhere in Skokov's company--the circle immediately began to say: "There, you see! Something is not right here...." The president is a human being. He is also vulnerable, like all people. He has been betrayed more than once. Before our eyes he was betrayed three times in a major way. Under such circumstances each of us should be more cautious in relations with other people, even more suspicious. I understand him well. There is one more obstacle--jealousy on the part of the Ostankino company. They are beginning to calculate on which channel the president speaks most often. These calculations absolutely do not interest me. I am also not interested in the fact of who in a shot is next to the president. All of this is details; the main thing is that there should be a continuous, open dialogue with the president on Russian Television. And there will be.
