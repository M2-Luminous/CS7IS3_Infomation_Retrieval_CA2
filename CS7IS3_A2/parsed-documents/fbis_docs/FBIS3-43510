The troops were on Nigerian territory and had no "expansionist" intentions, he added, explaining that the aim was to show local people that they had not been abandoned by the authorities. Press reports said that last week Cameroonian paramilitary police carried out a raid against Abana fishing village in Cross River state, killing six people. Six women have been reported missing since. THE GUARDIAN newspaper, citing sources close to the security forces, said the Cameroonian gendarmes threw the baby child of one of the villagers into the water after she said she did not have to pay them money they had demanded. Fourteen fishing vessels were sunk during the raid, the independent newspaper said.
