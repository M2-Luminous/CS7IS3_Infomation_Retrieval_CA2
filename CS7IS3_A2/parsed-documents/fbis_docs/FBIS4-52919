FBIS4-52919 "dreas094_d_94025" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 South Korea Nationwide Rallies Set for 17 May To Mark Kwangju Uprising Nationwide Rallies Set for 17 May To Mark Kwangju Uprising SK1605090594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0847 GMT 16 May 94 SK1605090594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- An umbrella organization of dissident activist groups announced Monday it will stage nationwide rallies Tuesday in memory of the "1980 Kwangju popular uprising" against the government. The rallies will start at 7 PM at Chongmyo Park in downtown Seoul [four blocks from the U.S. Embassy] and in 11 major cities across the nation to mark the 14th anniversary of the civil uprising, a spokesman for Chongukyonhap (The National Alliance for Democracy and Unification) told a news conference Monday. Local Chongukyonhap chapters will also file criminal complaints with prosecution offices in their regions Tuesday afternoon demanding the prosecution of Former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who they claim should assume responsibility for the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement, the spokesman said. Additional complaints will be lodged at prosecution offices across the country on May 27, when the organization expects to have more people joining the move against those responsible for the massacre during the suppression, he said. The group hopes more than 1 million people, including 400,000 from Kwangju, will join the attempt to take legal action. In a statement, Chongukyonhap said "we are going to file complaints with the prosecution against Chon Tu-hwan, then commander of the Defense Security Command, No Tae-u, then commander of the Capital Garrison Command, and 33 other military commanders above the level of battalion commander for treason and homicide because we think the incumbent government has no will to reveal the truth about the Kwangju democratization movement and prosecute those responsible for the suppression of the movement." In a separate move, a coalition of the nation's student councils plans similar rallies across the nation to commemorate the uprising during the "five-day period for struggle to succeed the spirits of the Kwangju civil uprising" starting Tuesday, with over 1,400 students from more than 10 universities in Seoul expected to take part in the rallies in the capital alone. The police, meanwhile, have beefed up security around the residences of Former Presidents Chon and No in Yonhi-tong, central Seoul, the U.S. Embassy and the presidential office of Chongwadae in preparation for possible action there by students. Police have stationed more than 2,000 men in and around the residences of the former presidents.
