At recent sessions of the Guangzhou Commodities Fair, investigations and penalties on such behavior have become increasingly more serious. Some enterprises with comparatively serious cases of trademark violation have already been dealt with through the issuance of a critical circular. On the very day of its opening, the current Guangzhou Commodities Fair organized an examination of trademarks and found that cases of enterprises participating in the exhibition violating regulations and trademarks had been somewhat reduced compared with previous sessions. Various trade delegations have universally attached importance to trademark controls; for example, the Henan delegation has on several occasions independently conducted checks on enterprises under its jurisdiction on their implementation of the regulations on trademark control. Nevertheless, there were still 20 enterprises, including the Shenzhen Kaicheng Company, which violated the rules, while most trademark violations fell into the category of marketable goods for export, and some had a reputation in the world market. The fair promptly adopted measures and sternly and quickly handled the case of any enterprise as soon as it was discovered. Viewing the situations of the 20 enterprises the current fair has handled, their cases varied as well as their attitudes. The goods of some units which violated trademarks were exhibited, but no transactions were involved; some units had already signed contracts for transaction, and the trademark violations had become facts; while the bulk of enterprises violating trademarks were comparatively active and sincere in admitting their mistakes. When it was verified that the Shenzhen Kaicheng Company had violated trademarks on 16 April, the company had all along delayed in giving a written explanation to the fair based on the relevant regulations, and displayed a very poor attitude: a heavy penalty was meted out, its qualification to participate in the commodities fair was canceled, and its exhibits were removed. The Guangxi Machinery Import and Export Company and the Xinjiang Zhongxin Industrial Company were known to have violated trademarks in previous sessions of the commodity fair, and during the current fair, they repeated their mistakes. It was learned that with regard to the commodities fair circular on checking trademarks and relevant regulations, the Guangxi trade delegation office had already relayed them to the company manager; however, the manager had failed to relay them to his staffers. This showed that the company manager had not paid any attention to them. This being the case, when penalties were imposed on the two companies, the managers in charge were especially criticized in a circular. The China Shenzhen Foreign Trade (Group) Company was verified to have violated the "White Dove" trademark on its slippers, and its samples were confiscated; however, the responsible person on the stall refused to cooperate. In light of his attitude, it can be seen that the company knowingly violated trademarks but paid no attention to the relevant regulations on checking them. Thus, a stern penalty was imposed on the responsible person. The current fair has done very specific and meticulous work on checking and handling trademark violations, while refraining from adopting a requirement for unanimity in everything, handling different cases according to their situation, and ensuring the smooth progress of the fair's export transactions, while firmly and promptly halting the violation of trademarks.
