As a result, several communities have no electricity. The National Police indicated that early this morning several men planted dynamite cartridges on two of the four sides of the pylon, which was partly destroyed while the homes of some 100,000 people were left without electric power. According to the Police, the Army arrived in the area and began to comb the mountains for those responsible for the attack. The Police said that last Saturday another two electricity pylons were dynamited in the country's interior, and no victims have been reported yet. The attacks took place within the framework of the meeting between the government and the Guatemalan guerrillas in Oslo, Norway, where the parties are considering the creation of a Verification Commission of the Historic Past. Guatemala has endured a 34-year armed conflict, which has resulted in some 175,000 victims.
