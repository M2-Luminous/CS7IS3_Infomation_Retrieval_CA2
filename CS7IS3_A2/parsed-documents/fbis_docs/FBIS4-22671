Today, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia appointed Ints Zitars, former head of the information center of the Citizenship and Immigration Department (CID), as director of the CID. I. Zitars, in his former position, has shown himself to be an able organizer. An important prerequisite was that the new department chief should come from this very department, and thus be familiar with its major problems, according to Normunds Belskis, Press Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as told to DIENA. Since the removal from office of the former department chief, Maris Plavnieks, the department was being run by his deputy, Peteris Zviedris. Ints Zitars was born in 1944, and is Latvian. He graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Latvia in 1970. From 1970 to 1978, he worked in the experimental semi-conductor laboratory in the University of Latvia as junior scientific associate. From 1978 to 1992, he was at the Solid-State Physics Institute of the University of Latvia as junior scientific associate, then senior engineer. From 1992 until his appointment as director of the CID, he worked as the head of the CID information center. Photo caption: CID director: Ints Zitars. Photo by Vitalijs Stipnieks, A.F.I.
