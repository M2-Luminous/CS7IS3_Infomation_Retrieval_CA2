During the weekend [26-27 March] the foreign ministers presented a compromise proposal to their London colleague Douglas Hurd as a last offer in Ioannina, Greece, a proposal in which they do not yield one millimeter of substance. They only built a bridge for Hurd, across which he can retreat. What the British wanted to prevent at all costs has now been set down: In an enlarged union it will no longer be 23 votes but 27 that are necessary to build a blocking minority. The smaller minority then can still delay decisions, according to the formal concession -- and that until the Council decides the end of the debate with a simple majority in line with its standing orders. Then the matter is decided with the usual qualified majority of 70 percent. However, this has been the usual procedure at the European Council of Ministers' meetings anyway, because for them how one treats the other is more important than the arithmetic of votes. In Brussels the government representatives are not overly surprised when the votes are taken. Quite the opposite: The decisions of the Council are usually clarified in the "Committee of Permanent Representatives" of the 12 governments, which comes before the Council of Ministers' meetings. If the ambassador of a larger member country, such as the United Kingdom, objects, the other 11 discuss the matter with him and postpone the pending decision. The ambassadors virtually buy from each other, with compromises, the majority that they think politically appropriate. Occasionally, the opposition exhibited by any one of them is nothing but a game with marked cards to deceive the opposing forces at home. This means: Quite a few ministers do not mind being outvoted in Brussels. However, if things get tough sometimes, the oppressed government has the last resort of stressing a "vital national interest" and blocking the decision. Just last autumn France got into the headlines when it threatened to veto the European-U.S. agricultural agreements within the framework of the GATT round. The Germans definitely could have put in their veto in the past to prevent Brussels' bad banana protectionism. However the Bonn agriculture minister himself "betrayed" consumers' interests because he had to follow the producers' interests. Douglas Hurd knows what conditions in Brussels are like and he knows very well that London's struggle for 23 instead of 27 votes is quixotic. He has probably joined the insight of a growing part of his faction, namely that the foreign policy damage that Great Britain is doing to itself far exceeds the benefit of a compromise about balancing the votes, in particular since this benefit can hardly be measured. From the British viewpoint, it would make sense to struggle generally against the instrument of majority vote in the Brussels Council of Ministers, with the goal of turning the EU back into a forum of cooperation among states. Just modifying the qualified majority seems to be pointless since even opponents of European integration, such as the British, are occasionally very interested in pushing something through in Brussels. Great Britain, for instance, is the pioneer of a liberal economic constitution in the EU. Precisely at the time when, by being enlarged to 16, the traditionally protectionist majority of the current 12 member states might turn into a liberal majority, which would be acceptable to the British as they want to make votes by qualified majority more difficult. Today, Tuesday, Secretary Hurd will try to make it clear to his stubborn party colleagues that in Europe, Great Britain has meanwhile acquired the bad reputation of being erratic and is dramatically losing political weight. "Lightweights," however, are actually very much in need of the instrument of majority vote.
