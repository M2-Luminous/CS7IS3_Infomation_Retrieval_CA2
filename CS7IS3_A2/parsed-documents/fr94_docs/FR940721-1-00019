FR940721-1-00019 FR940721-1-00009 Using the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment to attainment, Michigan's I/M SIP submittal for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area is acceptable. The State held public hearings on the State's submittal February 14, 1994 in Detroit, Michigan. With respect to the first element of the four criteria, the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule requires ``legislative authority for basic I/M such that implementing regulations can be adopted without any further legislative action.'' The legislation adopted by Michigan as a whole includes all the essential elements of a satisfactory basic I/M program. The essential elements include: •Describing the network type (``test and repair''). 3 3 The parenthetical information refers to the specifics in the Detroit-Ann Arbor, Michigan legislation. •Listing of geographic coverage of program (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and possibly Washtenaw if redesignated, or Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, Livingston, and Monroe if not redesignated). •Specifying the test type and procedure (idle test with BAR 90 equipment). •Listing of other applicable testing procedures (visual tampering inspection). •Defining subject vehicle population (1975 and later). •Specifying testing frequency (every 12 months). •Granting authority to a State agency to develop necessary rules (MDNR). •Establishing the enforceable obligation in the rule (persons shall not drive a motor vehicle without a valid emissions certificate of compliance or waiver). In addition to defining the elements essential to the definition of an I/M program, the legislation grants the authority to MDNR to develop the rest of the language necessary to make the program complete, including technical and administrative details. No further legislative action is necessary to authorize or implement the program. In the event of redesignation, the USEPA believes that the States's approach to implement I/M in the counties of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and Washtenaw counties is acceptable and meets the population requirements (geographic coverage) specified in the I/M rule (40 CFR 51.350). Because the State has authorized and provided the essentials of an I/M program in its adopted legislation, the first element of the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation Rule is satisfied. The second element of the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to require ``a provision in the SIP providing that basic I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.'' This requirement is satisfied by the provision of section 8(2)(a) which requires a basic I/M program to be implemented as a contingency measure. The third and fourth elements of the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule require an enforceable schedule and commitment by the Governor or his/her designee for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program upon a specified, appropriate triggering event. These elements are satisfied based on language submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under separate cover, within the State's redesignation application. Section 6.8.3 of the State's Southeast Michigan Redesignation TSD states ``implementation of the contingency measure[s] will be completed in a time-frame consistent with schedules of implementation required for SIPs under title I of the Act and corresponding regulations.'' This commitment was submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under the signature of Roland Harmes, the Governor's designee. The USEPA assumes that the effective date of the basic I/M legislation as a contingency measure is the date that the State determines that a basic I/M program is necessary, as shown by the urban airshed model (UAM), to correct a violation of the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA further assumes that the basic I/M program will be implemented in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area as a contingency measure 1 year from the effective date of the legislation as stipulated in the I/M rule 40 CFR 51.373(b). 4 4 Title 40 CFR 51.373(b) specifies the implementation of a basic I/M program within 1 year of obtaining legal authority. While the USEPA is proposing approval of the State's I/M submittal based on the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation Rule, if the State's redesignation request is not approved, or if the alternative approval criteria applicable to redesignation is not codified as proposed, the State's submittal must be judged against the current I/M approvability criteria which require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the program, as detailed in USEPA's final I/M rule of promulgated on November 5, 1992. The State's submittal would then not be approvable because the submittal does not include detailed rules, including cut points, test procedures and standards, quality control procedures, waiver provisions, and program compliance and oversight.
