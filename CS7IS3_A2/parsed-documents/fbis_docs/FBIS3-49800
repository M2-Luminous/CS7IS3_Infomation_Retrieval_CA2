At the end of the session, Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, made a statement for Belgrade Radio's special correspondent Milorad Denda: [Denda] Professor Koljevic, what did today's session of the assembly of the Serbian Republic conclude? [Koljevic] Today's session on the platform for the peace agreement concluded that the delegation of the republic of Srpska will once again offer in Geneva what the Serbian side has been asked to offer in the past, namely territorial concessions, and the administration of the district of Sarajevo, under specific conditions agreed upon during the negotiations. However, considering the public statements by the Sarajevo Presidency, especially by Messrs. Izetbegovic and Ganic, the assembly has adopted another platform in case the Muslim side does not accept the proffered peace agreement. This platform will be revealed, that is presented, in Geneva tomorrow, and the general conclusion, if I may say so, is unanimous and undivided that if the Muslim side does not want the agreement on these bases, the representatives of the republic of Srpska will take a very specific and definitive stand that will lead toward the affirmation of the republic of Srpska on completely new bases. [Denda] Can you be more specific about these new bases? [Koljevic] These bases will be discussed, or rather the platform itself deals with these bases. The most important element for these bases is that we will proceed with the demand for a cease-fire and the de facto situation on the ground.
