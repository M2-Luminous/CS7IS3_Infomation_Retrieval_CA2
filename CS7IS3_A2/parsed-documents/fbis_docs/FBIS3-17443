But, if Ukraine is to have any hope of averting the sort of disaster foreign experts predict, then the day after they take up their seats, the new MPs will have to face up to the issues they have been avoiding on the campaign trail. On its own, Ukraine's economic plight is cause enough for serious international concern. Ukraine's macro-economic record -- the worst in the former Soviet Union -- is so dreadful that the beleaguered officials of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Kiev have taken to raising their spirits by counting the inventive new ways Ukrainian officials are constantly discovering to destroy their economy. But what makes fragile Ukraine particularly important now is its increasingly hostile relationship with Russia. Russians -- ranging across the political spectrum from Lenin to Solzhenitzyn -- have always seen Ukraine as an integral part of "Greater Russia". As Russian foreign policy hardens in the aftermath of the elections there in December and in reaction to Russia's own economic travails, Moscow's pressure on Kiev to re-submit to Russian rule has become stronger. Ukraine's economic collapse makes it more difficult for Kiev to resist; at the same time, the nation's political determination to remain independent is growing stronger. This makes Ukraine a particularly volatile partner in what is already a tense relationship, hence the CIA's gloomy prediction earlier this year of a "probable" conflict between the two Slav giants. It is in the cities, with their greater voting power, that the outcome of Ukraine's election will be decided. There, the race is far more competitive and a new political class, representing a fledgling middle class rather than the entrenched ex-communist nomenklatura, could emerge. Ukraine's tragedy is that the uncomplaining resilience of its villages is likely to help keep its inept government in place. The irony is that it is the villages, with their tradition of hard- working self-sufficiency, which could be the driving force behind a Ukrainian economic revival -- if Ukrainian voters are ever able to elect a government with the courage and skill to initiate reforms.
