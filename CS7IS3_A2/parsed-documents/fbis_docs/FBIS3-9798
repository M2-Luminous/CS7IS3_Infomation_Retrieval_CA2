Weiss stated the SDL, a member of the new five party coalition government, had always supported a second wave of coupon privatization. "It is not just the only chance for people who otherwise wouldn't have enough money to take part in the privatization process, but it's also a form of investment in the future," Weiss said at the Trencin-Fashion City Trade Fair. Weiss said he believed privatization should be a continuous process and thus it would be wrong to ask the government to shelve the process for six months. Chairman of Parliament Ivan Gasparovic told CTK that he doubted the government would manage to prepare the second wave in time for the elections, scheduled for September 30 and October 1. Property worth 100 billion Slovak crowns ($3.1 billion) is to be privatized in the second wave.
