PV power generation systems are safe and reliable, noiseless, and non-polluting, do not require the consumption of fuels, do not require the construction of high-voltage power transmission lines, have short construction schedules, and can assume any scale. Because PV power generation system have no mechanical or moving parts, they have extremely low breakdown rates and are simple to maintain. Furthermore, PV power generation is subject to only minimal restrictions by regional resources and is far better than other renewable energy resources (such as hydropower, wind power, geothermal, marine energy, etc.) because light resources are evenly distributed across the globe. It is precisely because of this that PV power generation has attracted the universal attention of all countries and developed very quickly. World output of solar cells was just 2.5MW in 1980 but had grown to 60MW by 1992. [passage omitted] Applications of PV power generation in China began in the 1970s but they did not actually develop until after 1982. During a period of just a few years from 1983 to 1987 we imported seven solar cell production lines from the United States, Canada, and other countries, causing China's solar cell production capacity to leap from 200 kW before 1984 to 4.5MW in 1988. Because of financial restrictions, however, it was very hard to open a market and the rate of construction starts for solar cell production during the past several years has been extremely inadequate, only about one-tenth of our production capabilities (see Table 2). Table 2.

In certain new types of solar cells such as spherical cells, MIS cells, polycrystalline membrane cells, and other areas, the domestic situation is almost a blank. In the area of applications, solar cells in China at the present time are mainly used in communications systems and frontier regions. Many applications realms such as photovoltaic water pumps, civilian appliances, and so on have yet to be opened up. For the long-term market, however, such as PV power generation grid connection systems, battery-powered automobile charging systems, seawater desalination systems, and so on, development and demonstrations have still not been included on the agenda. In summary, China's research, development, production, applications, and other areas concerning PV power generation lag substantially behind the developed countries and many problems also exist. PV power generation involves systems engineering and touches upon a variety of industrial realms. Silicon, the raw material for solar cells, falls under the metallurgical industry. Sealing materials such as low iron and steel chemical glass, EVA, silver, aluminum slurry, and so on fall under the chemical industry. The matching storage batteries fall under the battery industry. The retransformers used in PV power stations and PV water pumps fall under the electric power and electronics industry. Power station control systems, special purpose instruments and equipment, and design software fall under the electronics and computer industries. High efficiency energy-saving loads, such as lamps, refrigerators, and televisions, fall under civilian appliances. Thus, truly high-quality inexpensive PV products are determined by overall national industrial foundations and levels. To develop China's PV power generation industry, we must emphasize the following points: 1. The emergence of China's PV power generation industry is not the result of market demand but was instead the result of imports. At present, all producing plants are in difficult straits and hope that the state will be able to provide substantial inputs to spur technical progress in this industry and encourage scientific research departments to vow to solve the production problems that now exist in plants such as a shift to domestic production of raw materials and auxiliary materials, raising finished production rates, improving the conversion efficiency of solar cells, and so on to ultimately attain the goals of reducing costs and improving quality to spur the course of industrialization of the PV power generation industry. 2. We must pay attention to the establishment of development and experimental base areas for PV power generation systems that combine technology development and production development, and that take responsibility for engineering and personnel training, engineering experiments, and production quality inspection and control to guarantee the quality of PV products and consolidate the existing market. 3. Make major efforts to open up markets and establish demonstration projects in potential applications realms in the market such as PV water pumps, seawater desalination stations, power grid terminus grid connection systems, and so on. Use the demonstrations to derive technological breakthroughs and design and operating experience and lay a foundation for future scale applications of PV power generation.
