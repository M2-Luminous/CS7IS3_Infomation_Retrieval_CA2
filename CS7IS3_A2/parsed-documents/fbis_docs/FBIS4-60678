FBIS4-60678 "drnes103_l_94017" FBIS-NES-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 ISRAEL Netanyahu, Begin, Eytan React Netanyahu, Begin, Eytan React TA2705063894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0500 GMT 27 May 94 TA2705063894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu has harshly reacted to Ari'el Sharon's announcement that he intends to run for the premiership in the next elections and called on him to leave the Likud. Interviewed by Qol Yisra'el, Netanyahu said that Sharon sows conflict and dispute. He conspired against Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and is now trying to conspire against me. The time has come for this intriguer to leave the Likud. All Sharon does is undermine, sabotage, and split, Netanyahu said. With him, this is a chronic disease. He is a man who does not recognize any democratic norms and sets out to destroy every framework, the Likud chairman asserted. Sharon told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he has been holding contacts to set up a united front of the right-wing camp which would hold primaries before the next elections and decide on its candidate. Knesset Member Binyamin Begin told Qol Yisra'el that Sharon's chances of winning are similar to his chances of becoming the world's tennis champion. This is a wrong move which will lead to a split in the national camp, Begin said. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said he would run against Sharon. In his opinion, it could be an advantage if a few candidates of the national camp ran in the first round of elections.
