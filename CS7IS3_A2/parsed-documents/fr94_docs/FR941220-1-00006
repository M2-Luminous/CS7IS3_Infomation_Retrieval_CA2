FR941220-1-00006 FR941220-1-00002 Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Fokker: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;215&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Note 1: This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent corrosion of certain mounting frames of the auxiliary power unit (APU), which could render the APU inoperative and may lead to a potential fire hazard, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect the presence of a drain hole in frame member M of the mounting frames, having part number (P/N) D67050&hyph;407, of the auxiliary power unit (APU), in accordance with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;49&hyph;022, dated August 27, 1992. (1) If no drain hole(s) is present, no further action is required by this AD. (2) If any drain hole is present, prior to further flight, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion on the mounting frame of the APU, in accordance with the service bulletin. (i) If no corrosion is detected, within 90 days after accomplishing the visual inspection, replace the mounting frame with a new mounting frame in accordance with the service bulletin. (ii) If any corrosion is detected, within 30 days after accomplishing the visual inspection, replace the mounting frame with a new mounting frame in accordance with the service bulletin. (b) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install on any airplane a mounting frame, having P/N D67050&hyph;407, that has a drain hole in frame member M. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on December 14, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
