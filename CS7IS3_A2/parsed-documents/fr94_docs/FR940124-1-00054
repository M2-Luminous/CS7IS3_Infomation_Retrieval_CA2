FR940124-1-00054 FR940124-1-00008 The Secretary acknowledges that the development of standards for this area involves very complex issues. For the purpose of stimulating discussion in this area, the Secretary offers the following possible approaches to the development of standards. Under one approach, the standard might require that annualized tuition and fees for a program not exceed a percentage of the annualized minimum wage. Under another approach, the standard might require that annualized tuition and fees for a program not exceed a percentage of the program's graduates' average earnings for their first year of employment. Under still another approach, annualized tuition and fees for a program could not exceed a percentage of the average annualized wages, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in occupations for which the program prepares students. In suggesting possible approaches to the establishment of standards for this area, the Secretary reminds commenters of the difficulty in obtaining employment information, including salaries and wages, from graduates of an institution for periods beyond the first year after graduation. The Secretary is considering establishing in other regulations requirements governing program length and tuition and fees for programs that are eligible to participate in the SFA programs. Accordingly, if those regulatory requirements are established, the Secretary would consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows that an institution's program is too long or too short under that requirement, or if it knows that an institution's tuition and fee charges violate that other requirement. The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of adding this notification requirement or any alternative method of obtaining this information. Finally, the Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for program length and tuition and fees applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA. Section 602.26(b)(8) Measures of program length in clock hours or credit hours. Section 496(a)(5)(H) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address measures of program length in clock or credit hours. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine if an institution take into proper account, as appropriate, factors such as program objectives and content, the types and locations of instructional delivery, and the knowledge and skills necessary for students to reach competence in the field being taught when determining the length of its programs in clock or credit hours. General agreement was reached by negotiators with regard to the substance of this standard. However, the Secretary has reconsidered this matter and now proposes an additional factor: any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does not believe the addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when developing their standards goes beyond the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies but simply to take them into account. The Secretary invites comments on this proposed addition. To the extent that the Secretary regulates this area in other regulations governing the SFA programs, these regulations may need to be modified. Moreover, as indicated with regard to ยง602.26(b)(7), if those other regulations are established, the Secretary may consider requiring an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary if it knows that an institution's measure of the number of credits hours in its programs does not satisfy that other regulatory requirement. The Secretary invites comments about the feasibility of adding this notification requirement or on alternative methods of obtaining this information. The Secretary notes that the requirement to establish a standard for measures of program length in clock or credit hours applies only to those accrediting agencies whose accreditation enables the institutions they accredit to participate in programs authorized under the HEA. Section 602.26(b)(9) Success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission. Section 496(a)(5)(I) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address success with respect to student achievement in relation to mission, including, as appropriate, consideration of course completion rates, pass rates on State licensing examinations, and job placement rates. It is the Secretary's view that standards for student achievement are the most important of all accreditation standards because the true success of an institution or program is measured by the success of its students. For institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational programs, the Secretary proposes to require agencies to establish minimum quantitative standards for completion rates, job placement rates, and pass rates on State licensing examinations for those programs, since gainful employment is the purpose of those programs. The Secretary proposes this additional requirement for institutions offering prebaccalaureate vocational education programs because, as noted in the discussion under ยง602.26(b)(7), these institutions have often engaged in abusive practices. The Secretary notes that the concept of minimum quantitative standards, even when restricted to prebaccalaureate vocational education, was not supported by non-Federal negotiators.
