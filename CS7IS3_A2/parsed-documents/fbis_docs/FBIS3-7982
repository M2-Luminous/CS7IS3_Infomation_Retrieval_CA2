This letter directly affects our relations with the PRM, which has thus announced the electorate that it "suspends all negotiations begun with the PDSR regarding a participation in the government." In these circumstances, it is necessary to explain our party's position on the issues raised by that letter, which motivated the respective decision of the PRM leadership. With Electoral Demagoguery, Forward! 1. The letter of the nine members of the PRM leadership depicts the current Romanian society in a way that we cannot agree with. Their description of the country's situation, in apocalyptic terms, is not based on a serious analysis of the circumstances. We would have expected the leadership of a parliamentary party to overcome the stage of electoral demagoguery and make a profound analysis of the processes and trends in Romanian society. The situation is indeed difficult, but a lucid examination should primarily emphasize the causes of this situation. After the 1989 revolution, Romania has lost half of its foreign markets and the mechanisms of the centralized economy were eliminated without us having developed the specific mechanisms of the market economy to replace them. All this has caused Romanian industry to operate at half of its capacity. To all this, one should add the Gulf crisis, which caused Romania losses amounting to almost $3 billion, and the embargo imposed against Yugoslavia, which cost us another $7 billion in direct and indirect losses. Romania has been and is still being faced with a number of very serious crises. Their cumulative effect is quite hard to endure and it has generated social discrepancies, various cases of corruption, and a state of discontent among the people, who must cope with many hardships. However, one cannot solve these problems through laments and demagogic and populist formulas. You need an authentic will if you want to accomplish that. The real problems of the economy must be solved by taking into consideration the context of the real world, the world in which we live and from which we cannot isolate ourselves, by replacing it with an utopian world or by turning back to the past. From "Proven Criminals" to the "Future Convicts" 2. The entire language used in the letter is vulgar and unworthy of the leadership of a parliamentary party. It abounds in totally unfounded accusations and personal attacks, which again prove that the nine signatories of the letter consider themselves to be above the law. They want to supplant our legal bodies -- which are the only ones in a position to decide who are "proven criminals" and "future convicts" -- on the basis of arguments contained in some anonymous letters sent to the editorial staff of the ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA magazines by "several earnest Romanian women with the fear of God in their souls," by "a group of generals," or others. The rule-of-law state relies on arguments, proofs, and the observance of rights and laws, primarily the observance of the basic principles of the presumption of innocence until proven otherwise. The rule-of-law state does not rely on letters received by the editorial staff, on their number, on the "people's verdict," or on the conviction of some party leaders that they represent the law. We cannot accept the "judicial messianism" that the nine members of the PRM leadership arrogate to themselves. They may display its exclusively before their supporters, at their party meetings; however, in their capacity as parliamentarians, they must subordinate themselves to the law, as far as their actions and manners are concerned. We believe that, before pronouncing on the major problems of the country, the nine members of the PRM leadership should begin by apologizing to those whom they have slanderously attacked in their letter, primarily the country's president. Slightly More Than 3 Percent 3. In connection with all this, we would like to state our position vis-a-vis the claim of the PRM leadership that it speaks on behalf of the people or of "the Romanians" and that it "echoes the people's discontent." We believe that these habits, which were acquired during the reign of the sole party, cannot be imposed on us as a norm of behavior and a criterion of political superiority; they might belong to a party that, although it claims to represent "the Romanians," have barely exceeded the 3 percent threshold required for being represented in Parliament. In a pluralistic democracy, the PRM leadership only has the right to talk on behalf of the "25,000 card-carrying members." Whose capacity to mobilize correctly reflects the people's interests is periodically checked by elections. 4. As a matter of fact, the entire letter signed by the nine members of the PRM Steering Committee proves that it is motivated by electoral campaign considerations, rather than the desire -- if any at all -- to find solutions and answers to the real problems facing Romanian society today. The reference to early elections that can be found at the end of the letter proves that the PRM leadership is not concerned with the consequences of political acts and of their own responsibility. The appeal, which is made in a purely electoral style, to "all Romanians who love their country" and whom the National Bloc is "awaiting with open arms," has nothing to do with tackling and solving the country's problems. Patriotism as a Party Monopoly 5. We consider that patriotism cannot be the monopoly of a political party, the PRM's appanage. Being a patriot does not mean isolating Romania from the modern world, but rather protecting its interests and sovereignty within the framework of the modern world. You do not accomplish this by going back to the communist system and rekindling Ceausescu's image, but by realizing that our country's evolution depends on European developments, which the PRM seems to ignore. Our political intelligence and the principles and values we believe in should not lead us to making enemies left and right -- both inside the country and abroad -- through demagogic, populist, xenophobic, or antisemitic speeches. These manifestations, which are unanimously condemned, project an unfavorable image for Romania abroad and cause us great difficulties in connecting our country to the modern world. 6. It is true that we have reached a pretty tense situation in the country's political life. A good part of these political tensions, which affect the government's action capability, were artificially created, on the one hand by the ambitions of certain politicians who want to change the composition of the government at all costs and, on the other hand, by an erroneous understanding of the role of the opposition in a pluralist democratic system. All these problems can be resolved through negotiations among the political parties. Therefore, the PDSR welcomed the Romanian president's initiative on the conclusion of a political pact and pledged to achieve it. From the letter of the PRM Steering Committee, we note that the differences between our parties on the ways and means to overcome these tensions are profound and quite susceptible to lead to a real political crisis, whose consequences -- imputable to the PRM leadership alone -- the PDSR is ready to face. Inciting to Violence 7. Resorting to totally groundless propagandistic cliches ("imported reform") and accusing the government of things that it has not done, and which actually contradict our party's principled positions ("shock therapy"), the PRM is projecting a true scenario of incitation to violence and justification of violence. The exclusively negative description of the country's situation should serve the goal of presenting the PRM leadership members as "justice seekers," the only one capable of saving the people from being "robbed" by the "alliance" between the power and the opposition. At the same time, this true denigration of the country seems to be a justification of violence. The message of the PRM leadership's letter is that, if there is misery, hunger, epidemics, and crime, the only solution to all this is violence -- the violence of the workers from the Grivita Workshops and a "possible outbreak of popular despair," which, in the view of the PRM leadership, "would be more devastating than the December 1989 revolution." The entire text of the PRM leadership's letter contains no concrete solution. The proposed political philosophy seems to be the threat that "if we come to power, within 24 hours we will do away with the robbery, chaos, and the profanation of the Romanians in their own home." A Simplistic Way of Thinking Beyond the recollection of other times and political forces, when some "24 hour" solutions were tried out, this passage clearly proves a simplistic way of thinking, for which the entire process of institutional restructuring is nothing but "chaos," while the economic reform and the privatization process are nothing but "robbery." We have all due respect for an economist from Diaspora, such as Professor Anghel Rugina. However, we are not convinced -- as the nine members of the PRM leadership seem to be -- that "this idealist," who, out of objective reasons, is not familiar with the specific problems of the Romanian economy, would have a plan that can "avoid all the errors committed in the other Eastern countries." We are open to his ideas, but we consider it an unacceptable insult to accuse our government, the Romanian economists engaged in working out and implementing the reform, and those who are planning the integration of the Romanian economy into the European and world economy of being "doubtful experts only intent on lining their own pockets." 8. In these circumstances, the PDSR can only take note of the decision to suspend the talks that the PRM leadership has adopted. The responsibility for this act and its implications fully devolves on the nine members of the PRM Steering Committee. As a matter of fact, given the "platform" emphasized in that letter of the PRM leadership, it is hardly likely that we can still find some elements of dialogue. For us, it will be very difficult in the future to differentiate between the pamphlet writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor and the party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor, head of the PRM. At the same time, we believe that the PRM members will show understanding for our position. As far as our relationship with the PRM deputies and senators is concerned, we have often had constructive, joint or closely similar positions on certain draft bills. However, we assure them and the PRM rank-and-file members that we are still open to a dialogue with them, provided that party leaders show responsibility, that they are prepared to adopt reasonable positions, and that they are truly concerned with the real problems the country is facing in this period of transition. This statement was adopted at the enlarged meeting of the Central Executive Bureau, with the participation of the PDSR parliamentary groups, on 22 February 1994.
