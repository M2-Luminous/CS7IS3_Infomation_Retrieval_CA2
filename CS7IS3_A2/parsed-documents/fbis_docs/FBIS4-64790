FBIS4-64790 "drweu089_j_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY Motion Blamed on Leftists Motion Blamed on Leftists BR0605152294 Rome SECOLO D'ITALIA in Italian 6 May 94 pp 1-2 BR0605152294 Rome SECOLO D'ITALIA Italian BFN [Text] An (as yet) unknown hand has touched up the Italian edition of the European Parliament motion, proposed by the Socialists, on the next Italian government's "loyalty to the values of the European Community." The original text contained no reference to fascism and Nazism, whereas this reference is clear and explicit in the version drafted in our language. How come? It is a mystery. The least one can say is that there is something suspicious about it. The document itself, even without the most offensive phrase, clearly interferes in the life of a sovereign state, and the president of the Republic and the speakers of both houses of parliament were therefore right to protest strongly. It must also be said that while the resolution voices no explicit attack on the National Alliance [AN], we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the "warning" is unacceptable in view of the fact that neither the AN nor the other members of the future government alliance have ever shown hostility to the values underlying the European Union. It follows that both this little mystery and the overall smoke screen of polemics that is being fanned day after day in Europe around events in Italy have but a single source: The Left in our country is conspiring with the Left in the whole continent to do all it can to demonize a government willed by the people (as even [former Prime Minister] Ciriaco De Mita has emphasized). However, as Gianfranco Fini has said, the "affair" can only die down once the new executive has assumed its full powers and can set to work in the country's interests. Leaving aside the progressive and pseudocommunist papers and circles of the old continent, Europe will then realize that no threats to free institutions can come from National Alliance ministers, who will not fail to win acclaim for the respect in which they will hold the values of democracy, tolerance, peace, and solidarity. So let us note with deep concern that the Left is working at all levels not to exert its legitimate, normal opposition, but to poison the political and social atmosphere in Italy and elsewhere. The outcome of the work of the professional intriguers is always unpredictable. We hope that the country will boycott them. For the general good.
