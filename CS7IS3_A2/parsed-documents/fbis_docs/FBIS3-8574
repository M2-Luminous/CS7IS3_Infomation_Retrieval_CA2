The regional Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) is seeking to join the group but the coalition members, including the Christian National Union (ZCHN), the Confederation For an Independent Poland (KPN), the Peasant Agreement (PL), the Movement For the Republic of Poland (RDR), the Peasant Christian Party (SLCH) and the Centre Alliance (PC), have put off the decision till next week. The coalition's hesitance is caused by its "reservation towards one of the Rzeszow leaders of this political association." The agreement signatories are discussing the name of the new bloc and its election manifesto.
