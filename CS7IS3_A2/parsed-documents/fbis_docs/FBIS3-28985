Laos said it is a poor landlocked country which has good brotherly relations with Thailand. The tariff reduction would help promote Laos' exports through Thailand. Suphachai said the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy considered that Thailand should comply with Laos' request. Thailand has already granted special tariff reductions for several categories of goods from Laos. The committee had put the Foreign Trade Department of the Commerce Ministry in charge of negotiations with Laos. Thailand also wants Laos to reduce transit fees on trucks from Thailand -- now collected at the rate of 2,000 U.S. dollars, or about 50,000 baht, per trip. The deputy prime minister reported that at yesterday's meeting the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy endorsed the U.S. Government's proposal to set up a joint advisory committee on economic affairs, with full power in decision making regarding negotiations on trade and economic cooperation. Asked about the U.S. Government's decision on Thailand's status as a country on its Priority Watch List, or PWL, facing retaliation under the U.S. trade law, the deputy prime minister said it was very likely that the United States would remove Thailand from the list, but it is still not known when. This is because of Thailand's good record in cracking down on violations of U.S. copyrights, including the pirating of copyrighted video tapes and discs.
