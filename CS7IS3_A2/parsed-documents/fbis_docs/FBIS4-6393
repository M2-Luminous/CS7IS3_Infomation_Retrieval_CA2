The protest occurred around 1:20 PM, when Perry entered a second-floor conference room in the main building for talks with his Korean counterpart, Yi Pyong-tae, after reviewing an honor guard in the ministry compound. Perry arrived here Tuesday to discuss problems related to beefing up Seoul's defense against possible North Korean attack with South Korean Government leaders. The students, shouting anti-American slogans, demonstrated in front of the ministry's main building for about 30 minutes before they were forcibly dispersed by riot police. It was the first time that student protesters have entered the Defense Ministry compound. Military police guarding were unable to stop the students when they moved into the compound through the vehicle gate, witnesses said.
