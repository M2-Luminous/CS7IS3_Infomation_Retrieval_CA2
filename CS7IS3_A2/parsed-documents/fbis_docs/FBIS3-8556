"Talks with Germans were conducted in a good atmosphere," said Polish Deputy Interior Minister Henryk Jasik before his return to Poland from Germany on Wednesday morning. Jasik said that contacts between the leadership of the Polish and German Interior Ministries developed well while Polish Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski and his German counterpart had a good mutual understanding. According to the asylum agreement of May 1993, Poland promised to earmark half of German aid (out of the global sum of 120 million DM) for the purchase of equipment in Germany. German firms, however, offered equipment which is on the average twice as expensive as that offered by other suppliers. The delegation pointed to the fact during the present talks. The German Interior Ministry is entitled to buy equipment from German producers at reduced prices and the Polish delegation asked Germans to buy the equipment for Poland on the same principles. It cannot be ruled out that the two documents, that is the technical protocol on readmission of people arriving in Germany via Poland and the agreement on cooperation of Police and customs services of Poland and Germany will be ready for signing in spring 1994. The second round of talks on the matter is scheduled to be held in Warsaw in a few weeks time.
