Hsu Hui-you, SEF deputy secretary and Taiwan's major negotiator, and his party left for Beijing today. The Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] under the Executive Yuan yesterday formally authorized SEF negotiators to hold negotiations with the ARATS on repatriation of hijackers, fishery disputes, and repatriation of stowaways. After agreements on the abovementioned three issues have been reached, the two sides may exchange views or hold practical talks on other topics prescribed in the agreement reached in the Ku-Wang talks, on protection of Taiwan investors in the Mainland, and on other relevant economic and science and technology issues. The following is a report by He Chien-min: [Begin recording] Beginning tomorrow, the SEF and the ARATS will hold the fourth round of routine negotiations in Beijing. MAC Chairman Huang Kun-hui held a news conference and issued a carefully-worded oral statement today, saying that there is still a long way to go to sign an agreement based on the oral consensus achieved in the Chiao-Tang talks. It is clear from the way he talked that he is not optimistic about these negotiations. [Huang Kun-hui] You know we have already put the oral agreement down in black and white at previous formal talks, however, they called it off at the last minute. That is what happened. We did not cancel it. The point is that we need to communicate with each other and understand each other's views by means of talking. After coming back, we continued to work on the agreement and ask departments concerned to do their best to help us. Because our government is a democratic one whose work is shared and coordinated by various government departments, many departments are involved in drawing up this agreement. This shows our sincerity in reaching an agreement with the ARATS. [He Chien-min] Chairman Huang emphasized that the first thing we should take into consideration while turning oral consensuses into a written agreement is the feasibility of its implementation. It is reported that the MAC has made a thorough evaluation of the consensus on the abovementioned three issues. The MAC and relevant ministries and commissions have expressed some opinions that articles concerning fishery disputes are not applicable to disputes involving official boats, and articles concerning the repatriation of hijackers are not applicable to criminal offenders. These opinions will have an unpredictable influence on this round of negotiations. This has been a report by China Broadcasting Network Corporation reporter He Chien-min from the Mainland Affairs Council. [end recording]
