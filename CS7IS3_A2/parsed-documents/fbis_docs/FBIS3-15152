This was stated by representatives of the Social Democratic parties of Belarus, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Lithuania, Sweden, and Estonia who participated in an international conference held in Minsk on basic questions of social policy and economic management in Belarus and neighboring countries. A statement cites facts of judicial and administrative persecution of the organizers of a political strike demanding early parliamentary elections, the resignation of the present government, and the formation of a transitional government. After 15 February, when rallies and demonstrations were held in Minsk and other cities, many of their participants were arrested, fined, and summoned to appear in court. The authorities regarded the actions of the strike committees and of the Belarusian free trade union as a call for a violent change in the state system. A protest, which is fully justified under conditions of an economic and political crisis, is described as an attempt to overthrow the power structures. All this, the statement reads, as well as the restrictions on free speech and the rigid control over the mass media, constitutes an offensive against human rights.
