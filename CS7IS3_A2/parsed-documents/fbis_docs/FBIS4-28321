"We discussed objective criteria...mainly on qualitative criteria," the Finance Ministry official told reporters after two- day working-level talks on government procurement of medical equipment. But he said the two sides avoided discussing quantitative yardsticks which led to bickering over "numerical targets" and ruptured the bilateral "framework" talks in February. "We did not touch on talks that could cause turmoil when negotiations are to continue," he said, adding that the two sides agreed not to disclose details. U.S. officials were not available for comment. The two sides agreed to continue working-level talks in mid-June, but further adjustments are needed to decide on the date and place, either Tokyo or Washington, the Japanese official said. Otherwise, "the talks got off to a smooth restart" in an "extremely good atmosphere," with most of the two days taken up by the Japanese side explaining and the U.S. side questioning promises made by Japan in its March market-opening package on government procurement, he said. In the package, Japan vowed to widen the scope of products open to foreign firms, make specifications fairer and simpler, improve information available on government tenders, beef up the review of bidding complaints and institute comprehensive bid evaluations. Japan also promised to review the progress of foreign goods procurement under these measures, apparently for use as a qualitative benchmark. Japan and the U.S. agreed two weeks ago to restart the framework talks after reaching common ground on the definition of objective criteria that it would be both quantitative and qualitative yardsticks instead of numerical targets for each of the negotiation sectors. Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment is one of the three priority areas along with automobile and auto parts, and insurance business. Medical equipment is the last on which working-level talks have restarted. Telecom [telecommunications] talks were held separately last Friday and Saturday. After a first round of resumed talks, all the three sectors made some progress without touching on the crucial issues, and the two sides agreed to continue talking.
