FBIS4-52830 "dreas094__a94003" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Nissan Lowers `Maxima' Export Price to U.S. Nissan Lowers `Maxima' Export Price to U.S. OW1405140494 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1405140494 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Nissan Motor Company will lower the export price for "Maxima," the passenger car to be sold in the United States beginning on 13 May, by about 6 percent for its lowest-priced model. The reduction has been done by changing components. As a result of the sharp appreciation of the yen in the past one to two years, Japanese companies have been forced to lower their selling local prices, and have been losing grounds to the U.S.-made cars. The new pricing strategy of Nissan this time means it is giving priority to winning "price competitiveness" even in the U.S. market, and this is likely to impact on other Japanese manufacturers too. The new model of Maxima will be equipped with a remodeled 3,000-cc engine. While safety features of the car have been improved by putting airbags on both driver's and front passenger's seats as standard equipment, remote-controlled doorlocks and aluminum wheels have become optional, becoming available at real cost prices if wanted by buyers. Additional cost savings have been done by making some parts interchangeable and adopting new technologies. The price for the lowest-priced automatic base-model car is $20,999, which is about $1,400 (6.4 percent) less than the current model. A manually driven base model, priced under $20,000, has become available as well. Nissan's action this time is aimed at impressing the would-be buyers with the low price of the car by simplifying some of the components. But it can be interpreted also as a change in the Japanese car manufacturer's policy -- going back from making larger and deluxe cars to making low-priced cars.
