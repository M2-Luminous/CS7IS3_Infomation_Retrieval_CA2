ACTION: Issuance of an extension to a scientific research permit (P45D). On October 4, 1988 Permit 648 (P45D) was issued to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to take listed shortnose sturgeon ( Acipenser brevirostrum ). Notice is hereby given that on January 19, 1994, NMFS issued an extension to Permit 648, authorizing research activities to be conducted through July 1, 1994, as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;222).

This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217&hyph;227 of title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
