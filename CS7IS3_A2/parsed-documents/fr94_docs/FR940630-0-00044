FR940630-0-00044 FR940630-0-00013 There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(a) require the operator to adopt measures consistent with known technology which prevent subsidence, maximize mine stability, and maintain the value of surface lands. The Director finds that the proposed regulation at COMAR 08.20.13.11 is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.121(a). (f) At COMAR 08.20.13.12, Maryland is proposing to establish submission and content requirements for projection maps. There is no direct Federal counterpart for this regulation. However, the Director finds that the regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. 4. COMAR 08.20.14.13_Deep Mine Bonding Requirements At COMAR 08.20.14.13(A), Maryland is proposing to delete a reference pertaining to the submission of a general and a revegetation bond. In the same section, a reference to COMAR 08.13.02.07 (which is being repealed) is also being deleted. At subsection (C), Maryland is proposing to delete a provision that limits the period of liability for those portions of a deep mine that continuously disturb the surface for a period exceeding five years to the term of the deep mine permit, which is a five year maximum period. Also proposed for deletion at subsection (E), are provisions pertaining to bond liability for mine drainage. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.17 pertaining to bonding requirements for underground coal mines contain no comparable provisions. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed deletions at COMAR 08.20.14.13(A), (C), and (E) do not render the Maryland State program less effective than the Federal regulations. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the heads of other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Maryland program. The Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, commented on provisions of COMAR 08.13.02.10 and 08.13.02.12 and the applicable Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) requirements. The Director notes that the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 are being repealed as discussed in Finding 1. Those provisions incorporated into COMAR 08.20.02 and 08.20.13 are found to be no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director acknowledges MSHA's comments but according to 516(a) and 702 of SMCRA, the cited Maryland regulation cannot be construed as superseding, amending or repealing any MSHA regulation. The Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, recommended that in COMAR 08.13.02.13A and 08.20.13.10D, water impoundments be included with public bridges as areas on which mining should be prohibited if subsidence is likely to occur. The Director notes that the provisions of COMAR 08.13.02 are being repealed as discussed in Finding 1. Further, in COMAR 08.20.13.10A, Maryland generally prohibits underground mining beneath impoundments having a storage volume of 20 acre-feet or more. The Department of Interior, Bureau of Mines, concurred without comment.
