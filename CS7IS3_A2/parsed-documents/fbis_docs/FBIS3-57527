Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev, his deputy Rifat Chubarov, and other Assembly members said in their addresses that in the series of acts of violence that is gaining momentum in Crimea, the assassination of Iskandar Mamedov is not the first act directed against the Crimean Tatars. All these events, says the Assembly statement made in connection with the escalation of violence in Crimea, attest to the efforts by certain political forces to destabilize the situation by inveigling Crimean Tatars into a wide-scale conflict. The Assembly of the Crimean Tatar people, which rejects violence in solving any questions, believes: "In the situation that has taken shape, measures should be immediately taken to resolutely cut short actions that threaten peace and the fragile calm in Crimea." It is necessary, in the Assembly's opinion, to stop crime in Crimea, which has appreciably grown owing to the worsened political situation in the course of the elections for Crimea's president and the preparations for the elections for a new Supreme Soviet. The Assembly finds it necessary to take measures to preserve peace and accord on the peninsula. The statement says that a special investigation group should be created on a first-priority basis in Ukraine's prosecutor's office to carry out a thorough and objective investigation into all acts of violence and terror in Crimea. The Assembly demands that the Supreme Soviets of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea should "examine and bring into line the provisions of the Republic of Crimea's constitution with the existing legislation of Ukraine and with the requirements of the trilateral agreement between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine on nuclear disarmament and mutual security guarantees."
