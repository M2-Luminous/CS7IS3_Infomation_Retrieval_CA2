"Many difficulties will have to be overcome in order to implement the Cairo agreement between the Palestinians and Israel. We also have to move forward in the matter of Israeli-Syrian relations." He went on to say that Cairo was "playing a key role in the Middle East process and in resolving other international problems." We appreciate the contribution to the Bosnian settlement made by such member states of the Islamic Conference Organization as Egypt, which has adopted a balanced and even-handed approach on this and other issues. As to bilateral relations, Moscow is "getting ready for President Mubarak's visit, which will be a very important event." The Egyptian leader is held "in the highest esteem in Russia." Boris Yeltsin and Husni Mubarak keep in contact and exchange messages. "We are moving consistently towards a Russo-Egyptian summit," stressed Andrey Kozyrev.

According to him, Cairo is ready to continue helping to set up various meetings that can advance peace. The Egyptian minister stressed the "Bosnian issue occupies an important place on our agenda."
