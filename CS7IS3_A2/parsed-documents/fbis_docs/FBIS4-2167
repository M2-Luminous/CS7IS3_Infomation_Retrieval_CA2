Wu Yi will lead a Chinese Government economic and trade delegation to visit the United States 11-20 April. On the eve of her U.S. trip, she told XINHUA that China's sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth and its grandiose economic development plan will create even more favorable trade and investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises. The Upcoming Session of the Joint Committee on Commerce and Trade [JCCT] Is Very Important As for the purpose of her U.S. trip, Wu Yi said that the most important thing during her mission is to co-chair, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the Eighth Sino-U.S. JCCT Session scheduled for 13-14 April in Washington. According to her, the JCCT session, as an annual meeting between the Chinese and U.S. Governments, is a most important occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations. She called the session another major event following the Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the talks between finance and foreign ministers of the two countries. She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and cooperation and legal matters in such areas as information, energy, transportation, the chemical industry, and environmental cooperation. During its visit to the United States, the Chinese delegation will hold trade and investment negotiation meetings in Los Angeles and New York on 11 and 19 April, respectively. To Discuss 800 Investment Projects and Purchase Goods Worth Hundreds of Millions of U.S. Dollars Wu Yi said: The trade and investment negotiation meetings will be China's first large-scale trade and investment promotion activity to be held in the United States in the past 15 years. The activity is sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation with assistance from the U.S. law firm Graham and James and the U.S. Asian Association. The Chinese trade negotiation group will be made up of senior officials, experts, and business executives from eight ministries and commissions of the State Council, three national corporations, and 26 provinces and municipalities. Meanwhile, the ministry's four affiliated corporations, which will be in the United States to negotiate exports and imports, plan to buy U.S. goods worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. She said: To further promote investment and trade cooperation between the two countries, the trade negotiation group will mainly brief U.S. businessmen about China's reform, opening up, and economic development, and will help prospective U.S. investors find opportunities in China. She revealed that China will offer about 800 key investment projects at the negotiation meetings, including the construction of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways, airports, and wharfs; and projects in industrial raw and semi- finished materials for the machine-building and electrical, electronics, petrochemical, and metallurgical industries; as well as in agriculture, livestock breeding, and forestry. It Is Imperative To Remove Obstacles in Developing Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations After briefly reviewing the development of economic and trade relations between China and the United States, Wu Yi said bilateral trade and U.S. investment in China have grown continuously in recent years despite some problems that have cropped up. Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, trade between the two countries has developed rapidly. According to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of China, bilateral trade jumped from $2.45 billion in 1979 to $27.65 billion in 1993, an increase of more than 11.3 times. Meanwhile, U.S. businessmen's investment in China has been increasing each year. As of now, the number of U.S.-funded projects in China exceeds 8,000, involving an agreed upon total investment of $11 billion, topping the list of all foreign investment. More than 50 of the U.S. major firms have opened business bases in China. Wu Yi held that a major reason for the rapid development of bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation is the fact that the two economies are highly supplementary to each other. However, she stressed that if the bilateral trade and cooperation are to develop further, the U.S. side should take further steps to remove man-made obstacles. The United States should relax controls on U.S. technology exports to China, resume financing for feasibility studies for projects undertaken by the U.S. Trade Development Agency, resume risk guarantees by the private U.S. Investment Company for U.S. Investment in China, and resume preferential loans by the American Import and Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China, so as to further tap the the potential of China's imports from the United States and U.S. investment in China. Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] Status and China's Rejoining the GATT Touching on the issue of MFN status, Wu Yi said: This is a purely trade issue and it should not be entangled with issues with which it has nothing to do. Proper handling of MFN status is an important condition for the further development of bilateral trade and economic coopeation. China hopes to remove the shadow of MFN status and achieve greater development in bilateral economic and trade relations. Wu Yi said: China has always opposed the practice of linking MFN status to the human rights issues, as views on human rights and explanations on the meaning of human rights differ from country to country. China and the United States have differences of view on the human rights issue, and they may discuss them through other channels on the basis of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and seeking common ground while preserving differences. The two sides should in no way let this nontrade factor stand in the way of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation. On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party status in GATT, Wu Yi said that major progress was made at the 16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China last month. Most GATT members voiced support for China's "reentry into the GATT" orally and in action. Minister Wu Yi said: During bilateral talks, the United States has said it will firmly support China's reentry into GATT. She hoped that the U.S. side would effectively fulfill its promise, take a positive attitude in handling the matter of China's reentry into the GATT, promote the course of negotiation for China's "reentry into the GATT," and will truly keep its promise and be as good as its word.
