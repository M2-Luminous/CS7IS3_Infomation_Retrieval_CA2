Dementyeva and Candidate of Economic Sciences I. Pikan, experts of the TOR marketing center of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN: "Without Embellishments and Black Paint"] [Text] If one looks at the present situation in Russia's economy without embellishments (which is practiced by the governmental and presidential team) and without blackening (as do their opponents), the following picture appears. Basic Results of the First Quarter The following (based on offical data) basic factors characterize the situation in Russia's economy in the first quarter of 1993 in the opinion of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN's experts. First of all, a deepening of the production crisis which has manifested itself in a drop in the output of the majority of the types of industrial purpose products and consumer goods. Even though a decrease in production at the beginning of the year was predicted by practically all experts, no one had guessed its scale right--instead of the expected 10-12 percent reduction in the industry-wide level of production, the real drop had come to 25 percent of the level of the first quarter of 1993. At the same time, for the quarter as a whole the level of inflation had come to a value that is a record-breaking low for the last two years--146 percent. Moreover, it should be recalled that the inflation rates in the first two-three weeks of 1994 were very high (5-7 percent a week), but have steadily declined subsequently. The non-payments crisis has drastically intensified. The volume of overdue debt in industry has risen and as a consequence problems in the sale of finished products have increased substantially and the number of work stoppages and the complete shutdown of enterprises has grown. The financial instability of enterprises has increased and the amount of profit obtained has fallen. A drastic growth in the number of unprofitable enterprises and consequently a growth in the amount of the losses has taken place. To a decisive degree the activity of the government was determined by the struggle with inflation, the rates of which it has tried to reduce by all means possible. Gross Domestic Product In the first quarter the gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped by 4.9 percent in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993, and by 15 percent in comparison with the analogous period of last year. The drastic decrease in the production of GDP in January (by 29.3 percent in comparison with December) was accompanied by subsequent monthly growth--18.5 and 6.7 percent. However, the situation which developed during the quarter as a whole continued the trend of a steady decline in the GDP. A tendency for change in the structure of the GDP has also been noted: the share of the production of goods has shrunk (from 49 percent to 43 percent), the share of services has risen (from 38.5 percent to 48.5 percent), and the share of net taxes on products and imports has fallen (from 12.5 percent to 8.2 percent). The reduction in the volumes of GDP is connected, first of all, with the continued shrinkage of the volumes of industrial production. However, the rates of the fall of the GDP are significantly lower than the rates of the fall of the volumes of industrial production. This is due to the increase of the share of services in the GDP. Thus, during the first quarter the volume of industrial production had come to no more than 75 percent of the level of the fourth quarter of 1993. At the same time the services of trade and the housing economy have remained approximately at last year's level. The volume of financial services increases while the decrease in other services did not exceed 20 percent. Thus, somewhat unexpectedly one has succeeded in achieving a more market structure of GDP formation, as in the western countries, where the share of services comes to no more than 50 percent of GDP. In future, in our view, the GDP structure which has developed will not undergo serious changes--the anticipated limited increase in the volumes of production will be accompanied by an equal increase in the volume of services. Material Production Crisis phenomena have increased in the sphere of material production during the first three months. The trend of a fall in production observed throughout last year (the average-quarterly rates of the fall in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1992, according to our calculations, had amounted to 12-13 percent) has not only survived but has even grown noticeably stronger. During the quarter as a whole the drop had come to 26.6 percent in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993, whereas production had fallen by 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993 in comparison with the third quarter. A further "weighting" of the sectorial structure took place in the first quarter. The fall in production had amounted to about 27-28 percent in the processing sectors and 10-11 percent in the extractive sectors. Production is more and more acquiring a "raw material character." It follows from an analysis of production in the branches of industry (see table) that the most stable situation was observed in the fuel and power complex (the rates of fall in comparison with the first quarter of last year were 7-9 percent). The drop in ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy (fall rates of 15-17 percent) as well as in the food industry (18-20 percent) was markedly lower than the industry-wide drop.

A very difficult situation in the first quarter was noted in machine-building where the level of production had come to 55 percent of the corresponding period of 1993, in the chemical and petrochemical industry (level of production--67-68 percent of the level of the first quarter of 1993) as well as in the timber, wood processing and pulp and paper industry. The production of shoes, hosiery products, all types of fabrics, and sewn goods had declined significantly (the depth of the fall had exceeded 60 percent of the corresponding level of last year for individual groups). A similar picture was observed in the production of building materials (a decrease in the production of materials for general construction use by 30-35 percent, of asbestos cement products by 50-60 percent, of panels for large-panel housing construction by 35 percent, etc.). Beginning with the end of last year the crisis of non-payments in industry is intensifying against the backgound of continuing inflation and the growth of wholesale prices and the number of unprofitable enterprises has increased. The Financial Situation of Enterprises in Industry If by the summer and at the beginning of autumn of last year the situation with non-payments in industry had remained approximately at a single level, the amounts of overdue debt had begun to grow beginning with the second half of October 1993. Thus, for industry as a whole the volume of overdue debt to suppliers had amounted to 10.99 trillion rubles by the end of January and had increased by 43.1 percent in comparison with September. At the same time the share of overdue debt to suppliers in the total volume of output produced had increased during this period from 46 percent to 68.8 percent. Dynamics of the Change in the Share of Overdue Debt An analogous situation developed also with the overdue debt of buyers, the volume of which had increased by 38.1 percent during September-January. The share of debt in the total volume of output produced had increased from 59 percent to 95 percent, i.e., buyers are not paying for practically the monthly volume of output produced. A situation has developed in which they don't take products because they're not needed but because there's no money and it's uncertain when there will be. Analysis of the status of non-payments broken down by sectors indicates that the fuel industry, ferrous metallurgy, chemistry and petrochemistry, and machine-building have the greatest share of overdue debt. The amounts of non-payments in the building materials industry, light industry, and the wood processing and food industries are considerably smaller. This situation once more confirms the pattern that sectors which work to a greater degree for the consumer market are more stable in regard to finances and that their output is orienting itself to effective demand earlier than the rest. The sectors which produce raw and other materials react significantly slower to demand, continuing through inertia to produce what is required already in far smaller volumes. In January 1994 the branches of industry had received a profit in the amount of R2.6 trillion, i.e., the volume of profit had fallen by a factor of three in comparison with January 1993 (taking inflation into account). At the same time, a reduction in profit by almost a factor of two had taken place during October-December 1993, and by 45.6 percent during January in comparison with December, i.e., by a factor of almost 1.5. The fall in the volumes of profit in industry was also accompanied by a decrease of their share in the volume of industrial production--from 22.6 percent in September 1993 to 16.2 percent in January of this year. This implies a further curtailment of investment demand and consequently also the absence of changes in the structure of the fixed capital of enterprises. The latter are not buying new technologies and new equipment and nearly not putting new products into production. In the best case the catalogue and quality of the products produced remains unchanged. The dynamics of the ratio of the monetary funds of enterprises and the overdue debt to suppliers is also characteristic. In the first half of 1993 the monetary funds of the enterprises exceeded overdue debt by 20 percent, by the end of 1993 they covered half of it, and 40 percent by February. The possibilities of increasing the effective demand of the enterprises through credit investments are very limited. Analysis of the dynamics of the change in the volumes of credit investments indicates that, beginning with the second half of 1993, the rates of their increase had begun to shrink (in the third quarter the rates of their increase equalled 48 percent, and in the fourth--30.3 percent). Credit investments in the economy had increased by 6.8 percent (compared to December 1993) during the month of January and by 11 percent during January-February. For the quarter as a whole the increase in the volume of credit investments will be two times less than the increase during the fourth quarter of 1993. As of the beginning of February the relative share of centralized credits in the total amount of credits had come to 26 percent. In February its relative share had increased somewhat and reached a level of 29 percent. However, in connection with delays of receipts into the budget (by the end of March 1994 more than R4 trillion had not been transferred to the budget in the form of taxes) and the surviving high level of the budget deficit (8-9 percent of GDP), the possibilities of increasing the volumes of centralized credit are very limited. The latter is allotted mainly for the needs of the agro-industrial complex (44 percent) and the military-industrial complex, for deliveries to the Far North, etc. The situation with the use of the credits of commercial banks is no better. Under conditions of instability it is not profitable for the banks to grant credit for a protracted period. Short-term credits take up 86.5 percent in the total volume of credit investments and have a tendency to grow. Against a background of the growth of the volumes of short-term credits and of bank interest, and also taking into account the increase in the number of unprofitable enterprises (in January their share had come to 16.2 percent as compared with 9 percent in December 1993, while the amount of losses had more than doubled in the past five months), the possibilities of increasing the effective demand of the enterprises through credits are becoming more and more limited. The Status of Monetary Circulation It follows from an analysis of the structure of the money supply that the share of cash in the total supply of monetary funds had a steady tendency to grow throughout the entire preceding year and had risen during the year from 24 percent to 38 percent (for comparison--in the USA this share comes to only a few percent). At the same time the rates of increase of the supply of cash constantly outstripped the rates of increase of the total money supply. The situation had changed in the beginning of 1994. In the first place, in January the share of cash in the total money supply had declined by 2.6 percent compared to December. Secondly, in January 1994 the volume of cash and non-cash funds had increased by 4.9 percent relative to December while the volume of cash had declined by 2.4 percent. This trend had also been preserved in February. Dynamics of the Change in Per Capita Monetary Incomes The contraction of the volume of cash in January had been one of the reasons for the lowering of the rates of inflation in February and the beginning of March. The currency emission in the amount of R1.6 trillion carried out at the end of February will undoubtedly stimulate an acceleration of the rates of inflation in April-May. The velocity of the circulation of cash and non-cash money, according to data from the State Committee for Statistics, had been kept at last year's level in January-March: cash money circulates twice as fast as non-cash money. In January 1994 the volume of GDP had declined (in comparable prices) by 29.3 percent in comparison with December 1993, while the volume of the total money supply in circulation had increased by 4.9 percent. Since the growth of monetary funds has not been supported by a real growth in production, the money in the accounts of enterprises will be converted subsequently into cash, which will emerge as payment funds not backed by goods and will give rise to a corresponding growth of prices. In analyzing trends of the change in the money supply, one needs to bear in mind that its growth does not mean an increase in the capital actually circulating. An increase in prices, especially wholesale, will result in its contraction. At the same time capital is depreciated more rapidly than the money supply grows. Thus, during January the money supply had increased by 4.9 percent while wholesale prices had increased by 19 percent. Inflation and Wholesale Prices Against the background of the worsening situation in industry a sharp surge of inflation had taken place in January of this year with a subsequent dampening of the rates of the growth of inflation: December 1993--113 percent; January 1994--121 percent; February 1994--110 percent and March 1994--108-110 percent. The level of inflation has come to 145-146 percent during the quarter. This is the lowest level during the last two years. The surge of inflation in January was dictated by a number of the factors we have already mentioned. Insufficent effective demand had restrained an increase in prices in subsequent months. The state had not settled up its debts either with the miners, or the agro-industrial complex, or the military-industrial complex. The crisis in production had resulted in a significant shutdown of enterprises (some 4,280 enterprises stood idle in February as against 3,789 in January and 2,407 in October 1993; production had come to a complete stop at 428 plants in February) and, consequently, in a reduction of the volumes of wage payments to industrial workers. The tense financial state of the enterprises had led to a growth of overdue debt with respect to the payment of wages of 2.2 times in January and by 18 percent more in February, which had also caused a drop in demand on the consumer market. The state intends to retrieve part of its debts in April. To a certain degree these measures will result in a revival of effective demand. The seasonal surge in the demand for a number of construction and light industry goods also will contribute to the growth of inflation, the level of which, according to our estimates, will come to about 15-16 percent a month by the end of the second quarter. Despite an anticipated convergence of the rates of growth of wholesale and consumer prices even under conditions of a growing sales crisis, Russian industrialists, as before, do not see another way out besides a mechanical increase in the prices for their products. For industry as a whole wholesale prices had increased by 19 percent in January, 16 percent in February, and 15-17 percent in March. The index of the growth of wholesale prices during the quarter has come to 158-159 percent. The correlation of the rates of growth of consumer and wholesale prices at the beginning of the year was analogous to the correlation of their growth rates in the second half of last year: on average wholesale prices are growing 15-20 percent more rapidly than consumer prices during the quarter. The surviving financial strain in industry will become one of the factors in slowing down the growth rates of wholesale prices in the second quarter. Many enterprises, in striving to survive, will try to sell their product, even if only very cheaply. However, at the same time the abolition of state regulation of prices for the products of monopolists, the proposed allocation of credit to enterprises on the strength of clearing off the state debt, the increase of the prices for electric power and of transport rates will stimulate a further growth of prices. The superimposing of these two contradictory trends will lead to a moderate growth of wholesale prices which, according to our estimates, will amount to 60-65 percent during the second quarter.
