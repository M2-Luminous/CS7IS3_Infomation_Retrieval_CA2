FR940328-2-00090 FR940328-2-00052 The Commission believes that the requirement of a sufficient market imbalance is a critical aspect of the pilot program. 11 Such a requirement is necessary to ensure that stops are only granted, in a minimum variation market, when the benefit (i.e., price improvement) to orders being stopped far exceeds the potential for harm to orders on the specialist's book. 12 To evaluate how this standard is being applied in practice, the Commission requests that the NYSE conduct another comprehensive quantitative analysis of market depth. In its next monitoring report, the NYSE should provide, in chart form, a comparison of the size of the stopped order to any quote size imbalance. 13 The chart also should include the ratio of the size of the bid to the size of the offer. 14 The NYSE should concentrate on orders for 2,000 shares or less, and should provide the requested information in the form of an average for all buy orders stopped, and then for all sell orders stopped, in that size range. 11 For a discussion of the relationship between quote size imbalance and the likelihood of price improvement, see supra , note 8. In extending a comparable pilot program by the American Stock Exchange, the Commission placed similar emphasis on the critical nature of the sufficient size standard when stopping stock in minimum variation markets. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32664 (July 21, 1993), 58 FR 40171 (July 27, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;22). 12 See infra , text accompanying notes 15&hyph;20. 13 Every time a specialist stops an order to buy, the NYSE should calculate the size of that stopped order as a percentage of the quote size imbalance, i.e., the difference between the size of the offer and the size of the bid. Every time a specialist stops an order to sell, the NYSE should calculate the size of that stopped order as a percentage of the quote size imbalance, i.e., the difference between the size of the bid and the size of the offer. 14 Every time a specialist stops an order to buy, the NYSE should calculate the size of the bid as a percentage of the size of the offer. Every time a specialist stops an order to sell, the NYSE should calculate the size of the offer as a percentage of the size of the bid. Third, the NYSE does not believe that the amendments to Rule 116.30 significantly disadvantage customer limit orders existing on the specialist's book. 15 This conclusion is based on the Exchange's review of limit orders against which orders receiving price improvement were stopped pursuant to this pilot program. As part of its review, the NYSE determined how often such book orders were executed at their limit price by the close of the day's trading. The Commission does not consider that data to be conclusive, because it does not reflect the disposition of book orders in those circumstances (approximately half of all stops granted) where the stopped order did not receive price improvement. 16 15 When stock is stopped, book orders on the opposite side of the market that are entitled to immediate execution lose their priority. If the stopped order then receives an improved price, limit orders at the stop price are bypassed and, if the market turns away from that limit, may never be executed. As for book orders on the same side of the market as the stopped stock, the Committee believes that Rule 116.30's requirements make it unlikely that these limit orders would not be executed. Under the NYSE pilot program, an order can be stopped only if a substantial imbalance exists on the opposite side of the market. See supra , notes 10&hyph;14 and accompanying text. In those circumstances, the stock would probably trade away from the large imbalance, resulting in execution of orders on the book. 16 See infra, note 18.
