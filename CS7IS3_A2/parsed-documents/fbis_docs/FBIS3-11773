Machado was accompanied by Alfredo Enriquez Pina, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Granma Province. During his tour, Machado Ventura stressed that the UBPC's were created because of the need to increase production. [Begin Machado recording] If this does not go well, we will have very serious problems throughout the country. From there we must care for them and work with them in discussions if there is any indication that there may be problems. [Words indistinct] the stability that will guarantee and satisfy the needs of the cooperative, the worker, and his family. That is a guarantee that will keep the people here. Other problems will follow: better quality, higher yields. All this will follow, but this year we must organize ourselves. We cannot begin next year with new ideas or new interpretations. If there is anything to interpret, move, or change, it should be done now, during these next months. That is why I am visiting you. We are trying to do this now so that later on no one gets off track. This is not to sell plantains along the road. We sell the plantains on the road, we get so much, and we sell the rest. That is not the way. You are here to produce more because by selling plantains on the road maybe with half of the production you get more because it is sold at 10 times the price, yet we must focus on producing more. When we talk about earning more, we want you to earn more, but based on your production, not because your product was sold at a higher price, rather because you produced more. [end recording] These were statements by Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura in Granma on the UBPC's, after visiting several of these collectives in this eastern province.
