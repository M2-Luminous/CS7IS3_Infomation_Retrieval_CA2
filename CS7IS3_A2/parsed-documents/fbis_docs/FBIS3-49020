Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic to have gained its independence peacefully, and it is an example of the cohabitation of different ethnic groups, which is more unique than rare in these parts. The Albanians are even represented in the government, run by Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, who is only 32 years old. What is the present situation like on the borders with Serbia and your other neighbors? There is talk of illegal trafficking and of the embargo being violated. [Crvenkovski] Extremist Albanians in Macedonia, Kosovo, and Tirana, dream of a greater Albania. This plan is embarrassing for the authorities in Tirana, with whom we have good relations. If Kosovo were to explode, the war would be more devastating than the present one. The Albanians in Macedonia would rush to support their brothers, and Serbia could take advantage of this to invade our country. At this point Bulgaria, which recognized us and with which we now have good relations, would come forward with its ancient territorial claims. Even Greece, in which there is a Macedonian region, would be involved.
