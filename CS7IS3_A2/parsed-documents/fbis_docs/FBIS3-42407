Shirokorad: "With Missile and Projectile"] [Text] "Are there systems similar to the American ADATS [Air Defense Anti-Tank System] in our Armed Forces? " S. Kurganov (Kemerovo Oblast)" The 2S6M "Tunguska" Self-Propelled Air Defense System, the first domestically-produced air defense system with the 2K22M missile-gun complex, entered the inventory at the beginning of the 1980's. Batteries consisting of six of these systems provide the air defense of motorized-rifle and tank regiments. Initially, let's examine the missile portion of the air defense system. Eight launchers with 9M311 missiles housed in canisters are mounted on it. The missile is 2,562 mm long, weighs 42 kg, and has a 9 kg fragmentation-continuous rod warhead. Its maximum speed is up to 900 meters per second [mps] and its average speed is 600 mps. It is capable of destroying aircraft (helicopters) that are flying at speeds of up to 500 mps. Missile firings are conducted in place or from a short halt when the target is within visual range. It has a semiautomatic radio command guidance system with manual target tracking and automatic placement of the missile on the sighting line based upon signals that are transmitted via a radio channel. The warhead has a proximity fuze with an operating radius of five meters. Two 2A38 30 mm twin-barrel automatic guns that were developed under the leadership of V. Gryazev make up the artillery portion of the air defense system. The rate of fire of one automatic gun is 1,950-2,500 rounds per minute. The automatic gun operates on the energy of powder gases that are eliminated from the barrel channel through special vents. Cooling of the barrel is carried out using water that is circulated in the barrel jacket. Reloading of the automatic gun is pyrotechnic and manual (in the event a projectile becomes jammed). For the former, there are three pyrotechnic cartridges per automatic gun. The "Tunguska's" chassis is a GM-352 that was manufactured by Minsk Tractor Plant. Right now Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant makes it. A transloader vehicle on a KamAZ-43101 motor vehicle chassis is attached to each of the self-propelled air defense guns. It transports eight missiles and 32 boxes with projectiles for the automatic air defense guns, it has a crane, a machine for loading and to couple and uncouple cartridge belts, and radio communications equipment. The "Tunguska" air defense mount is certainly an effective system. But you must keep in mind that it destroys only airborne targets. At the same time the United States, jointly with Switzerland, has developed the ADATS air defense-antitank missile system, the missiles of which can destroy aircraft at a distance of up to eight kilometers and at an altitude of five kilometers and any tanks at a distance of up to eight kilometers with a shaped charge-fragmentation warhead with a 900 mm armor-piercing capability. Missile guidance is by laser beam.
