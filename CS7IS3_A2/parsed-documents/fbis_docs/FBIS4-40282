Winding up his visit to Moscow, Karadzic said that Russia was not siding with the Serbs, but understood the Serbs' problems and was striving to find solutions which would be equally just or equally unjust to all three parties to the Bosnian conflict. Speaking to Yugoslav reporters in Moscow, Karadzic asked whether it was possible to reach peace if only one side -- viz. the Serbs -- was working for it. He wondered that individual circles in the United States were supporting the fundamentalist, pro-Iranian regime in Sarajevo. They have not only caused the war in Bosnia, but are keeping it alive with their skillful game of imposing unacceptable solutions on the Serbs and then accusing them of prolonging the war, Karadzic said and added that the Serbs did not want Russia to enter into a confrontation with the West because of them. He explained that the Russian Parliament understood that the Serbs' peace efforts were sincere, that they had made better offers at the latest talks in Geneva, but had finally accepted a compromise for the sake of peace, even if it had to be for only a month. At Geneva, the Bosnian Serb side had offered a ceasefire for a year, the international community proposed one for four months, but the Moslems and Croats, after painstaking negotiations, finally agreed to only a month's suspension of hostilities. Karadzic said that the size of territory in the division of Bosnia was not the biggest problem in the matter of territorial delimitations, and that the Serbs were willing to agree to the offer of 49 percent of Bosnia (as against 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation) if they were given the right quality of territory. He said that agreement could easily be reached if, for example, the Serbs were to get Sarajevo and Tuzla, but added that percentages as a means of dividing territory should be abandoned. The important thing is that both the Moslem-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serb republic should be viable states, he explained. The Serbs are taking into consideration the Moslems' need to have a compact state, and the international community must take the same approach to the Serb state, he added, insisting that the Bosnian Serb state must not be scattered around like five Nagorno-Karabakhs, but that it too must be compact.
