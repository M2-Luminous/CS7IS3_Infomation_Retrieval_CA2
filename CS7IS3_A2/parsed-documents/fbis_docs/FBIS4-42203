Vranitzky told ORF [Austrian Radio and Television] that Austrian policy is very clear. It was laid down in a joint statement that the production of nuclear energy is always based on the political decision of the country in question. According to Vranitzky, the same applies to the disposal of nuclear waste. Therefore Austrian politicians are responsible here. For Vranitzky, these are clear guidelines.
