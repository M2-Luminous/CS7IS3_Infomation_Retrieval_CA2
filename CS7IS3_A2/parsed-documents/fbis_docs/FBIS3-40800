This, according to the Tamanrasset governorate department of regulations and administration, is the final evaluation of the damage assessment commission. According to the commission, four sectors were hit especially hard: housing, agriculture, water supply, and basic infrastructures. Thus, 416 houses in Ideles and 118 in In-Amguel have become uninhabitable. As a result, governorate officials indicated, the Tamanrasset governorate initiated an emergency housing reconstruction program as part of communal development plans (PCDs) in order to cope with the emergency and provide housing for the homeless. As far as agriculture is concerned, 120 hectares under irrigation were flooded, 70 motor pumps carried along by the deluge, and 100 range wells damaged. Hundreds of cattle, goats, and sheep were also lost. The departments involved prepared an application to the National Natural Disaster Fund for any assistance and indemnities that may apply. In the In-Amguel and Ideles areas, the drinking-water supply system was reported damaged over 3,000 meters, the discharge system over 850 meters. At In-Amguel, four drillings are deemed irreparably lost, and eight valves were carried along by the water. The basic infrastructure sector, too, suffered extensive damage involving in particular 110 km of unpaved road, three crossings, 65 km of road shoulder, and a long section of Highway No. 1 between Tit and In-Amguel. The Tamanrasset governorate declared an emergency concerning the repair of damaged drinking water lines and unpaved roads, and decided to launch an emergency housing construction program making it mandatory, this time, to use local stone as building material instead of the "toub" that disintegrates every time it rains. Note that the president of the Algerian Association for Maladjusted Children (AAPEI), whom we contacted by telephone, indicated that the association would start distributing food to flood victims in the In-Amguel and Ideles areas on Saturday.
