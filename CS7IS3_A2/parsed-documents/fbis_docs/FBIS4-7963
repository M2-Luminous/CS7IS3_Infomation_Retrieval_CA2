The poll was carried out over telephone by DELO's Stik research group on 31 March and 1 April. As it is reported, out of 1,000 randomly chosen telephone subscribers from all over Slovenia, 789 took part in the poll. The report consists of 6 graphs and an accompanying explanatory text. The first graph shows replies to the question: "Which of the present parliamentary parties would you vote for if the elections were tomorrow?" The party that won the most votes is the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) with 19.3 percent, followed by the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia (SDSS) with 10.3 percent, the Slovene Peoples' Party (SLS) with 7.5 percent, the Slovene Christian Democrats (SKD) with 7.2 percent, the United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD) with 4.7 percent, the Democratic Party with 1.5 percent, the Slovene National Party with 0.8 percent, the Greens of Slovenia with 0.8 percent, and an independent group of deputies of the Slovene National Party with 0.1 percent of votes. Of the pollees, 29.3 percent replied with "I do not know," 9.6 percent would vote for none of these parties, while 8.9 percent would not take part in the voting at all. The second graph on page 1 shows the opinions as to whether the State Chamber did the right thing in impeaching former defense minister Janez Jansa. To this question 37.1 percent replied affirmatively, 41.9 percent negatively, while 21 percent did not know. As DELO writes "despite considerable dissatisfaction with the parliamentary decision regarding Janez Jansa, the pollees mostly (54 percent) expect that Jelko Kacin will be a good defense minister." As it is written further "a good half of the pollees is also of the opinion that the departure of Janez Jansa from the post of the defense minister cannot influence adversely the Slovene defense situation and its independence. A little over 30 percent fear that this could happen." "However," paper continues, "a staggering 74.4 percent of DELO's pollees believe that the demands of the demonstrators and the State Chamber deputies that the President of the State Milan Kucan accounts for some of his statements and also for his possible involvement in the Smolnikar affair, are perfectly legitimate." As a graph on the page 2 illustrates, 12.8 percent disagreed, while 12.8. percent were undecided on this question. "Regardless of this," DELO writes on, "more than a half believe that after the Monday events the Smolnikar affair will never be thoroughly investigated." According to the paper, more than a half (56 percent) find the demands for early elections "nonsensical" while 30 percent approve. Regarding the demand of some parties that the United List leaves the coalition, 38.3 percent replied negatively, 24.1 percent positively, and 37.6 percent were undecided on the matter. "Because the three men -- Kucan, Drnovsek, and Jansa -- in a way symbolize three rival or at least different political orientations, DELO's pollees could also answer to the question of which of the political orientations they supported the most," paper says. As an accompanying graph on page 2 shows, Jansa's political orientation won the most votes -- 27.5. percent -- followed by that of Janez Drnovsek with 24.1 percent, and Milan Kucan with 17.5 percent: 14.4 percent were undecided while 16.5 percent said that they do not support any of the above three. A separate analysis on page 2 by Aleksander Bratina, which examines correlation between the education of pollees and their choices, shows that "in terms of sex, age, and place of residence (we have classified the pollees according to whether they live in a bigger town, smaller town, or a village, although there is also a possibility of regional classification, which we leave to the marketing experts) there are no significant differences in support for the above three political orientations." As Bratina writes, "there is an important difference only in terms of education. Jansa is favored by those with completed primary and secondary education and a little less by those with higher education. The opposite is the case with Janez Drnovsek, who is supported by the voters with higher education. The support for Kucan is the same as the support for Janez Jansa; however, the latter is currently leading."
