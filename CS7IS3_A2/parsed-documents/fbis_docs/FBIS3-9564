Therefore, it is important to know what the citizens think about the parties, whether they have a program and, if so, whether their program provides answers that are also regarded as important by the public. At the beginning of the election campaign, 45 percent of citizens did not know that there were parties that had already formulated their programs for the upcoming elections; 3 percent thought that there were no such parties, and 3 percent thought that every party had a program. Only 29 percent of those who do not want to vote think that some parties have already formulated their programs, and only 59 percent of those who will certainly go to vote think this. Those who think that at least a few parties are preparing for the elections with programs mainly think of parliamentary parties. The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] held its program-formulating general meeting two weeks before this opinion poll. Only 20 percent of the people surveyed had heard about this meeting, and this also shows that the good position of the SZDSZ is due not so much to information, but to the fact that a considerable number of citizens have consistently regarded the SZDSZ (as well as the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]) as a program party since the 1990 elections. It is also important to know the extent to which supporters of individual parties "follow their feelings" and the extent to which they evaluate the party program. We cannot give an exact answer to this question, but the way voters judge their own parties is also characteristic from this viewpoint. Supporters of the SZDSZ, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] are higher the average in thinking that their party has an election program, while supporters of the MDF are more uncertain than the average. A considerable proportion of voters for the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is made up of women older than 60, living in villages, and disinterested in politics; in their election decisions, religion plays a bigger role than the party programs. In this respect, the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] resembles the two government parties more than the opposition parties. Since shrinking to a third of the figures prevailing in December 1992, the Fidesz supporters are increasingly connected to a certain age group: Half of the present Fidesz supporters are younger than 30 and three-quarters are young than 40. Political disinterest can often be found among the younger generation, and many of them are only attracted to Fidesz for emotional reasons. There is a broad consensus in the fact that politics should first of all solve the economic problems; however, many voters have no idea which party could best solve the problems facing the Hungarian economy. Many voters do not think that the party they want to vote for is capable of doing this. This shows the limited commitment of some of the Hungarian voters. These are facts that every party should face more deliberately during the election campaign. About the same number of people expect economic improvement from the MSZP and the MDF as the number of people who would vote for these two parties, but we are not talking about exactly the same people. Some 4 percent more people than the actual supporters think that the SZDSZ could improve the economic situation. Almost the same applies to the FKGP. However, only a small percentage of their supporters think that the Fidesz and the KDNP could improve the economy. The new government will have several possibilities at its disposal to solve the economic problems. The surveyors of the Median Opinion Poll Institute asked the people surveyed to choose three out of 10 possibilities they regard as the most important to implement, and another three possibilities they regard as the least important to implement. On of a scale of 100, the figures under 50 show that people do not regard the implementation of the given task as particularly important, and the figures above 50 show that they regard it as important. On another scale of 100, the people in the survey listed the four most popular parties according to the extent these parties would strive to solve a given task if they became part of the government. Only 18 percent of the people were able to list the parties according to all the 10 tasks. Some 36 percent of the people could not list the parties. This also means that the data represent the opinion of more politically-informed people. This explains that, while a relative majority expects the MSZP to improve the economy, the SZDSZ is leading regarding the impelementation of every concrete task. Among the four parties, the MDF is rejected the most. In two cases, however, the MSZP came in the last place: People generally do not regard the flow of foreign capital and privatization as goals of the socialists. However, this will not cause the MSZP to lose many voters, because the majority of people do not regard the aforementioned tasks as really important.
