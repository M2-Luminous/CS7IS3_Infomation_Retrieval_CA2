We will continue to proceed on this line. All of you live in our hearts and deep in our conscience.

It is a great duty. However, with God's help and through everyone's resolve and awareness, you will perfectly carry out your duty. God the almighty is the one who grants success and sponsors the march. Greetings. [applause] [crowd shouts: Long live His Majesty King Husayn] Be reassured that we here are one cohesive family.

If you please now, allow me to shake hands with you, one by one.
