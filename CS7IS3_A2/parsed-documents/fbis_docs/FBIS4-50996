FBIS4-50996 "drchi100_v_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 TAIWAN Structure of Balance of Payments Changing Structure of Balance of Payments Changing OW2405093294 Taipei CNA in English 0811 GMT 24 May 94 OW2405093294 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan's balance of payments has changed structurally, with the current account surplus declining while capital inflow is beginning to outpace capital outflow, finance officials said Tuesday [24 May]. Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of more than U.S.$1 billion in the first quarter of this year, the first favorable balance in its capital account since 1988, according to preliminary statistics compiled by the Central Bank of China (CBC). Taiwan's current account surplus, however, dropped to a 13-year low of about U.S.$200 million during the January-March period mainly because of a sharp decline in the merchandise trade surplus, the CBC said. It will release the exact figures of the country's balance of payments for the first quarter of 1994 later this week. CBC officials said the capital account surplus indicates that foreign capital movement has begun to influence Taiwan's balance of payments as a result of its financial liberalization and internationalization policy. Meanwhile, the officials said, the drop in the current account surplus reflects structural changes in the local economy. Taiwan has gradually lost export competitiveness, particularly in labor-intensive industries, and thus no longer enjoys a huge trade surplus. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only U.S.$240 million during the three-month period. The balance of payments measure records all of a country's economic transactions with the rest of the world during a specified period of time. It is usually divided into the capital account, which records short and long-term capital flows, and the current account, which records merchandise and service trade as well as unrequited transfers. The balance of payments is an effective measure to monitor a country's external trade and financial relations. Taiwan consistently registered net capital outflows between 1987 and 1993 as local companies were making massive investments abroad because of the worsening investment climate here. The capital account deficit reached a record U.S.$5.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 1992. The trend reversed itself in the first quarter of this year. An influx of "hot money" for investment in the local stock market in January and February as well as a slowdown in direct overseas investments resulted in a net capital inflow of more than US$10 billion during the period. Thanks to its huge current account surplus, Taiwan saw its balance of payments end up in the black between 1981 and 1991. It registered a rare U.S.$639 million deficit in its international balance sheet in 1992, but again chalked up a U.S.$1.45 billion surplus last year. The balance of payments surplus is also expected to exceed U.S.$1 billion in the first quarter of 1994 due to a combination of factors, including net capital inflow, slower increases in overseas travel bills and increases in interest income from the country's huge foreign exchange reserves, the officials noted.
