FR940803-1-00060 FR940803-1-00012 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Denial of petition for rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice denies a petition for rulemaking by Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd., to amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to allow the abrupt release of the accelerator pedal to operate stop lamps. The reason for the denial is the importance of retaining the existing requirement for activating the stop lamps only through application of the brake pedal in order to avoid confusion. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patrick Boyd, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;6346). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Baran Advanced Technologies, Ltd. of Israel manufactures a device called ``Red Alert'' which is intended to activate the stop lamps during emergency braking before the brake pedal is applied, thereby providing an earlier warning for following vehicles. The device senses the rate at which the accelerator pedal returns to its upper stop after being released. It activates the stop lamps for one second if the accelerator pedal reaches its upper stop at greater than a certain predetermined rate. Its operation is based on the assumption that any rapid release of the accelerator pedal is the beginning of an emergency braking maneuver, and thus will be immediately followed by application of the brake pedal. Application of the brake pedal continues to activate the stop lamp in the usual way. If the brake pedal is depressed within one second of the release of the accelerator, the brake light will remain on at the end of the initial one second period of activation and thus provide a steady signal. Standard No. 108 requires that stop lamps ``shall be activated upon application of the service brakes.'' That requirement has been interpreted to mean that the stop lamps are to be activated only upon activation of the service brakes. Some years ago, Baran's competitor in the Israeli market, ATAT, sought an interpretation of Standard No. 108 that would allow the aftermarket installation of its similar Advanced Brake Light Device (ABLD) in the U.S. In a letter of January 25, 1990, to Larry Snowhite, Esq., the agency concluded that accelerator release activation by an aftermarket device such as the ABLD would render the stop lamps partially inoperative within the meaning of the prohibition of 15 U.S.C. 1397(a)(2)(A). Said NHTSA: The heart of our concern is that while the standard requires the stop lamp to operate in only one particular circumstance, the ABLD causes the stop lamp to operate at an earlier time when the lamp is supposed to be unlighted. Further, the ABLD's activation of the stop lamp indicates only that the operator has released the accelerator. It does not necessarily follow that the brake pedal will be applied. Under this fact situation, the stop lamps fulfill a purpose other than for which they are installed. This can only create the potential for confusion and dilution of the effectiveness of the stop signal. For the reasons stated above, we have concluded that installation of the ABLD in the aftermarket would render the stop lamps partially inoperative. Baran's ``Red Alert'' and ATAT's ABLD operate under the same fundamental principle of measuring the accelerator pedal return rate to anticipate emergency braking. ATAT did not report its threshold rate for accelerator pedal release. However, the fact that its false alarm rate is similar to that of the Baran system suggests that the activation of both systems is based on a similar threshold rate of accelerator release. These rates are discussed later in the notice. NHTSA has examined Baran's petition in an effort to balance possible safety benefits of the device against the possible safety disbenefits of signal confusion. The first issue is whether the petitioner can demonstrate that its device is likely to lessen the number of accidents. Baran estimates large reductions in rear-end accidents using figures from a paper by Enke ``Possibilities for Improving Safety Within the Driver-Vehicle Environment Control Loop'' and from a NHTSA report on Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS) countermeasures to rear end accidents (DOT HS 807 995). Enke's paper estimates that the impact speed of 25 percent of rear end accidents is no more than 10 km/hr (9 ft/sec) and that the amount of distance traveled at the assumed initial speed for 0.25 second equals the distance required to stop from the impact speed. Baran claims that ``based on Enke's analysis, providing a driver with an additional .25 seconds of warning of an impending stop by the leading driver could result in a 25 to 30 percent reduction in all rear-end accidents.'' NHTSA disputes this conclusion. Enke's analysis presumes that the following driver is attentive to the very first glimmer of a stop signal from the car ahead and that (s)he reacts immediately even though a speed differential has not yet occurred. It also presumes that the lead driver decelerates so rapidly that the following driver cannot ``outbrake'' the lead driver and that the initial distance between them is less than following driver's reaction time multiplied by the initial speed. NHTSA views these presumptions as unrealistic. Further, NHTSA's IVHS report characterizes a rear-end crash as ``largely a dry/straight road phenomenon associated with driver inattention.'' It found the lead vehicle stopped (LVS) in 75 percent of rear-end crashes, which Typically do not involve simply a ``too-slow'' reaction of the following driver to a sudden crash threat. In the most common scenario, the lead vehicle is stopped for an extended interval (i.e., 2&hyph;6 seconds) before it is struck by the following vehicle. There is adequate time to provide a warning to the following driver and for the driver to avoid the crash. Vehicles involved in this crash subtype should not be viewed as a locked pair where one vehicle is following the other at a specified distance. Instead, the following vehicle is closing on a stationary object. The initial gap distance between the vehicles is often several hundred feet or more. No cases were identified where a lead vehicle decelerated rapidly and then was hit by a closely following vehicle immediately after coming to a stop. It is difficult to see how a 0.25 second advance stop lamp warning would be of any use in the 75 percent of rear-end accidents in the LVS category when prolonged driver inattention appears to be a near universal cause.
