Especially, shoes, cosmetics and enamelware have won popularity on home and foreign markets. The workers of the light industry there are making innovations in production in hearty response to the revolutionary economic strategy of the party. They overfulfilled the January assignments by two percent. And they are greeting significant February with a greater upswing in production. Sinuiju, the border city and the capital of North Pyongan Province, is one of major light industrial cities of Korea. The city has tens of modern factories under central or local management. They produce thousands of kinds of light industrial goods needed for the people's life. The Sinuiju general chemical fibre mill, a grand self-reliant chemical fibre producer of the nation, supplies fibre to light industrial factories across the country. The Sinuiju cosmetics factory produces large quantities of cream, aromatic powder, toilet soap, tooth paste and other high-class cosmetics containing Ginseng (Insam), a specialty of Korea. The shoes produced in the city account for more than 20 percent of the nation's total. The textile mill, the woollen mill and the knitting mill produce a half of the province's total. The plastic daily necessities factory, the household articles factory, the garment factory and the pharmaceutical factory in the city are also well known nationwide. Before the liberation of the nation, the city was a small commercial and consumer city with a backward textile industry and pulp and paper-making industry of a small scale. The light industry of the city has made a rapid progress under the wise guidance of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The total light industrial output value of the city is 76 times the 1944 figure before the liberation. The light industry of the city relies on its own raw material base and light industrial machine production base. Sinuiju University of light industry creditably discharges its mission as a training centre of light industrial technicians and a centre of scientific research.
