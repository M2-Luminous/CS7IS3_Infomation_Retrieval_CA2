Pham Van Quang, born in 1942, a resident of Phuoc Binh village, Thu Duc District, deliberately engaged in a rebellious act in a public place when Ho Chi Minh City was hosting its first international marathon on 16 December 1992. On that day, Pham Van Quang drove his family car to Me Linh Square with the intention of creating trouble. He reasoned that many people, especially foreigners, visit this place each day and that his act might produce political repercussions. At noon, Quang climbed onto the hood of his car and waved a flag. He fired a revolver at intervals to draw people's attention. He reloaded his gun five times, firing a total of 19 shots. Seeing this, people in the vicinity immediately tried to stop Quang, but were driven back when he pulled the pin of an M26 grenade to frighten them. Quang was later arrested along with his exhibits. The Ho Chi Minh City People's Court sentenced Pham Van Quang to 15 years imprisonment on the charge of "rebellion." After serving his jail term, Quang will be on parole for five years and will be deprived of some of his rights as a citizen.
