The Colombian foreign minister indicated that the topic is not on the agenda of the chiefs of state, who will attend the 14-15 June meeting in Cartagena de Indians, but she said the Haitian situation will be analyzed "for certain." "We will condemn the de facto regime, and we will support the embargo policy and the economic measures that are directed at having the current government open the doors to constitutionality," Sanin said. [passage omitted] Sanin indicated that she does not know whether the topic of Cuba will also be addressed by the government leaders, although she said that in these types of meetings diverse topics may be debated. The foreign minister said that, since the previous summits, it has been observed that changes have been introduced by the Fidel Castro government, but she stressed that these are insufficient modifications. "We have seen some reforms, but not with the speed we would like. We respect Cuba's self-determination, although I do not want to deny that it would be very satisfactory for everyone if complete freedoms existed in that country," she commented. [passage omitted]
