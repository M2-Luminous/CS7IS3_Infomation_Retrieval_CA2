Therefore, they cannot support the changes to the constitutional law yet. Miroslav Mozetic told this at a regular news conference of the Christian Democrats today. He also said that the party is preparing for all possibilities envisaged by the Law of Local Self-Rule, which regulates the elections into new or old communes. Gojko Brvar reports: [Begin Brvar recording] [passage omitted] The party holds a well-established opinion regarding the affiliation of the center-oriented political parties, which the party's secretary general, Edvard Stanic, repeated today. The affiliation of the political parties is a necessity on the Slovene political scene. The political field is thus narrowing and becoming more definitive. [passage omitted] The affiliation on the right is still characterized by the relations between the Peoples' Party and the Christian Democrats. After numerous offers of the Slovene Christian Democrats, a public initiative for wider affiliation came from the Peoples' Party just before the New Year. The Christian Democrats have heard it with interest, but expect that they will nevertheless get an answer to their earlier initiatives. Namely, the Slovene Peoples' Party still has not responded to the last initiative, which was suggested at a personal level by the president, leader of the club of deputies, and secretary general of the Christian Democrats. When asked how would the Christian Democrats view a possible Social Democrat [SDSS] withdrawal from the government coalition, Edvard Stanic did not give a direct answer. Indirectly, he hinted that a withdrawal of one coalition partner would not necessarily result in the withdrawal of the Christian Democrats. [passage omitted] [end recording].
