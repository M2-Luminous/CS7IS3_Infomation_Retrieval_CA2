Even if we add the remaining deputies to that figure, the number is lower than we have had as far back as 1992. But the number of our deputies has not been reduced to the extent reported in the country. The attitude of the 15 other parties has not been to go to Congress to make specific proposals. No. Their only goal has been to oppose the current government. They have not presented any proposals nor have they been constructive. They were bent on destroying the government's image. The fact that we have the number of deputies you people say we will have, although we did not elect even one deputy in some provinces, the two lists constitute substantial proof of support. That means that the people in general, the majority within the center-right option, favor changes like restructuring the economy, changing the political stand, and creating more jobs. The people have seen that this is what my government has been doing. [Reporter] What can you say about today's political victory, Mr. President, considering that, as you say, there has been [words indistinct]? [Duran-Ballen] We cannot talk about a political victory or say that the opposition has won. There is an anticipated result, which will depend on the spirit with which the deputies will work at the National Congress and in the provincial and canton councils over the next two years. [Reporter] Mr. President, you say that all parties have banded together to campaign against the government. There is no doubt that the number of votes received by the government parties represents a rejection of the government's policy. It seems that not all the people are aware of what your government is doing. [Duran-Ballen] Well, I cannot expect uniform acceptance by the Ecuadoran people. If I asked any one of you whether my work as mayor of Quito was positive, you would probably say yes. Well, this very same thing has happened to me halfway through my term. There has been a reaction. The people could not see the purpose of planning and the administrative and financial reorganization of Quito municipality. I had the same reaction to the government in general. [Reporter] The majority of the next Congress will be in the opposition [words indistinct]. [Duran-Ballen] No. The people are aware that the only goal of the parties in Congress has been to oppose the government's work. At some time, not only the Social Christian Party has cooperated with the government. Several deputies have supported government proposals because they found them reasonable and were convinced that the country urgently required these proposals to advance. [Reporter] Do you expect a similar stand now that a letter of intent has been sent to Congress so the obligation with the IMF can be paid? [Duran-Ballen] I would not talk about an obligation with the IMF. I would talk about commitments with the country, commitments we have told the IMF that we would try to fulfill. It is worth clarifying, however, that the IMF has not set terms. Quite the opposite is true. I have explained this a number of times. Any country's letter of intent to the IMF represents a pledge by the country to solve its economic problems in the near future. Consequently, there are no impositions other than those that we have placed on ourselves. [Reporter] Will the government be able to do all that has been planned? [Duran-Ballen] Regarding the aspects that depend solely on the executive branch, we will continue to do everything we had in mind, just as we have been doing. [words indistinct] [Reporter] Mr. President, there is no doubt that the number of votes received by the government parties is disappointing. What do you think has been your worst mistake in these two years? Do you think it should be corrected in the remaining two years of your term? [Duran-Ballen] I would not describe those actions as mistakes but rather as an outside assessment of what we have done. The country, including my fellow party members, and the media expected the economic situation we received to be corrected. We have made decisions to keep the number of bureaucrats low. This decision, not only to keep the number from rising but to reduce it, had never been made before. That is a positive step for the country. The economic reorganization we have been implementing is already yielding results. Consequently, a number of loans will be signed with the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank in a few months. Some loans have already been signed with the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and the Andean Development Corporation. All of these loans without exception are for development, exclusively to be invested in projects and services that mean recovery for the country. None of these loans is for administrative expenditures. The only way we could have achieved these things is by doing what we have been doing in these [words indistinct]. [Reporter] You said no tangible results have been achieved in the first two years. [Duran-Ballen] There are tangible results. [Reporter] But not tangible enough. [Duran-Ballen] I invite you to take any aspect and compare what my government has done with what previous governments did. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [Duran-Ballen] Let us consider the current road construction and maintenance programs. Tell me if the number of kilometers of highways in 1988 through 1990 is comparable to the present number. I am asking you to dig out the figures. You have to have the figures to make an accurate assessment. [Reporter] My question is specific, Mr. President. What can the Ecuadoran people expect considering that you explained [words indistinct]? What will those results be? [Duran-Ballen] In these first years, we have been reorganizing the economy and reducing the number of government employees. As a result, we have access to international loans from institutions and countries. We can move greater internal resources and devote all of them to our economic development. [Reporter] What exactly can the people expect from the government? [Duran-Ballen] I would like to invite you or any one of the people here to come with me and tour the construction programs, not necessarily of this government, and tell me whether this reorganization has not had good results. Tell me if there are no additional jobs, which we intended. There has been an opening to international trade, and exports have increased. [Reporter] It has been said that inflation goes down but that prices go up. It is said the number of jobs has increased but that there are no jobs. [Duran-Ballen] How can you say there are no jobs? Who is building the highways? Who is working on the various programs in the provinces? I repeat: Let us compare any two years of any of the previous governments with the first two years of my government. [Reporter] Mr. President, how can you .... [Duran-Ballen, interrupting] If there are fewer projects, then I would agree with you that there are fewer jobs. [Reporter] Have more jobs been created? [Duran-Ballen] Of course, many more jobs have been created, but there are fewer jobs in the public sector. I refuse and will continue to refuse to consider the public sector as the only source of employment in the country, as reporters seem to believe. [Reporter] Mr. President, you have been talking about the government's work. How do you interpret the inconsistency between what the people think, what has been expressed against the government today, and what you say? Unfortunately, you seem to speak a different language than the people. Is your government completely impossible to understand? [Duran-Ballen] I shall go back to the time when I was mayor of Quito. For the first months, the first year of the first two years, everyone said the same thing. When I started to reorganize the real estate registry and charge fees, which had not been collected before, when we started to outline a rational plan to pave streets, establish services, and extend electrical energy, no one saw or believed. There was a reaction. Now, if I ask you -- unless you do not reside in Quito -- you would say the projects carried out in Quito were many and real. Otherwise, I am saying something different from the truth and deceiving the people.
