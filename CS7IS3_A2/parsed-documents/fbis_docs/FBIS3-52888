Feasibility studies are now on to make planes with the capacity [of] up to 100 seats. The Chinese ambassador, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, told PTI in New Delhi that the two countries proposed to pool their technological and other resources for the project. The studies are to be undertaken by experts of the National Aeronautical Laboratory and the Aerotechnology Research Institute of China. Mr. Cheng said both India and China have good military planes and they can diversify the capability to the civilian side. As the two countries are carrying out economic reforms, they will also be able to acquire better technology for the project, he said. The ambassador also felt that there is great scope for stepping up bilateral trade as it accounts for just 1 percent of India's foreign trade. He said China is trying to introduce Indian technical know-how in the computer field and is interested in launching Indian satellites which will be cheaper than other European launchers.
