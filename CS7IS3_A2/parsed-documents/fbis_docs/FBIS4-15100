FBIS4-15100 "drsov067cc_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 7 Apr ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 7 Apr LD0704074694 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0616 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704074694 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow, April 7 (ITAR-TASS) -- Under the headline "To Achieve Civil Accord in Russia", the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper features the full draft of the appropriate agreement (version 1) of last March 27. The newspaper also singles out a decision by President Boris Yeltsin on setting up Russian military bases in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as in Latvia to ensure security of the Russian Federation and the above states as well as to test new weapons and combat materiel. Deputy Director of the Institute of Europe Sergey Karaganov, D.Sc. (History), describes in an interview with the same newspaper President Yeltsin's programme of a Spanish visit which will start on April 11. It will be the first official visit by a Russian president to Spain. According to Karaganov, the forthcoming talks in Madrid "can be described as a timely step of the two sides towards each other against the background of the latest trend of West European countries' certain aloofness from Russia". This aloofness, he continues, was caused above all by dissatisfaction of many European states with the solution of their general domestic problems. The deputy director expresses confidence that the visit will yield positive results for the two countries in the political, economic and cultural spheres. Under the title "Black Sea Fleet is a Political Notion Now", the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with the fleet commander, Admiral Eduard Baltin. Noting that "Russia and Ukraine should equally appropriate funds" for the needs of the Black Sea Fleet in compliance with the Yalta agreement, the admiral states that "Russia has been virtually fully maintaining the fleet since the end of 1993". The admiral stresses that "the two sides should take into account, above all, military need and economic expediency" while shaping up their relations with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. "In that case, relations will be good-neighbourly," Baltin adds. The same newspaper runs a statement by Commander of Russian Border Troops Andrey Nikolayev to ITAR-TASS which is entitled "Russia will not put up with pillage". The newspaper writes that the press reports all the time about violations of Russian territorial waters by Japanese fishing vessels for illegal fishing. In this connection, a decision was taken to launch a special operation on the eve of the fishing season to stop illegal fishing by foreign ships in the Pacific region, starting from April 20. It will be carried out gradually till next October. Today's Moscow press singles out reports on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea as a result of a fire five years ago. It carried, apart from the nucler reactor, two torpedoes with nuclear warheads. The tragedy tolled 42 lives. In this connection, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, taking into account that the komsomolets was not decontaminated due to incompetence of people responsible for this case, calls on Russian authorities to take urgent measures to prevent a possible radiation disaster in the region of the submarine's wreckage. The same newspaper runs information that the upper chamber of the Russian parliament did not accept on Wednesday the resignation of former Russian Prosecutor-General Aleksey Kazannik. Byacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the lower house subcommittee on international security and arms control, examines in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA a decision by Russian authorities to join NATO's programme "partnership for peace". He notes that the existence of the programme does not depend on Russia's decisions. The programme will operate. "We could influence its implementation by participating in the programme. "by obstaining from the programme, Russia would lose every chance to participate and will gain nothing, apart from glamorous self- isolation from the rest of Europe," Nikonov notes. The TRUD newspaper describes "a veritable war against spring elements of nature" and the emergency situations which have developed in European Russia as well as in Siberia and the Far East. Over 200,000 hectares of land are now flooded, the newspaper writes. "When do we learn lessons, at long last, from this war?" the newspaper asks.
