Unfortunately, things are not so simple. The response by the Bosnian Serbs was not short in coming: "Our artillery will not move one inch...." French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe undoubtedly has a ready reply on his lips, in the form of the alexandrine: "The cannon of the Gascons never retreat." However, NATO's fighter-bombers are no officers of Gascony [region in southwest France]. They obey regulations which are not as clear as one might have liked to think they were on Wednesday evening in the Belgian capital. In order to launch an air strike once the ultimatum deadline has passed, in 10 days' time, or before, or even very soon if necessary, if the Serbs use their mortars once again, one order is needed from French UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander General Cot, and another order must come from the operational commander at NATO, U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda. However, both of these orders must be approved by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. All of this is possible. All of this has been provided for. However, it remains the case that the UN secretary general only derives his authority from the Security Council, and that one UN resolution may quite evidently cancel out another. The Russians lost no time. Just several hours after the Brussels "ultimatum," they -- quite legitimately, in the light of their permanent member status -- called an emergency meeting of the Security Council, with the clear objective of saying that they do not really see why NATO -- to which they do not belong -- should have become the executive body, the armed wing, of the United Nations. It is hardly likely that the Beijing government of China, another permanent member of the Security Council, which also has a right of veto, will oppose the arguments put forward by Moscow. At the same time, the Bosnian Serbs have already found another answer. When Alain Juppe launched another appeal in favor of a political settlement, once more asking the United States to become more closely involved in French diplomatic efforts, Mr. Radovan Karadzic laid down a precondition for any continuation of negotiations in Geneva, namely that an international inquiry be held to establish who had really been responsible for the massacre that occurred at the central market in Sarajevo. This constituted a roundabout way of pointing a finger at the Bosnians. Impudent though this may be, the tactic is not lacking in astuteness. While Bill Clinton has suddenly managed to find some virtue in the French position that he contested just a week ago, this is only because his public opinion would not have conceded that he remained indifferent to the unbearable images broadcast all day long on television in households across the United States. Is nothing easier to do than turn around U.S. opinion?
