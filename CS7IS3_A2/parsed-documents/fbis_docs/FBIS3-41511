Economic development, population growth, and higher consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of development and urbanization, as well as the development of village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and ecological damage accompanying our economic development have increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our economic and social development. In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award ceremony for the world's ``top 500'' were held in Beijing. The event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental protection. In environmental protection, China has always been in the front ranks of developing countries. Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of civilization: -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country, with the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture experimental units of various types and size. As early as the beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as ``the world's best ecological project.'' -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes [waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the up-to-standard rate, remarkably. -- China's urban environmental situation has improved remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to various urban air pollution control measures. China's environmental protection has unique features, which have attracted the attention of the Third World. Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development According to relevant departments, our country should soberly assess its current status of environment protection, despite its tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects, especially ``wholly or partly foreign-owned'' construction projects in development zones, continued to develop new pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact assessments, and the ``simultaneous construction of projects and facilities to control three wastes.'' Pollution in village and town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general level of industrial pollution increased. In 1992, 36.6 billion tonnes of waste water was released across the country, up 9 percent from 1991; this figure does not cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste water released last year was significantly higher than that discharged in the preceding year. Although the water quality in the main course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite serious near the river banks in sections that run through the major cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only 41 percent of the 38,000 km stretches of the seven major rivers and inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48 percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in 80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution. Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state limits. Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected. The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5 May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we were given a warning of ecological destruction. The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation, desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely halted. Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93 million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest, north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60 percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5 billion yuan annually. The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental Protection Wave in 1993 Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never before had our country set up environmental protection committees under both the government and the NPC. On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau released the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike in the past when enterprises were allocated ``spots'' in order of their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and medium enterprises which had previously been considered ``efficient'' were on the list. The move caused quite a stir throughout the country.
