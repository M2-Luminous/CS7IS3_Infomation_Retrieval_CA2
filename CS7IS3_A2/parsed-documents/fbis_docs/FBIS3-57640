In an interview for a UNIAN correspondent on the occasion of this date the BSF commander said that he comes out against the fleet's politicization. According to the admiral, despite a number of agreements reached by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, the status of the fleet remains suspended thus giving rise to problems as far as the material basis and the personnel are concerned. Eduard Baltin pointed out that the preservation of the Black Sea Fleet as a combat unit and an outpost on the borders of the Commonwealth countries are regarded by him as a priority at the present stage. The BSF commander is anxiously waiting for the heads of the two states to find a solution acceptable to both sides.
