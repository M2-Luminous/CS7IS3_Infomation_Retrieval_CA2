The SDP's decision is an angry reaction to the abrupt establishment of a parliamentary group that excludes the socialists. In a statement issued after a meeting early today, SDP Chairman Toriichi Murayamua said that the formation of such a group infringed upon the relationship of trust among the coalition parties. The 130-member parliamentary alliance named "Kaishin" (Renovation) includes the Shinseito Party, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Jiyuto (Liberals) and Kaikaku No Kai. This new group will be the largest force in the coalition and will have more members than the SDP. Hata earlier today invited the SDP to remain in the coalition, while defending the formation of the parliamentary group. "Unless we have such a group, coalition parties will not be able to cope with the difficult problems and act in solidarity," Hata said. Several meetings were being held this morning to discuss the situation after the SDP announced it was quitting the coalition. Hata's policy speech to the Diet scheduled for Tuesday afternoon has been postponed because of the delay in forming a new government. A large-scale reshuffling of the cabinet now seems unavoidable since the SDP held six cabinet posts in former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition cabinet.
