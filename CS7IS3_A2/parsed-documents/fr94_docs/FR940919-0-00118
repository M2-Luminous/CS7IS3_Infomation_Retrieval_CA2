Recoverable levels or mercury contained in soil PART 268_LAND DISPOSAL RESTRICTIONS 18. The authority citation for Part 268 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6921, and 6924. Subpart A_General 19. In §268.1, paragraphs (c)(3)(ii), (e)(4), and (e)(5) are revised, and paragraph (c)(3)(iii) is added, to read as follows: §268.1 Purpose, scope and applicability. * * * * * (c)␣*␣*␣* (3)␣*␣*␣* (ii) Do not exhibit any prohibited characteristic of hazardous waste at the point of injection; and (iii) If at the point of generation the injected wastes include D001 High TOC subcategory wastes or D012&hyph;D017 pesticide wastes that are prohibited under §148.17(c) of this chapter, those wastes have been treated to meet the treatment standards of §268.40 before injection. * * * * * (e) * * * (4) De minimis losses to wastewater treatment systems of commercial chemical product or chemical intermediates that are ignitable (D001), corrosive (D002), or are organic constituents that exhibit the characteristic of toxicity (D012&hyph;D043), and that contain underlying hazardous constituents as defined in §268.2(i), are not considered to be prohibited wastes. De minimis is defined as losses from normal material handling operations (e.g. spills from the unloading or transfer of materials from bins or other containers, leaks from pipes, valves or other devices used to transfer materials); minor leaks of process equipment, storage tanks or containers; leaks from well-maintained pump packings and seals; sample purgings; and relief device discharges; discharges from safety showers and rinsing and cleaning of personal safety equipment; and rinsate from empty containers or from containers that are rendered empty by that rinsing; or (5) Land disposal prohibitions for hazardous characteristic wastes do not apply to laboratory wastes displaying the characteristic of ignitability (D001), corrosivity (D002), or organic toxicity (D012_D043), that are mixed with other plant wastewaters at facilities whose ultimate discharge is subject to regulation under the CWA (including wastewaters at facilities which have eliminated the discharge of wastewater), provided that the annualized flow of laboratory wastewater into the facility's headworks does not exceed one per cent, or provided that the laboratory wastes' combined annualized average concentration does not exceed one part per million in the facility's headworks. 20. In §268.2, paragraphs (g) and (i) are revised to read as follows: §268.2 Definitions applicable in this part. * * * * * (g) Debris means solid material exceeding a 60 mm particle size that is intended for disposal and that is: A manufactured object; or plant or animal matter; or natural geologic material. However, the following materials are not debris: Any material for which a specific treatment standard is provided in Subpart D, Part 268, namely lead acid batteries, cadmium batteries, and radioactive lead solids; Process residuals such as smelter slag and residues from the treatment of waste, wastewater, sludges, or air emission residues; and Intact containers of hazardous waste that are not ruptured and that retain at least 75% of their original volume. A mixture of debris that has not been treated to the standards provided by §268.45 and other material is subject to regulation as debris if the mixture is comprised primarily of debris, by volume, based on visual inspection. * * * * * (i) Underlying hazardous constituent means any constituent listed in §268.48, Table UTS_Universal Treatment Standards, except zinc, which can reasonably be expected to be present at the point of generation of the hazardous waste, at a concentration above the constituent-specific UTS treatment standard.
