The only thing that it does for the overseas firm is to manufacture components for the distribution of high voltage power, and these components have nothing to do with the actual nuclear operation. The spokesman also mentioned a project in a preparatory stage of the [word illegible] of fuel rods for nuclear reactors. In this instance, too, we deal purely with engineering production. The talks with the German firm Siemens then pertain only to the manufacture of turbines. The spokesman was responding in this manner to speculation that these firms are trying through Skoda to reach Iran with their nuclear technology, which laws in their own countries do not facilitate. Nevertheless, official circles in Israel have expressed concern about such a danger. Jaroslav Hudec again recalled that the discussion about nuclear power generation was also on the agenda during the visit to Iran by Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek. The Czech Foreign Ministry was informed in advance about these talks with the provision that all these discussions are of a fact-finding nature only. Any steps in this direction will be taken, according to the spokesman, in accordance with the laws in effect.
