In the conversations and talks between the leaders of the two states, which passed in an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding and trust, note was made of the need to strengthen further friendly relations and to deepen interstate cooperation in all fields. The presidents informed one another about the sociopolitical situation in their countries, and there was discussion of a broad range of issues of mutual interest. The sides exchanged views on the current situation in Central Asia, the CIS, and also on a number of international problems. During the talks note was made of the important role of the accords reached in January 1993 at the Tashkent meeting of heads of Central Asian states, which opened up major prospects in deepening integrational processes. The heads of both states stressed the particular importance of observing the principles of the inviolability of the existing borders between the two states, and spoke in support of constructive efforts in ensuring peace and stability in Central Asia, and primarily on sections of the Tajik-Afghan border. Fundamental accords were reached on the further expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation between the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and a mutual intention to foster the economic integration of the countries of the region was reaffirmed. Kyrgyz President Akayev gave a high assessment of the treaty on creating a single economic area between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Republic of Uzbekistan of 10 January 1994, and announced the decision of the leadership of the Kyrgyz Republic to join this treaty, with the consent of the sides. The treaty on the creation of a single economic area makes provision for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor on the territory of the states which are party to the treaty, and ensures coordinated credit, accounting, budget, tax, pricing, customs, and currency policies between them. The new decision to unite the economic efforts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan makes provision for the abolition of customs examination of the baggage and hand luggage of citizens of these countries on entering and leaving their borders, and also the abolition of customs duties and the gradual reduction of taxes, duties, and other kinds of restrictions. With a view to simplifying the clearing of mutual payments to the national banks of the said countries, clearing chambers will be opened in the capitals, and branches in other towns of their countries, together with currency exchange outlets. The sides noted in particular that the treaty on the creation of a single economic area is fully in line with the treaty on the creation of an economic union of the CIS, and represents a new level of economic integration among the independent states. Uzbek President Islam Karimov stressed that the openness of the treaty on the creation of a single economic area is an important prerequisite for expanding mutually advantageous cooperation and developing the effectiveness of economic relations between the sovereign states. The following agreements were signed between the governments of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic: on trade and economic cooperation for 1994; on organizing accounts in 1994; on deepening cooperation in the field of culture, health care, science and education, tourism, and sports; and a protocol on making amendments and additions to the agreement on non-trade payments. The sides agreed to deepen further cooperation in issues relating to environmental protection, and in this connection they made special note of the importance of the fundamental decisions, taken at the conference of heads of state of Central Asia and the Russian Federation in the town of Nukus on 11 January 1994, on the problems of the Aral Sea and the Aral basin aimed at coordinating efforts and deepening cooperation in this sphere. During the talks an accord was reached on further developing the treaty and legal foundation between the two friendly states.
