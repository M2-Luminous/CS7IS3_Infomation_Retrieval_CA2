Nakasone, who is on a tour of the United States, told reporters that such an alliance would best suit the current political situation. ``If the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is like that, policy (alliance) among new conservatives, liberals, and, if necessary, centrist forces, may be appropriate,'' he said, referring to the second-largest opposition SDP's departure from the ruling coalition in April that left the first minority government in decades. His remarks were viewed by observers as an indication of acceptance of a coalition with centrist forces such as Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) -- and even with some SDP right-wingers. Nakasone, a kingpin of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is known as a staunch conservative and has been leery of leftist socialists. It is well known that Nakasone is seeking a coalition between the LDP and its splinter party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, as envisaged by Shinseito strategist Ichiro Ozawa and the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister. But his latest remarks appear to show he is tilting toward a coalition which includes some liberal and centrist forces for at least the current period of transition, according to observers. Nakasone also said that political realignment will progress in the coming months in line with the political stance of the parties.
