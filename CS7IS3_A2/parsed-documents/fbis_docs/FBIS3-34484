Moti Trotosh, Union of Chambers of Commerce vice president, said the delegation includes private businessmen who came for purely business purposes, but in his opinion this visit will be followed by political contacts. According to Mr. Trotosh the delegation will mainly deal with energy related deals, because after the contacts with Qatar on this issue new vistas have been opened to Israel in the gas and oil sphere. The Saudis are also examining trade possibilities after peace agreements are signed.
