"Companies themselves will decide what exchange rate they will use to settle their debts on the account. It is untenable that differences from changes in the exchange rates be paid from the state budget," Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said on his return from the economic forum in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, where he also met Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. The possibility of companies paying the differences, on which both premiers agreed, is only one option. "Companies can agree on compensation through supplies of goods, or each paying half the difference," Moravcik said. He admitted that Slovak companies would be the losers. The account's abolition must be approved by both countries' parliaments. Moravcik said it could take effect as of August 1 if sufficient legislation is found to serve as a basis for the step. He admitted that the account might be abolished after the autumn Parliament elections in Slovakia, because in contrast to the Slovak Parliament, the Czech one will be holding its last session in July. Moravcik said that he considered it important that the Czech side had promised it would not "begin any initiative" to abolish the mutual clearing account from the customs union. That does not mean that mutual payment agreements could not be improved if either side wants to change something, he added.
