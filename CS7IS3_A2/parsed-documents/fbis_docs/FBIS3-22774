But he explained the matter in a different way. He said Pakistan had attained complete nuclear ability including the development of delivery system of the bomb to its target alongwith the ability for manufacturing the required number of devices at the time of need. Addressing a gathering of lawyers and journalists at a local hotel arranged by Manzoor Qadir Advocate, he said on the occasion of taking the decision for halting the nuclear programme, Pakistan had full knowledge of India's nuclear ability as well as the number of devices it had. He said at that time Pakistan was in a position to respond to India on atomic front. He said the capping of nuclear programme meant that the manufacturing of the devices should be halted. But the development of nuclear technology and the delivery system should be continued. Replying to a question, he said be had no knowledge that Benazir Bhutto had provided any help to Rajiv Gandhi during his tenure as COAS. Answering another question, he rejected the perception that Pakistan Army was involved in making and breaking the governments in the country. He said the Opposition and ruling party politicians had been trying always to drag the Army into the polities for cover-up to their misdeeds. He pointed out that only General Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan and General Zia had willingly interfered in politics. He said now the thinking of the Army had changed and the Armed Forces would never seize power in future. He said if the politicians strengthened the democratic process in the country the little interference of Army into the political affairs would also come to an end. He said be would soon decide to take part in politics. He said either he would float his own party or would join some political party of the country. However, he said he would make this announcement from Lahore. He said he would create a leadership from grass-roots level as the problems of 95 per cent of the poor and middle class could not be addressed by the privileged class in power. He said the return of the representatives of the poor and middle class in the assemblies was necessary to resolve the acute problems of the country. He said he wanted to see the people in power and that was why he had refused to take over the country in August 1988. He said if the present confrontation continued the people would soon get fed up with the politicians. He said the politicians lack vision necessary to run the government.
