FBIS4-1412 "drafr082_cs94005" FBIS-AFR-94-082-S Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA IEC Orders Urgent Printing of 5.4 Million Ballots IEC Orders Urgent Printing of 5.4 Million Ballots Regional Official Comments on Shortage MB2704165494 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1556 GMT 27 Apr 94 MB2704165494 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] East London April 27 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] on Wednesday [27 April] ordered the urgent printing of four million extra ballot papers for the Eastern Cape region, said regional monitoring director Mark Anstey. Earlier, several polling stations in the region were shut down because of a lack of ballot papers and boxes and an Independent Electoral Commission official described the position as "extremely serious". Speaking to representatives of political parties and international observer missions in a long and often angry meeting at IEC headquarters in East London, Mr Anstey promised a full investigation into the reasons for the shortages. "It appears the national plan simply underestimated the volume of equipment and resources for the (voting) exercise," he said. There was simply no national reserve of ballot papers, he said. Appealing for parties' co-operation, he said some areas had become "fairly volatile" and warned tensions could rise when voters found themselves temporarily unable to cast their votes. There had already been an incident in Mdantsane on Wednesday when an impatient crowd became angry and troops had to be called in to secure the polling station. IEC Eastern Cape spokesman Mr Mike Chandler said South African Defence Force helicopters had been seconded to take voting materials to the transkei. Voting boxes from previous elections were being taken out of home affairs storerooms and pressed into service. Mr Anstey said the four million extra ballot papers, including the Inkatha Freedom Party's listing, would be ready by Thursday morning. They were being produced by Port Elizabeth firms which would not be identified for security reasons. All IEC sub-regions had been told to gear themselves to collect the ballot papers early on Thursday morning. The under-supply of papers was so general that a redistribution of papers from less-heavily used polling stations was "simply not feasible". Mr Anstey said it was the IEC's intention that everyone would vote and he asked party representatives to spread the word that steps were being taken to ensure this. "By tomorrow (Thursday) we believe we will be back on track," he said. Provincial electoral officer Mr Dirk van Schalkwyk told the meeting it was clear the regional population figures used by the IEC were "completely under-estimated". He had pointed this out a long time ago, he said. Party representatives at the meeting gave their approval to the printing and distribution of the extra ballot papers but said they were concerned about the security of the printing process. IEC representatives said they would try to ensure that international monitors, rather than party representatives, oversaw the printing. ANC representative Mr Hintsa Siwisa said the lack of ballot papers was not the only problem causing concern to his party. The ANC had discussed its problems, including irregularities committed by electoral officers, with the IEC on Tuesday night, but they were still occurring on Wednesday. The ANC was becoming ever more convinced there was a "conscious effort at undermining the process", he said. Mr Chandler said earlier on Wednesday a decision by some district electoral officers in the Transkei to unilaterally increase the number of polling stations had added to the organisational problems. The IEC had 1797 stations on its books for the territory and had supplied voting materials for this number. "Today it appears there are more than 2,000. That's bloody ludicrous," he said. "We can't supply them." People who had turned up to vote and been unable to do so were understandably angry, he said.
