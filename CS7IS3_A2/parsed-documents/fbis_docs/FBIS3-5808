The report pointed out that Kim Yong-sam has done next to nothing to end human rights violations and enumerated human rights violation cases in detail. The report said South Korean peace activist Kim Sam-sok and his sister, Kim Un-chu, were beaten and sexually assaulted by the Agency for National Security Planning after their arrest on national security charges in September, 1993. It was a just denunciation and protest on the Kim Yong-sam puppet group which, under the cloak of a so-called civilian-led regime, has turned South Korea into a barren land devoid of human rights. As everyone knows, traitor Kim Yong-sam took office a year ago raving that he would make South Korea a more democratic society and resolve the human rights issue. Nonetheless, the current situation in South Korea clearly shows that it was an imposture of a political prostitute who attempted to win the people's favor by hiding the rebellious nature of the treacherous regime that has changed its nameplate from a dictatorial system to a civilian one. In order to make South Korea a democratic society and resolve the human rights issue, the National Security Law, the most vicious law in the world, and other fascist evil laws should be abolished first and foremost. The Agency for National Security Planning; the Defense Security Command; and other suppressive organs, which are the breeding center of human rights violations, should be dissolved as well. Raving about human rights while keeping intact the evil laws and suppressive organs that systematically and physically infringe upon human rights is in fact preposterous. However, traitor Kim Yong-sam, saying he will carry out reforms, left intact all the evil laws and went so far as to enhance the suppressive organs' role. Under such conditions, the patriotic students and the people who called for independence, democracy, and reunification have been mercilessly suppressed by the police and put behind bars. Workers who called for the right to live have been trampled under the puppet soldiers' combat shoes. Until last October, compared to the same period of No Tae-u's early days in office, the number of students and people who have been arrested invoking National Security Law has increased by 2.5 times. This fact clearly reveals how malicious the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique's suppressive maneuvers are. In addition, the innocent people have been terrorized in broad daylight and patriotic students have been kidnapped only to be found in a deep valley or at sea as corpses. Universities and work places have been raided by the police and those who have different ideologies have been arrested and executed. Brutal medieval-type torture, such as sleep and water deprivation and sexual assaults, are openly carried out in South Korea. All of these can only be committed in South Korea. According to materials, approximately 340 people are wanted by the South Korean police and there are now some 300 long-term prisoners. Among them, there are long-term prisoners who have spent their days in a cell for 42 or 44 years. Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who advertised himself as being a civilian-led government's leader, is an infringer of human rights, surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators who gained notoriety for their military dictatorship. South Korea is an area in which human rights is infringed upon and a living hell in which no one can live. This notwithstanding, the fascist clique did not stop there and raved that it is acceptable to proceed with torture on political detainees. In doing so, they encourage human butchers to commit brutal torture and killings. The fact that traitor Kim Yong-sam clamors about his so-called respect for human rights and democratic development is nothing but a sophistry to hide his ugly color as a ringleader of human rights violations. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a wolf in a lamb's skin. The reason why human right violations are openly committed in South Korea is because the present regime has sprung from the deep root of the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military dictators. It is self-evident that the Kim Yong-sam regime, which has sprung from the deep root of the military dictatorial regimes, can only but take the road of human rights violation. The Kim Yong-sam regime is a succeeding regime of the Sixth Republic. At a time when human rights is most valued around the world, how can a brutal human rights situation be permitted in South Korea? Amnesty International's indication that nothing has been done to improve the human rights condition in South Korea is just. As long as South Korea remains as a U.S. colonial country and traitor Kim Yong-sam holds power, South Korea's human rights situation will never be improved. As a crazy dog should only be caught after being beaten to death with a stick, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which runs amok in trampling on human rights and committing manslaughter, will receive a stern trial of the history. The South Korean people will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam ring, a fascist tyranny for the century.
