Both bills were drafted on the basis of the principles which were thoroughly discussed by parliament. Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists after the meeting that the bill on security services defines the basic framework of their activity and basic forms of coordination between them and additionally states the way the services are to be made accountable. In this sense it is an umbrella law of global nature and serves as a basis for another law on the BIS, Klaus said. He confirmed that the government had agreed with a proposal by its Legislative Council that BIS installations are guarded by policemen and not by counter-intelligence members. Klaus described as a considerable positive shift the fact that, apart from general control, the new law would make security services less accountable to parliament and more to the government. To entrust a security service with a task was basically a matter of the government and president, with the president entrusting security services with tasks through the government, Klaus said.
