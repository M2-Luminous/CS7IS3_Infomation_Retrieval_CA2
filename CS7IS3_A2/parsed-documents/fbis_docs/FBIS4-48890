Meeting with Bunbei Hara, president of the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his wife and their party, Qiao said China and Japan are close neighbors, adding: "We are pleased to note that the two countries have enjoyed very good relations." The two countries have exchanged frequent visits and conducted a wide range of exchanges in the fields of politics, economy and culture, he said. Qiao said the constant strengthening of bilateral friendship and cooperation will be an important contribution to peace in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the rest of the world. Looking towards the 21st century, he said, the influence exerted by such friendship and cooperation will become greater, adding that "It is our hope that an unpleasant period in history will never appear." Referring to China's economy, Qiao said that over the past few years, China has accelerated its economy. But there still exists a gap between China and Japan in the level of development because China, as a vast country with a large population, cannot experience development all at once. China is willing to further its cooperation with Japan although it will mainly rely on its own efforts in its economic development and do its utmost to develop its economy under a stable environment. He stressed that it is of great importance for China to conduct varied ways of cooperation with countries all over the world including Japan. Hara said he was particularly glad to visit China for the first time. He said China has a history of several thousand years which has exerted a great influence on Japan's culture. At present, he said, China is implementing the policy of reform and opening to the outside world, and its economy has grown quickly. He expressed the hope that both Japan and China will advance hand in hand and further push forward bilateral ties and exchanges and cooperation between the Japanese House of Councillors and Chinese NPC. Hara, aged 81, mentioned the unfortunate period in the history of Sino-Japanese relations, stressing that it is imperative for Japan to earnestly search its soul in this regard. Aside from this, the most important thing for Japan to do is to look towards the future and develop its cooperation with China. During the meeting, Hara invited Qiao to visit Japan. Qiao thanked him for the invitation. This evening, Qiao gave a dinner in honor of Hara and his wife and their party. Present at the two occasions were Qiao's wife Yu Wen, and Wang Bingqian and Cao Zhi, respectively vice-chairman and secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee. Hara and his party arrived here this afternoon for an official goodwill visit to China as Qiao's guests. They will also tour Xian, Shanghai and Suzhou after their visit in Beijing.
