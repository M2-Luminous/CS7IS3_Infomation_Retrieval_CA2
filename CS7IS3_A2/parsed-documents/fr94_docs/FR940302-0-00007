FR940302-0-00007 FR940302-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;6] Modification of Class E Airspace, Hayden, CO AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E Airspace at Yampa Valley Airport, Hayden, Colorado. The airspace was described incorrectly, using a magnetic radial instead of a true radial, and cited the Yampa Valley Airport instead of the Craig Moffat Airport. Therefore, controlled airspace as depicted on aeronautical charts does not currently encompass the instrument approach procedure at the Craig Moffat Airport. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' DATES: Effective date: March 2, 1994. Comment date: Comments must be received before March 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the rule to: Manager, Airspace & Procedures Branch, ANM&hyph;530, FAA Docket 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;6, Federal Aviation Administration, 1601 Lind Ave., SW., Renton, WA 98055&hyph;4056. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, FAA Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;6, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments on the Rule Although this action is in the form of a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the rule. The FAA will use the comments submitted, together with other available information to review the regulation. If the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings to amend the regulation. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. History The Hayden, Colorado, Class E airspace was designated to contain an instrument approach procedure in controlled airspace from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth at Craig Moffat Airport. It was incorrectly published under the Yampa Valley Airport title, and the airspace information incorrectly lists a magnetic radial instead of a ``true'' radial. Accordingly, neither the airspace designation nor the aeronautical chart depiction reflect the controlled airspace. Currently, IFR pilots are not afforded controlled airspace in which to conduct instrument flight rules procedures to the Craig Moffat Airport. Similarly, VFR pilots do not have correct references for controlled airspace. Any matter which adversely affects aeronautical safety requires immediate corrective action in the interest of flight safety. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to public interest, and the FAA finds good cause, pursuant to 5 U.S.C., 553(d) for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the order.
