As a rule, there is no smoke without fire. So, a scan of the Russian press has straightaway made it evident that this information arose from the head of the Belgorod Oblast administration's resolution on steps to implement the law of the Russian Federation of 1 April 1993 on the Russian Federation's state border. This resolution envisages the establishment of a border zone up to 5 km deep on the territories of a number of Belgorod Oblast rayons, with the depth of the zone to be measured from the former administrative border between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, and the introduction of a border regime from as early as 1 January 1994. So what is it that Russia is building? [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Regrettably, we failed to obtain information from officials, as both the leadership of the Grayvoron border post and Belgorod border detachment declined interviews. The builders, however, were more open. [Unidentified interviewee] The construction of a customs passage between Ukraine and Russia is under way here. It is a complex of dwellings for border guards and border posts for the passage of motor transport. [Correspondent] How intensive is the work being done here? [Interviewee] Very intensive. [Correspondent] When will you have to finish it? [Interviewee] Well, some time at the end of March or beginning of April. [end recording] [passage omitted]
