At a meeting on 15 March, certain difficulties and problems arose, which hindered the demobilization of some of the 3-80 Northern Front's fighters -- a demobilization scheduled for 16 March. These people need to rejoin civilian life because these peasants do not have... [pauses] they live in abject poverty; they have no place to live; and so on. They have been hoping that the government will give each of them a small plot of land, enough to survive, and that they will be given technical and financial assistance, as was agreed in past negotiations. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, who represents the government in these talks, said he was acting in good faith, but he noted that decisions are made in Managua. He added that the land problem had to be resolved in Managua and reviewed in Managua with various ministers -- I think specifically with Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo. In turn, today we suspended the surrender of weapons of 150-200 combatants. The government and the 3-80 Northern Front agreed to discuss this issue in Managua over the next four days. We have a representative there who is talking to the government in an effort to find a way for the government to buy or give plots of land to these peasants to allow them to rejoin civilian life the day they surrender their rifles. This has to be done so they can start working. [Diaz] How did Minister Mendieta explain the fact that the government is now claiming it is unable to keep its promise, especially given that, when the first 100 men surrendered their weapons, he said the government would indeed comply and that it was capable of complying? [Talavera] There is problem; there is a problem with the central government. I do not know whether President Violeta Chamorro has failed to authorize all of the available resources to ensure that all demobilized 3-80 Northern Front commando units rejoin civilian life. Nevertheless, we are witnessing a huge difference between promises and actions. This creates distrust among those peasants planning to demobilized. They are conveying these feelings to us. These people were prepared to demobilize today. They told us they were very disappointed in the government because they were extremely interested in surrendering their rifles, rejoining civilian life, and farming the land. I do not know whether the failure to comply was caused by a lack of maturity or responsibility on behalf of the government. The government has failed to comply with a promise it is completely capable of complying with. We know perfectly well that it has funds. The government spends a lot of money on other less important areas. This, however, should be a high priority area, because peace would be established throughout northern Nicaragua. All of these combatants would be contributing to the country's economy. [Reporter] Why are negotiations not being held in Managua with the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] Higher Council, instead of here in Caulatu? [Talavera] We are working on that. We will see if the government allows us to hold the next meeting in Managua to put an end to this phase of violence in northern Nicaragua. If this happens, we will have a chance to talk with members of the cabinet, and the ministers can come up with solutions for these people to enable them to finally rejoin society. [Reporter] Do you need the government's permission to go to Managua? [Talavera] Obviously we need the government's permission, as stipulated in the agreements. [Reporter] [words indistinct] [Talavera] Yes, international observers have limitations too. They have told us that without the central government's permission, they cannot transfer from here to Managua any combatant of the 3-80 Northern Front who has not demobilized or who does not have an I.D. card issued to demobilized members. It is the government's responsibility. [Reporter] Do you not feel like a prisoner in these enclaves? [Talavera] Not really. Of course, I believe there is some disadvantage in holding the negotiations in this area instead of in Managua, where talks would have more coverage. If that were the case, the government would have to be more sensitive to national and international repercussions because we would have more chances to talk with domestic and foreign journalists. This could benefit us in the sense that, although it is feasible to find a peaceful solution for violence in the northern region, this subject has not been accorded the importance it deserves. [Reporter] What if the government does not allow you to go to Managua to conduct this phase of the negotiations? [Talavera] I believe this is something the government can do. If there is real willingness, I believe the government will permit a delegation of the 3-80 Northern Front staff to travel to Managua to follow up on the negotiations and put an end to violence in northern Nicaragua. The government has the last word. We in the 3-80 Northern Front are willing to lay down our weapons, but we demand compliance with the agreements. We hope the agreements do not turn out to be empty promises, as in previous years with the RN. [Reporter] Commander Chacal, the RN Higher Council will meet with the economic cabinet tomorrow. What actions will the RN Higher Council take on your behalf to expedite your demobilization? [Talavera] They have plans. They will have the chance to meet with several cabinet members. We have confidence in the representatives of the RN Higher Council. This will be their first opportunity to review the RN's problems in general. They have our confidence and our full support. We hope the government will listen to them, and that it will not merely make empty promises as it has done in the past. We hope specific agreements will be reached tomorrow at the meeting with representatives of the RN Higher Council.
