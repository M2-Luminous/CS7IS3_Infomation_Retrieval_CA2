Government Ministry sources told LOS TIEMPOS on 7 February that the project to buy land from the peasants was proposed by the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada during the latest meeting of the World Bank Consultative Group for Bolivia late last year. The sources said: "This option was proposed by the negotiating commission that went to Washington to the international community as a start of the Zero Option project." They said the administration is seriously studying the idea of buying from the thousands of peasants "their land" used for growing coca. The sources added: "The offer of $2,000 for every hectare cleared of coca made by the previous government to Chapare peasants, with a bonus of $500 per tract of land cleared of coca is not an empty proposal." The sources indicated that the government is willing to pay up to $2,500 per hectare of coca to each peasant. They added: "This means a farmer with 5,000 hectare for example, will have the possibility of getting approximately $10,000 per hectare for the land he puts up for sale." [sentence as published] President Sanchez de Lozada decided to implement this project which was labeled "Zero Option" but the project is subject to international financing for its implementation in the medium-term.
