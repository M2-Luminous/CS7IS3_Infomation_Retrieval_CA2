The development zone and the real estate boom, that emerged in the province last year, have been brought under control. Forty-five development zones in the province have been reduced and 1,000 mu of land occupied by the development zones have been withdrawn. The trend in which development zones wantonly occupy and build cultivated areas has basically been brought under control. In the latter half of last year, the province also generally straightened out the land occupied by the on-going projects, carried out the land registration work, and straightened out the real estate companies of the land departments. The province has straightened out 18,000 cases relating to the land occupied by the on-going projects, investigated and handled 3,000 cases of illegal use of land, and withdrew 2,070 mu of land. Simultaneously, the system of paid use of land has been carried out across the province. As of the end of last year, the rights to using 19,000 mu of state-owned land were sold and 1.8 billion yuan were earned from this. This has become the new financial resources for local governments. Last year, the province cut trees and developed land on 250,000 mu, including 130,000 mu of cultivated areas. This figure is roughly equal to that of the land for construction. Thus, the good trend of balancing the increase and the decrease in the cultivated areas has continuously been maintained. At the conference, Xiao Zuofu, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of the provincial government, made a speech entitled "Strengthen Land Management, Deepen the Reform of the Land Utilization System, and Accelerate the Inspection of the Land Development Situation." He set forth: In 1994, we should comprehensively carry out the paid utilization of the urban state-owned land; and gradually expand, on a trial basis, the paid utilization of the rural collective-owned areas. The enterprises that carry out the shareholding system on a trial basis should embody the principle of paid use of land. The land for construction use should gradually be distributed according to the orientation of the market. The land marketing forms should be dominated by inviting tenders and auctioning. We should try by every possible means to reduce the negotiation of land forms.
