As the practice has always been between the two leaders, consultation on all issues related to Arab issues becomes a duty, particularly when important issues are raised in the Arab arena.

I hope that the efforts of our two leaders in both countries play an influential role in keeping the peace and the security of our Arab nation and our two brotherly peoples.
