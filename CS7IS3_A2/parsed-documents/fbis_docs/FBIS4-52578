The farm sector will remain an important factor because it is still the main source of income for the Indonesian people. President Suharto stressed this point at a ceremony held in the State Palace, Jakarta, when he presented honors to winners of the 1993 national intensification contest on Thursday (10 February). Mrs. Tien Suharto, Vice President Try Sutrisno and Mrs. Try Sutrisno, several members of the Sixth Development Cabinet and Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin Baharsjah were present at the ceremony.

Primary Source The president stressed that efforts to increase farmers' incomes is no less important than other initiatives. During PJPT II the farm sector will continue to be the primary source of income for most Indonesians. At the same time, along with the increase in population and the increase in people's income, the demand for farm products is also increasing. On the other hand, these developments reduce the amount of farm land. "That is why we must be able to increase the ability of farmers to raise the scale of their farm enterprises through the development of group farm enterprises through the application of various aspects of agribusiness and agroindustry," the Head of State said. These measures, said the Head of State, must also be matched by an increase in the role of the KUD in servicing farm production, capital and marketing. It is hoped that these efforts will give an increased value to farm enterprises oriented toward agribusiness. In addition, to raise social well-being on a broad scale in the years to come, the president continued, the farm sector must continue to be developed along with the development of the populace so that the agricultural sector can continue to play its role and will be able to supply the food needs of the entire population of Indonesia. The agricultural sector must also be capable of providing an incentive for the growth of domestic and export industries, as well as take part in producing equitable growth and in increasing village dynamics. The president also stressed that sustaining self-support in food must at the same time be directed toward increasing the quality of nutrients that people consume. That is why self-sufficiency is not limited to just rice but also covers diversification of food production and consumption. Once again the president stressed, "no less important is increasing farmers' incomes". He suggested that raising the living standards of farmers, the largest sector of society, has been in the center of the developmental battlefield from the start. That is also why the field of agriculture always gets the most attention. But he admitted that developing agriculture is not an easy task which can be carried out quickly. The development of agriculture requires perseverance and takes a long time. The president said that development efforts have yielded satisfactory results, proved by ever-increasing farm production which has resulted in self-sufficiency. The president hopes that we can continue these initiatives and at the same time try to increase farmers' income so as to decrease the number of farmers living below the poverty line. At the same time, Agriculture Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah said that the goal of these activities is to provide the farmers' groups and the KUDs with the greater motivation and energy needed to persevere, and be diligent and energetic. It is hoped that the heads of development-unit agencies and BIMAS [Mass Guidance] managers will increase their cooperation in developing and servicing the KUDs and the farmers. Moreover, it will encourage the cooperation and partnership between farmers who participate in farmers' groups with KUDs and development companies [as published]. He also said that these measures will also increase farmers' production, income. .
