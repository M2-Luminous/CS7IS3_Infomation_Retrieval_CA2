We end this bulletin with this interview. Good night and may God keep. [Correspondent] Please be so kind as to tell us about the reasons behind the new decisions, announced last night, adopted by Article Three, Clause 29 committee. [sentence as heard] ['Adeli] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. In view of the new possibilities established after the negotiations that we carried out with our foreign commercial partners, and in view of the fact that the banking system will be able to open letters of credit, and the fact that the new letters of credit issued during 1373 [beginning 21 March 94] will be paid at the appropriate time -- and, again, in view of the fact that we were also finding that some importers were turning to the open market for foreign exchange and that this was leading to an increase in the exchange rate, we came to the conclusion that there was no longer any reason why -- bearing in mind the new possibilities -- we should allow open market transactions to raise the exchange rate. A new decision was therefore adopted, according to which all importers will be able to carry out their work in the normal way, that is, via the banking system. [Correspondent] Dr. 'Adeli, what difference, on the whole, is there between these new decisions and the previous ones? ['Adeli] In fact, the new decisions represent no changes from the previous ones; it is rather the case that they are in line with previous decisions, where the idea was that we should limit demand on the open market for foreign exchange. These new decisions are in keeping with that idea and, with these decisions, a number of new ways have been foreseen for limiting demand on the open market for foreign exchange. The new decisions have two aspects: First, from now on all foreign exchange transactions relating to imports into the country will take place exclusively via the banking system and no one will be allowed to go to the open market for their foreign exchange. This is in line with the general policy that the government has been following during recent months; that is, limiting demand on the foreign exchange market. The second aspect relates to the question of imports in exchange for exports. Previously, this existed in a formal sense only and, in reality, it was enough for an importer to purchase an authorization for exports and then go to the open market himself and buy foreign exchange. From now on, this process will be ruled out and an importer will now either have to purchase his foreign exchange from the banking system or he must buy actual foreign exchange from an exporter; that is, as long as an exporter's foreign exchange has not entered into the banking system, the exporter will not be allowed to sell it. In other words, the previous deposit slips that were bought and sold before can only be sold now along with the actual foreign exchange -- it will be actual foreign exchange that is bought and sold. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] One of the points referred to in the recent announcement of the new decisions was the issue of controlling foreign exchange rate fluctuations. To what extent do you think the new decisions will succeed in keeping the foreign exchange rate under control? ['Adeli] It seems to us that importers who previously purchased foreign exchange on the market in order to send it abroad will, henceforth, be prevented from carrying out their transactions, because, if they buy foreign exchange on the open market, their imported goods will not be cleared from customs. Second, it has been stated that if someone buys foreign exchange on the open market and sends it abroad, that will be viewed as smuggling. In other words, sending foreign exchange abroad other than via the banking system is henceforth forbidden. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] We have had some talks with foreign parties about rescheduling agreements. Will this prove useful and effective in this process? ['Adeli] Fundamentally, one of the reasons behind the new decisions was that our rescheduling negotiations, fortunately, proved successful. We have been able to obtain allowances for the payment of our debts. From 1 June of the Christian year, that is, in a few days from now, we will begin the first of a series of payments, which will amount to about 4.5 billion marks to German sellers. This has had a very good impact on banking relations with foreign countries. Some insurance establishments, such as Canadian insurance and Australian insurance and some others have announced that they will accept our letters of credit. This will, consequently prove to be a new opportunity, both for the country and for importers. God willing, they will be able to operate using the banking system. I think that these are the positive effects of what we have done. [Correspondent] Thank you.
