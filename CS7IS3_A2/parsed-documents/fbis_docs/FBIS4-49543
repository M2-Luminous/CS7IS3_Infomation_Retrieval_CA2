Yang Zhou, who is spokesman of the Chinese Association for Human Rights, said Lin was detained at the airport on Friday. "We understand that he was stopped by border police as he was about to board a flight to Seoul, where he was going to change planes for the U.S.," a spokeswoman at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai said. "He had been issued with a student visa for the U.S." The other two were Li Guotao, the association's president, who was detained on May 2, and Dai Xuezhong, another association member, who was arrested the following day. The association's secretary-general, Wang Fucheng, has been in custody since April 14. The detentions come in the runup to the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings, when the People's Liberation Army crushed a pro-democracy movement in the heart of Beijing in 1989. "The June 4 commemoration is approaching, and (Chinese leader) Deng Xiaoping is in poor health," Yang said. "Party conservatives want to show that they have the situation under control." Several dissidents have been told to quit Shanghai by the end of May, diplomats there added. In another development, Yan Huili, the wife of the well-known Shanghai dissident Zhang Xianliang, who was sentenced last August to three years' labour in a re-education camp, said she had been unable to visit her husband for three months.
