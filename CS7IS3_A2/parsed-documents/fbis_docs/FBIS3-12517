The newspaper AL-'IRAQ reported today that the people of Rawandoz in the Irbil Governorate recently staged demonstrations to express their resentment and to protest their deteriorating living conditions. They also protested their intense suffering as a result of the services, administrative, and health problems they have been experiencing for the past two years due to the corruption of the agent and subversive cliques and their theft of the economic, health, and service infrastructures in the Kurdistan region, which were built by the 17-30 July revolution. The paper said that the demonstrators chanted slogans about the Kurds' poverty and inability to obtain their food requirements, saying: "We want bread. We want freedom." This prompted the agent and subversive cliques to open fire on the demonstrators to frighten and disperse them, the paper added.
