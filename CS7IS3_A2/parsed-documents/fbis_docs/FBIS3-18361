This Tuesday [1 March], Kinkel is scheduled to hold talks with Azeri Foreign Minister Hasanov on relations between the Asian country and Russia, Armenia, and Turkey. Possibilities of CSCE involvement in the settlement of regional conflicts should also be discussed. On Thursday, the Belarusian foreign minister will brief Kinkel on the relations within the CIS after the election of a new president in Minsk and the events in Moscow. In January, Kinkel invited the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian foreign ministers to Bonn for joint talks; this meeting will take place next Wednesday. The invitations to Foreign Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs (Latvia), and Gylys (Lithuania) for consultations has to be seen in connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic states of a threat from Russia. Even then, statements by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said that Russia had "fundamental vital interests" in the other successor states to the former Soviet Union, the CIS, and the Baltics, have caused some fear. With the foreign ministers of the Baltic countries Kinkel will also discuss the issue of leading their countries closer to the European Union [EU]. Since December, Germany has been trying to extend the negotiating mandate of the Brussels Commission, which, initially, only provided for talks on a free-trade agreement. The agreements should now contain at least the "prospects" for later EU membership, similarly to existing Europe agreements with other countries. Estonian President Meri described the Baltics as a "touchstone for the European idea." In a lecture in Hamburg, Meri expressed his concern that the West would not realize the full extent of what was brewing in Russia. The West was confounding what was desirable with reality. Meri said: "Just like the West, all of us, including the Estonian people and the other peoples in Central and East Europe, are interested in an economically and socially stable Russia; however, if we look at the events of the past few years, we would actually have to be overcome by an eerie feeling that we have moved further and further away from this objective." Meri did not conceal his astonishment that the West "invited" Russian soldiers and tanks to Sarajevo. One has to ask oneself whether a country that is itself struggling with serious unsolved ethnic and ethical problems, could act as a credible arbiter and peacemaker in other countries. The ill-feeling was growing when reading one of the most recent documents issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry: "Here it says that the problem of the Russian ethnic groups in the neighboring countries can not be solved by Russia only through diplomatic means." Meri added that these Russian ethnic groups often settled there in the wake of the occupiers and after a massive deportation of the native population. One can only conclude from the Moscow memorandum that, if necessary, other means should also be used: "What these other means could be has been experienced in a bitter way by us, the Estonians, and other small nations in our recent history." Fear of "Power of Order" In Russian foreign policy, the irrational element was getting the upper hand again, Meri said. Responsible Russian politicians were openly speaking of an allegedly "special role" of Russia, of its function as a "power of order," which the new Russia had to fulfill on the territory of the entire former Soviet Union. Yeltsin's adviser Karaganov has claimed for Russia the role of "first among equals" on the entire territory of the former Soviet empire. Meri said that one reason for his fears was that Russia did not admit "that, in 1940, and again in 1944, the Baltic nations were occupied, annexed against their will and in violation of international law and, subsequently, Sovietized and Russified to the limit of their national existence during five decades." Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Krylov last week officially told the Baltic states that in 1940, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Soviet Union "voluntarily." Meri said: "The next thing they will claim is that tens of thousands of Estonians -- including my family and myself -- `voluntarily' agreed to be deported to Siberia by the Soviets." Meri complained that the democratic West was tending to follow a policy of "appeasement" toward Moscow, which, out of convenience, is presented as realpolitik. "Against its better knowledge," the West was thus making itself "an accomplice to Russia's imperialist forces, who think they could solve the enormous unsolved problems of their country by external expansion and by threatening their neighbors." It is true that the West was shocked by the statements of nationalist Zhirinovskiy: "Still, surprisingly, hardly anybody recognizes it and nobody protests when Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev states that the Moscow government regards the continued presence of Russian Forces in the former Soviet republics as desirable." The widespread inclination in the West to regard whoever is in power in Moscow -- from Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Gorbachev, or Yeltsin -- as irreplaceable, has led to enormous faulty investments and misjudgements. Meri said: "Those who really want to help Russia and the Russian people today must emphatically convince the Russian leadership that there is no chance for a new imperialist expansion; those who fail to do so will actually help the enemies of democracy in Russia and the other postcommunist countries." The West's, and Germany's, policy was facing the crucial question of whether one should tolerate and finance a neoimperialist policy of the superpower in the East and, in the short term, maybe even benefit from it, or whether one wants to facilitate the success of democracy, freedom, responsibility, and peace between the Baltic Sea and the Pacific. The second objective can be achieved only if the West contributes strongly to the stability and security of the medium-sized and smaller countries east of the German border. Meri was referring to the countries of Central Europe from the Baltics to Ukraine. "If we manage to integrate thise belt of states into the democratic world, then these countries will have an exemplary effect on Russia." The Baltic countries wanted and had to be safely anchored in the West so that they could have a bridging function from such a firm position -- and not from a gray zone -- and could help the democratic forces in Russia. If, however, those countries, one of which is Estonia, are left to themselves and remain exposed without protection to Moscow's neoimperialist appetite, "then the price would be so high that not even all of Europe could pay it."
