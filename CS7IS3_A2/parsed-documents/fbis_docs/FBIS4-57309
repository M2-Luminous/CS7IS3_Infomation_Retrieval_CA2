The Council of Foreign Ministers, which is ALADI's top executive organ, will hold a special meeting to address the subject during a session that the Committee of Representatives has summoned to that effect. The foreign ministers will formally approve the agreement that high-ranking officials reached in Montevideo on 3 May. The agreement provides for the granting of a special permit or waiver [preceding word in English] for ALADI members to form partnerships with developed countries. The ALADI treaty sets forth that members must give other members the same benefits that they grant to countries outside ALADI, but Mexico, after joining the United States and Canada, was unable to fulfill this condition. Consequently, an interpretation document was drawn up permitting an exception for the members that join developed countries, in return for commercial compensations to the other ALADI members. Cartagena de Indias was chosen as the place for holding the meeting at the invitation of the Colombian Government.
