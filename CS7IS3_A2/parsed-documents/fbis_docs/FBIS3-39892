Only 10 percent of the German people believe that the CDU/CSU "is working hardest to ensure our safety from crime." This is the result of a representative poll conducted by the Allensbach Opinion Research Institute in November 1993. Ten years ago, 71 percent of those polled affirmed that the CDU/CSU was taking care to effectively combating crime. In its history, the CDU/CSU has not had to accept a more massive loss in trust -- and that in a key policly area. However, the people also attest to the failure of the other parties. Only 5 percent cite the Social Democratic Party of Germany as the party that is doing most against crime, 1 percent the Free Democratic Party of Germany, 1 percent Alliance 90/Greens, and 3 percent the Republikaner. The comment by the Allensbach institute: "The fact that 80 percent answer this question with `no party' or do not have an answer is an extremely alarming sign." Furthermore, the opinion research institute has discovered that the Germans' fear of crime increasing further has become one of the people's main worries. In the west of the republic, 49 percent of people are afraid "that crime is going to increase in Germany;" in eastern Germany this is felt by as many as 65 percent. A total of 44 percent feel threatened by crime in their everyday life. One in four said they had been a victim of robbery during the past three years. Asked about the most important reasons for increased crime, 38 percent of those polled by the Allensbach Institute cite unemployment; 24 percent point to "wrong education," 22 percent to the "crisis in values and meaning," 14 percent to foreigners, 13 percent each to the welfare and leisure-time society as well as to the media, and 12 percent to politics. The people's demands for large-scale measures to restore public order are clear: 76 percent interviewed by the Allensbach Institute called for better equipment for the police, 69 percent want the police to be given more rights and potential in their work, and 59 percent demand stricter laws. Currently, 31 percent even think that the death penalty should be reintroduced in Germany. A total of 48 percent of citizens think that stricter education of children and adolescents is necessary. Against the background of steadily rising crime, the Allensbach Institute comes to the conclusion: "There are no indications that the latest measurement...describes the climax. The signs of anxiety among the people point to a storm...."
