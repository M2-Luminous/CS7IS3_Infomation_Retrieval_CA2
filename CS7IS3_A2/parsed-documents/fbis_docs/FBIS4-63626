The president's new edicts contain a number of clauses which can only be described as sensational. They include the repeal of quotas and licenses for deliveries for export. A whole tribe of officials who used to receive bribes for issuing licenses and quotas will remain without "under the counter" earnings. A special edict of the president has put taxes in order. It is planned to reduce their number and to lower them by 10-20 percent. A preferential tax regime is being introduced for enterprises with foreign investments, only in the production sphere, it is true. The creation of new federal state enterprises is ending. Some of the existing ones will be transformed into public enterprises. The president's edicts also provide for the introduction of order in clearing operations. In Aleksandr Livshits' opinion this is the start of a fundamental reform in the state sector economy about which a lot has been said recently but for whose reform they have not had time, being engaged in political battles. This stage of the reform, he believes, has become possible only with the advent of relative political stability in Russia and the president's edicts are nothing other than the literal execution of the commitments he assumed under the social accord treaty.
