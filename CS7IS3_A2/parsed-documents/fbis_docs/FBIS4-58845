FBIS4-58845 "drnes089_j_94026" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-Bid Urges Support for Accord Document, Democracy Al-Bid Urges Support for Accord Document, Democracy EA0705163494 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 7 May 94 EA0705163494 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Central Committee, has confirmed that the Yemeni people will successfully pass through this test of unity and democracy, just as they did the test of the September and October revolutions. He explained during a news conference that the Yemeni people are strong because of the cause they support, and that no matter how much the secessionist al-Ahmar gang tries to fabricate issues, militarize the crisis, and derail the homeland, the political forces and national consensus will remain on the correct path which we all chose on 20 February. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: Man is Yemen's foundation. Hence, our strength lies with men and with those causes which men support. Random missile and cannon fire do not amount to any kind of strength, and they will not prevent the masses from raising their heads proudly and refusing to yield to the wishes and sicknesses of domineering gangs. We are stronger, our people are stronger -- we shall not abandon the march on the path that we chose -- the path of unity and democracy, the path of stability. The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP pointed out in the course of his speech that the party had sacrificed much on behalf of the people. It had confronted the evil gangs so that they would not plunge the country into conflict. He pointed out that these concessions to the evil gangs have now been exhausted, and that the YSP stands united with the people. He confirmed that the situation is getting better. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid pondered what might be happening in Sanaa and many other areas, pointing out that the northern gangs have cut off communications both inside and outside the country so that people cannot communicate. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stated that our legitimacy is derived from the people, and that the legitimacy of the media, which is being imposed on the people, is transient. He said that this legitimacy will only last for a couple of days, and he doubted the ability of some people to impose it for thirty days. He emphasized the importance of cohesion to the internal front and to the nationalist forces, and stressed commitment to the processes of unity, democracy, multipartyism, and nondiscrimination between the citizens, wherever they live in any governorate. Whoever supports the pledge and accord document, national cohesion, and peaceful, democratic struggle, is with us in any governorate. The deputy chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP explained that instructions have been given for opening a camp in Lahj Governorate for whoever wants to join the ranks of unity and democracy. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid denied reports being disseminated by the hostile media on the strike against the Dhamar electricity station. He pointed out that the Republican Guard in Dhamar carried out this act. He emphasized that the forces of unity and democracy did not and will not hit any vital targets, since these belong to the people. But the forces of unity and democracy will search for the gang and its palaces, hideouts, and nests.
