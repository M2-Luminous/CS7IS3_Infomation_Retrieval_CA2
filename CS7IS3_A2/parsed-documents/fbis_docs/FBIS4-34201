"I respect the opinion of President Castro, but do not agree with it, nor do I agree with his concept of what democracy is," de Leon told a group of newsmen. The Guatemalan president added that he does not feel he was recriminated by Castro at the summit. Castro also complained that the summit has not recognized the fact that Cuba is the Ibero-American country which has achieved the most in social aspects. Asked about the same topic, Figueres responded that the Cuban president's statements "are his opinion, but not those of the other presidents," and that he respects all opinions. The Costa Rican president also said the political situations of Cuba and Haiti, which will be broached today by the chiefs of states and governments and their foreign ministers at a closed-door meeting, complicate the continent's integration processes.
