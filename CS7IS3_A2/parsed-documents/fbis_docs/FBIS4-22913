Kulikova, Zaporozhye City Center of Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; UDC 616.1/.8-02:614.7]:313.13] [Abstract] The findings of a study of the effect of air pollution on the population morbidity in Zaporozhye carried out between 1982 and 1990 whereby two observation zones were selected in the city pursuant to the instruction and methodological directives approved by the USSR Public Health Ministry are presented. Each zone--one ``dirty'' and one conditionally clean (Ordzhonikidze borough and Khorti neighborhood)--house a city weather forecast station. The former is located 2-3 km from an industrial area while the latter--at a 10 km distance. Morbidity data are classified by the frequency of aid requests and are obtained from current files maintained by treatment and preventive care facilities covering both children and adults. The findings are backed by a sound statistical correlation and are consistent with the results produced by the laboratory of genetic research at the Republican Scientific Hygienic Center at the Ukrainian Ministry of Public Health. For children, morbidity in the dirty zone is higher than that in the clean zone by 3.51 times for blood diseases, 1.81 times for eye diseases, and 1.79 times for upper respiratory tract disorders while the combined morbidity is 1.6 times higher than in the clean zone, 1.45 times higher than in the rest of the republic, and 1.39 higher than the USSR average. Upper respiratory tract disorders have the highest incidence (75-87%). The findings served as the basis for developing and implementing the Biosfera comprehensive target-oriented program for improving the environmental conditions in Zaporozhye. References 5.
