Organizing commission sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA that more than 100 people will join about 50 others who are already in the capital and have been receiving their credentials since yesterday. It was reported that about 200 guests from more than 40 countries will participate in a personal capacity in the meeting that will run from Friday to Sunday afternoon. Official reports show that the common denominator of the participants is their opposition to the U.S.-imposed blockade on the island, although many of them do not share the ideology of social justice developed here since 1959. The broad acceptance of the conference among emigrants contrasts with an intimidation campaign, launched mainly in Miami where most Cuban emigrants live, against those who agreed to participate in the meeting. Raymundo del Toro, one of the participants and chairman of New Jersey's Cuban-American Committee for Peace, announced here that he received death threats from the Alpha 66 terrorist organization headquartered in Miami. I am not afraid of them because they are a small group of frustrated and old-fashioned people, del Toro told the local media. Meanwhile, Mari-Tere Vishop, propaganda secretary of an organization called Cuban Committee for Democracy, headquartered in the United States, said that things have changed within the Cuban community in that nation. Cuban emigrants are increasingly less afraid of the aggressiveness displayed by quarters that oppose the normalization of their relations with the island, she added during an interview with PRENSA LATINA. Del Toro and Vishop reaffirmed their rejection of the siege imposed by successive U.S. administrations for over three decades and condemned their attempt to suffocate the country. Del Toro added that all Cubans who wish to do so can unite to struggle for the country and that he thinks that this is among the main merits of the upcoming conference. I feel optimistic because sectors that oppose this normalization are losing ground, Vishop added.
