What are we to believe -- the strict liberal recommendations of [Finance Minister Vincenzo] Visco and [Budget Minister Luigi] Spaventa, or the threatening proclamations of [Communist Renewal leader Fausto] Bertinotti for a tax on treasury bills, his praise for the strikes that have brought railroad stations to a standstill, and his warnings about a reappraisal of NATO? [Adornato] I want to say something to Bertinotti right away: Let us not play games, please. There is something extremely serious at stake here, namely, the country's government for the next five years. The fact is that this election campaign is not as the voters expected. [Messina] Whose fault is it? [Adornato] It is everyone's fault. The law permitted the creation of two broad and consistent progressive alignments against the conservatives, but instead the parties -- all of them -- have pursued the rationale of the proportional system. They have come together to win more votes, but the alignments do not coincide on matters of policy. The Right is forming obscure, agreements with [Northern League leader Umberto] Bossi who cannot tolerate [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi, [Italian Social Movement leader Gianfranco] Fini who cannot tolerate Bossi, Bossi who cannot tolerate Fini, and Berlusconi who says: Maybe it would have been better for me to stand alone. [Messina]It seems to me that the progressive front has some minor problems, too.... [Adornato] Who is denying it? The difference with respect to the Right is that everything happens out in the open, but even among us there is not consistency between policies and alignments. [Messina] But you of the Democratic Alliance [AD] also agreed to establish the alliance of progressive forces, and you too were at the negotiations when its establishment was announced, were you not? [Adornato] Well, actually we proposed something different. We said "no" to Communist Renewal. But we of the AD, who are the youngest of all and must therefore show the others the respect due to our elders, were told that we could not lay down the law. And indeed, we did not. We were told that we were imposing ideological vetoes. But that was no veto; it was a prediction that things would turn out as indeed they have. [Messina] Let us be honest: You progressive forces set off without properly broaching the issue of the government program. You evaded the obstacle, and now you are paying for that mistake. [Adornato] No, the mistake was to have formed an alliance that lacked consistency between policies and alignments. Communist Renewal, by its own legitimate choice, has no program for the government of this country. Bertinotti's continual harangues show that what Communist Renewal wants is not to participate in the government but to carve out a proportional opposition space for itself. [Messina] But could you not have promptly resolved the problems of the strikes, treasury bills, NATO, and all the rest, instead of allowing these bombshells to explode in the very midst of the election campaign? [Adornato] Let us make one thing clear: Communist Renewal is a member of an electoral accord, not of a government agreement. Only the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the AD, and the Social Christians have discussed and presented a government program. Certainly, the inconsistency remains. But we issued a warning in plenty of time. And now it is sad to witness the dishonest use that Communist Renewal is making of this election campaign. [Messina] Why do you talk in terms of dishonesty? If Bertinotti has not adhered to your government program, he can say whatever he likes about treasury bills, can he not? [Adornato] Yes, but instead of facilitating a victory by the alliance of which he is a member, he is concerned only with gathering votes for his own party in the proportional vote. This, to the detriment of everyone else. Moreover, Bertinotti is also betraying the sense of responsibility toward the country that was demanded of the old irresponsible political class. Because, if you are a responsible person, you cannot go back to electrification plus the soviets [paraphrase of Lenin's definition of communism]. Of course, he is not the main person to betray this sense of responsibility. The main one is Berlusconi. [Messina] Does Berlusconi beat Bertinotti? [Adornato] Yes, because yet again he is asking the voters for a blank cheque. If someone smiles and says, "When I come to power I will perform the Italian miracle," he is insulting the Italian people. It is not enough to promise to reduce taxes in order then to be able to do so and to actually do so. But if we want to fall yet again into the hands of someone who stands up and makes such promises, this kind of [shipping magnate] Achille Lauro of television, then of course we are free to do so. [Messina] Let us return to the progressive alignment and its problems. If you perceived this rift on the Left in good time, why did you not stand up and leave? [Adornato] For the simple reason that a victory by the Right would be a victory for irresponsibility and destabilization. Berlusconi wants a market with no rules. As Spaventa said, if hitherto politics has managed business, we will have business managing politics. This is why we stayed on, to combat this Right and to defend the line of reform represented by Ciampi. We stayed on, even though we do not like the progressive alignment, because the real choice on 27 March will be between Ciampi and Berlusconi. [Messina] What will happen if the progressive alignment needs Communist Renewal's parliamentarians in order to govern? Will it request them or reject them? [Adornato] I cannot answer that. We will have to see what the election results are. My hope is that the progressive alignment will win and that this alignment can bring about a democratic alliance government -- that is, one with the Christian Democrats, the PDS, and the Social Christians. Of course, the endless nonsense that Bertinotti talks confirms the fact that Communist Renewal has no intention of broaching the problems of a modern and complex society, and it is rightly aiming to go into opposition. And I say that this is as it should be. [Messina] Mr. Adornato, have you ever thought that in your own single-candidate constituency Communist Renewal's voters might be tempted not to vote for you? [Adornato] That may be so. But my impression is that Italians, including those who may incline toward Communist Renewal, are tired of following theories that would confine them to the opposition for another 40 years. [Messina] What would you do if Bertinotti and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, deputy] Mattarella were competing in your constituency? Who would you vote for? [Adornato] Unfortunately, I will not, we will not, have this choice. The real choice will be between the progressive forces and Berlusconi's Right. [Messina] A few days ago a left-wing reader responded to the "manifesto" with a letter full of anger and disappointment: "Dear progressive forces, you have lost my vote." Did you read it? [Adornato] Yes, and I identify closely with that citizen's feelings. The candidates should have been chosen differently, by boldly establishing a single democratic party of the reformists and leaving the task of democratically selecting the candidates for the runoff elections. However, I would like to ask that reader to ponder the fact that in the election we will have to choose between Ciampi and Berlusconi, and that every vote less for the progressive forces will be one vote more for our adversaries. [Messina] [newspaper editor] Montanelli used to say, hold your nose and vote DC [Christian Democratic Party]. [Adornato] Just a minute: I would never ask anyone to hold their nose. I am saying: Open your eyes and vote for us.
