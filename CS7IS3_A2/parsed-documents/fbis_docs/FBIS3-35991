He arrived here to attend a three-sided forum, opening on Tuesday, of representatives from Russia, the United States and Japan on security in the northern Pacific. Nikolayev said he brought the video film to Tokyo and is prepared to show it to Japanese experts if they would wish so. On Monday a spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) told ITAR-TASS that the agency "did not put on record" massive intrusions by Japanese fishing boats into Russian territorial waters on January 21-22, which had been the subject of a Russian Foreign Ministry representation made to Tokyo. In view of this, the MSA, which partially performs the functions of frontier units, dropped the inquiry into whether Japanese boats crossed the state border of the Russian Federation. It has become known from informed sources that last year Russian border guards recorded about 7,000 transgressions of the border by Japanese fishing boats. Practically no transgressors were apprehended to avoid a conflict with the neighbouring state.
