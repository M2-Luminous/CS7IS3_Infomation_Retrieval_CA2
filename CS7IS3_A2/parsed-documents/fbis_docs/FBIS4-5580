Yi had been determined to report details of his schedule for a U.S. visit in a Supreme Council meeting Monday as a formal step before embarking on the trip. The opposition leader, who has already postponed his departure originally scheduled for Sunday, however, expressed his intention to go ahead with the plan, saying, "If the domestic political situation worsened, it would be difficult for me to leave, but it is neither easy nor good to delay for the second time, or cancel, it." "Even if I went there, I would come back in a hurry if the domestic situation warranted," Yi said, hinting that the visit is still on. Meanwhile, sources close to Yi said he would leave for America on April 19 for a 13-day visit featuring a meeting with Vice President Al Gore, speeches at the National Press Club in Washington and the Asia Society in New York, and a tour of California's silicon valley. Some members of the DP Supreme Council strongly opposed his departure, however, as the party is demanding a special session of the National Assembly to deal with a "national crisis." The Democratic Party has launched a nationwide movement to oppose the Uruguay Round trade agreement and vowed not to ratify the accord at the National Assembly. It is also demanding a probe into the power struggle gripping the Chogye Buddhist order and alleged diversion of Buddhist slush funds into the political arena.
