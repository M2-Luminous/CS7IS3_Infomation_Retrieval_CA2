"We had planned to send troops in the framework of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda. But because of the size of task, if UDEAC decides to speed up this mission with respect to the French intervention, we are ready to do it," the source told AFP. On Friday, the six UDEAC heads of state welcomed the French initiative. Congo has 25 officers in Rwanda as part of the UN operation and plans to boost its contingent to 300 men. Senegal is the only African country to have taken part in the French operation.
