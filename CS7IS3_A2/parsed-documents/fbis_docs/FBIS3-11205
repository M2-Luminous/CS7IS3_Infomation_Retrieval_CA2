I have taken a break from my activities during my official visit to Japan to refer to an event that I believe sets a very serious precedent for the country: the arbitrary decision made by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] to declare the summons to a referendum inadmissible. Article 79, Paragraph O of the Constitution unequivocally and precisely establishes the president's unquestionable right to summon a popular referendum to decide issues that he believes are of extreme importance to the state. Removed -- as has always been my case -- from any sort of political, personal, or party interest, I decided to call a referendum so we can discuss, for the first time, various topics of great national importance. My intention was and continues to be for the Ecuadoran people, all fellow citizens, to directly and sovereignly express an opinion and decide how our country should be, how the Ecuador we desire for our children should be. Nevertheless, the unconstitutional and surprising TSE attitude, which cannot legally disqualify my summons, attempts to hush the people's supreme voice -- our voice -- through an illegal act. On what legal precedence does the TSE interpret the Constitution and state that my summons to a referendum is unconstitutional? The TSE's decision is absurd, and I denounce and reject it. The decision dangerously challenges the essence of democracy. In fact, it keeps the people from directly participating in the country's political life and from deciding on its resources and alternatives. How much longer must our country witness the repeated and useless power struggles? What dark agreements and last-minute arrangements will the legislative majorities make to resolve their fierce disputes for control of the basic institutions that are required to strengthen and improve our democratic life and to ensure the thorough development of our people? The time has come to change and respect the people's right to express themselves on significant national issues. Thus, with great firmness, the president of the Republic and the national government will not falter in their efforts to carry out this legitimate referendum. Based on our democratic discipline and with due respect for the Constitution and the laws of the country, I have instructed the vice president of the Republic, as acting president, and my government to resort to legal measures to see that my constitutional right to consult the people and the people's inalienable authority to express themselves on the most important national problems be respected. Any attempt to negate my and the Ecuadoreans' rights is a serious mistake that will have a negative effect on the very nature of our democracy. I call all of you to join efforts so that we can defend our rights together. I call on you to join us in defense of the democracy we want to maintain and protect in our country.
