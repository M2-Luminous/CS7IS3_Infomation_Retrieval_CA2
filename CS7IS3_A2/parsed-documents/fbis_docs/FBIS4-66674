The retiarii and myrmillos of ultrademocratism, who had been fighting their own shadows for weeks, have therefore just won a "historic victory," as some colleagues in the Tunisian press will not fail to boast. These "presidential elections," a euphemism to describe the self-confirmation of the existing head of state, however farcical they were, are nonetheless full of lessons. In the electoral sham of 20 March, he was the only candidate to his own succession, because the candidacy of Moncef Marzouki, a brave defender of human rights, was received by the "pro-Ben Ali" camp if not as a snub, at least as "the machinations of an isolated psychopath." This professor of medicine is certainly not the only pathological case in this country governed by a "philosopher king," because 100 Tunisian academics published a communique "supporting Moncef Marzouki's right to stand in the presidential election." There is, therefore, no doubt that, in this country, there is no process of democratization, nor even the slightest intention of moving toward a semidemocratic system. Instead, there are many signs that Tunisia is sinking further and further into a system that gives no place to even the most basic human rights, or freedom of thought, or moderated opposition, still less to serious elections. A system that relies only on the strength of its police--18,000 policemen in 1986, 45,000 today--has a name: police state. Gregarious men call it a "happily strong state." "Happily" because such a state protects "civilian society" from Islamic fundamentalism. Look at what is happening in the neighboring country, the regime's feudalists add, as if Algeria were in its death throes because of excessive democracy. In reality, many intellectuals already knew that, with or without the Islamic fundamentalist specter, Tunisia would inexorably move toward a Syrian-style democracy. The second regime, born in the confusion of colorful conspiracy and a suspect trophy, received as its genetic inheritance the vices and responses of the Bourguibian republic, which had been in a deep coma since 1980. There was no shortage of signs to contemplate while awaiting the face of the new Moloch state: seizures of newspapers, relentless repression of political oppositionists of all colors, infiltration and neutralization of the former powerful trade union federation (the UGTT [General Union of Tunisian Workers]), the systematic use of the legal apparatus to concoct political trials, the "privatization" of opposition parties. But not everything is negative in the nonevent that Tunisia has just lived through. Any action or political decision contains within it what the sociologists call in their jargon aggregation effects (secondary and unexpected effects). In the new Tunisian situation, there are two. 1. The surprise candidacy of Moncef Marzouki breaks an old taboo rooted in Arab and Muslim mentalities, namely that there can be no salvation outside the president or petty king you have. For years, or even centuries, no Arab head of state has been seen to accede to the supreme office by a popular vote. In our countries, you do not gain power, you seize it by violence or usurp it. Similarly, nobody has ever seen an Arab head of state give up power voluntarily. 2. A democratic and secular opposition, which had been developing for months, has just been born in Tunisia. Men disenchanted by their experience hope to change the "change" peacefully. They are thus exposing this daunting deception, which is keeping the country in hibernation, namely that there are only two political protagonists in Tunisia: those who aspire to govern in the name of history and those who want to govern in the name of an eschatological messianism. Some men, and not unimportant ones, think, like Rousseau once did, that you can only legitimately govern in the name of the general will.
