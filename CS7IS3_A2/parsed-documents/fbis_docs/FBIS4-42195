Politicians and journalists were preparing for what was generally considered to be unavoidable: The imminent resignation of Interior Minister Van Thijn of the Labor Party and of Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin of the Christian Democratic Appeal. Back in April, Hirsch Ballin stayed at his post for so-called reasons of "national interest." National interest again seems to be the only term which could be used to explain Ministers Van Thijn and Hirsch Ballin being allowed to keep their jobs in the outgoing government. In the deciding motion during the IRT [Interregional Investigation Team] debate on Wednesday evening, it seemed that the Parliament felt that Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn had only made the situation worse. They cast doubt on the credibility of politicians and the police. As the government itself is to leave office (the members have already offered their resignation to the Queen) there was no motion of no-confidence. [passage omitted]
