Ortega's Refusal To Retire PA1104183694 Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 p 14 PA1104183694 Managua LA PRENSA Spanish BFN [Article by Ubeda Bravo] [Text] Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo reiterated in statements this morning that Army chief Humberto Ortega is the one who has the weapons and therefore the power even though President Violeta Chamorro is commander in chief of the Armed Forces. "It is well known that in this country, whoever has the weapons has the power. It will be hard for Ortega to leave soon because he has the rifles," the chief of the Nicaraguan Catholic Church said after meeting with Managua Mayor Arnoldo Aleman. Dr. Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, a prominent political analyst, labeled Humberto Ortega's statements as "praetorian" and exceeding his military duties. "Ortega's statements are a clear praetorian sign that the Sandinist People's Army (EPS) exercises control over the civilian government," said Alvarez Montalvan. Alvarez Montalvan said that the EPS meddles in civilian society "where it has no right to meddle." "At this stage of the game, Humberto Ortega should be home after his 14 long years at the head of the EPS," he said. Various social sectors have requested Ortega's retirement. Some Sandinists such as Edmundo Jarquin and Carlos Tunnerman Bernheim have said on several occasions that the high-ranking military head's retirement "would be healthy." Guillermo Potoy said that Ortega's statements demonstrate once more that "military power prevails over civilian power." "Humberto Ortega is another gorilla [derisive term used to describe military officers] among those that have existed in Latin America and who want to remain in power backed by weapons," Potoy commented. According to Potoy, Ortega's continued presence as EPS chief would bring more instability to the nation. Meanwhile, Wilfredo Navarro, president of the Independent Liberal party, told a local radio that Humberto Ortega's statements "reflect the fragility of the state of law that some are attempting to establish in Nicaragua."
