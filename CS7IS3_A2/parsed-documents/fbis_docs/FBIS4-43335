During his talk with Chairman of the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP) Aleksander Kwasniewski, now on a visit to Germany at the invitation from the German Association for Foreign Policy (DGAP), Kinkel stressed that Poland had to fulfill particular economic conditions. The German foreign minister also emphasized the necessity to improve "membership abilities" in key fields and added that this also concerned other candidates. Kinkel promised Germany would deal with this problem during its chairmanship in the union, to start on July 1, 1994. Kinkel approved of Poland's "fast and open" attitude towards the Partnership for Peace programme, saying that the partnership would change relations between the countries participating in the initiative and NATO. Next, the foreign minister stressed Germany's readiness to support Poland in building market economy and pluralistic structures. Also on Tuesday, Kwasniewski met with former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President of the Bundestag Rita Suessmuth, Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt, head of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) faction Herman Otto Solms and deputies of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) Markus Meckel and Friedbert Pflueger, respectively. The SDRP leader briefed the German politicians on the political and economic situation in Poland, emphasizing the consistency in implementing reforms. He also added that a greater stress on the social aspects did not mean the easing of the budget requirements and the weakening of anti-inflationary measures. Kwasniewski also said EU markets should open to Polish products. The German defence minister confirmed his support for Poland's membership of NATO around the year 2000. He also stressed the significance of contacts between the German and the Polish armies for bringing Poland closer to Western defence structures.
