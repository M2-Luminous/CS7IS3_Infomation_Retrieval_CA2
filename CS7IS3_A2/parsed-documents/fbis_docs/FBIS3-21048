The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model, which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab-340 type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900-kg radar made by the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics. The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary electrical power system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its computers. Sweden's Defense Equipment Office (FMV) ordered six of the aircraft for surveillance of national land and sea territory. A spokesperson for Saab Aircraft AB said that construction of the craft, excluding radar, would cost just over 500 million Swedish crowns (a little over 365 million French francs [Fr], give or take). The new Saab-340-AEW, which the British have nicknamed "the poor man's AWAC", has attracted the notice of international specialists. This, says the company spokesperson, "is a very good sign for future exports." The first AEW will be delivered to Sweden's defense forces during the first quarter of 1995.
