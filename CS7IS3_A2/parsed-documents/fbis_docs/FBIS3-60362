The scheduled second instance of dumping was canceled. However, there are some decommissioned nuclear submarines which have been left untouched at a submarine repair base in the Russian Far East region. The base in is great need of facilities at which radioactive waste produced during the process of dismantling nuclear submarines can be processed and stored. Officials of the Maritime Kray Government cannot conceal their uneasy feelings about the possibility of "instances of nuclear pollution that can occur anytime." Today, we will report on the actual state of the dismantling of the nuclear submarines and the treatment of radioactive waste. We drove two and half hours from Vladivostok, where the headquarters of the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet is located. A harbor with repair and dismantling dock facilities came into sight as we passed a checkpoint at the entrance to Bolshoy Kamen city. Nuclear submarines were being dismantled in three dry docks. Dark hulls which had been aged by many long voyages were cut crosswise, and some people were working there to take out radioactive waste. According to military officials and people who work at the Zvezda (meaning "star") dockyard, which is the largest submarine repair factory in Russia, and at Stella, which is a Russian-U.S. joint venture established last spring, jointly dismantle the nuclear submarines. About 50 submarines have already been retired from service. The submarines still possessing nuclear reactors were being left out in the harbor and on beaches, for the dockyard can dismantle only four submarines a year. About 50 more submarines are scheduled to be retired from service by the year 2000. A simple calculation tells us that 25 years are needed to dismantle all these vessels. Radioactive wastes are being separated into solid and liquid wastes. Solid wastes are buried underground, but many of the solid wastes remain piled up in the open air because they are being removed from the submarines faster than the workers can bury them. Liquid wastes are stored in two storage tankers, the Pechega (which has a 700-ton capacity) and the TNT (which has a 900-ton capacity). The TNT was used to dump radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan. One thousand tons of radioactive waste are stored on the two ships; their remaining capacity is only 600 tons. According to reporter Pashko (age 30), who works for an organ of the same fleet, about five dumpings at sea were carried out each year from the end of the 1980's to 1991. Reportedly, 373 tons of solid waste (with radiation levels of 6 trillion Becquerels) and 3,000 tons of liquid waste (with radiation levels of 925 billion Becquerels) were dumped into the Sea of Japan. The radiation levels of these wastes are far higher than that of the liquid wastes which were dumped last month. According to an already-made announcement, the radiation level of the liquid wastes dumped into the Sea of Japan last month was about 40 billion Becquerels. Assistant Commanding Officer Maksimov (43), who belongs to a chemical unit of the same fleet, said, "With our current storage capacity, our facilities will be full in 18 months." On the other hand, Maritime Kray Deputy Governor Stegnyy [name as published] (45) stated: "We need to build processing and storage facilities as soon as possible. This is the way to safety. We will call on the Japanese Government for its assistance."
