FR940921-0-00097 FR940921-0-00016 * * * * * (b) Component description_Otto-cycle, petroleum-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles. The components necessary for petroleum-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle and Otto-cycle vehicle exhaust sampling shall meet the following requirements: * * * * * (3) For gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled Otto-cycle and petroleum-fueled, natural gas- fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel-cycle vehicles, the transfer of heat from the vehicle exhaust gas shall be minimized between the point where it leaves the vehicle tailpipe(s) and the point where it enters the dilution tunnel airstream. To accomplish this, a short length (not more than 12 feet (365 cm) if uninsulated, or not more than 20 feet (610 cm) if insulated) of smooth stainless steel tubing from the tailpipe to the dilution tunnel is required. This tubing shall have a maximum inside diameter of 4.0 inches (10.2 cm). Short sections of flexible tubing at connection points are allowed. * * * * * 49. Section 86.111&hyph;94 of subpart B is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(3) introductory text and (b)(3)(v) to read as follows: §86.111&hyph;94 Exhaust gas analytical system. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (3) For petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles (and if selected, for methanol-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel vehicles) a continuous hydrocarbon sample shall be measured using a heated analyzer train as shown in Figure B90&hyph;5 (or B90&hyph;6). The train shall include a heated probe, a heated continuous sampling line, a heated particulate filter and a heated hydrocarbon instrument (HFID) complete with heated pump, filter and flow control system. * * * * * (v) For petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel vehicles, the sample line and filter shall be heated to maintain a sample gas temperature of 375 ○ # 10 ○F (191 ○ # 6 ○C) before the filter and before the HFID. * * * * * 50. Section 86.113&hyph;94 of subpart B is revised to read as follows: §86.113&hyph;94 Fuel specifications. (a) Gasoline fuel. (1) Gasoline having the following specifications will be used by the Administrator in exhaust and evaporative emission testing of petroleum-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles. Gasoline having the following specification or substantially equivalent specifications approved by the Administrator, shall be used by the manufacturer in exhaust and evaporative testing except that octane specifications do not apply;
