Liu Huaqing said: The guidelines laid down by the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have been successfully reflected in the basic policy and tasks for 1994 which Premier Li Peng has clearly outlined in his "Government Work Report." The "report" has especially stressed that seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, expediting development, and maintaining stability are the requirements of overall importance for the country; and that the relations between reform, development, and stability must be handled properly. Comrades in the armed forces must obey and serve these requirements of overall importance and contribute to reform, opening up, and economic development, as well as to safeguarding the motherland's security. Liu Huaqing said: China is a socialist country, and our efforts to speed up the modernization of our national defense are totally for defensive purposes so that our motherland's territorial land, waters, and airspace will not be violated, the unification and stability of our country can be safeguarded, and people of all nationalities in the country can dedicate themselves to socialist modernization. The annual military budget of our big country is very low compared to countries of the world. While our military budget cannot be compared to those of the developed countries, it is even much lower than those of certain neighboring countries. Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese people are a peace-loving people. We suffered immensely from foreign powers' aggression for more than a century, and the wounds of foreign aggression are keenly felt. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will absolutely not permit any aggressors to trample on our national sovereignty and interests, will never seek hegemony, and will never seize an inch of foreign territory. China will not embark on an arms race, nor will we join any military blocs or create spheres of influence. This is our consistent stand. For a long time to come, China will concentrate its efforts on developing production and improving the people's living standards. We will adhere to the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering. Not only is this in the interest of China, but it is also in the interest of Asia and the world as a whole. Liu Huaqing noted: The armed forces made new headway in all fields in 1993. New successes were achieved in improving party members' conduct and in promoting honesty and administrative ethics in the armed forces. Many heroes with Xu Honggang as the model came to the fore. An upsurge of the troops' training occurred, and an unusually good situation in military training appeared. New headway was also achieved in defense science and technology research and in improving logistical support. Liu Huaqing said: To intensify the modernization of national defense, we must follow the guidance provided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thoughts on military construction during the new period, pay attention to quality, firmly follow the path of building crack troops with Chinese characteristics, and comprehensively build up our armed forces in accordance with the general requirement put forth by Chairman Jiang Zemin that the PLA must be "politically measured up, militarily toughened, outstanding in work style, strict in discipline, and powerful in defense." In order to improve the PLA's combat-readiness, current and future work will primarily be on strengthening its ideological and political construction, developing modern weaponry, training commanders and technical specialists with the skills needed in modern warfare, and bringing about the best combination of people and weapons through scientific organization and rigorous training. We still have some difficulties with regard to military budgets and military construction, we must therefore carry forward the "five types of revolutionary spirit" which Comrade Deng Xiaoping advocated and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "64-character pioneering spirit" [liberate the mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore, be brave in innovating, wage arduous struggle, proceed despite difficulties, learn from foreign countries, make persistent efforts to improve ourselves, be humble and prudent, guard against complacency and rashness, work with one heart and one mind, take the interests of the whole into consideration, work diligently and practice economy, be upright and honest, rouse ourselves to build a stronger nation, and make selfless dedication], wage arduous struggle, build the armed forces through diligence and thrift, strive to improve the economic efficiency of military projects, and proceed while overcoming difficulties. Liu Huaqing said: The rock-solid Army-government and Army-people solidarity is important in enhancing social stability and ensuring national peace. We must always preserve this fine tradition under the new situation. He said: Army-government and Army-people relations have been developing satisfactorily in recent years. Projects to support the government, cherish the people, support the military, and give preferential treatment to military families are making progress and improving. Military and local authorities must bear in mind the overall interests of the country and take the initiative in promoting Army-government and Army-people solidarity, in consolidating and developing new Army-government and Army-people relationships, and contribute positively to expediting economic construction and social stability. The PLA must remain humble and prudent and respect local party committees and government under all circumstances. All officers and men in the armed forces must always bear in mind the code which requires them to serve the people wholeheartedly, and set an example in following the party's lines and general and specific policies and state laws and regulations. The PLA must actively support and take part in local economic construction projects, help the local people solve problems, correct conduct improper for party members, guard against the inroads of corrosion, advocate work ethics, establish a good image, and be brave in fighting social evils. We must rally even more closely around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and work hard together with the people in the country to achieve new victories in reform, opening up, and modernization.
