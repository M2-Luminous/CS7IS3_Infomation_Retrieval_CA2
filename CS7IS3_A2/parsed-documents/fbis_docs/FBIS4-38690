Kozyrev said the Bosnian problem featured prominently at the talks because Russia and Greece "have traditional interests and influence in that region." Additionally, he continued, "both of us are members of the initiative group of ministers which gathered in Geneva and we support direct contacts with Belgrade and other sides involved in the conflict. We have mapped out a number of additional steps to support the settlement process and stated practically full coincidence of our views." "We also believe it necessary to strictly observe all international agreements, particularly the regime (of navigation) in Black Sea straits established in Montreux. Our positions on the Cypriot problem also coincide. It is important that the next U.N. Security Council discussion of the U.N. secretary-general's report on the talks on Cyprus lead to progress," Kozyrev said. "Our contacts are developing on a firm basis established during (Russian President) Boris Yeltsin's visit to Athens last year," he added. He said Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is expected to visit Moscow this autumn. Kozyrev admitted that some complications may arise in bilateral relations, but what is much more important is that both countries have the political will and determination to develop multifaceted ties. Papoulias also pointed to the coincidence of the positions of Russia and Greece on international problems, including on ways to settle the Bosnian conflict, Cypriot problem and navigation in the Black Sea. He described relations between the two countries as "friendly and cordial" and said that there are no problems between Moscow and Athens. Papoulias invited Kozyrev to visit Greece in order to "continue the fruitful dialogue in the interests of the two countries."
