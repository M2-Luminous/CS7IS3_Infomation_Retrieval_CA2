This key issue is prices for products. We would like them to drop, especially at the time when [words indistinct] the minimum wage grew twice, including some other payments from the state budget. However, prices for agricultural products do not even compensate for production costs. This is the subject of our talk with Alyaksandr Pawlavich Hretski, deputy chairman of the Department of Prices. [Hretski] Since January 1992, all industrial output, public works and services have been issued to the agricultural sector free of charge. These prices are constantly growing. First and foremost, this is connected with our Republic using enormous amounts of gas, electricity, oil, metal, grain, and other raw materials which are being chiefly imported from Russia and other states. Naturally, (?we) cannot set the prices for these products. For example, in 1993, the price for one tonne of oil increased from 27,500 rubles [R] to R450,000; of 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas -- from R16,600 to R116,700; and of one tonne of grain -- from R96,000 to some R2 million. As a result, the 1993 index of price increases for material and technical resources consumed by the agricultural sector stood at 3,776 percent. Prices for mineral fertilizers increased by 3,928 percent, electricity -- by 9,211 percent, fuel --by 3,554 percent, and wheeled tractors -- by 3,381 percent. As for agricultural produce being sold at prices set by the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs, their level increased by only 1,229 percent in 1993, representing 178 percent of the nonparity of prices [nieparitet tsen] or R964.6 billion. [Reporter] The government is doing everything to protect the population. [Hretski] The government adopted a range of measures aimed at improving this situation in 1993. These steps include lowering prices for material and technical resources delivered to the agricultural sector. In addition, the agricultural sector was supplied with electricity and oil at lower prices than the industrial sector. Purchase prices were regularly increased. Nevertheless, the results of 1993 show that our agricultural sector did not receive almost R400 billion in compensation. Due to this, the profitability of agricultural production in 1993 stood at only 3.3 percent. The profitability of meat production stood at 4.8 percent, in particular, production of pork at 13.6 percent, beef at 0.7 percent, and poultry at 6.7 percent. Milk profitability was reduced by 6.2 percent. To my regret, this tendency has remained the same this year. As of 1 April 1994, the total sum of price increases for resources that are delivered to the agricultural sector stood at R4.3 trillion. Prices for oil products increased by R1.374 billion. Oil products, mineral fertilizers, and the increase in wages for workers of the agricultural sector account for the biggest proportion of these increases. In this regard, the increase in purchase prices for agricultural products became inevitable. For example, on 6 April, purchase prices for all kinds of meat were increased by 30 percent, for milk -- by 40 percent. However, this permitted only R2 trillion in compensation, or 46.3 percent of costs in the agricultural sector. The remaining sum was transferred to crop production and [word indistinct]. [Reporter] This cannot help but affect retail prices. [Hretski] Of course. Such increases in purchase prices for meat and milk cannot but affect retail prices for products traded at free prices. For example, prices for meat -- poultry, beef, pork, sausages -- have already increased. Retail prices for dairy products are still untouched. To do this, prices for vodka were raised by R2,000 per bottle. Indeed, we receive complaints from our citizens that it is impossible to buy dairy products because they are being smuggled abroad. In my opinion, the increase in prices for these products with corresponding social protection measures would have been justified. Summarizing my report, I would like to urge the working collectives of our industrial enterprises to decrease prices for produce, which is being delivered to the agricultural sector. This will return a hundredfold when we have cheaper agricultural products on our table.
