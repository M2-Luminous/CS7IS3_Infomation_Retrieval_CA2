The NPFL says it believes as the parties still exist in the transitional government, it remains their prerogative to make positive moves to achieve peace and reconciliation at all levels. The NPFL is reacting to reported fears that the front and other factions may object to changes in the composition of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] representatives to the Liberian National Transitional Government. The NPFL says it has no objection whatsoever to any change within the rank and file of a faction to stop the bloodshed and bring about peace and unity.
