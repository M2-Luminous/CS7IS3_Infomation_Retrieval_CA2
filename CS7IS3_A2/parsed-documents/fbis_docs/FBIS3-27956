With their efforts at rationalization such as the closing of branches and forced reductions in personnel approaching the limit at this point, the author proposes specialization in money markets as a recipe for their survival. Shedding Light--the Midyear Results We will focus our attention on the contents of the combined September 1993 midyear results for all securities companies. Although all companies showed increased earnings after a long dry spell, reflecting the impact of the temporary upturn in the stock market during April and May 1993, in contrast to the broad-based profitability of the four leading securities companies, the performance of the majority of medium-sized firms in terms of earnings was conspicuously dull, with continued red ink (see table). Particularly noticeable was the further trend in the expanding earnings differential between the four largest companies and the remaining ones, as might be expected from the size of the earnings bulge of the top four companies. The primary reason for the upturn in earnings was an increase in commissions from stock trades. The four leading companies saw an increase of 151 percent over the same period a year ago while the second-tier companies experienced a growth of 140 percent. The four leaders solidly increased earnings commissions in bonds and underwriting, and bonds were the primary contributor to trading profits for the second-tier companies and below.

On the other hand, retrenchment of administrative expenses such as the closing of branches and reductions in personnel remained at 0.3 percent for the four leading companies, but the average for the second-tier companies and below was 9.4 percent, with the bulk of their efforts going to rationalization. Nonetheless, in addition to their using invested negotiable securities and latent real estate profits, found here and there among the second-tier and lower companies were lower required net-worth ratios as efforts at efficiency and rationalization extending over three years appeared to be pushing the limits of the old system. The situation is serious because rationalization at this point will only make business retrenchment--that is, lower market share--increasingly inevitable. The issue then is that the future shape of the "securities markets" and the "securities industry" will not be visible at all without signs of a recovery being visible as in the past. Lacking a picture of the future, they face continued pressure on investment, expenses, and reductions in personnel. Changes in the Securities Industry's Environment The explosive drop in the stock market that began in 1990 can be explained as a phenomenon resulting from the bursting of the bubble economy. Without dwelling on the surface phenomena of "investors leaving the market," "stagnation in the stock underwriting market," and "worsened earnings by securities companies," which have been pointed out, the extended market stagnation caused by the plunge into a major economic slump following the collapse of the bubble seems to have given rise to qualitative changes in the basic structure of the stock market. Furthermore, the entry of banks into the securities business through the reform of the financial system which began this year has begun to usher in momentous changes in the functions of the securities markets, as well as simply being threatening. Environmental changes of this kind have been forcing fundamental changes in Japan's securities system since 1965 and appear especially to have shaken the operational base of the smaller securities companies. How should the securities business respond to these changes? As the smaller securities firms look to their own well-being and strength, they worry about their next move, wondering what to do. Changes in market structure caused by the extended securities slump are summarized in the following three points: The first is the "affixing of a low relative weight to stocks in the securities markets." By allowing only new listings in the stock underwriting market, market dullness invites a stop to capital expansion. Capital acquisition needs of corporations at present are being financed through bank loans and debt underwriting here and abroad. We see the underwriting of hybrid securities, including swaps. Furthermore, "stocks" are in disfavor in the application of capital, symbolizing the retreat of banks and business corporations from "financial engineering" investments. High-risk Japanese stocks are being avoided. In this way, stocks apparently have lost the degree of importance they once had for capital acquisition and application and, with substitute vehicles appearing on the market, continue to be frozen in their present form. For Japanese securities companies, which grew up on stock trading, and especially the smaller securities companies whose very existence to a great degree is owed to stocks, the phenomenon of the "changes in mainstream trading vehicles" has to be termed revolutionary. The second change could be summarized by the words "changes in investor structure." Changes in the structure of stock ownership, which started with the financial institutions, are steadily manifesting this impact in what has become a topic of daily conversation: "mutual dissolution." In what has become symbolic of the avoidance of "financial engineering," business corporations are increasingly distancing themselves from stocks, and "corporations" are now a major cause of the "sell" anxiety and are the reason for the gloomy market. The "individual," who can substitute for the "corporation," in particular with "investments from household savings," calls attention to this. In Japan the "pure investment" institutional investors for investment trusts, annuities, and insurance, which ought to play the role of channel between the individual and the markets, are still weak. Household savings is an area that is still to be exploited. In any event, although organizational investors play a role in this field as in Europe and the United States and are expected to be major players in the market, the fact that the investor structure continues to change means that the customer structure for securities will continue to change as well. "Changes in investment philosophy and methodology" is the third change. The explosive drop in stock prices and the recession have again forced investors to recognize the importance of return on investment, of controlling risk, and of the efficacy of diversified investments. They have stimulated the development of new derivative investment approaches. Furthermore, emphasis is being placed on the importance of an infrastructure with analyst functions and research mechanisms to make it easier to put funds to work, which in turn has given rise to an opportunity for establishing evaluative mechanisms for investment performance. Securities companies require superior talent and systems in order to cope with the development of these kinds of investment techniques. This demands that smaller securities firms make fresh investments. Responding in concert and in step with the above market changes, the fact that various securities system reforms are being moved forward under authoritative leadership cannot be overlooked in considering the environment of the securities industry. Regarding this, reform to this point has had an especially large impact in the following three ways. 1.% 1.%The entry of banks into the securities business. 2.%The equipping and activation of a debt market. 3.%The trend toward deregulation of commissions As described above, with the current environment, which says that there must be a debt market in order for business financing not to be a function of the stock market, providing a favorable climate for bank-affiliated securities companies, beginning with the Industrial Bank of Japan, it is an extremely satisfactory beginning that bank-affiliated securities companies are reporting that they anticipate being in the black from the beginning of the fiscal year. Furthermore, with the opportunity for entry into the management of debt underwriting by bank-affiliated securities companies or into acceptance groups, changes in the traditional syndication rules of the underwriting market will be inevitable. And there has been a trend toward a formula of acceptance by only a few leading securities companies. As a result, the scenario has manifested itself of shutting out lower-tier securities firms--being degraded to participating in selling groups--which is beginning to harm medium-sized securities companies. Together with the anxiety that the trend toward a monopoly by the leading securities companies in this kind of underwriting market, starting with debt, will extend to stocks, it is feared that a cost differential in the purchasing of market instruments will emerge for midsized securities companies. Whereupon, reform of the securities system itself will be largely toned down, with the brakes applied from the viewpoint of protecting the securities industry and with the intensification of the securities recession, by adopting such approaches as "bank-affiliated securities companies will not be permitted to transact [immediate] stocks" and "we will investigate the deregulation of commissions once we look into large transactions." These measures make the goals and ideals of basic system reform vague, but have the temporary effect of pacifying the tenacious victim mentality of the smaller securities companies regarding system reform. Coping by the Smaller Securities Companies The changes in market structure accompanying the extended recession we have discussed thus far and the trend to system reform in response cannot halt this trend or turn the tide, even in the future when we see recovery from the depressed stock market. Rather we may need to consider that the part of the system frozen out by system reform will once again take possession. How are smaller securities companies to try to cope in the midst of this turmoil? However you look at it, the trend now is to maintain efficiency and rationalization in order to eliminate losses. Key to rationalization is the closing of branches, reductions in personnel, postponing new investments, and use of latent profits. Included in this are home office transfers and campaigns for reduced overtime as steps to an increased drawdown. As a result, marketing costs for second-tier firms and below have been reduced by 27-31 percent and personnel by 26 percent over a three-year period. For the midterm accounting period of September 1993, the reduction in marketing costs was 9.4 percent and in personnel 10-13 percent. However, despite these efforts, we find here and there securities companies with worsening net-worth ratios, who are consuming their latent profits, and unable to avoid losses. As discussed above, from this point on rationalization will accompany shrinkage in business scope and lower market share. All the more because the situation is so serious one has to wonder where will it all end. For example, one must say that moves to make rapid changes in the character of companies in order for them to survive the trend in market changes are inadequate. The smaller securities firms have not trained people who either are able to deal with derivatives or are conversant with the debt market, and for this reason still need time and further investment. All companies would like forward-looking, "power up" investments of this sort, but the issue is one of a balance between this and the press of rationalization. Furthermore, some assert they are having difficulty setting goals, much less establishing a reform schedule. A variety of opinions on all aspects are being offered these days to smaller securities firms groping for ways to survive in the changing financial environment. What these opinions all have in common is that these companies avoid an "integrated securities" syndrome, determine their own customer focus, and specialize in running individual operations. There are, in fact, two or three good examples of owner-run securities firms. While courageous talk is easy, in truth the going is probably pretty tough. When we think about this based on the above trends, the results of system reform and internationalization, especially in the near future, I think we will see an era of international syndication ushered in, where, like London, Japan's underwriting market in stocks and debt will be hybrid. Players in this will be limited to those who employ talent and systems, namely the top-ranking securities firms turned investment banks, securities firms affiliated with the leading banks, and securities firms affiliated with overseas investors. The smaller securities companies fear being shut out of the underwriting market. Should this happen, the smaller securities companies on their own will retreat from an "integrated securities approach," with the majority probably specializing in secondary markets. One can imagine that securities companies focusing on the secondary market will either take the form of U.S. discount brokers with large volume sales of securities to individuals and ordinary investors, or will specialize in developing investment advising with high added value aimed at special classes of customers. The former are hoping for a large volume sales format despite a total deregulation of commissions, while the latter seek the format of investment adviser, having studied the successful earlier examples of the financial planner as exemplified by Merrill Lynch salesmen. But they will then be expected to be able to do commodity planning and development to meet customer needs with the know-how to put assets to work. Furthermore, business diversity will be indispensable to ensure operational stability. First, deregulation of sideline businesses such as investment advising and investment trusts is to be expected, even if very small. Furthermore, relaxing the regulations on dealer positions may become an issue in promoting increased trading earnings as an earnings remedy. Problems Remaining for the Future As market changes and reforms move forward, securities companies must accommodate this trend, preferably by thinking for the future. In order to do this, it will be necessary for underwriters, investors, market-affiliated people, and the authoritative leadership to join together early on, to lay out the future image of Japan's securities markets and to state it clearly and widely. Whereupon, should the picture that is laid out be overly severe for smaller securities firms, perhaps it would be best to consider a policy of additional time. A future image would better work as a guide on which to advance reform and rationalization among securities companies. Creation of such an image for the future is the number-one topic demanding attention. It has been asserted that administration policy should shift from a business-oriented policy to a market-oriented one. I think that this administration policy as it should be is largely borne out by investigation. The most important facets to a securities policy are perhaps market regulation and protection of the investor. In this sense, the immediate subjects for deregulation are such things as deregulating the development of market instruments, deregulating sideline businesses, and relaxing rules governing dealer positions. In addition, in order to protect the investor, it may be necessary to set in place something like the U.S. SIPC (Securities Investors Protection Corporation).
