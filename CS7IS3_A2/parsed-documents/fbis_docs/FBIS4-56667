Here is Juan Santoyo with a report: [Santoyo] Good afternoon. No major announcements followed the second meeting with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Samuel Ruiz, and the 10 members of the EZLN general staff. The parties merely pledged that they will make new contacts in upcoming weeks and that the EZLN will, in the coming days, comply with the 36 points agreed upon in San Cristobal de las Casas. At the meeting held in nearby Guadalupe Tepeyac, Monsignor Ruiz said the EZLN has resumed consultations for peace negotiations. Msgr. Ruiz also expressed concern over recent events that at any moment could hinder the peace process. He emphasized, however, that major difficulties have been overcome and current conditions are very different. Ruiz also referred to Camacho Solis' statements during the meeting with the EZLN. [Begin Ruiz recording] Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis referred to progress in the EZLN's compliance with the San Cristobal commitments. He said the conditions are right for prompt compliance with those commitments. The key issue at hand, he added, is peace negotiations in Chiapas that restore tranquillity nationwide. The parties agreed to maintain contact in the coming weeks. [end recording] [Santoyo] Following these comments on Camacho's meeting with the EZLN, Ruiz reiterated that the parties have agreed to meet again but gave no specific date. Camacho Solis, who was also asked about the meeting, said it took place at a location chosen by the EZLN near Guadalupe Tepeyac and that it lasted over six hours. [Begin Camacho recording] The meeting was attended by 10 representatives of the EZLN, and they also kept the area under very tight surveillance. Before the meeting, EZLN followers and ordinary citizens demonstrated to voice their views and political demands. Subcommander Marcos also attended the meeting. [end recording] [Santoyo] Reports added that some residents of San Cristobal de las Casas, who were listening to Camacho Solis and Msgr. Ruiz, were somewhat disappointed because they thought more concrete agreements had been reached. Many residents expected to hear that a specific date had been set to sign a peace agreement. [Announcer] Although no specific dates were set, this meeting with the EZLN in the Lacandon jungle was significant. For one thing, Camacho Solis stated that this consultation process among all the EZLN members in the area may set the stage for another meeting and a continuation of the peace dialogue. This opportunity is likely to arise once EZLN discussions on proposals and counterproposals to petitions made in the first phase of the peace talks conclude. [Santoyo] Yes, those are the prospects, but we must also raise a point made by the EZLN members themselves. It is true that they have currently resumed their consultations, but they are also asking the entire country, including all peasant and social organizations, to conduct surveys on the 36 points agreed upon in San Cristobal de las Casas. The EZLN seeks to include those surveys in the second phase of the peace dialogue and use them to draft their response to the 36-point San Cristobal agreement. Many observers are following this situation very closely, basically because it constitutes an effort by the EZLN to make their internal consultations a national matter, which could cause some delay. The EZLN is expected to give a definitive answer to the 36 points in the coming days -- whether it agrees or disagrees -- and at that juncture set a date for the second phase. In addition, rumors have mushroomed here in San Cristobal since Msgr. Ruiz revealed a few days ago that he had plans to travel to Rome. When asked about this trip, his closest associates said they were awaiting a definitive answer following the meeting with the EZLN to know whether Msgr. Ruiz will leave tomorrow for Rome to meet with top leaders of the Catholic Church as well as to discuss the Chiapas situation. Msgr. Ruiz' trip to Rome has not been confirmed yet, but rumors are strong. Some say Msgr. Ruiz might return from Rome in 15 days when an answer is likely to be ready and the date for a second talk set.
