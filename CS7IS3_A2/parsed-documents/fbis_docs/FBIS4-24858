Therefore, the Chinese side maintains that matters which are not directly connected with politics should be handed to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group for deliberation as soon as possible, where a solution can be pursued. This remark was made to reporters by Cheng Ming-fun, head of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board of directors delegation to Beijing, after meeting with Zhu Rongji this afternoon. Cheng Ming-fun said: At the meeting, Zhu Rongji pointed out that overseas personalities have been paying too much [guo fen 6665 0118] attention to the overheated development of China's economy. Zhu Rongji said: The scale of the large infrastructural projects that China conducted last year had virtually no match in the world. These projects included the construction of 2,000 km of railways and highways, the laying of 15 million new telephone lines, and the increase of electric energy production by 15 million kilowatts. As a result of the fast pace of development, economic overheating naturally occurred. However, initial results have been achieved through the implementation of macroregulation and control measures which began last year. For example, the growth rate of capital construction was reduced from 70 percent in the year 1992-1993 to 20-30 percent in the year 1993-1994; the exchange rate of renminbi was kept at the level of 8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar; and the growth rate of the money supply was lowered from 100 percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Besides, since the tax-sharing system was introduced at the beginning of this year, the total tax revenue has increased by 22 percent. These figures are a clear indication that China's banking and financial sectors are moving toward stability. Cheng Ming-fun said that Zhu Rongji's briefing has boosted his confidence in China's economic environment and he believes now is a golden time for investing in China. Also, earlier today, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board of directors delegation to Beijing met separately with the persons in charge of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, exchanging views on economics, trade issues, and most-favored-nation trade status.
