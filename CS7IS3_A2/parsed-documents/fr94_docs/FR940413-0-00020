FR940413-0-00020 FR940413-0-00004 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;08&hyph;07 McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;8879. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;29&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F series airplanes equipped with Honeywell Flight Management Computers having part numbers 4059050&hyph;906, &hyph;907, and &hyph;908; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the airplane from failing to achieve sufficient climb gradient, which may result in the airplane failing to achieve obstacle clearance, accomplish the following: (a) Within 20 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Limitations Section (Section 1) of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), page 5&hyph;1, FLIGHT GUIDANCE, Flight Management System (FMS) Section, to include the following information. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD or an FAA-approved McDonnell Douglas AFM revision in the AFM. For any approved thrust level, the FMS computed V 1 , V R , and V 2 must be verified with AFM derived data, unless all of the following conditions are met: •Dry Runway. •Balanced Field Length. •Ice Protection OFF. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Operations Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Los Angeles ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Los Angeles ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) This amendment becomes effective on April 28, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on April 6, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8686 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
