Since then, influenced by the "4 June" effect, the HKDL has made a remarkable showing in all direct elections at all levels. While the HKDL at the time had only about 530 party members, including 80 who took part in the district parliamentary reelections, its success rate turned out to reach 70 percent. By the time of the first Legislative Council [LEGCO] direct elections, except for their defeat in the New Territories East election district, all other HKDL candidates won easily. But since the HKDL's victory in 1991, while it has been able to retain its position in most public opinion polls as the best-received political party, its real score is in a declining trend. Independent Congressman Liu Hui-ch'ing [0491 1979 0615] has outdone Li Chu-ming [2621 2691 6900] to become Hong Kong's best-received directly-elected congressman. Meanwhile, the Cooperative Resource Center [CRC], composed of 17 LEGCO members, has changed into the Liberal Party [LP]. As to number of party members alone, the LP has about 2,000 members, having replaced the HKDL as the political party with the largest membership. During the Sino-British controversy, the LP visited Beijing, proposing that the two countries might first resolve their dispute over the 1994 district parliamentary elections, only on which cooperative basis they could then deal with the more thorny "direct-service problem" of the makeup of LEGCO. Once they had obtained Chinese consent, they met with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten to promote their "first easy, then hard" negotiating plan. Such a mediation role was one that the HKDL was unable to play. But the HKDL has never seen the LP as its major election foe, as the major threat that it feels has come mainly from Hong Kong's left-faction forces. In the 1991 LEGCO elections, while the congressmen with close ties to Beijing all lost on the district front, a few such candidates, such as Ch'en Wan-hsien [7115 1238 8300] and Ch'eng Chieh-nan [4453 0094 0589], did remarkably well. Having assimilated the 1991 experience, the camp with close ties to Beijing officially established the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong [DABHK] on 10 July 1992. While the DABHK had only 57 founding members, there was no lack of figures with election potential. While they had lost to the HKDL in the earlier Executive Council [EXCO] by-election in the Southwest District, the very first time they raised the DABHK flag in an election, they showed their full organizational might in that district. In October 1993, not long after the independent "Commission on Elections and Election-District Boundaries" appointed by the Hong Kong Government had announced its division of the directly-elected seats in the 338-member 1994 district parliament, the DABHK's district members criticized it very quickly. Their officers indicated to the press that they were making active plans for the next year's district parliamentary elections. The differences between China and Britain on election plans for Hong Kong prior to 1995 remain very deep. The news released repeatedly by both sides on "plans to each go their own way" has led to much speculation. Some surmize that the DABHK might be forced to follow Beijing's line, by renouncing or even boycotting elections not approved by Beijing, to avoid being blamed for supporting Britain's conspiracy of "three violations." But as the DABHK had indicated as far back as at the time of its founding that it would take an active part in elections, its not taking part in elections arranged unilaterally by the British Hong Kong Government prior to 1997 would be a great blow to its future development. Moreover, the indications of recent DABHK words and deeds are that even if there is a final fallout between the Chinese and British, it will still launch a full-scale offensive in the coming three-levels of parliamentry elections. In fact, some directly-elected HKDL LEGCO members have also recently expressed privately that they are highly likely to use "one-on-one" tactics to counter the DABHK's "four great stars." These so-called "four great stars" are the DABHK's Ts'eng Yu-ch'eng [2582 6877 2052], T'an Yao-tsung [6223 5069 1350], Ch'eng Chieh-nan, and Ch'en Wan-hsien. Ts'eng Yu-ch'eng is one of the few DABHK's leaders who are fluent in English. Since elected party chief, he has become the unofficial international spokesman for the whole camp in Hong Kong with close ties to Beijing. While he received less votes than most current legislators, he has at least passed the first test of widespread name recognition. As to T'an Yao-tsung, he is currently DABHK's only voice in LEGCO. Since the 1991 direct elections, many analysts have all agreed that if the left faction at the time had even a litle daring, by having T'an Yao-tsung take part in the Kowloon-Central District election, and raising labor circles to give Ch'en Wan-hsien its functional-constituency seat, it was highly likely that they would both be elected at the same time. And while Ch'en Wan-hsien and Ch'eng Chieh-nan both lost in the 1991 elections, they still won more votes than DABHK candidates in other election districts. So it is quite understandable that the HKDL would regard these four as its strongest foes. The DABHK was also very conspicuous in various public opinion polls, with a political-party questionnaire by Hong Kong U's Social Science Studies Center showing the DABHK for the first time at the end of November 1992 jumping to the fifth best-received political party in Hong Kong, replacing right from the start the former ranking of the "Liberal Democratic Coalition" [LDC] to place fifth. In the year-plus since then, the DABHK's showing has fluctuated at around 43-46 percent, with no breakthroughs, generally tailing the HKDL, the "Democractic Livelihood Progressive Association" [DLPA], the Huitien [Collection Point] [CP], and the LP. But meanwhile, HKDL support is down from its 61 percent in early December 1991 to 55-56 percent recently. Certain key HKDL figures hold that it is a normal pheonomenon for a political party's public support to slide after a general-election victory, which is also often the case abroad. But HKDL's difficulties may be far more severe than it imagines. While the HKDL has always presented its image as the "forerunner of democracy," it has made absolutely no prgresss in the 1994 and 1995 election arrangements due to the Sino-British dispute. In other words, in the next election, it is going to be hard for the democracy faction not to lose the trust that it has built up over a long period of time in its platform of striving to speed up the pace of democracy. In addition, public studies are finding that as 1997 nears, Hong Kong residents seem increasingly able to accept the mainland Chinese regime. All of these factors might cause a loss of votes for the HKDL. The changes in the election system will also carry minuses for the democracy faction. After the change to a "system of one vote per seat" in 1995, certain current directly-elected members with less might will no longer be able to rely on the so-called "coattails effect," or be able to depend on the name-recognition of others to get elected. In fact, once the "one seat system" goes into effect, it is going to be hard for the HKDL to continue to coordinate its candidate list with other friendly organizations, such as CP and DLPA, with difficulty at the time avoiding a situation in which a third party profits from the struggle. This is particularly likely to occur in districts, such as Youchienwang, Tapu, and Shat'ien. Since the 1991 elections, the concern of the two large insider factions, the HKDL and the LP, has often been limited only to responding to immediate public events, leaving one with a sense that they lack long-range planning. At many times, individual members seem to be all-involved in daily parliamentary matters, leaving them unable to act freely. With 1994 here, congressmen of all political parties are starting to face reelection pressures, some of whom have talked about lacking time and energy, as their affairs in both parliament and their election districts are heavier than they had thought. On the other hand, the DABHK has only one LEGCO member, T'an Yao-tsung, leaving its other leaders without legislative pressures, so with much more time to do as they please in playing an opposition role outside of parliament. But while all political parties have been focusing on the elections in these two years, they have all been neglecting for several years a basic development direction. The "Hong Kong Youth Society" commissioned the Hong Kong U Social Science Studies Center to conduct in May 1993 a study of "young people's views on political organizations." They polled 558 young people between the ages of 15 and 29. While the results have not been widely noted by the media, the relevant data is certainly very enlightening about Hong Kong's future political developments. The poll showed that over 90 percent of those polled had not taken part in any activities sponsored by political organizations in the past year. And even when the political organizations that young people evaluate most highly issued them invitations, 70 percent said that they still could not accept. In addition, 60 percent of respondents stated that they would neither support political organizations with money or convey their views to them. While young people expressed much reservation about taking part in the body politic, nearly 60 percent of respondents over 17 years of age still said that they would vote in the coming elections. If the proposal to lower the voting age to 18 is finally approved, to include the group of young people who were just too young to vote in the 1991 LEGCO election, it is projected that those eligible to vote for the first time in the 1995 LEGCO election will make up about one-fifth of the whole electorate. And while their direction will be enough to impact the overall situation, not one political party in the last 3 years has worked hard for their support.
