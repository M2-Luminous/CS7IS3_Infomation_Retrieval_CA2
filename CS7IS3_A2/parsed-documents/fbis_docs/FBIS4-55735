He is accompanied by 500 citizens, including some war wounded and handicapped. [passage omitted] The Bosnian president spoke about tangible progress in the Bosnians' defense of their rights. He said: "You will see a change in the coming days." Izetbegovic announced his country's total rejection of occupied Brcko's inclusion in the safe areas. He said: "Brcko has a Muslim majority and this will continue to be the case. If it is not possible to retrieve it peacefully, we will work to do so by force of arms." He added that declaring it a safe area perpetuates the Serb occupation, which controls half of it. On the recent peace initiative, he stated sternly that "the international community cannot put further pressures on us, as we have offered sufficient concessions. We now believe that the shape of our future relies on our strength, God's help, and the support of our friends throughout the world, especially the Islamic world." Asked about the Bosnian Army's ability to liberate the Brcko area, he told AL-HAYAH: "I can now confirm that I am certain that we are capable of doing that, that the successes achieved by the Bosnian Army in recent days prove it, and that conditions are now different from past conditions." He announced his opposition to lifting economic sanctions on Serbia, even it accepts the new peace initiative. He said: "The real boycott is imposed on us through the arms embargo on us. Nevertheless, we have stood fast and begun to break the shackles, and you will see a tangible change in the coming days." On the contradiction between the powers to be exercised by the Bosnia-Herzegovina president and the federal union [al-ittihad al-fidrali] president, which will be held by a Croat, he said: "I am the president of all unified and internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The federal state is part of this state." The Bosnian president warned about the Serb forces' increasing violation of the fragile cease-fire agreement in and around Sarajevo. He added that the Serbs are exploiting international laxity to seize more Muslim territory in Bosnia, especially in central and north Bosnia. They are currently planning to initiate battles to seize Tuzla, as the day before yesterday Serb forces shelled the city of Kladanj, which is situated between Sarajevo and Tuzla to the north. Izetbegovic belittled the importance of the new European initiative, warning of overoptimism, as "the Serbs have persisted in breaking their promises as a result of Europe's sympathy with them." He appealed to the Islamic states to offer more material support and exert diplomatic efforts to try to lift the "arms embargo imposed on Muslims, in order to enable them to defend themselves."
