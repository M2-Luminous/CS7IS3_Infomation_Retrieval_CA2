De Leon said that last night after midnight the National Transport Coordinating Board [CNT] accepted the new rates proposed by the president for the transportation of fuel and cement. On 2 February, De Leon announced the Council of Ministers adjusted the current fuel transportation rates by 10 percent, and it ordered every carrier to have an insurance policy based on the number of gallons of gasoline or diesel transported. The president did not rule out the possibility of eliminating control over these rates, but the Energy and Mines Ministry is the institution in charge of setting wholesale prices. The CNT is in session and its leaders are expected to confirm or deny the suspension of the strike sometime day. The fuel truck drivers' strike caused a fuel shortage at city gas stations. Consequently, intercity and city buses could not circulate and street disturbances occurred. Hundreds of Guatemalans could not return to their communities, while others were forced to travel in trucks or privately-owned vehicles in uncomfortable and unsafe conditions.
