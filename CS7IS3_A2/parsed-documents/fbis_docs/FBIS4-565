For this reason, Interior Minister Bombet is getting ready to present a custom-made electoral law to Parliament. Article 3 of this law stipulates: Those eligible to vote are: Ivorian nationals of both sexes aged 21 before the closure of the voters' register, who enjoy full civil and political rights, and who are not disqualified to vote by law. Foreigners from the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] member countries, in accordance with the community's protocol on citizenship, whose names are in the voters' register. That is the PDCI's detonator. Obviously, the old party is demonstrating its desire to pitch the Ivorian people against foreigners because it knows that Ivorians have not yet forgotten the 1990 elections. The late Houphouet-Boigny stole their victory from the people by allowing these foreigners from neighboring countries to vote. How frustrating! However, if the people accepted their pain stoically, it was because it was caused by Houphouet-Boigny. This time, however, they do not know who their provoker is. Who says Ivorians are nonviolent. Beware! If the PDCI does not want foreigners in Cote d'Ivoire, it should drive them away itself. It must not use the hands of the freedom- and justice-loving people to do that. Frustrations at the elections have transformed peaceful Algerians into indomitable terrorists. As they see their hopes evaporate because the West has imposed freedom-stifling regimes on them, all they can do is to choose the path of violence. At least, that is what they believe so in Algeria no day passes by without the murder of at least two or three Westerners. Is that not driving foreigners away? The Ivorian people know that it is foreigners who imposed the PDCI on them in 1990 otherwise, this party, which has refused to organize fair elections, just has a few Ivorians within its ranks. Today, Eburneans [Ivorians] have decided to finish with their governors who have nothing to propose to them. They need change: new men and a new program. They should not be invited to the field of violence. The PDCI must be careful. The deputies who will be called upon to pass this fatal law must show a sense of moderation because no Army in the world, no matter its training, can thwart the legitimate aspirations of the people, especially when the people are provoked indefinitely. Let us look around us.
