[passage omitted] [Begin De Klerk recording, in English] It is indeed a very serious matter when some of the top management of a police force are implicated in deeds which obviously militate against the interests of the country, which are in direct contrast to what should take place. Therefore, I regard this report as--if the facts finally are proved to be fully correct -- as shocking. And resulting from that, I believe that very, very strong steps would then be needed. However, as you would have noted the report itself emphasizes the fact that nobody can be regarded as guilty, but that it does present strong prima facie evidence. As is customary under such circumstances, the government is called upon to take some immediate steps, firstly, in order to ensure that further investigations will not be hampered in any way and the first recommendation of the report also suggests that such steps should be taken. As a first step, I would like to announce that all those implicated in the findings of the commission, implicated in any unlawful act or aiding or abetting any unlawful act, or being involved in the whole plot and the activities described by the report, are immediately put on leave. We haven't had time to fully analyze the situation and to distinguish whether in some instances further immediate disciplinary action, going further than that, is justified. There are various options that one can look at. The government feels that the best option at this time, and this we will be discussing with the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], would be to immediately appoint a high-level international police investigation team, to simultaneously ask one of the attorney generals to work very closely with such a team, and to ask the TEC to nominate an expert, a jurist, to also together with the attorney general, work very closely with this investigation team. They will obviously have the support, inasmuch as they require it, of the South African Police. This is the first time where we have evidence through the Goldstone Commission, and the Goldstone Commission was inter alia created to deal with these allegations about a third force -- this is the first time that such prima facie evidence is laid before us, and I am now keeping my promise and that is to take immediate action. I would also like to highlight the fact that the report itself emphasizes that we have....[pauses] We are dealing here with the possibility of a relatively small group of people, and any conclusion that this means that the South African Police force, as a force, is involved in political violence would be more than grossly unfair. [end recording] The kwaZulu Police commissioner, Lieutenant General Roy During, this afternoon denied that his police force received any weapons from General Smit, who has now been placed on compulsory leave. [Begin recording] [During, in English] No, I'm afraid not. We have spare arms. I'm sure we could use them in kwaZulu, but there is most certainly no contact between myself and Basie Smit with regard to arms or arms deals at all. [Unidentified correspondent] Doesn't kwaZulu basically get their arms from South Africa? They work with the South African Police, don't they? [During] Well, I'm afraid I'm not going to give away our secrets -- where we get our arms from -- but we have our suppliers in South Africa, yes. [end recording]
