Romanenko, Hydrobiology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 577.34(282.243.7)] [Abstract] The keynote address to the 19th International Congress of the International Danube Limnology Association (MAD) held in Kiev on 15-21 Sep. 91 is reviewed. Ten reports submitted to the ``Radiology'' section, seven of which are directly related to studying the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident and the other three are dealing with the radionuclide migration between the aqueous medium and bottom sediments, geological and hydrogeological structures of the earth surface and its vegetation, the effect of radiation on humans, etc., are summarized. In particular, the process of radioactive cloud formation due to the release of short- and long-lived radionuclides from the depressurized reactor is tentatively divided into four phases. All reports by scientists from four Danube nations presented to the section address the water ecosystem conditions of the Danube basin; emphasis is placed on the radioecological conditions which have formed in the basin of the largest European river contaminated by the Chernobyl catastrophe. The daily radioactive substance discharge into the atmosphere in the first days after the accident, the radionuclide composition of these discharges, the cesium and strontium accumulation coefficients in some ecosystem components, and the [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs concentration in the Danube water are summarized, and the radioactive fallout pattern during the early days after the accident is plotted. It is noted that despite its scope, the review is not intended to address all aspects of the problem of radionuclide spread through the Danube and Dnepr ecosystem and is merely aimed at presenting the principal findings and conclusions.
