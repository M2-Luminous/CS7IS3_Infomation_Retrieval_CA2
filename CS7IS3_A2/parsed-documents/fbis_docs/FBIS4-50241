General Principles Article 1. These regulations are established to build a corps of military officers who are more revolutionary, younger in average age, better educated, and professionally more competent, in order to help the People's Liberation Army [PLA] accomplish the mission entrusted by the state. Article 2. PLA active duty officers are active duty service members who have been appointed to a post at or above the platoon level or to a professional technical post at or above the junior level, and on whom a commensurate military rank has been conferred. According to the nature of their jobs, officers are of four categories -- military officers, political officers, logistics officers, and professional technical officers. Article 3. In selecting and using officers, we must adhere to the principle of appointing people on their merits; ensure those selected have both political integrity and ability, and have performed well; exchange officers in a timely manner; and adopt a democratic supervision system. Article 4. The state decides various remuneration for officers according to the principle of giving preferential treatment to active duty service members. Article 5. Officers who meet the requirements stipulated in these regulations concerning retiring from active duty should retire from active duty. Article 6. The PLA General Political Headquarters is in charge of the management of all officers; political organs of units at or above the regiment level are in charge of the management of officers of their respective units. Chapter II. Basic Requirements and Training of Active Duty Officers Article 7. Officers must meet the following basic requirements: (1) Be loyal to the motherland; willing to wholeheartedly serve the people; and able to self-consciously dedicate themselves to national defense work. (2) They must abide by the constitution, law, and relevant regulations; carry out the state's principles and policies, and abide by military regulations and system; and obey order and command. (3) They must have the theoretical level, ability to understand policy, scientific knowledge, educational level, professional knowledge, and organizing and command ability required to carry out their assigned job; and have good health. (4) They must cherish soldiers, be fair and upright, be honest in performing official duties, and be willing to work hard and to sacrifice themselves. Article 8. The PLA adopts the system in which officers are selected after receiving training at a military academy. Military, political, and logistics officers who are at a command post below the battalion level should have been trained at a junior-level command academy; those who are at a command post at the regimental and division level should have been trained at an intermediate-level command academy; and those who are at a command post at or above the army level should have been trained at a high- level command academy. Officers who are office workers should have been trained at a pertinent military academy. Professional technical officers should have been trained at a special technical school at a level commensurate to their job. Outstanding soldiers may be promoted as officers after receiving training at a military academy. Article 9. If officers trained by military academies cannot meet demand, outstanding soldiers may be selected for training at other training organs designated by PLA general departments and may be promoted as officers after they successfully complete the training courses. Or, graduates of institutes of higher learning other than military academies, and professional technical personnel may be recruited and appointed officers. During wartime, soldiers, drafted reserve service officers, and personnel of non-military departments may also be directly appointed officers. Chapter III. Evaluation, Appointment and Removal of Active Service Officers Article 10. The principal leading officers and political organs at various levels should evaluate officers under their jurisdiction according to the principle of division of work with individual responsibility. The method of integrating the evaluation of officers by both leading officers and the masses should be adopted in evaluations. It is necessary to evaluate officers in an all-around way in accordance with the basic conditions for officers and the criteria for evaluating officers set by the Central Military Commission, with their actual work performances as the main basis for evaluation. The results of evaluations shall be used as the main basis for appointing or removing officers. The appointment and removal of officers must be done following the evaluation of officers in question, and must not be done without due evaluation. Article 11.

When there are vacant posts due to other reasons, the leading officers at the higher level may also temporarily assign other officers to fill the vacant posts. The temporary removal or assignment of officers due to the above conditions should be reported to the higher level units with the power of appointing or removing officers, which will review and make a decision in order to complete the procedures for appointment or removal of officers.
