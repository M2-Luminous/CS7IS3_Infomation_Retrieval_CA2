During the weekly PAN news conference, presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos spoke about events in Chiapas and called on other presidential candidates: [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] In view of the latest violent events in Chiapas, I believe there should be, not only from me but from all presidential candidates, respect and basic prudence not to take advantage of this painful moment to try and gain an advantage. [end recording] The other topic discussed during the PAN news conference had to do with the presidential candidates' debates. Fernandez de Cevallos rejected the proposal that the nine candidates debate in two sessions. [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I said that I do not reject that all candidates appear. What I protest is the intention to reduce the discussion of the country's major conflicts and topics to only two appearances. It is not possible, even with the country's modern communications system and especially with the high expectations generated, that these debates be reduced to two appearances for all presidential candidates. It is not fair, it is not correct, and it is not democratic. [end recording]
