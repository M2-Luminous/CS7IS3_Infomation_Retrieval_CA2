He added that the Chinese side was quite disappointed and regretful about what the British side had done to undermine the talks. When answering reporters' questions today, Lu Ping said: From the material published by the Foreign Ministry, everyone can see that the Chinese Government was really sincere and honest in the talks and that the Chinese side made the greatest efforts to reach an agreement with the British side. From the materials, everyone can see that the British side had no sincerity since the beginning of the talks. The Chinese side was willing to talk with the British side on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements because it hoped that China and Britain could cooperate on the question of a steady transition and bring about a steady transition in 1997. This was the "through train" concept. Lu Ping criticized the British side lack of sincerity and for causing the talks to break down. Therefore, the Chinese side is quite disappointed and regretful about this. He stressed that under this situation--a situation in which the British side is not cooperating--the Chinese side will make efforts to carry out Hong Kong's steady transition in 1997, adding that this was also the Chinese side's objective in its future work.
