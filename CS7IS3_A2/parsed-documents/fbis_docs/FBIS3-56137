The movement warned the president that since the government was being cut primarily at the expense of the reform-minded wing, "a real threat looms over reform yet another time." "In the emerging situation we have to warn you that Democratic Russia, true to its principled views, will have to reconsider the question of its support for the course pursued by the president and the government," said the letter signed by the movement's cochairmen, Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin.
