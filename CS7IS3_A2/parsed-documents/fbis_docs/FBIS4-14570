Vladimir Lukin on How One Should Join the `Partnership for Peace' Program"] [Text] Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee, at a press conference in the lower chamber of the Russian parliament yesterday suggested that a number of terms on Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program should be included in the presentation document now being prepared. The parliamentarian thinks that Russia can take part in the NATO decisionmaking mechanism only as an equal partner of the North Atlantic Treaty. Lukin is also convinced that the process of formalizing the "Partnership for Peace" program should take into account Russia's obligations in connection with the creation of a collective security system of CIS countries. It should also be specified how peacekeeping operations are going to be carried through, in what way processes are going to be coordinated, and what is the role of the Russian command. On the questions of standardization of armaments under the "Partnership for Peace" program, Mr. Lukin thought that these problems should be solved "with both sides' interests being taken into consideration." The parliamentarian suggests a phased system to finance the program because, according to him, Russia now would hardly be able to participate fully in its financing. Mr. Lukin also underlined that Russia would have to persuade China that "we are not joining any military bloc against them." Besides, he pointed out, as a Eurasian country, Russia should "talk with China about the creation of a security system" which is to be bilateral or with the six countries taking part -- China, Japan, Russia, two Korean states, and the United States.
