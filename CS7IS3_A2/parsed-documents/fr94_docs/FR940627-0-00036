FR940627-0-00036 FR940627-0-00009 b. Inclusion of Receipt Points The National Registry contends that receipt point information should be included because discounts may sometimes depend on the point at which gas enters the system. The Commission, however, will not include receipt points because receipt point information is often voluminous. If in a particular case, a discount is based on the receipt point used, that condition would be disclosed as a condition for granting the discount. c. Disclosure of Non-Affiliate Discounts Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission require posting of non-affiliate discount information on the EBB within 15 days of the commencement of service. KGPC also suggests that the Commission should replace the affiliate reporting requirements with a general requirement for EBB posting of all interruptible transactions. The Commission will not require posting of non-affiliate information, because information on discounts to non-affiliates is unrelated to the goal of the reporting requirements_to permit non-affiliates to monitor affiliate discounts for possible discrimination. A non-affiliate need not have access to other non-affiliate information to monitor affiliate transactions; the non-affiliate can compare any affiliate discounts with the rate the non-affiliate pays. The non-affiliate information will be available to the Commission upon request, under ยง250.16, should the Commission need to compare the discounts offered to affiliates and non-affiliates in investigating a complaint of discrimination. E. Standard G & Standard K (New Standard J)_Separation of Operating Employees and Books of Account Current Standards G and K require that the operating employees of pipelines and affiliates function independently to the maximum extent practicable and that the books of account for the pipelines and affiliates be maintained separately. Tenneco contends these provisions are unnecessary after Order No. 636, because pipelines are required by Order No. 636 to unbundle sales from transportation service and, therefore, must establish separate operations and staffs. Moreover, as a practical matter, it contends employees making day-to-day decisions regarding gas transportation will not be making decisions for the affiliate. By requiring separation of operating personnel to the maximum extent practicable, Standard G complements the other Standards of Conduct by reducing the possibility that information will improperly be shared with an affiliate. Tenneco is correct that in Order No. 636, the Commission did adopt new regulations under Part 284 that, like Standard G, require pipelines to ensure that their unbundled sales operating personnel operate independently from its transportation operating personnel. 45 But these regulations do not apply to marketing affiliates, and, therefore, Standard G still is needed to ensure adequate separation of pipeline and marketing affiliate personnel. 45 18 CFR 284.286. Standard J's requirement for separation of books of account is needed to permit scrutiny of costs so that affiliate costs are not shifted to the pipeline's rate base and recovered from the pipeline's transportation customers. VII. Tariff Requirements A. Shared Operating Personnel Section 250.16(b)(1)(i) requires pipelines to maintain in their tariffs a list of operating personnel shared by the pipelines and their affiliates, which, under ยง250.16(d)(2), they must update quarterly, if any changes occur. The NOPR proposed to continue this requirement. CNG and Panhandle Eastern Pipelines request clarification that the pipelines will not be required to make quarterly filings if no changes in shared personnel or facilities have occurred. The Commission agrees that a filing need only be made if changes have occurred. B. Request For Service Information The Commission proposed to eliminate the requirement, in current ยง250.16(b)(1)(ii), that pipelines include in their tariffs the information required for a valid request for service, including the information required for the Form No. 592 affiliate transportation log. Indicated Parties suggest this provision be retained, so parties will know what must be included in a valid request for service. They assert that, as far they can determine, this requirement is not duplicated in other regulations and that such information is important, because a valid request for service is often a prerequisite for participation in the capacity release program. The Commission finds that the requirement for pipelines to include information needed for a valid service request is no longer related to affiliate abuse. Under the previous regulations, pipelines were required to report certain information about shippers that the pipelines could obtain only through the transportation request form. 46 Under this rule, the Commission is no longer requiring pipelines to report these categories of information, and, therefore, a tariff provision requiring shippers to disclose such information is no longer needed. The Commission notes, however, that, under Part 284, pipelines must have tariff provisions that provide for equality of transportation service, with reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for acquiring such service. 47 To comply with these requirements, the pipelines still must have tariff provisions describing the procedures necessary to request service and participate in the capacity release program. 46 For example, for each transportation transaction reported on Form No. 592, pipelines were required to report the supplier of gas, the end-user, and whether or not the gas was subject to take-or-pay relief. This information would be known by the shippers, not the pipeline. The requirement for shippers to complete the transportation request form to obtain service ensured that the pipelines would obtain the necessary information from the shipper. 47 See 18 CFR 284.8, 284.9, 284.14.
