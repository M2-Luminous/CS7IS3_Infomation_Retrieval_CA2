Andreyev, V.V. Vaynshteyn, Yu.V. Mostovoy, Yu.D. Zharkovskiy and M.F. Podlipalin (NIKIMT) under the ``Problems, Search, Solutions'' rubric] [Abstract] The article deals with problems of improving the safety of RBMK reactors, particularly RBMK 1000. Due to the effect of the neutron flux the geometric shape and dimensions of graphite stacking blocks and fuel channels (FC) change the hole diameter of graphite blocks decreases, the graphite stacking contracts, and the FC diameter increases. The result decreased clearance between the FCs and graphite stacking. The design clearance between the FC and graphite stacking in the first unit reactor of the Leningrad AES decreased prematurely because the actual rate of change of the above parameters exceeded the design rate. A decision was made to replace all fuel channels and bore out graphite stacking holes for the channels. The repair work took 10 months and was done during a single reactor shut down. A technological process of restoring the clearance was developed; it is described in great detail. Repair equipment and fixtures were designed at NIKIMT, VNIIAES and TsNIITS [expansions not given] and LAES [Leningrad AES] and manufactured at NIKIMT, NIKIET, VNIIAES, NPO ``Krasnaya zvezda'', PNITI, FEI, TsKBM [expansion not given], LAES and IAE [Atomic Energy Institute] imeni Kurchatov enterprises. Main types of equipment used for the repair (the cutting mechanism, welding equipment and repair fixtures used for FC replacement and boring of graphite blocks) are described.
