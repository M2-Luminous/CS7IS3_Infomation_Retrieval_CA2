In his exclusive interview with Interfax he pointed out that coordination of these structures' activity has actually begun. "The main thing which is being carried out in this aspect is coordination of economic platforms contained in the address and developed at the hearings in the State Duma's Economic Policy Committee." Satarov reported that a joint work, being fulfilled by leader of the group of presidential economic experts Aleksandr Livshits and head of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Glazyev, has started. In addition, other members of the "presidential team" also undertake joint moves together with representatives of the Duma's other committees. Following the analysis of the situation after the adoption of the State Duma resolution on amnesty, the parliamentary structures have found a new model of interaction, noted Satarov. "There is an agreement to create permanent working groups. Their task is to make active the initial stage of preparation of the most important legislative acts," he said. The question concerns, for example, federal constitutional laws, he explained and added that, as a rule, contradictions preventing efficient work appear at the initial stage. "We have discussed the new model of interaction with the Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. I highly appreciate his statement during his recent meeting with Yeltsin when Rybkin said that the presidential and legislative structures have never before worked in such a close coordination," stressed Satarov. In his opinion, "this spirit of a team" should become a norm. "The cliche -- president plus parliament equals confrontation -- is left in the past. The barricades on the way to a normal work have not been entirely removed, however, they do not appeal to anybody any more," underlined Satarov. The democratic society on the way to formation can propose quite unusual "scenarios," said Satarov. For example, there may be situations when such forces as the president, parliament, and government will be forced to bar by some other means than earlier. [sentence as received] For example, the president and Duma will be forced to oppose the government on several issues, said Satarov. Satarov also reported that in the near term the State Duma would receive a package of bills, 50 in number, which Boris Yeltsin proposes to consider in the parliament's lower chamber this year. As he said, these documents can be divided into three blocks. The first one is connected with the continuation of the juridical reform and includes the Civil and Criminal Codes, several decrees on labor, magistrates, etc. The "economic" block is devoted to the bank system, to problems of securities, exchanges, and audits. The third package of documents concerns measures connected with building of a democratic society and, in particular, with legislature on political parties. The president offers to the State Duma not only the list but the priority to consider these documents, explained Satarov. In the first block Yeltsin draws attention of deputies to the need to consider the Civil Code and legislative initiatives closely related to crime fighting. Satarov said that among priority problems of the economic reform Yeltsin enumerates a package of acts connected with reformation of the bank activity and creation of Federal reserve system. "If we could judge from the sharpness of debates to be waged around the contents of the third package, the draft decree on political parties will obviously become the central one," believes Satarov. Uncontrolled growth of parties, peculiar to Russia, becomes "a destabilizing factor in the life of the society," he said. The lawmaking itself should stimulate such a development of multiparty trends which will channel the process along the way of formation of a small number of strong parties, said Satarov.
