Faustin Twagiramungu explained to correspondent Monique Mas that he hopes the opposition forces will meet and work together: [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] We are in contact with those who have remained in Rwanda in the liberated areas, as well as with those who are in Brussels. Therefore, we think that it is absolutely necessary to set up a coordination committee formed by all these forces and to try to act and do something so the Rwandan people know that the opposition still exists and intends to carry out its activities and assume its responsibility as an alternative to the regime. [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution to the Rwandan problem? [Twagiramungu] The military solution can be looked at from one angle. What we say today is that the army and the gendarmerie commands failed to put an end to the massacres perpetrated throughout the country. If this situation continues, it is obvious that all political forces and military forces that are able to introduce change and improve the situation will be absolutely welcome. [end recording]
