The Seller shall take out and maintain throughout the contract period insurance of the following types and minimum amounts: (a) Workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance, as required by law, covering all their employees who perform any of the obligations of the contractor, engineer, and architect under the contract.

(b) Public liability insurance covering all operations under the contract shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million each occurrence, limits for property damage of not less than $1 million each occurrence, and $1 million aggregate for accidents during the policy period.

In any such event, the additional premium or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price. The policies of insurance shall be in such form and issued by such insurer as shall be satisfactory to the Owner.
