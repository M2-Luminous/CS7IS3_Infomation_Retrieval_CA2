We have discussed a few theoretical problems and found several joint points of interest. I am referring to political, military, and mainly technical-military aspects, such as the training of cadres and methods of training cadres. We also discussed complex technical-military issues and ways to coordinate actions, carry out joint maneuvers, and ensure an exchange of experience. Today I visited the educational institution of the Romanian Navy. There, we discussed issues regarding our bilateral relations and our views about issues that are of great interest to both sides. We drafted a number of conventions regarding cooperation between us, between our countries, such as the accord on cooperation between the two military departments. We also broached issues regarding the concept of and our participation in the Partnership for Peace, which both we and Romania have signed, and we agreed that this is a first stage and then, we will have to participate in NATO, but for this new stage we will have to prepare new proposals. I am referring to military issues and the issues of our departments. Thus, in general I am very pleased with this visit because 70 percent of the issues we broached have been solved during my stay here, after one and a half days, and we still have a few visits scheduled. Our relations are excellent. Yesterday we held talks with the minister of defense and today with the foreign minister. Yesterday we discussed economic issues of mutual interest with the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu]. He will soon pay a visit to Ukraine. We also have a meeting scheduled with Romania's president. In the evening we will meet with the chief of staff [Dumitru Cioflina], with whom we will discuss strictly military issues.
