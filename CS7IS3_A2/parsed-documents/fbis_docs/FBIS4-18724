[passage omitted] A Belgian government official in Brussels confirmed the fighting in Kigali between the the Rwandan Patriotic Front and army troops. He said the Belgian cabinet would probably meet later Friday to decide whether to evacuate Belgian civilians from Rwanda, what troops to provide for the operation and how to coordinate the operation with the United Nations. The official, who asked not to be identified, said: "It is difficult to assess the scale of the fighting. Nobody can leave their homes to find out what is going on." He said the timing of the Belgian cabinet meeting would depend on the return here of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene from vacation in Malta and Foreign Minister Willy Claes from an official visit to Romania. Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers were executed in Kigali on Thursday after trying to protect Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana from elements of the Rwandan presidential guard, their commander, Colonel Luc Marchal, said. The prime minister was assassinated. There are between 400 and 500 Belgians in the 2,500-strong United Nations force in Rwanda.
