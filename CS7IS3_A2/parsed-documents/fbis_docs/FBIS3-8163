The federation would for the time being encompass predominantly Croat and Bosnian-populated areas, while Serb controlled areas would have the opportunity to either join the federation or join the peace process and find appropriate solutions, through which the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina is always emphasized. The essence lies in the fact that the constitutional system should be transformed into a new form of a cantonal type, in which federal units would be cantons and would be set up exclusively on an ethnic basis. This national element was taken into consideration. The essence lies in the fact that a number of cantons should be set up in which important state competences would be discharged. The central government would have much wider competences than envisaged by the Vance-Owen and the Owen-Stoltenberg plans. The central government's competences include the Armed Forces, foreign affairs, issues related to the monetary system, the economic market, the free flow of goods and capital, issues concerning citizenship, managing resources, and so on. This is a wide range of competences. The second range of competences would be realized through the cooperation between the central authorities and the cantonal authorities; it would include an infrastructure shared by several cantons and cooperation in a series of other fields. On the cantonal level, state bodies would be set up: from the assembly to the executive bodies and judiciary. Cantonal competences would cover everything that has not been enumerated on the level of central authorities and central-cantonal cooperation. Within each canton there would be municipalities; they would have their local self-administration. A special arrangement has been agreed upon in this regard: Municipalities where the majority population is not the majority population of the canton would have a special status, a much higher degree of autonomy than other municipalities within the same canton. The intention of the council here is to work further on the principles laid down in the Washington agreement, initially referring to the constitution of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. An eventual agreement on the confederation with the Republic of Croatia should also be prepared, and then military experts should work on military arrangements and other measures should be examined with Croatia for the new constitutional order.
