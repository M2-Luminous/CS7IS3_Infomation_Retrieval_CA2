In a joint letter to the Parliament in The Hague on Tuesday [28 June], Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans and Defense Minister Relus ter Beek wrote "that in its foreign policy the Government must orient itself more strongly toward the position of the FRG in Europe and the developments in German domestic policy." The letter continues: "In view of the fact that the Netherlands and Germany have many common interests and that many of their foreign policy goals are identical, there is certainly reason to strive for even more intensive cooperation. Because of the differences in the status of the two countries -- the Netherlands is no big power and only one of Germany's nine neighbors -- a German-Dutch relationship comparable to the German-French axis is not realistic." Over the past weeks the relationship between Bonn and The Hague has cooled down considerably because Chancellor Helmut Kohl did not support Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' candidacy for the succession of European Union Commission President Jacques Delors. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Wim Kok noted during the European Union summit in Corfu over the weekend: "Relations are tense." Obviously a lot of anger about the Netherlands has accumulated in Bonn over the past years. "We have to talk about this," Kok said.
