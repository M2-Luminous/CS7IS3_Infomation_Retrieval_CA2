Goplachev; date and place not given: "The Vigilance of the Procurator's Eye"] [Text] January and February are the time for summing up the results of the previous year, including results in law enforcement agencies. The results of 1993 were summed up by the republic procuracy. There was a thorough discussion of the procurators' performance in overseeing the enforcement of laws and securing the primacy of laws, the socioeconomic liberties of citizens, and the rights of the republic. Attention was focused on shortcomings in the work, unsolved problems, and the means of solving them. Procurator R.I. Abazov of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic was interviewed a few days ago. [Goplachev] Ruslan Ismelovich, attempts to evaluate the performance of law enforcement agencies in quantitative terms usually produce comparatively objective results. What can you tell us about some of the results of the past year, using these evaluations as a basis? [Abazov] I want to start with the following comment. Everyone still remembers the tragic events of last year. These events, which were caused by the confrontation between two branches of the federal government, certainly could have moved to the regional level. In our republic this was averted by the efforts of our leaders and the wisdom of the people living here. Now I will answer your question in more specific terms. Procurators discovered 860 violations, challenged 289 unlawful legal instruments, and filed 251 reports for the elimination of these violations. They instituted 535 suits for 380 million rubles on behalf of state and public organizations and institutions. [Goplachev] There is valid public concern about the rising crime rate in the economic sphere. I have a question about three aspects of this: the protection of state property and the violations committed during privatization and in foreign economic activity. [Abazov] Equipment, vehicles, and other assets worth tens of millions of rubles fell into the hands of private firms and small enterprises as a result of the negligence of some administrators in maintaining state property and the late discovery of these incidents by municipal and rayon procurators. Cases of this were discovered at the Kabbalkproyektstroy Association, the Baksan Consumer Goods Combine, the Terskiy Meat and Dairy Product Combine, and other enterprises. Measures are being taken now to recover the illegally acquired state property. Procurators conducted 27 inspections of compliance with state and private property laws, discovered 118 violations, and filed 15 reports. The inspection of compliance in the sphere of privatization was extremely productive. Although the republic managed to avoid "wholesale" privatization, around 30 violations were found and 18 reports were filed. Decisions on the sale of state property or other forms of traffic in this property were frequently made without going through the proper channels. Municipal and rayon procurators did not have the necessary information about the state of legality in this sphere and could not influence the activities of the rayon committee for the management of state property in sufficiently effective ways. A comprehensive inspection in an area as new to us as foreign economic activity produced positive results. We were able to draft specific proposals to improve the mechanism of foreign economic operations. Many enterprises and organizations engaged in this activity are not pursuing the goals that were set when they were founded: the attraction of advanced technology to the republic economy and the provision of the consumer market with adequate supplies of goods. The overwhelming majority of joint ventures and private firms are conducting trade and foreign economic operations not on a permanent and concrete basis, but in sporadic barter transactions, frequently ignoring the applicable limits imposed on export and interregional deliveries by authorized agencies, including the procuracy. [Goplachev] How would you rate the state of republic agriculture? [Abazov] The state of affairs in the republic agroindustrial complex is seriously disturbing. The theft and loss of products and the harvest are still widespread. Just last year around 9,000 head of cattle in the republic died or were stolen. Farms in Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, Chegemskiy, Urvanskiy, and Prokhladnenskiy rayons suffered the most damage. The measures procurators took were far from adequate: Only 37 suits for 1.5 million rubles in compensation were instituted for the dead cattle. [Goplachev] How effective has procuracy intervention been in preventing violations of social laws? [Abazov] Inspections revealed flagrant violations in the distribution of housing and telephones in Nalchik. The municipal procuracy knew about these cases but confined its response to filed reports. It was not until the republic procuracy intervened that suits were instituted to invalidate orders and evict citizens from illegally occupied apartments. The republic procuracy lodged the necessary protests with the Nalchik municipal administration, and dozens of citizens lost their illegally installed telephones. [Goplachev] How are things with regard to felonies? [Abazov] Regrettably, I have nothing good to report to the readers of KABARDINO-BALKARSKAYA PRAVDA. Although the overall crime rate was relatively stable (0.6 percent below the 1992 figure), there has been an increase in felonies in the republic, including homicide (+57.4 percent), the intentional infliction of serious bodily injury (+18.6 percent), rape and attempted rape (+60.5 percent), mugging (+55.6 percent), and vandalism (+52.2 percent). The number of these crimes has risen in all cities and rayons in the republic. They now account for 17.9 percent of all crimes. In all, 7,681 crimes were reported in the republic. An increase in crime was recorded in Prokhladnenskiy, Terskiy, Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, and Sovetskiy rayons. Last year was marked by an unprecedented rise in the homicide rate (from 61 to 96 cases). Furthermore, one out of every three has not been solved. The number of homicides increased most dramatically in Nalchik--from 19 to 42 (+121 percent); 17 of these, or 40.4 percent, have not been solved. There were more homicides in Terskiy, Urvanskiy, Mayskiy, Chegemskiy, Zolskiy, and Sovetskiy rayons. The rise (73.1 percent) in the number of crimes committed with the use of loaded firearms (one out of every three homicides) is particularly disturbing. The weapons generally come from outside Kabardino-Balkaria, which still has "transparent" borders, despite the presence of checkpoints on access roads from adjacent territories. [Goplachev] How vigilant is the procurator's eye in discovering wrongful dismissals of criminal cases? [Abazov] Last year procurators discovered 135 crimes which were removed from police records by the issuance of unlawful decisions to drop criminal charges. Procurators filed 173 reports on the violations, leading to disciplinary actions against 109 officials. The oversight of criminal cases by the procuracy, however, was also inadequate. This is attested to by the increasing number of dismissed cases. Procuracy personnel dismissed 30.4 percent of all cases. This is an impermissible luxury. [Goplachev] Children are also involved in crime.... [Abazov] The overall rate of juvenile crime has decreased by 5 percent. There was an increase in Nalchik and in Prokhladnenskiy, Zolskiy, Sovetskiy, and Chegemskiy rayons. There are still too many cases in which juveniles are framed for crimes. A case in Nalchik is a good example: When the 9-year-old Karatsukov was "railroaded" for 10 thefts of personal property, including such items as a television set, a rug measuring 3 x 4 meters, and a crate of champagne, no one even wondered how this "miscreant" could have carried these items. [Goplachev] The procuracy presses charges, and the criminal is convicted. Then what happens? [Abazov] The punishment is usually left up to the courts, but the penalty is not always administered in a timely or satisfactory manner, and laws are sometimes broken during this phase. The group overseeing corrective labor institutions and the procurators conducted 87 inspections and filed 33 reports on the results. There are still numerous violations of prisoners' rights in camps No 1 and No 3, leading to the commission of crimes, and the absence of work precludes corrective labor. There was an excessively formal approach to the oversight of the activities of the corrective labor institutions department of the republic Ministry of Internal Affairs, where standards were relaxed and other violations were committed. These led to the mass disturbances in March. Then the case of the suspect who had been held illegally for eight months came to light in December. The procuracy lodged a protest and the guilty parties were punished. [Goplachev] Did the economic reform affect your work? [Abazov] The intensification of economic reform and the democratic changes in the society transferred the protection of the interests of economic entities and the majority of civil rights to the jurisdiction of arbitration boards and people's courts, increasing their workload and, consequently, the possibility of judicial error. This called for intense work by the Division of Civil Suit Oversight and by local procurators. The effectiveness of the appeals process to protest unlawful rulings was improved slightly. [Goplachev] Is the procuracy involved in the exoneration of victims of political repression? [Abazov] In accordance with the requirements of the Law "On the Exoneration of Victims of Political Repression," the republic procuracy has worked with security and internal affairs agencies to restore the reputation of innocent victims. The files of 422 people were reviewed. Decisions on exoneration were made in 289 cases. The majority of exoneration orders have not been delivered yet, however, and have not been requested, despite the coverage of the review of these cases on radio and television and in the press. [Goplachev] What can you tell us about your personnel problems? [Abazov] Six of the ten municipal and rayon procurators are serving their second constitutional term. Last year three staff members of procuracy agencies were elected to the republic Constitutional Court and two were elected to the Kabardino-Balkar Parliament. We are proud of this. Ten staffers were promoted to higher offices after their performance evaluations. I would like to discuss two extremely important personnel problems we cannot solve without considerable assistance from the republic leadership and the Procuracy General. One is the urgent need for a new building or new premises for the republic procuracy, because our staff is several times the size it was when our present building was designed. Besides this, our staff was increased by another 23 positions in the new year. The distinctive features of our work, particularly our investigative work, require each inspector to have an office of his own, but our present offices have to be shared by two or three people. Meanwhile, the Nalchik municipal procuracy does not even have a building of its own and half of its staff has to do its work in a residential building. We also have no facility for meetings of the whole staff. Problems in securing housing for procuracy personnel have not been solved either, especially in the city of Nalchik. The Law "On the Procuracy in the Russian Federation" says that the local administration must supply procuracy personnel requiring better living conditions with the appropriate living area as soon as possible, or within six months in the case of newly appointed personnel. We have not received a single apartment in the city of Nalchik in recent years, although one out of every three members of our staff needs one. [Goplachev] What would you like to say in conclusion? [Abazov] I want to express satisfaction with the adoption of the constitutions of the Russian Federation and Kabardino-Balkar Republic at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. These exceptionally important documents will serve as a sound legal foundation for the stabilization of economic and political conditions and reinforce the legal system and the administration of justice. The individual has been granted broader rights and freedoms. The Constitution reaffirmed the organizational principle of the procuracy as a single centralized system. Edicts of the Russian Federation president assigned the procuracy the functions of coordinating the activities of law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime and granted our personnel various types of social protection. We will evaluate our own performance from the standpoint of the requirements engendered by these changes.
