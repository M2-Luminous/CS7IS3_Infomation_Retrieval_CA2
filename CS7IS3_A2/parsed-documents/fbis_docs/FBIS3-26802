Chiao Jen-ho, secretary-general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation, and Tang Shubei, vice director of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, ended their five-day talks in Beijing on Saturday [5 February] with the issuance of a statement saying that agreement had been reached on ways to handle three controversial issues. The three issues are the sending back of airplane hijackers, the returning of illegal immigrants, and fishing disputes. These topics were on the agendas of previous talks between the SEF and the ARAT'S but the two sides had been divided on how to deal with them. The negotiators also agreed at the Beijing talks that an official pact will be signed after the exact wording of the pact is decided in the next round of talks later this year. All this can be seen as a breakthrough. Previous contacts between the SEF and the ARATS had all failed to yield any concrete results. This is only the beginning. There is still a long way to go before a warm, brotherly relationship is established across the Taiwan Strait. But the breakthrough, however small, is better than nothing in view of the long, bitter confrontation between Taiwan and the mainland. The main obstacle to better progress by SEF and ARATS negotiators is the sovereignty issue. While Beijing insists it has sovereignty over Taiwan, Taipei maintains that the mainland regime has no political or legal authority over the island. This and other sharp political differences have prevented the SEF and the ARAT'S from settling a wide range of issues concerning relations between the two sides. The impasse must be broken if a favorable situation is to be created for China's reunification -- the hope of all patriotic Chinese. At the news conference he held last Friday, Premier Lien Chan noted the importance of working for reunification of the nation, and stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not treat each other in an eat-or-be-eaten manner. He has a point. At a time when Chinese around the world are anxious for China's reunification, Taipei and Beijing should work aggressively to overcome all the barriers to the achievement of the goal. Taiwan and the mainland, in negotiating for better ties, should put aside the sovereignty issue. If both sides treat each other with more trust, understanding, sympathy and respect, they will be better able to solve the many seemingly unsolvable problems troubling Taiwan-mainland interaction. The sovereignty issue will probably sort itself out when eventually a reunification arrangement is worked out that is advantageous to both sides.
