The government also reportedly decided that North Korea's acceptance of this special inspection be made a precondition for the end of the possible sanctions. Toward this end, the government has decided to make diplomatic efforts to ensure that at least two provisions -- restrictions on the remittance of money from Japan to North Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea -- are included in the resolution on sanctions. Still, the government plans to pursue phased sanctions to ensure that the possibility of resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue is left open. It also plans to ensure that the resolution specifies the deadline for the resumption of dialogue between North Korea and the IAEA. Prior to this, the ROK, the United States, and Japan had emergency tripartite talks in Washington and New York on 4 June. At the talks, the ROK Government reportedly presented this plan and got an affirmative response from the two countries. An ROK Government official said on 5 June: "Special inspections are the only means to verify North Korea's past nuclear activities because North Korea continued to replace fuel rods." He also said: "The government's policy is to ensure that special inspections be a precondition for an end to sanctions." This official also said that "the ROK, the United States, and Japan have reached agreement on this matter." He also said that "the government believes that if sanctions are to produce effects, they must be ones painful to North Korea," adding that "the government plans to make every effort to include in the resolution restrictions on remittance of money to North Korea and a ban on weapons exports to North Korea, which would deal a direct blow to North Korea." He also said that "the most important thing is not the content of the resolution but China's support for sanctions." He predicted that the toughness and level of the resolution on sanctions would be decided depending on China's attitude."
