He accused U.S. decisionmakers of being more Israeli than the Israelis themselves. He said: The U.S. Administration has lost its credibility and cannot be a fair broker or a sponsor of the peace process. He added: There might be a need to reassess the overall peace process by the Palestinian party in particular and the Arab parties in general. [passage omitted]
