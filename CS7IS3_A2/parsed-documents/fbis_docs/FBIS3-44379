The meeting's participants listened to the report made by Ke Huanzhang, president of the Beijing Research Institute for Urban Planning and Design, on implementing the written reply of the State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan. Beijing Municipality will muster an appropriate period of time next year to energetically publicize this plan to make every household aware of it. Chen Xitong said in his speech: The important written reply of the State Council on Beijing's new overall urban plan is great support and encouragement to future construction and development in Beijing. The new overall plan is a trans-century project suiting the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up, establishing the socialist market economy, and accelerating the development of urban areas. He said: Planning is the dragon's head of construction and development and is an important lesson. Thus, we should conscientiously study and explore it. When viewed from the experiences gained from our practice and from the experiences gained by some cities in foreign countries, overall planning must be strictly upheld without any confusion. In carrying out the plan, we must have a hard heart and strict demand and should not be afraid of giving offense. Anyone obstructing this plan should not be tolerated and no one should change the plan. Overall planning for the capital is all the more influential and thus, it should be upheld in an even stricter manner. Beijing must depend on the guidance of the Ministry of Construction and on the endeavor of all fields to build itself well in line with better planning under the leadership of the central authorities. Li Qiyan said in his speech: Urban construction and development of Beijing has garnered the great support of various central party, government, and military departments. We hope that these departments will continue to vigorously support the implementation of the State Council's written reply and Beijing's new overall plan.
