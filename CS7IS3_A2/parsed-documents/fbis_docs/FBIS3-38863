According to Astrid Koller, of the Market Institute, this has mainly to be seen in connection with the fact that the EU negotiations are currently accompanied by a particularly large number of political statements: "The potential of the undecided is in great motion. In quiet months such as June and October, when there was less discussion on entry policy, people were much more certain on how they would decide." Koller points out that even among educated people, one in five does not know how he or she would vote. As reported earlier, 39 percent would currently vote in favor and 34 percent against EU membership. Among university and high school graduates, 47 percent are for and 33 percent against accession. In the federal capital the support for membership is even more marked: Every other Viennese would vote in favor of membership, only 28 percent against, while 22 percent of people living in Vienna have not yet made up their mind. Surprising Farmers Resolve is remarkably high among farmers: Only 14 percent are undecided, while the number of those in favor of membership equals that of those who are against. This is surprising, because the farmers had up to now taken a rather critical position and because the headlines were dominated by agricultural issues at the time of the survey. The supporters of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], and the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] also proved to be relatively determined as to what they want, with the number of people without a clear position toward Europe remaining under 20 percent for each party. However, the Market survey for DER STANDARD's European Barometer shows that a clear majority in favor of EU entry (45 against 35 percent) only exists within the SPOe. How the somewhat more than 25 percent of the population, which has not yet made up its mind, will finally decide, or whether it will even abstain, is still entirely unclear.
