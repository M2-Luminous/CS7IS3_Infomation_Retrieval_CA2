President Lissouba will begin his week-long state visit to China on 19 May at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin -- his first visit to China. It has been learned that President Lissouba will exchange views with Chinese leaders on international and bilateral relations during his visit. He will also tour other parts of China to better understand conditions of its reform, opening up, and construction of a socialist market economy. Lissouba is an old friend known to the Chinese people. China and Congo established diplomatic ties in 1964 when he was premier of Congo. Touching on friendly cooperative relations between China and Congo in the past three decades, Lissouba praised such cooperation as a model, saying "This kind of cooperation is what Congo has been looking for." He maintained that China has been consistent in fulfilling its obligations and has done a lot for Congo. Lissouba said that he will express respect to the Chinese people and their leaders during his forthcoming visit and explore jointly with Chinese leaders new ways and means of cooperation between the two countries. On Congo's current economic situation, Lissouba said that, due to poor management and inappropriate exploitation of state resources, Congo is currently heavily indebted with its economy on the brink of collapse. He said Congo, with its rich natural resources, would like to further strengthen cooperation of mutual benefit with China in better opening up and utilizing its resources, particularly in promoting agricultural production.
