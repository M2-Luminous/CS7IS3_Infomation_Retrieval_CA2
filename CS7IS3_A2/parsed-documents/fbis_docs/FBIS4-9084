[Kuzmanov] It will be inevitable if we are not given the money we need to maintain the plant. I am not speaking about investment, simply about funds for maintenance. I do not even mean the funds needed to implement the plant's safety program. If we are not given the resources we need, we will have to close down Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. [Damyanova] What is the basic source of funds for Kozloduy? [Kuzmanov] The basic source is the National Electricity Company, from which we receive revenue (for consumed energy). Special measures must be adopted because it is the power supply issue that is involved here and we must receive the funds we need. In addition to money for maintenance, we also need money to develop the plant -- this involves investments. These must be pegged to inflation in order to ensure a proportional increase. I could understand a difference of 6, 8, or 10 percent, but when investment is not coordinated with the inflation coefficient then the situation becomes dangerous. [Damyanova] You also receive help from the West.... [Kuzmanov] In fact, we receive a fixed amount of aid on the basis of an agreement between the government and the European Development fund. This is gratuitous aid for increasing safety and the conditions of exploitation, which in 1993 amounted to 12 million francs [currency not further specified]. It has been increased to 20 million francs for the next three years. Obviously, this aid is significant, but not decisive. The money we receive from the National Electricity Company is decisive. [Damyanova] Who else could help? [Kuzmanov] I think that our country has sufficient potential and could protect its nuclear power plant, but there is no one to decide the issue.... We cannot allow the power plant to continue to be exploited under the existing conditions. [Damyanova] Does the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant continue to be an evil myth for some people, as you once told KONTINENT? [Kuzmanov] I said this in the past because certain circles are trying to present the nuclear power plant precisely in this light. I meant that several years ago the Western politicians turned Kozloduy into an evil myth. However, we showed the world that we can implement measures and improve conditions. We showed that the reactors about which it was said that they cannot function, could function after we obtained the appropriate permission from the relevant organs. [Damyanova] Your colleague Delcasso said that if the problem Kozloduy faces at present happened in France, the relevant minister would immediately resign.... [Kuzmanov] He even said that he could be imprisoned for something like this.... [Damyanova] Do you have many problems? [Kuzmanov] Yes, there are a lot of problems in Kozloduy, and let us not even mention the problems Bulgaria faces as a whole. However, there is an unwritten rule: always to follow closely the situation in every branch. Otherwise, you know very well what could happen if we had to close down Kozloduy. [Damyanova] Who is interested in closing the plant? [Kuzmanov] I do not want to comment on this issue. The most important thing for us is to receive what we are entitled to.
