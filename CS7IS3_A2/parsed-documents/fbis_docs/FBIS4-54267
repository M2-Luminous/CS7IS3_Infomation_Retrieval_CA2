When Will We Really Make It?"] [Text] After the elections were held, the National Assembly formed, the Constitution drafted and passed, the king enthroned, and the Royal Government set up, the Cambodian people have hoped that with all of these accomplishments the country would at last enjoy peace, there would be happiness and security, and myriad foreign firms would flock in to invest in various fields, thus creating employment opportunities, educational and training facilities, and enabling Cambodians to rebuild their country and catch up with other more civilized nations. What has happened, however, has been different from the expectations. It is observed that at present the politicians are busy quarreling with one another and political parties have nothing but mistrust for one another. Sometimes, people in the same party do not even speak the same language. The fighting on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields has produced no clear result; the proposal of a roundtable for national reunification and reconciliation has met with many obstacles; the economic law principles have yet to be promulgated; more and more foreign investors have pulled out because they are afraid to stay; the number of freighters bringing goods to the ports has gradually declined; tourist attractions have become very quiet, unlike what they used to be not so long ago; while battles at the front have intensified and each side has resorted to greater and greater savagery in retaliating against one another. When will the leaders of the political groups stop their bickering and join hands in national economic reconstruction efforts, as they pledged to do when they were begging for aid at the Tokyo ICORC [International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia] conference? At a time when the government cannot eliminate the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer Rouge refuse to take part in reconstruction, it is the people who suffer so badly. It is these ongoing disputes and wars between Cambodians that have deprived us of economic gain and completely stalled progress. The new Olympic market problem remains unresolved; the old Olympic market continues to spill into the streets, thus severely blocking traffic; the state airline continues to be stranded; and a number of petroleum companies, such as Total, are forced to wait and wait for answers from the government. Will there be any other investors coming in if the situation, the economic stability of the country, continues like this? Nevertheless, while some companies are visibly hesitant, a few others are optimistic enough to carry on, such as Golden Sea Shipping, which provides express transportation in the provinces; PAD, which takes charge of the city's garbage disposal operations; and a U.S. electric power company. These companies are carrying on as if nothing serious is happening. We do not know we will see an economy which truly serves development, or when an economic authority can be set up by the government to thrust the country forward. This is because people can see that the government is spending the bulk of its energy and funds on ensuring its own political and security-military stability. This is a factor that has stunted the growth of the economic authority, preventing it from becoming the decisive factor. We would like to know when will the investment law, the trade law, and the concept of giving priority to economic infrastructure all take effect so we can truly activate Cambodia's economy.
