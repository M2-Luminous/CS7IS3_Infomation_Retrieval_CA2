ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Consumer Product Safety Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval through May 31, 1997, to collect information about product-related injuries. Section 5(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act 915 U.S.C. 2054(a)) requires the Commission to collect information related to the cause and prevention of death, injury, and illness associated with consumer products, and to conduct continuing studies and investigations of deaths, injuries, diseases, and economic losses resulting from accidents involving consumer products. The Commission uses this information to support rulemaking proceedings, development and improvement of voluntary standards, information and education programs, and administrative and judicial proceedings to remove unsafe products from the marketplace and consumers' homes. Persons who have been involved in or who have witnessed accidents associated with consumer products are an important source of information about deaths, injuries, and illnesses resulting from such accidents. From consumer complaints, newspapers accounts, death certificates, hospital emergency room reports, and other sources, the Commission selects a limited number of accidents for investigation. These investigations may involve face-to-face interviews with accident victims or witnesses, or telephone interviews with those persons.
