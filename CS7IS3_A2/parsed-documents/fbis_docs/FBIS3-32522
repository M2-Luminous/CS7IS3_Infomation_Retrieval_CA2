President Sixto Duran-Ballen, who is facing the second paralyzation of activities in less than six days, said that strikes lead to nothing but loss for the country. In addition, high school and university students have resumed clashes with Quito police, and the government has responded by stating that it has not ruled out the possibility of implementing emergency measures to protect public and private property. The Indian communities joined the workers' and students' general protest that began last week as a means of pressuring the government into revoking a fuel price increase of up to 71 percent. National government spokesmen reiterated that the adjustment measures will not be revised and called for a tripartite dialogue among businessmen, workers, and the government to reach agreements that will not result in losses for the country. President Sixto Duran-Ballen told reporters that a consensus must be sought and that the parties involved must come to the dialogue with open minds and a willingness to accept valid arguments from others and to admit that they are wrong. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, held a news conference and proclaimed the strike a success as all provinces are participating. Radio and television reports stated that the Indian stoppage has been carried out in a peaceful manner and that activities are normal in the central and western regions of the country. The Indians' stoppage will end tomorrow with a march during which participants will bang on empty pots and pans. A few minutes ago we were able to verify that the Ibarra road is closed; there is no traffic. Cuenca is also completely isolated. The Army is now controlling the interprovincial highways, and there is no violence.
