"His only aim of appearing in public is to encourage better (implementation of)... overall policies, to assist and help our current leaders in even better implementing the route of construction," Xiao said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Xiao is in Tokyo to promote the Japanese edition of her book My Father, Deng Xiaoping, the first part of a biography of the 89-year old revolutionary covering the years up to 1949. In one of his rare public appearances the frail-looking Deng was shown on television during the Chinese Lunar New Year Festival last month. On these occasions Xiao is always seen at her father's side supporting him by the arm, whispering into his partially deaf ears and translating his almost incomprehensible utterings. She laughingly dismissed allegations that her interpretations of his utterings reflected more her own opinion than her father's views, saying that was "incomprehension and ignorance." "Wouldn't that be putting my father to a much too low level?" She said, adding that her father has no speech problems and often talks for 30 minutes at a time. At a press conference earlier in the day, Xiao said, "at the moment (Deng) has no disease" and walks three-kilometers a day, even during Beijing's cold winter weather. Xiao said that although her father is frail, he is usually amused by frequent foreign press reports that he is rumored to have cancer or has already died. The secret of her father's longevity is his regular routine, she said. Deng wakes up at 7 A.M., reads the newspapers in the morning, enjoys playing with his grandchildren in the afternoon and plays bridge with old friends in the evening, she said. Although he has given up all political posts, the mastermind of China's market reforms is still believed to have his say in major policy decisions. Deng has complete confidence in the current leadership, said Xiao, indicating that he has entrusted day-to-day politics entirely to President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. The three "actually come to see him very seldom," but still consult with the senior leader on important matters, she said. Yet Deng does not expect them to adopt his advice, which he wants to be understood as "his personal opinion," she said. Xiao adamantly dismissed efforts in China to create a new personality cult around the father of China's socialist market economy. She said the Deng family would agree to setting up a monument after her father's death, but oppose the construction of a pendant to Mao Zedong's mausoleum in Beijing.
