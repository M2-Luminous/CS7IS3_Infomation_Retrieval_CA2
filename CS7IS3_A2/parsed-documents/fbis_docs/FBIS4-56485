Cavallo said: "U.S. Ambassador James Cheek told President Menem that President Clinton has decided not to include Argentina for the next 60 days on the list of countries that are likely be punished. Kantor informed me over the telephone of this decision." Cavallo noted: "The news is not that we will be punished; the news is that any possible punishments will not begin on 30 April, the move has been moved back by at least 60 days. This represents a positive, not a negative gesture towards Argentina." Concerning the harsh description of "greatest trade pirates," the minister noted: "Countries that do not protect intellectual property are involved in a type of piracy. We must not be offended by these words."
