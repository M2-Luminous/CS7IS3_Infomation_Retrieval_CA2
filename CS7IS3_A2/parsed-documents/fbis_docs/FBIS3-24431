According to data provided by the republic's Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the decline in industrial production in January, compared with the same period last year, was recorded at 11.3 percent. The situation was worse in practically all sectors. The situation in agriculture is even less comforting. The production of automotive gasoline was increased somewhat. But against the background of nearly universal economic decline, the situation in the wine and vodka sector was especially heartening. Production of alcoholic beverages was nearly doubled compared with January 1993. As far as prices are concerned, they rose by nearly 10 times as much during the year, but the average wage rose by just 4.3 times as much. It was 4,600 manats in January 1994. The principal reasons for the production decline and the worsening economic situation, according to the analysis cited by the republic's Goskomstat, are the critical shortage at enterprises of raw material and materials because of their higher prices and enterprises' failure to make payments.
