The Saudi forces are heavily armed and equipped with machine guns, armoured personnel carriers, tear gas cannisters and water cannons. The battalions have arrayed themselves in the form of a triangle in the northeastern side of holy Mecca. One battalion has taken up position at al-Aziz street at the site of the Iranian pilgrim headquarters. This battalion forms the point of the invasion triangle of the Saudi commandos. The main part of the equipments and personnel of this batallaion are seen in the al-Azizieh school which is precisely in front of the Iranian pilgrim headquarters. In the Azizieh street there is another battalion that is completely ready. In addition to these forces, dozens of private cars are seen on different sides of the triangle stopping and interrogating unsuspecting pilgirms to the holiest sanctuary of Islam. Many pilgrims who pass this region interpret the abnormal movements of the Saudi police as disrespect of the divine sanctuary. The insulting behaviour of the Saudi police with pilgrims from various countries in many cases has met stong objection. In view of the provocative behaviour of the Saudis, Hojat ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader of the Islamic revolution's representative for the Hajj, was forced to call off the annual rally which was planned for Tuesday May 17. The rally in accordance with the spirit of the Hajj aims to promote Islamic unity and awaken the ummah to the plots of enemies against them. Quite strangely the Saudis are averse to this all-important rally and on one such occasion in 1987, Saudi security forces massacred over 400 Iranian pilgrims near the most inviolable of sanctuaries where the shedding of even an animal's blood is divinely prohibited.
