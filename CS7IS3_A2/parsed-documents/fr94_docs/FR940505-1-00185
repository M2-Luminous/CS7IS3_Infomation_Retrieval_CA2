FR940505-1-00185 FR940505-1-00012 In summary, although EPA's ECO Guidance addresses the use of averaging, banking, and trading of APO credits as well as using AVO zones, EPA does not believe these elements are appropriate for the proposed ECO program. APO averaging, banking, and trading would add an administrative and enforcement burden beyond EPA's present resources and is perhaps better administered at the local level. In the case of AVO zones, EPA has no information suggesting that significant subregional differences in commute patterns, land use, transit availability, and baseline AVO exist to justify this approach. Finally, while EPA may approve a local or state ECO regulation incorporating crediting of satellite work stations under very restrictive conditions, EPA has chosen not to credit satellite work stations in the proposed ECO regulation for the reasons stated above. 3. RACT for 25 Ton Per Year Sources a. Applicable requirements. As discussed in the General Preamble for Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (57 FR 13521), for ``Severe'' areas, reasonable available control technology (RACT) must be applied to any source that emits or has the potential to emit 25 tons per year of VOC or NO X . If the Sacramento area is bumped-up from ``Serious'' (major source = 50 tons per year) to ``Severe'', in order to address this requirement, RACT regulations must be developed for sources which are caught by the more stringent major source definition. EPA believes that between current State and local regulatory requirements and today's proposed FIP regulations (Section III.C.), there should be few, if any, uncontrolled stationary sources which emit more than 25 tons per year. However, EPA plans to continue working with the State and local agencies to identify all stationary sources which have the potential to emit greater than 25 tons per year or more of VOC and NO X and apply RACT regulations as needed. 4. New Source Review a. Background. Today's proposed rule is based on the New Source Review rules in the affected air pollution control districts (APCDs). It includes necessary revisions to those rules that will satisfy severe area requirements, including a major source definition of 25 tons/year and a 1.3:1 offset ratio requirement. The rule also incorporates EPA's permitting requirements (primarily those at 40 CFR 51.165), and changes necessitated by the 1990 CAAA. EPA is expecting to shortly publish proposed changes to the regulations at 40 CFR 51.165 in order to codify and interpret changes to nonattainment permitting requirements pursuant to the CAAA. As appropriate, EPA will rely on that proposal as guidance in taking final action on today's rule. If EPA's final action includes a severe-area classification for the Sacramento FIP areas, this rule will apply in each of the affected APCDs. EPA's main goal in following the structure and, where possible, the actual language of the existing rules is to provide a rule that is easy for the local APCDs to adopt and implement and familiar to industrial sources subject to NSR, and thus provide the least disruption when incorporated in the local programs. However, should the local APCDs fail to adopt the necessary requirements, EPA will implement the severe area NSR requirements through today's rule. EPA is specifically soliciting comment on the issue of the source size affected by the rule. As the rule is structured in this proposal, it requires permits of all sources currently required to obtain permits at the APCDs. EPA has several reasons for including this requirement. First, EPA wants to make this rule as similar to the current District rules as possible so that the Districts can be reasonably certain that adopting this rule will lead to rapid SIP approval such that EPA will move into an oversight rather than permit issuance mode. The current District rules use an accumulation structure that sums all emissions increases, and triggers substantive requirements based on that accumulation. EPA considered making the rule only apply to sources with a potential to emit greater than 25 tpy. However, because the Districts' emissions inventory is based on actual emissions rather than potential emissions, EPA would be unable to know clearly to which sources the rule applies. Second, EPA is concerned that excising those portions of the rules related to minor sources will lead to increased confusion by sources as to jurisdiction and applicable requirements. Third, EPA believes that not including minor sources will result in a rule capturing fewer emissions than the current District rules, a result contrary to the intent of the FIP. On the other hand, EPA is concerned about the effective use of its resources, and about the burden placed on companies constructing very small sources having to obtain air pollution permits from two agencies. Even so, because EPA has the ability to delegate today's rule to the Districts, the effects of dual permitting should be short lived. EPA is therefore soliciting comment on whether to include minor sources or not, and, if a commenter suggests excluding minor sources, EPA solicits comment on the most effective way to exclude minor sources while maintaining the structure of the rule.
