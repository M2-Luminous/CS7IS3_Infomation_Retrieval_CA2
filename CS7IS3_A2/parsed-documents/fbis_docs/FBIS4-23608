According to UN representatives on the ground, cease-fire talks are getting nowhere and the airport remains closed. We spoke yesterday evening of the latest massacre which had targeted at a group of Tutsi children. Two clergymen, Fathers Blanchard and Mayer, had taken in hundreds of people, mostly Tutsis, into their church. On 10 June Hutu militiamen broke into the church. The UN's Canadian military spokesman, Major Plante, spoke with Florence Mavic. [Begin recording] [Plante] Approximately 10 armed men, in civilian clothes but well armed, entered the church and asked Father Blanchard and Father Otto Mayer not to intervene, because, as they said, they had come to evacuate--I repeat, evacuate--the people who had taken refuge in the church, about 250 in total. One of the armed men then told Father Blanchard: Father, we are very serious, and we want to prove this to you--and then he shot into the crowd and a dozen people were killed on the spot at that moment. At the same time, another of the armed men threw a tear-gas grenade into the church, provoking total panic. At this point, more armed men turned up, with several trucks and they picked up all those in the church, all those they could find, and they took them away. [Mavic] Could the blue helmets have intervened? [Plante] We cannot intervene for the simple reason that it is too dangerous, and that we have nowhere near enough men or equipment to go and help or to evacuate these people. [end recording]
