Special campaigns against criminals at railway lines and robbery of automobiles have achieved initial results and public order is now turning for the better. In recent years, the province has seen an increasingly grim public security situation which has become a hotpoint of common concerns. According to three surveys conducted in recent three years, among five items with which residents in the province are unsatisfactory, the situation of public security had twice topped the list and ranked the second for one time. 74.4 percent to 81.5 percent of residents there are unsatisfactory with the situation of public security [paragraph as received]. The police force in the province has organized a number of campaigns against crimes this year. During the period of the Lunar New Year, they waged a special campaign against criminals committing crimes at railway lines with more than 5000 cases dealt with and nearly 3000 criminals from more than 200 gangs seized. In April, the police force staged another special campaign against the robbery of automobiles with over 2900 cases dealt with, over 2300 cars seized and more than 2400 criminals from 490 gangs arrested. The province has seen more than 10 million migrant people flowing in every year which also formed the reason for the increase in the number of crimes there. The crimes committed by some migrant people covered more than half of the total number of criminal cases in the Province. In addition, according to statistics of police force, more than 40000 criminal cases occurred in the province from January to April this year, over 10 percent up than the same period of last year, and the number of big cases showed high growth in particular. The police force there has taken two new measures to consolidate public security. First, more than 4000 policemen have gone on patrol in the medium- and large-scale cities of the Province, and county towns and the above county-town cities will all have their policemen on patrol by the end of this year. Second, the administration over migrant people will be strengthened.
