No details have been disclosed, though it is believed that the mediator wanted to hold separate meetings on outstanding issues -- namely, the specific principles and ways of completing the presidential elections and national reconciliation. No basic document has been issued regarding the specific principles on the completion of the presidential elections. A source close to the negotiations said that it in view of that, it is not possible to make further comments. The mediator is still making efforts to bring the government and UNITA negotiators together to deal with the outstanding issues. Beye is still optimistic, saying he believes the negotiations will end soon. Yesterday Beye said Lusaka is about to write its name in the history of the Angolan people. Let us wait and see.
