Martin Dorazin has phoned in: [Dorazin] The main aim is stop the war immediately. If you do not give a solution to the warring sides they will not stop fighting, Minister Baudys said. One cannot, however, seek a solution that would disadvantage one of the sides. According to Antonin Baudys, one has to give guarantees to the sides involved in the fighting. The basic idea of the Czech proposal, therefore, takes its starting point as the ethnic and religious background of the Bosnian conflict. We can stop this war if the states whose religious and cultural identity is connected with the ideals of the warring sides become the guarantors of developments and the overall solution. Minister Baudys proposes to create an executive goodwill committee in the United Nations in which Russia, Greece, Turkey, Pakistan, France, and Italy would be represented. These countries would thus take over direct protection of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Baudys's plan is based on the fact that the solution must be sought with a long-term perspective and that an immediate solution is not known by anyone. A short-term aim of Baudys's plan is disarmament, administrative arrangements, and the punishment of war criminals regardless of their national origin. Political and diplomatic activities would follow in the coming two to five years, as would economic reconstruction. Conditions should arise for putting an end to direct protection. This would be followed for a period of up to 10 years by a long-term solution and an overall settlement of the Bosnian conflict.
