Matlala] [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] will jointly take over the administration of Bophuthatswana, African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela said on Friday [11 March]. Addressing about 2,000 South African and Bophuthatswana workers at a public forum in Pretoria, Mr Mandela said he was in touch with State President F. W. de Klerk and Minister of Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee. He said they agreed on Friday morning on the deployment of South African Defence Force [SADF] personnel in the territory. A unit of the SADF had been deployed at the South African Embassy in Bophuthatswana, he added. "This operation should not be seen as a military operation only but as an operation to bring about law and order in the place. This is not to restore (Bophuthatswana President Lucas) Mangope or anyone else just as discredited. It is for the people of Bophuthatswana to be able to administer their own country," Mr Mandela said. Now that the SADF was deployed in the homeland it was important the government and the executive council ensured that workers go back to their jobs and that their pensions were secured. Mr Mandela urged workers to leave the matter in the hands of the government and the council. He warned people against looting and destroying property, calling on them to respect other peoples' property.
