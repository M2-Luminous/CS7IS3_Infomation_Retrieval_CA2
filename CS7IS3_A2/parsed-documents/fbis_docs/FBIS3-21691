He had been working for six years at Agno airport near Lugano. The man admitted his crimes, according to the Lugano public ministry and the canton police. Living in Barbengo in the southern suburbs of Lugano, the 40 year-old police corporal had been under surveillance for several weeks. The man was arrested on his return from a trip to Mexico. Immediately questioned by Ticino Prosecutor Jacques Ducry, the policeman made confessions. He had been involved, since February 1991, in international cocaine trafficking in South America, Switzerland, and Italy. A casual cocaine user, the Ticino corporal had imported and delivered 150 kg of cocaine, making 70,000 Swiss francs. The Ticino authorities stated that the police corporal had been in contact with the world of drug traffickers in the course of his duties at Lugano airport. The canton's police force asked the State Council to suspend the man immediately. The corporal was imprisoned at the end of his period in custody. The Ticino authorities stressed: "The inquiry is being made at an international level and therfore we cannot reveal any more information."
