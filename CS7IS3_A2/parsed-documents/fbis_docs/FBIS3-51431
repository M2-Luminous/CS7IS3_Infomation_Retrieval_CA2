On December 16, the Venezuelan cabinet approved an "alternate proposal for commercial shipping to the Eastern Caribbean," a statement from the Embassy said. "The proposal aims to facilitate trade relations with this part of the Caribbean by augmenting the maritime transportation services existing at the moment." The agreement was approved December 27 and is in keeping with a trade and investment agreement between Caricom and Venezuela, which took effect one year ago. Units of the Venezuelan Navy will be used on a commercial basis, and will serve initially, the Venezuela/Grenada/St. Lucia/Antigua route, the statement explains. These ports will be used as centres for the consolidation of freight, and it is hoped that other Eastern Caribbean countries will take advantage of what is regarded as a new opportunity for expanding export/import trade with Venezuela. The move is also expected to strengthen intraregional shipping services.
