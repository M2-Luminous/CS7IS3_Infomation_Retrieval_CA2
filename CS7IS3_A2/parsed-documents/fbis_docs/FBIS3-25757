Michelle Vermaak asked Mr. Botha whether any progress had been made in resolving the impasse. [Begin recording] [Botha] I would first of all wish to make it clear, this was an informal meeting, no agenda, just a discussion -- informally, openly, as South Africans. So I would not wish to proceed from a point where the purpose was to make progress in any way. The purpose was to discuss, to analyze, to be completely open with one another and that is what we did. [Vermaak] Do you think that any solutions, anything positive then came out in the meeting? [Botha] That will depend on decisions taken today and in the days that come. I reported fully to the president in Cape Town and to my colleagues, Minister Roelf Meyer and Minister Danie Schutte, and the one thing that came out very clearly was a deep-rooted desire on the part of His Majesty the king, to have the position and status of the Zulu kingdom preserved and guaranteed and secured. That to the king is a very important, if not nonnegotiable position, because his reasoning is that the Zulu kingdom was functioning long before the British came to Natal or long before the Union of South Africa came into being in 1910, or the Republic of South Africa subsequently, and their reasoning is that the Zulus, the king, being a monarch, recognized worldwide -- in years to come -- that they had not been consulted. [Vermaak] Do you think that the government and the ANC [African National Congress] are moving closer to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and that a possible solution will be found before the elections? [Botha] I personally believe that a distinction must be made between the status and the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu, and political activities or elections, and participation in elections, and I think we ought not to confuse the two, or rather, see the one directly related to the other. The king or the kingdom ought to be above politics and elections and should not be subject, in my opinion, to political decisions in which the king has no power, but if something could be agreed on or something could be done urgently in the next day, or two, or three, to put the position of the kingdom of KwaZulu beyond any doubt -- no tampering with it -- I think if something could be done in this direction then there is a good possibility that all the other outstanding matters which trouble Dr. Buthelezi and Inkatha, I think they could then be resolved.
