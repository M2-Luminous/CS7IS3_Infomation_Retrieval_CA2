Three of the seven were executed immediately, while three more had their sentences suspended for two years, the newspaper said. Among those executed were two banking accountants, Shi Yuqing and Zheng Xiaojie, who embezzled 189,000 yuan (22,000 dollars) and 990,000 yuan (114,000) from their respective bank branches. A further 23 people were given prison sentences ranging from three years to life for a variety of crimes, including embezzlement, bribery, fraud and graft. In a separate report, the newspaper said eight people were sentenced to death -- suspended in six cases -- for masterminding a series of robberies at an oil field in northeastern Hebei province. On three separate occasions, they entered the oil field and stole hundreds of barrels of oil which they then sold on the black market. During one robbery, a dropped cigarette sparked a serious fire that raged for 21 days, the newspaper said.
