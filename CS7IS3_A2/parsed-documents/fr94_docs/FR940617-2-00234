FR940617-2-00234 FR940617-2-00118 Contractual_Line 6f. Enter the total costs of all contracts, including procurement contracts (except those which belong on other lines such as equipment, supplies, etc.) and contracts with secondary recipient organizations. Also include any contracts with organizations for the provision of technical assistance. Do not include payments to individuals on this line. Justification: Attach a list of contractors, indicating the names of the organizations, the purposes of the contracts, and the estimated dollar amounts of the awards as part of the budget justification. Whenever the applicant/grantee intends to delegate part or all of the program to another agency, the applicant/grantee must complete this section (Section B, Budget Categories) for each delegate agency by agency title, along with the supporting information. The total cost of all such agencies will be part of the amount shown on Line 6f. Provide backup documentation identifying the name of contractor, purpose of contract, and major cost elements. Construction_Line 6g. Not applicable. New construction is not allowable. Other_Line 6h. Enter the total of all other costs. Where applicable, such costs may include, but are not limited to: Insurance; medical and dental costs; noncontractual fees and travel paid directly to individual consultants; local transportation (all travel which does not require per diem is considered local travel); space and equipment rentals; printing and publication; computer use; training costs, including tuition and stipends; training service costs, including wage payments to individuals and supportive service payments; and staff development costs. Note that costs identified as ``miscellaneous'' and ``honoraria'' are not allowable. Justification: Specify the costs included. Total Direct Charges_Line 6i. Enter the total of Lines 6a through 6h. Indirect Charges_6j. Enter the total amount of indirect charges (costs). If no indirect costs are requested, enter ``none.'' Generally, this line should be used when the applicant (except local governments) has a current indirect cost rate agreement approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another Federal agency. Local and State governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements. When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be charged again as direct costs to the grant. In the case of training grants to other than State or local governments (as defined in title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, part 74), the Federal reimbursement of indirect costs will be limited to the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect cost rate or 8 percent of the amount allowed for direct costs, exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations. For training grant applications, the entry under line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project. The Federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows: (a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total project (Federal and non-Federal) direct costs. (b) Calculate the Federal share of indirect costs (b*) at 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (Federal and non-Federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations.
