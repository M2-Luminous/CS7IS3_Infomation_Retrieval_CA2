As often happens with people, his shortcomings have become an extension of his merits. The main ones evidently being his creative and selfless involvement with the matter assigned him and his directness and ability to remain loyal, whether to people or to ideas.... Born in Kiev in 1937, Lobov has always been proud that his family comes from an old cossack tribe and is mentioned in "Quiet Flows the Don" and that his uncle, an inhabitant of Veshenskaya village, once admitted Mikhail Sholokhov to the party. The fate and career of Oleg Lobov himself were determined by a meeting with Boris Yeltsin. It happened in Sverdlovsk in 1971, where Lobov had then been working for 11 years after graduating from the Rostov railroad engineers institute. Oleg Ivanovich was the main engineer at a large institute with the lengthy title "UralpromstroyNIIproyekt" and was a candidate of technical sciences. And he looked like a "promising worker" to Yeltsin, who at that time headed the Sverdlovsk party oblast committee [obkom] construction department. Boris Nikolayevich offered the 34-year-old Lobov the post of his deputy although at that time the latter had served virtually no time at all in the party. In 1972 Oleg Ivanovich joined the party obkom. It was a brilliant launchpad. Since then he has retained his irreproachable loyalty to his boss. So that if anyone is to be given the title "Yeltsin's man" then Oleg Ivanovich Lobov is obviously the first. Yeltsin himself who, according to eyewitnesses' accounts, is hypersensitive to any kind of betrayal, intrigue, and plotting, has frequently stressed that he sees in Lobov not only a pragmatist and a strong economic leader but also a man he trusts. A man who could not stab him in the back. From 1972 through to this day Lobov and Yeltsin have been walking through life arm in arm: Yeltsin became obkom secretary, Lobov became chief of the construction department and then chief of the country's biggest construction organization, "Glavstreduralstroy;" Yeltsin became first secretary, Lobov became secretary for construction and later chairman of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Soviet executive committee.... Probably the years spent in Sverdlovsk were the best time in Oleg Ivanovich Lobov's life. As they liked to say in the old days, they were glorious pages in his labor career which he is obviously not ashamed to mention to this day. At least he has left his mark in Sverdlovsk. He was indeed a "strong economic leader" of the Soviet era. Actually, I do not know whether he was a "pragmatist." Perhaps rather he was a romantic, a man of enthusiasms. What is in 1993 the offensive nickname of "chicken and egg" leader invented by journalists in the era of the big battle against Lobov as minister of the economy was in the second half of the eighties for Lobov, as chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee, simply an honorary title. And a deserved one. To this day people in Sverdlovsk, or Yekaterinburg, remember that under Lobov there were eggs and chickens and milk too. They say that in his office there was a huge map of the oblast showing "the dynamics of the increase in poultry and milk production" in various rayons and the oblast soviet executive committee chairman unswervingly kept track of these dynamics. But Oleg Ivanovich's main hobbyhorse is undoubtedly construction. They say he was a good construction worker. He knew his job backwards and had passed through every level of "professional growth." When he was in Moscow, as an important man, he recalled with pride and seemingly a certain nostalgia: "Cultural and sports complexes were constructed for the first time in the country on the basis of my sketches." The first such complex was constructed in a village, which was remarkable at the time. It had everything: a pool, a volleyball pitch, football, amateur artistic activities, and even baths. What is curious is that th is complex is still used for its purpose: People go there to wash.... As chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee Lobov came out with what for the time was a quite bold initiative: Giving city dwellers the right to buy houses in the countryside. Now young people will merely shrug -- so what? But only seven or eight years ago this decision by the Sverdlovsk people alarmed Moscow. A special CPSU Central Committee commission arrived to investigate and closely "studied the question" and eventually kindly agreed it should be supported. A special CPSU Central Committee decree was published, after which Lobov embarked on the construction of cottages. An experimental settlement was installed near Sverdlovsk consisting of houses with every comfort and with auxiliary premises which, they say, were beautifully executed. To this day the entire local elite lives there. It is indicative that Lobov was eager to repeat this successful experiment and he began to speak enthusiastically of a further 38 settlements. But like the majority of reforming ideas in the era of socialism, this one was overtaken by an inevitable fate: It was implemented in a strictly limited number of examples. Or to be more precise in just one case. At the same time youth housing complex construction reached impressive scales in Sverdlovsk and considerable credit went to Lobov here. Or rather to Yeltsin and Lobov. In general all Oleg Ivanovich's progressive initiatives saw the light largely thanks to the fact that he had Yeltsin's support. Often the initiative itself came from Yeltsin. Recalling today Oleg Ivanovich's activity in Sverdlovsk one cannot fail to mention the best supermarket in the oblast, the idea for which came from the executive committee chairman; the modernization of old Urals plants; the swift installation of gas compressor stations; the brick plants which, although he did not manage to install them in every rayon, as he wished, he nonetheless managed to construct in some quantity; and, pardon me for mentioning them, the excellent Sverdlovsk toilets. Incidentally, all of Lobov lies in the story of the toilets. At one time he had traveled to Mexico or Italy where he had familiarized himself with the production of these necessary items. After which he returned home and called in the director of a ceramics plant and gave him a real dressing down for producing poor-quality toilets. Local inhabitants assert that from then to this day they have made good toilets.... So was Lobov a reformer? Probably there is no one answer to that question. One thing is perhaps undoubted and that is that this man was very sensitive to... how to put it more precisely, to the requirements of the time, perhaps to the market situation? Obviously both are correct. They say that in the days of classic party leadership Lobov was a real party boss -- an inaccessible demigod. When the era of wide-scale democracy began Oleg Ivanovich became a very big democrat. When there was the cooperative boom Lobov enthusiastically supported the "shoots of the new." And when Moscow began to criticize the cooperatives' get-rich-quick members Oleg Ivanovich immediately restructured himself. I do not want to make mischief here. That was how the party raised people. Be prepared! Always prepared! Today you have been sent to build youth housing complexes and cooperatives, tomorrow to bury money at the bottom of irrigation channels. You must! And loyal soldiers of the kind that Oleg Ivanovich Lobov undoubtedly is will put all their efforts into organizing the digging. They will set up an optimum work schedule, organize hot lunches for the workers, and where necessary even take hold of a spade themselves.... In 1987 on instructions from Yeltsin, who was already working in Moscow at the time, Lobov became deputy chairman of the Russian COuncil of Ministers. They say he was viewed with great sympathy there. It was a time of general discord, a time of a disorderly work style. And in this situation, when emergency, anticrisis decisions frequently had to be taken, Lobov was not equal to the task. Moreover, in that government he almost looked like the most zealous reformer. At least to my journalist colleagues working at the time Lobov seemed the most progressive man in the government: He spoke more than anyone about the market, he supported youth housing complexes and in general everything new and progressive. For instance, he preached what was then a terrible heresy: Specialists should be sent to Germany to buy housing construction plants and then a "mass cottage industry" should be set up in Russia with the aid of these plants. In general Lobov's press conferences at which journalists were spoken to in human language were an event at the time, in the era of universal secrecy. Oleg Ivanovich looked good in 1989-1991 in Armenia, where he was sent immediately after the earthquake as leader of the restoration work staff. After a while be became second secretary of the Armenian Communist Party Central Committee. And in April 1991 at Yeltsin's initiative Lobov was appointed first deputy chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers. His short stay -- scarcely more than six months -- in that post was marked by the stormy events of August. During which, eyewitnesses assert, Oleg Ivanovich behaved with dignity. It is universally known that he was assigned leadership of the "reserve" government in exile. But when the time came for balanced rational work to reform the economy Oleg Lobov felt uncomfortable. In the fall of 1991, when Silayev had just been dismissed and Gaydar had not yet been appointed, he was left in charge of the economy. And imagine: Everything was collapsing, disintegrating, ties were breaking down, enterprises were coming to a standstill, but Lobov was discussing at a government session the question of... procurements of conifer branches to feed livestock. Observers believe that it was then that he failed -- like the Swede at Poltava [reference to defeat of King Charles XII of Sweden by Peter the Great in the battle of Poltava]. Yeltsin obviously understood this. When Gaydar's team appeared on the horizon and the question of a change of course arose, there was no place in the government for Oleg Ivanovich. He himself explained the situation like this: "New people have come who want to work in a new way, I do not want to make them nervous with my presence." But to all appearances if anyone was nervous then it was primarily Oleg Lobov himself, whom the young reformers obviously did not want to take on as a mentor. Concealed hurt could be heard in the words uttered after Gaydar's men had been dropped: "What was the Gaydar team's mistake? They should have relied on experienced cadres and then the young men's energy would have had a reliable cover." But that is highly doubtful. When Lobov returned from the council of experts which he had headed while Gaydar was the top man in the government and joined the cabinet of ministers now headed by Chernomyrdin, he became virtually the number one enemy of liberal market reforms. Oleg Lobov, first deputy premier and minister of the economy, became widely known to the public concerned for his norm-creating activity. And primarily as the author of two impressive works: the draft president's edict "on the Russian Federation Ministry of the Economy" (May 1993) and the analytical memorandum "on the economic situation in the country" (August 1993). The imposing and threatening nature of these works contains all Oleg Lobov's cossack nature. When the sabers are unsheathed the Russian Ministry of the Economy will become "the leading central organ of federal executive power." Lobov eagerly arrogates to his department many functions of the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, the central Bank, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and other departments. His instructions are compulsory for all regional authorities.... His first deputies are equal to ministers "in terms of remuneration conditions and material and consumer and medical services...." In all Lobov tried to arrogate to himself in the heat of his lawmaking at least half of all the economic and sociocultural powers which the law on the Council of Ministers assigns to the government. The program which Oleg Ivanovich was eager to implement with these powers was distinguished by the drastic intensification of state regulation of the economy. The tax system was to be reviewed: The state was to be given the opportunity not only to lay claim to taxes but also to the revenue of enterprises with a share of state property. Privatization was also to be reviewed: There was to be a reduction from 80 percent to 30 percent in the proportion of state and municipal property handed over in exchange for privatization vouchers.... Oleg Ivanovich defended these ideas of his as selflessly and enthusiastically as he had once defended the ideas of youth housing complexes, cottage construction, and brick plants. The press pulled him to pieces, turning Lobov into a simply odious figure. It is said that when Oleg Ivanovich yet again tried with unfeigned enthusiasm to preach his ideas at government session, a rumble went round the auditorium. Even Mr. Zaveryukha looked quite sane compared to Lobov. Eventually in September 1993 Oleg Lobov was honorably removed from the economy: He was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council. In considering this inglorious and dramatic page in Oleg Ivanovich Lobov's history you can make several hypotheses. Experts believe that the drastic increase in the activity of "Yeltsin's man" could only have been sanctioned by the president. Thus Yeltsin was sounding out the possibility of retreating from the reforms after the Russian Supreme Soviet had voiced its lack of confidence in Gaydar in December 1992 and removed him from the management of the economy. Lobov's resignation in September 1993 was a concession to the "monetarists" fighting him not for life but to the death, when the president needed their support again in the late summer and early fall. When the idea of constitutional reform ripened, when all public opinion polls showed unequivocally that if the president were to dissolve parliament then the people would not lift a finger. In addition virtually the entire government at the time was interested in Lobov's resignation. Fedorov and Chubays because of the obvious contradiction in views of economic policy. The premier and his henchmen because of apparatus considerations: Chernomyrdin had absolutely no need for the close presence of a man laying claim to a considerable proportion of the powers of the premier himself. But I would not present Oleg Lobov as a kind of unfortunate victim of the political struggle. His rise and fall in 1993 were ultimately by no means the consequence of the president's political games or the premier's bureaucratic intriguing (although there undoubtedly were games and intriguing). Rather they were the natural outcome of the next stage in the country's historical development. A stage at which managers like Oleg Lobov were quite unable to hold commanding heights in the economy. One newspaper wrote at the time: "Oleg Lobov has the image and personal qualities of a typical representative of the former party and economic nomenklatura and whatever he does, however he tries to look like a 'market man,' his style and manner will remain those of an inveterate representative of the administrative-edict system. And nothing can be done about that. The man will not be able to change his skin in his maturity." Today Oleg Lobov holds the "honorable" post of Security Council secretary. This work is hardly to his liking. He himself has repeatedly stressed and seemingly quite sincerely: I am not a politician, I am an economic manager. And now, on the anti-Chubays wave raised by Yuriy Luzhkov, Lobov continues to defend his views of privatization. But the Security Council is in no haste to study the economy and, people in the know say, are quietly grumbling about their new boss. What next? Lobov will not break through to power like Yuriy Skokov. Because he does not know how. During his entire time in leading posts Oleg Ivanovich has not cobbled together any "support group": He simply did not engage in it. There are no lobby structures behind him. No "initiative group" of interested political "chess players" will gamble on him because what kind of a chess game is it when everyone can clearly see on hundred moves ahead: Lobov is Yeltsin's man. And in general playing political chess is not in the nature of this heir of the Don cossacks. Experts believe that if there is a military coup tomorrow (I stress -- this is a purely hypothetical suggestion, there are no real grounds for it, and it does not lay the slightest claim to the "number three story) and if Yeltsin were to go abroad, he would leave the country not to Chernomyrdin but to Lobov. The former, a pragmatic man, who has always had his personal interests in sight, will find a common language with the putschists and will make compromises. The latter will shoot it out to the last but will not surrender Yeltsin. And the experts also say that if Chernomyrdin drives the country into hyperinflation and Yeltsin decides to take full economic power into his own hands -- he will put Lobov in the government in order to neutralize it but always to have it to hand and to feel calm about it. God forbid we live to see such options....
