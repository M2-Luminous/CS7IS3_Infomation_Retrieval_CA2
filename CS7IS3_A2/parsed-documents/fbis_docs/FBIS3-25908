A total of 182 advanced individuals and representatives from advanced units went up to the platform to receive their prizes. Zhou Youliang, a leader from the General Logistics Department; Nanjing Military Region's leaders Gu Hui, Fang Zuqi, Guo Xizhang, He Qizong, Yan Zhuo, Wang Yongming, Lan Baojing, Chen Bingde, Wang Tongzhuo, Wang Chuanwu, and Shi Shuizhou attended the closing ceremony. Yang Zhuo, deputy commander of the military region read out a notice of commendation for advanced units and individuals in logistic construction in the Nanjing Military Region. [passage omitted] Guo Xizhang, deputy commander of the military region, spoke at the meeting. He said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the CPC National Congress has further specified and systematized the goal of establishing a socialist market economic system. From now on, the pace of developing a market economy will be further quickened, and a number of new policies will gradually be introduced. The development of a socialist market economy has not only brought about historic opportunities for logistic construction, but also has made many new demands on logistics guarantee work. Logistics units at all levels should, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, earnestly study the impact of the market economy on logistics work; deepen reform; and do a good job in providing logistics guarantee under the conditions of a market economy. He stressed: In order to meet market needs and deepen reform, we must properly handle the relationship between carrying forward tradition and blazing new trails. Over a long period of time, our army has built up a whole set of fine traditions; it is a unique and superior feature of our army. Be it military, political or logistics work, we should seriously carry forward the fine tradition. Presently, reform is the current of the time, but when we emphasize reform, it does not mean we no longer need the effective part of our glorious tradition. We should say that notwithstanding the fact that the guiding ideology, principles, and methods for our army's logistics guarantee were formulated under the planned economy, they have embodied the nature of our army's logistics work; possess the characteristics of a military economy; and, on the whole are still practicable. When we carry out partial reform, introduce the competition mechanism, the benefit mechanism, and the incentive mechanism, we should never overlook the direction of logistics services; and when we apply the general principles of the market economy to guide logistics reform, we must never forget the nature and special law of the military economy so as to ensure the healthy and steady development of logistics reform.
