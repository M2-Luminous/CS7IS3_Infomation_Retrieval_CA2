FR940114-1-00019 FR940114-1-00005 RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD 20 CFR Part 200 RIN 3220&hyph;AB05 Availability of Information to the Public AGENCY: Railroad Retirement Board. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection with the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The proposed rule increases some of the fees based on updates of estimates of direct costs to the Board of providing these services and adds a fee for transmittal of documents by other than regular mail. DATES: Comments shall be submitted on or before February 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Secretary to the Board, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael C. Litt, Bureau of Law, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (312) 751&hyph;4929, TDD (312) 751&hyph;4701. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication, and review. The fees currently provided for in §200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. Consequently, the Board proposes to increase these fees presently found in §200.4(g) and to add a new paragraph to provide a charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post. The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this proposed rule within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
