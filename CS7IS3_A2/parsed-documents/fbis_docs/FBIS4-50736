The Central Bank reached the decision in a meeting of its board of directors and supervisors. The bank said it is unnecessary for Taiwan to follow the example of the United States and raise its rediscount rate, or the interest rate the central bank charges banks, because Taiwan's m2 money supply growth rate was still high at over 15.2 percent in April, leaving room for commodity prices to move up. Taiwan's current rediscount rate was 5.5 percent. In addition, it said, the new Taiwan dollar's exchange rate was at a "reasonable" level against the greenback. The U.S. dollar finished Thursday on the Taiwan foreign exchange at NT$26.84. Observers said the central bank's decision to maintain a loose monetary policy is in line with its policy to revitalize the stagnant economy and export growth.
