Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said the agreement will be signed if the US approves Thailand's demands and conditions. "The discussion will be going on as long as the US cannot agree on the conditions. We propose to set up the quotas," he said. Uthai said Thailand will emphasize exporting high quality products. He added that the import tax structure on raw materials will be reduced so that the production cost will be considerably lower, allowing Thailand to compete with foreign countries. President of the Thai Garment Industry Association, Wirot Amatakunchai, said that even though the world garment trade will enter free trade under the GATT agreement, and that in the next ten years the garment quota will be increased by 2.34 percent, it is still likely that the Thai garment industry, on the contrary, will encounter increased obstacles. Wirot said Thailand now faced problems regarding the cotton price which has increased by 30 percent. He added, that it has been rumored that the price of cotton will be reduced by 30 percent this year. "Garment traders therefore try their best to keep the cotton in stock. The production cost in the meantime has increased by 20 percent following the cotton price rise," he said. However, Wirot said it was expected that the situation will improve next month. Thailand now imports 80-90 percent of cotton used. Wirot made his statement during the seminar entitled "Summary on the Uruguay Round Trade Talks on General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Repercussion on Thai Garments".
