FR940202-2-00118 FR940202-2-00071 CATEGORY II g. NO RECOMMENDATION for preferentially placing the feeding tubes, e.g., jejunal tubes, distal to the pylorus; 189,190,649 UNRESOLVED ISSUE h. NO RECOMMENDATION for using oro-tracheal rather than naso-tracheal tube. 650 UNRESOLVED ISSUE 2. Prevention of Gastric Colonization a. If stress-bleeding prophylaxis is needed for a patient with mechanically assisted ventilation, use an agent that does not raise the patient's gastric pH. 22,34,105,111,115,140&hyph;142,144&hyph;146 Category II b. NO RECOMMENDATION for selective decontamination of an ICU patient's digestive tract with oral and/or intravenous antimicrobials to prevent gram-negative bacillary (or Candida spp.) pneumonia. 147&hyph;170 UNRESOLVED ISSUE c. NO RECOMMENDATION for routine acidification of gastric feedings. 171 UNRESOLVED ISSUE B. Prevention of Postoperative Pneumonia 1. Instruct preoperative patients, especially those at high risk of developing pneumonia, regarding frequent coughing, taking deep breaths, and ambulating as soon as medically indicated in the postoperative period. 302,304 High-risk patients include those who will receive anesthesia, especially those who will have an abdominal, thoracic, head, or neck operation, or who have substantial pulmonary dysfunction, such as patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, a musculoskeletal abnormality of the chest, or abnormal pulmonary function tests. 287&hyph;290,293,294 CATEGORY IB 2. Encourage postoperative patients to cough frequently, take deep breaths, move about the bed, and ambulate unless it is medically contraindicated. 301,302,304 CATEGORY IB 3. Control pain that interferes with coughing and deep breathing during the immediate postoperative period by using systemic analgesia, 309,652 including patient-controlled analgesia, 310&hyph;312 with as little cough-suppressant effect as possible; appropriate support for abdominal wounds, such as tightly placing a pillow across the abdomen; or regional (e.g., epidural) analgesia. 313&hyph;315 CATEGORY IB 4. Use an incentive spirometer or intermittent positive pressure breathing, perform chest physiotherapy on patients at high risk of developing postoperative pneumonia. 295,298,299,302,304,305,307 (See III&hyph;B&hyph;1 above for definition of high-risk patients.) CATEGORY II C. Other Prophylactic Procedures for Pneumonia 1. Vaccination of Patients Vaccinate patients at high risk for complications of pneumococcal infections with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. High-risk patients include persons "65 years old; adults with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks; and children and adults with immunosuppression, functional or anatomic asplenia, or HIV infection. 319&hyph;321 CATEGORY IA 2. Systemic Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Do not routinely administer systemic antimicrobial agents to prevent nosocomial pneumonia. 84,191,322&hyph;325,653 CATEGORY IA 3. Use of Rotating ``Kinetic'' Beds NO RECOMMENDATION for the use of continuous lateral rotational therapy (i.e., placing patients on ``kinetic'' beds that turn on their longitudinal axes continuously and slowly) for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in patients in the ICU, critically ill patients, or patients immobilized by illness and/or trauma. 327&hyph;332 UNRESOLVED ISSUE Prevention and Control of Legionnaires' Disease I. Staff Education and Infection Surveillance A. Staff Education Educate (1) physicians and nurses to heighten their suspicion for cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease and to use appropriate methods for its diagnosis, and (2) patient-care, infection-control, and engineering personnel about measures to control nosocomial legionellosis. 611&hyph;613
