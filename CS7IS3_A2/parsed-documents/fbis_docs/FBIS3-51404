[Begin recording] As you all know, this has been a long struggle which has taken many complex turns in terms of its approval or rejection. There was great pressure exerted by the Argentine people, by pediatricians, and by mothers who wanted to vaccinate their children. Up to now, no permit had been issued to register the vaccine; therefore, there was no permit to sell it or to let the people buy it. This is what the great news we received a few minutes ago is about. I received a call telling me that we already have the registration in our hands. This opens the doors to freely market the vaccine and for the mothers to buy it and vaccinate their children, for the pediatricians to recommend it. Up to now we were not able to do this. This represent an important step to protect those children who are in the midst of a full blown epidemic and who were not allowed to get the vaccine. This is also something very important for us: To be able to sell a product which offers no risks and has extremely high potential to fight that epidemic in Argentine. [end recording] Dr. Concepcion Campa received today the 23 October award from the Federation of Cuban Women, a homage to the Cuban woman who gives to science and Cuba the best of her intellect.
