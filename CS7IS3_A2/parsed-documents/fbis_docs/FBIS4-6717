The Cambodian People's Party occupies 51 seats of the total of 120 seats in the Cambodian Parliament. Here is our radio editor's opinion. The Cambodian People's Party members of parliament's proposal to move the Khmer Rouge representatives out of Phnom Penh was put forth after the Khmer Rouge refused to take part in the ceasefire during the traditional new year festival, as proposed by Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen last week. The MPs are now preparing the draft law on the issue to be submitted to the coming parliament meeting in order to officially remove the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and to outlaw the rebellious section. Vice Premier and Minister of Home Affairs in the Cambodian Royal Government Mr. Sar Kheng, told AFP that King Sihanouk approved the proposal to isolate the Khmer Rouge. The king was reportedly disappointed when the Khmer Rouge refused to cease fire. Mr. Sar Kheng is a member of the Executive Committee of the Cambodian People's Party. Reality shows that the Khmer Rouge always run counter to the Cambodian peace process. As a signatory to the Paris Agreement on Cambodia, the faction not only refused to implement the commitment, but always tried to undermine the process. They refused to participate in the elections, and take part in any solutions put forth by the Cambodian Royal Government. While Cambodian people concentrate on national reconstruction, the Khmer Rouge conduct repeated sabotage activities. The world still remembers the Khmer Rouge as extremely barbarous criminals against their own people when they were in power in the seventies. Since the restoration of peace in Cambodia, the faction has committed many massacres against their own nation and Vietnamese residents in the country. The Khmer Rouge's refusal to cease fire during the Cambodian new year festival once again proves their war-like nature. That is why the proposal to oust the Khmer Rouge from the peace process and from Phnom Penh will meet the aspirations of the Cambodian people.
