The authority citation at the end of the section is removed. §1.664&hyph;2 Charitable remainder annuity trust. * * * * * (c) Calculation of the fair market value of the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust. For purposes of sections 170, 2055, 2106, and 2522, the fair market value of the remainder interest of a charitable remainder annuity trust (as described in this section) is the net fair market value (as of the appropriate valuation date) of the property placed in trust less the present value of the annuity. For purposes of this section, valuation date means, in general, the date on which the property is transferred to the trust by the donor regardless of when the trust is created. In the case of transfers to a charitable remainder annuity trust for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, if an election is made under section 7520 and §1.7520&hyph;2(b) to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the transfer is made, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. For purposes of section 2055 or 2106, the valuation date is the date of death unless the alternate valuation date is elected in accordance with section 2032, in which event, and within the limitations set forth in section 2032 and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. If the decedent's estate elects the alternate valuation date under section 2032 and also elects, under section 7520 and §1.7520&hyph;2(b), to use the interest rate component for one of the 2 months preceding the alternate valuation date, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. The present value of an annuity is computed under §20.2031&hyph;7(d) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, or under §20.2031&hyph;7A (a) through (d) of this chapter, whichever is applicable, for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989. See, however, §1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). If the valuation date of a transfer to a charitable remainder annuity trust is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely on Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700 (See §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter), in valuing the transferred interest.

(c) Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983.
