The article contends that the emergence of the price scissors has nothing to do with the operations of the market economy, that it was merely one of the economic policies of the former Soviet Union, that the price scissors cannot come about in the absence of government price-setting, and that elimination of the price scissors is just "around the corner" since China has decontrolled agricultural prices. Misled by his own erroneous thinking about the price scissors, the writer argues that the entire academic debate about the price scissors in the country since the PRC was founded was "misguided." Because it was published in some of the more authoritative scholarly journals in China, the article will have a substantial impact on policymaking. I believe, therefore, that it is necessary to comment on some of the major mistaken viewpoints in the article so as to clarify the issue and facilitate the development of a socialist market economy. 1. Price Scissors as Product of Imperfect Competition Two questions need to be asked here. First, why does imperfect competition give rise to the price scissors? Second, why do the price scissors typically operate in the exchange between industrial and agricultural products and not in other industries? According to the conventional theories of the market economy, when an economy is in a state of perfect competition, there are usually a large number of factories and farms, all fairly evenly distributed. Not one of them is in a position to influence prices. On the contrary, every single producer is at the receiving end of prices, meaning that he must sell his products at prevailing market prices. Under these circumstances, the cost of a product which a producer is willing and able to supply is exactly equal to the marginal cost (that is, the total cost incurred by the production of the last product) as well as to the price. It also equals marginal efficiency, namely the price consumers are willing to pay. In a state of perfect competition, the economy operates under what has been called the "Pareto efficiency," where allocation efficiency has been achieved with the result that the only way to increase an individual's well-being is to reduce another's by the same amount. However, since the prices of every factory or farm equal the lowest average cost as well as marginal cost, the factories, farms, and industries are driven to a state of zero profit (after deducting the opportunity cost return on investment). In a state of perfect competition, therefore, the circumstances of an individual or an industry will not worsen for no reason to the benefit of another individual or industry, and hence there is no unequal exchange between industry and agriculture. In other words, there is no price scissors. However, things are different under imperfect competition, particularly where there is a monopoly. When most of the output in a trade or industry is concentrated in a handful of sellers, they will be in a position to manipulate prices to a certain extent, thus introducing imperfect competition into their particular trade or industry. Suppose all incomes have been distributed properly among all social groups. Factory A is the sole imperfect competitor in this particular economic society, all others being perfect competitors, that is, their marginal costs equal prices. Under these circumstances, A, being an imperfect competitor (someone who deviates from the conventional rules or is a monopolist in a particular industry) has some control over prices because he faces a demand curve that slopes downward toward the right. In the absence of external restraints, he will, prompted by self-interests, make his products a little scarcer, at the same time raising their prices beyond the marginal cost to give himself extra profits. He will not increase output to a level where marginal costs equal prices, which also happens to be the level where market prices are decided by consumer wishes. Thus, relative to the social cost incurred by A's product, society does not obtain A's product in as large a quantity as it would really want. The upshot is unequal exchange. If A's product is an input required by B, a perfect competitor, B would discover that the same amount of money now purchases a lesser quantity of inputs. When his inputs drop, his output also decreases. Furthermore, since B has no power over prices, he must continue to sell his output at the old price, which translates into a lower income for him. Unfortunately, the industrial sector is better positioned to create imperfect competition. In other words, it wields more clout on the market, as mainly demonstrated in the following two ways: 1) Economies of scale. Market competition, we know, has one tendency: the larger the scale of production, the greater the profit. This tendency leads to accumulation and concentration, culminating in a monopoly. The reason is this. When large-scale production makes possible significant savings, large factories can engage in production more economically than their smaller counterparts and sell their products more cheaply than the latter, rendering it impossible for the smaller companies to survive. Thus, when economies of scale become widespread, there will only be a handful of sellers; that is, monopolists. In many industries, such as steel, automobile, chemical industry, plastics, and glass, producers can keep reducing their fixed cost per unit of output by endlessly expanding their plants, installing larger and larger boilers and machines, buying more and more specialized equipment, enlarging their labor force, and improving labor productivity. Let's suppose the vertical axis represents the average fixed cost and the horizontal axis represents output. The average fixed cost curve will then resemble a hyperbola whose asymptotic curve is the horizontal-vertical axis. That is, the fact that the fixed cost is distributed among a rising number of output units brings the fixed cost curve closer and closer to the horizontal axis. However high the demand curve in the industry in question, for the producer the most efficient scale of production is always the largest. Thus it is out of question for the tens of thousands of competitors at the mercy of prices to compete on a level playing field. To put it differently, in an industry where economies of scale are significantly notable or which is sensitive to economies of scale, the market is predisposed to monopolism. In agriculture, however, the significance of economies of scale is severely crimped because of the constraints imposed by the finiteness of land and the fact that it is where natural reproduction and economic reproduction converge. 2) Legal constraints. We know that regardless of whether a country is socialist or capitalist, the government finds it necessary to restrain competition in certain industries for a variety of reasons. In most cases such restraints take the form of entry restrictions, patents, and foreign trade restriction. As we can see, almost all these restrictions are confined to the industrial sector. 1) entry restrictions. Under the former Soviet model, all factories, mines, railroads, and banks were state-owned and entry by individuals into these industries was prohibited. The result was a high degree of administrative monopoly in industry. This is one example of legal constraint. Moreover, in many developed nations such as the United States, Japan, and those in Europe, the government believes that a high efficiency is possible in public utilities including telephone, water supply, gas, electricity, and roads only when the company enjoys a monopoly or a near-monopoly. Therefore, it has granted a special monopoly to the companies in those industries. In return for the special monopoly, a company agrees to submit to government regulation of their prices and operations. Nevertheless, by taking advantage of the official monopoly, the companies over the years have succeeded in almost completely shutting out other competitors. In contrast, similar privileges or entry restrictions are a rarity in agriculture. 2) Patents. To encourage inventions, the governments of many nations grant patents to investors, thus giving them the prerogative to use a patented product or production process exclusively or monopolistically. This is a legal way to limit entry into a particular trade or industry. However, it has led to some companies monopolize the production of a certain article for years and years. Most patents thus far have gone to industrial products. 3) Foreign trade restrictions. Almost all governments around the world seek to curb imports by imposing high tariffs or quota restrictions on foreign producers. The exclusion from the market of large numbers of foreign suppliers and buyers also reduces perfect competition up to a point. The principal beneficiaries of restrictive tariffs are those industries with a high degree of concentration. In other words, some parts of the industrial sector, thanks to reduced foreign competition, have been able to create a monopolistic situation. Because of the factors noted above, many countries that were the first to adopt a market economy have seen numerous of their industries come under the control of a handful of companies. In the United States, for instance, the four-company concentration rate (the output share of the four largest companies in a specific industry) in 1977 was 100 percent in the tobacco industry; 96 percent, automobiles; 91 percent, breakfast cereals; 90 percent, electric light bulb; 79 percent, aluminum; 61 percent, soap; 30 percent, iron and steel; and 22 percent, meat processing. In contrast, agriculture has a long long way to go before it achieves concentration of this magnitude. The above analysis shows that the price scissors emerge as a result of market forces when some companies behave without restraint. It is a product of imperfect competition. Because of a stronger objective tendency in some industries toward concentration, that is, monopoly, the companies in those industries are able to earn a higher profit than if the government makes them compete like perfect competitors. Their excess profit, furthermore, mainly comes from the pockets of perfect competitors, primarily agricultural producers. So we cannot but have to conclude that wherever there is imperfect competition, there are the price scissors. Wang Zhonghai writes in his article, "The price scissors were one of the economic policies of the former Soviet Government," a phenomenon unique to a specific nation (former Soviet Union) and a specific economic model (the socialist economy fashioned by Stalin). It is argued that in capitalist nations, in old China, and in China today now that it has jettisoned the Soviet model, either the price scissors do not exist or its disappearance is just "around the corner." This, it should be said, is where the real mistake occurs. Wang Zhonghai confuses government functions with the workings of the economy. To Wang Zhonghai, the price scissors is the brainchild of some policymakers, not the product of unrestrained monopolistic market forces. According to his logic, government only needs to end the practice of participating in the collection of the price scissors without, however, limiting or regulating imperfect competition, and the price scissors will disappear automatically. The analysis below will show that this point of view is wrong. 2. Only Government Control Will Eliminate Price Scissors As explained above, the existence of imperfect market competition has deep historic roots, including both what is inherent in market competition itself (economies of scale) and legal restrictions adopted by the state. As soon as a monopoly comes into existence, it will prevent the economy from achieving the kind of high-efficiency resource allocation possible under perfect competition and prevent society from deriving the most satisfaction from its finite resources. Unequal exchange between monopolists and perfect competitors will then naturally occur. Economists refer to this situation as "market malfunctioning." What is needed here is for the government to step in to offset market malfunctioning by opposing monopolies and unfair competition and preserving an orderly environment for competition using legal and administrative tools. This indeed is a paramount responsibility of government. Many industrialized market economies have anti-monopoly laws and corresponding executive agencies. Some countries regulate a small number of monopolistic resource products and public utilities, most importantly by determining the prices to be charged by the monopolistic companies. In the United States, furthermore, a rural cooperative law has been passed to make farmers better able to fend for themselves by helping them participate in the supply of inputs and the sale of their products. It may be said that the price scissors do not exist, or exist only marginally in industrialized market-economy nations, but that is because they have at various points created a market economy that includes macro-management and government intervention, the so-called "mixed economy." The cornerstone of a mixed economy is market regulation of resources. At the same time, however, the government and other public institutions regulate economic activities through fiscal and monetary policies and by using a mix of legal and administrative tools. It should be said, therefore, that it is in countries where government malfunctioning is most extensive that the price scissors are the largest. "Government malfunctioning" is also known as "nonoptimal intervention." What it means is that not only does government intervention fail to correct market distortions, but, on the contrary, thanks to misguided policies and conduct, the distortions are exacerbated, further undercutting economic efficiency. In this way, with government malfunctioning compounding market malfunctioning, the price scissors will only worsen. Meanwhile, the failure to put agriculture on a sound footing leads to food shortages and, ultimately, workers' discontent. This was probably what happened in the former Soviet Union in 1923, as noted by Wang Zhonghai in his article. This being the case, to suggest, as Wang Zhonghai has done, that the price scissors will not come into existence in the absence of government administrative price-setting is to reject all government intervention indiscriminately. Here we need to distinguish between two issues. One, there is no direct causal relationship between government administrative price-setting and the price scissors. This issue has been analyzed above. Two, justifiable and appropriate administrative price-setting not only will not cause the price scissors, but will on the contrary diminish or eliminate the price scissors. Perhaps Comrade Wang Zhonghai means to say that in a socialist market economy, natural monopolies will not occur, so there will be no such thing as imperfect competition. But if that is the case, wouldn't we need even more precise government administrative price-setting to prevent the emergence of the price scissors? In any case, among all those countries which have tried the socialist market economy, which has managed to do just that? 3. Decontrol of Agricultural Prices Not the Same as Elimination of Price Scissors Wang Zhonghai writes in his article, "The price scissors have not been eradicated completely, but since the 14th CPC National Congress has made the creation of a socialist market economy the objective of economic restructuring in China, it will be eliminated any day now. This can be achieved by accelerating the decontrol of agricultural prices and transforming the mechanism of price formation." His assumption is that provided we decontrol the prices of agricultural products, leaving it up to the market to regulate them (that is, transforming the price formation mechanism), we can get rid of the price scissors lock, stock, and barrel. What will happen if we go down this road? Let us begin by examining a number of important facts: In Shaanxi Province, the procurement prices of agricultural byproducts were raised 11 percent, 0.3 percent, and -1.8 percent in the several years between 1988 and 1991, respectively. During the same period, the retail prices of rural industrial goods rose 22.7 percent, 2.8 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively, widening the price scissors 10.5 percent, 2.5 percent, and 4.7 percent for a total of 18.6 percent for the 3-year period, or 5.9 percent annually on the average. After adjusting for inflation, agricultural inputs by peasant households rose a mere 3.2 percent each year, far short of the investment demand. Owing to the widening price scissors, the ratio of peasant incomes and those of urban households deteriorated from 1:2.38 to 1:2.75. In Guizhou Province, the price ratio index for the exchange of industrial and agricultural products shrank sharply in 1993: The wheat-salt price ratio index retreated to the level of the mid-1970's, a drop of 109 percentage points compared with the peak reached in 1990; the wheat-plain white cloth price ratio index fell to the level of the early 1960's, down 11.48 percentage points from the peak in 1982; the wheat-coal and oil price ratio index retreated to the level of the mid-1970's, a loss of 56.22 percentage points from the peak in 1990; the wheat-chemical fertilizers price ratio index sank to a new low, shedding 45.1 percentage points from the peak in 1987. In Xuzhou Shi in Jiangsu Province, unequal exchange between agricultural and industrial products in recent years has driven up the costs of farming excessively. If we look at the real return on farming one mu (0.0667 hectare) of each of seven major crops, only wheat yields a tiny profit (25.75 yuan), while the others are all money-losers: rice, 27.47 yuan; corn, 10.94 yuan; soy bean, 5.13 yuan; rapeseed, 86.14 yuan; cotton, 44.79 yuan; and silkworm, 87.47 yuan. The decline in the price ratio index in the exchange between industrial and agricultural products everywhere has also had a depressing effect on the price ratio index in livestock products-industrial goods exchange. In Guizhou Province, for instance, the pork-salt price ratio index has fallen back to the level of the mid-1970's, down 468.42 percentage points from the peak in 1988; the pork-plain white cloth price ratio index has retreated to the level of the mid-1950's, down 96.79 percentage points from the peak in 1988; the pork-coal price ratio index has fallen to the level of the mid-1970's, down 263.54 percentage points from the peak in 1988; the pork-chemical fertilizers price ratio index has hit a new low, down 305.40 percentage points from the peak in 1987. (Gong Yong [7895 0516], "Steep Decline in Price Ratio Index in Guizhou for the Exchange between Major Agricultural Products and Industrial Products in 1993," GUIZHOU DIAOYAN, 1993 No 2.) Then there are the data on nine cities in Jiangsu Province. The prices of mixed feeds for cows have jumped 29.3 percent on the average since 1993, while the prices at which milk is procured and at which sterilized milk is sold have risen only 2.0 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. As the raising of milk cows becomes less and less profitable and downright unprofitable, milk production is in decline in seven provinces and municipalities to date. The prices of coal, water, electricity, petroleum, and transportation have gone up by various extents in numerous places, greatly boosting the costs of livestock products and hobbling the animal husbandry industry. The situation described above occurred amid the gradual decontrol of agricultural prices. In 1992, 22.8 percent of all agricultural products sold by peasants had state-set prices, down from 92.6 percent in 1978; 20.0 percent had state-guided prices, up from 1.8 percent; and 57.8 percent had market-regulated prices, up from 5.6 percent. Thus the contention by Comrade Wang Zhonghai that the price scissors will disappear provided agricultural prices are decontrolled is not consistent with reality. A wealth of facts proves that a major reason for the decline in agricultural goods-industrial goods price ratio index is the extraordinary increase in the prices of industrial resources that are in short supply and in the charges of public utilities, including steel, coal, water, electricity, oil, and freight charges. According to observations at 11 points in Jiangsu, for instance, the costs of producing 100 kilograms of wheat rose 9.94 percent in 1993 from a year ago, spending on diesel oil jumped 28.28 percent compared with 1992, and the costs of producing 100 kilograms of rapeseed were also up 6.30 percent, including a 31.43 percent increase in diesel oil costs. Or take the case of Jinghai Fishery Company in Rongcheng Shi, Shandong Province. Its fishing fleet consumes 15,000 tons of diesel oil each year, yet the company is allocated only 460 tons of diesel oil under the plan. Diesel oil accounts for about 50 percent of the fishing inputs. A fishing trip lasts from 15 to 20 days on the average and a small or medium-sized vessel burns about 1 ton of diesel oil a day, which works out to be 20 tons of diesel oil per fishing trip. With the price of diesel oil as high as 2,000 yuan per ton, a fishing trip costs 40,000 yuan in fuel alone. The catch of a small or mid-sized vessel per trip ranges between 25 and 30 tons, which translates into a total income of anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Add the other expenses and a fishing trip may end up costing more than it earns. The fishing industry in Shandong Province has been unprofitable since 1992 and things got worse in 1993. To cut losses, fishery companies up and down the coast have suspended operations and auctioned off their fishing vessels. The extraordinary increases in the prices of scarce industrial products and the charges of public utilities have also directly driven up the costs of industries making articles for agricultural use, which, in turn, has exacerbated the unequal exchange between industrial and agricultural products. According to statistics, of the 55 mid-sized nitrogen fertilizer enterprises in the nation, 27 lost money in the first quarter of 1993 because of endless hikes in the prices of raw materials, electricity, and transportation costs. Unable to absorb these massive price increases by tapping internal potential alone, they have passed them onto agriculture. Thus, without strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, the decontrol of agricultural prices in itself will not get rid of the price scissors at its root. On the contrary, there is a tendency for the price scissors to expand. This proves that in China's socialist market economy, imperfect competition may result from the absence of the right kind of government intervention. As I see it, imperfect competition in Chinese industry to date may occur in either one of these two scenarios: 1) the transitional economic system inherits some of the administrative monopolistic habits of the past in the course of reform. At present, about 30 percent of all capital goods sold have administratively set prices, including energy (crude oil, coal), raw materials (iron, steel, and chemical industrial raw materials), and rail freight. Still under the influence of the old system, these sectors may engage in "rent-searching" activities and squeeze profits from price differences, which distorts prices, which, in turn, gives rise to imperfect competition. 2) The growth of the nonstate economy. Due to economies of scale and improvements in managerial and sales techniques, a number of large companies now account for a substantial share of the sales of the decontrolled part of some products, such as petrochemicals, coal, and steel, and in doing so manage to control the prices of products with negotiated prices. If this and other kinds of imperfect competition are not brought under government regulation and control, the price scissors will not go away. There was a time in the history of capitalism when laissez-faire and nonintervention policies were considered the best. With the emergence of imperfect competition and the consequent economic dislocations, the notion that capitalist nations must intervene in economic life to solve inflation, unemployment, and other problems became widely accepted. In other words, laissez-faire economics has long been discarded in the West. In China, people have suffered long and hard under the planned economic system. So they assume, understandably, that everything will be fine if only there is decontrol across the board. But it will not be long before we realize that decontrol alone unaccompanied by the right degree of government intervention will not work either. Therefore the only conclusion we can arrive at is this: We must make the most of the market economy in resource allocation and, at the same time, step up proper government intervention in economic life to ensure the realization of economic efficiency. 4. Measures To Narrow Price Scissors As noted above, the price scissors are a product of imperfect competition. Price decontrol cannot completely prevent the emergence of some forms of imperfect competition, namely monopolies. To eradicate the price scissors, therefore, we must take the following steps: 1) Impose price controls on a small number of monopolistic resources and the products of public utilities. Among them are crude oil, natural gas, a handful of rare metals, urban public transportation, running water, coal, integrated network electricity, rail transportation, and posts and telecommunications. The markets of these products are basically monopolistic resource markets, natural monopolistic markets, or public utilities markets. Without government intervention, enterprises in these markets will take advantage of their inherent monopolistic status or some other prerogatives to set high monopolistic prices and reap excessive monopolistic profits. Since the role of prices in the sound allocation of resources on these markets is restricted, regulation by an outside force, namely the government, is needed. These products come under government price-setting in just about every country in the world. Today, China is in the process of decontrolling the prices of most coal and petroleum products and increasing the share of steel with market prices. It is the plan of the departments concerned to completely decontrol the prices of competitive sectors by 1994 or 1995. In my opinion, the policy of totally scrapping price controls and decontrolling prices wholesale militates against the sound allocation of resources and the reduction of the price scissors in the exchange between industrial and agricultural goods. It should be reconsidered. 2) The government helps enhance the peasants' self-protection capability. As noted above, because there are so many of them and because they operate on a small scale, peasants are in a weak bargaining position when it comes to selling their products. At the same time, they are confronted with imperfect competition in the acquisition of inputs. If they are not organized properly, peasants will remain in a defenseless position. A peasants' supply and marketing cooperative may give them a tool through which they can participate in the acquisition of agricultural inputs and a means whereby they can enter the arena of agricultural products processing and marketing. In the United States, for instance, cooperatives purchased 20 percent of all inputs and accounted for 31 percent of all agricultural products sold in 1980. The farmers' cooperative provides a dependable market where farmers can sell their goods and purchase inputs, strengthens their bargaining position in those transactions, and maximizes their return while minimizing the costs of inputs and services. To make sure the cooperative truly represents farmers' interests, government regulations require that the cooperative be owned and managed by agricultural producers themselves. In elections, every member of a cooperative can cast only one vote so as to prevent large investors or consumers from taking over the cooperative. The interest rate on cooperative investment must not exceed the interest rate state banks pay on deposits, the idea being to ensure that most investment goes to improving the efficiency with which agricultural products are marketed and sold and imports are purchased, not to earning more interest for the cooperative. At least 50 percent of the volume of business conducted by the cooperative must be handled by cooperative members, again to ensure that it is cooperative members that really benefit from the cooperative. We can learn a lesson from all of that. 3) Introduce a protective procurement price system for major agricultural products and livestock products. Because of the low comparative advantage of growing bulk agricultural products, their growers need price support. Protective procurement prices should be held at a level where peasants derive an income from agricultural production roughly equal to that of laborers in other social strata, or at least enough to ensure the normal operations of simple reproduction in agriculture and animal husbandry and to prevent them from being hurt. When grain prices on the market drop below protection prices, the state must purchase the grain on peasants' hands within the scope defined by government regulations on protective price procurement.
