[passage omitted] On the occasion of its anniversary, the Andean authorities have issued a series of documents referring to the current status of the integration process. One of these documents admits that, despite the obvious progress made, "there are still great differences between the social groups within the member countries." Therefore, it adds, "the challenge that the Andean countries, in an individual and collective manner, must undertake is to promote equal opportunities; grant the great majority access to the right to education, housing, and health; improve the living standards of the population emigrating from the rural areas to the cities; and strengthen the institutions of civil society." The document explains that from a closed model at the beginning, the group has moved to an open one with automatic community mechanisms where the market system prevails, starting with genuine competitive advantages and the adjustment of community regulations to international levels. According to the document, in 1993, the Andean GDP amounted to $142 billion and increased at a greater rate than its population, that is, at a 3.2 percent rate per year, "which means the Andean Group has increased its available assets and services." Per capita income in the Andean Group increased by three times between 1970 and 1993, going from $515 to $1,850. Services have made the greatest contribution to the increase in GDP, with $70 billion which represents approximately half of the total $142 billion, followed by the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, which in 1993 amounted to $26 and $21 million respectively. Inflation has been curbed and shows a tendency to decrease by a monthly average of 0.5 percent in Bolivia, 1.8 percent in Peru, 2.8 percent in Ecuador and Colombia, and 3.1 percent in Venezuela. Trade between the Andean Group member countries has also increased. In the seventies, it amounted to $112 million and in 1993, it amounted to $2.88 billion, which represents approximately 10 percent of the Group's total exports of $29.459 billion. Foreign investments in the region have also increased, from $3.4 billion in the seventies to almost $14 million in 1993.
