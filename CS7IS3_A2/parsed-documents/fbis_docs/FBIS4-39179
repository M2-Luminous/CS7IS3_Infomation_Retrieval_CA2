It was a difficult process, it took a number of votes, and was passed by 10 votes in the end. Viewers have not yet forgotten "Parliamentary Hour," which for the people was synonymous with a very boring and biased political program imposed from on high. Will history repeat itself and replicate a failed experiment? The days when parliamentary spectacles replaced shows for the people are past. The State Duma deputies are probably aware of this. Nonetheless... Yuliy Nisnevich, chairman of the parliamentary Subcommittee on Computer Science and Communications, commented on the State Duma decree at the request of IZVESTIYA-TV: [Nisnevich] Among deputies there are two entirely different approaches to the creation of a State Duma television and radio service. One group believes that it must form its own full-fledged television and radio company. This is clear from the adopted decree and from the amendments to the law in preparation "On Coverage of the Work of State Organs of Power in the State Media." For example, amendments of the following kind: The State Duma press service must have direct access to the airwaves. But there are deputies who hold a directly opposite view: This television and radio service should be a department of the Duma press service dealing with such technical matters as television and radio recording of sittings of our parliament and its committees and commissions and compilation of archive material so that any journalist or interested organization can obtain these materials to work on. All is not straightforward. The thing is that there is nothing in the Constitution entitling the State Duma to make decisions like the creation of its own television and radio company. Legally any state company can ignore this decree. We have encountered manifestations of a public struggle for the airwaves. Some deputies believe that television provides insufficient coverage of their activities and their attitudes are unknown to society. So they want to have their own airtime and say what they see fit. A draft decree was submittd by deputies from the Democratic Party of Russia -- Travkin's party. It is actively supported by the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], which periodically organizes actions in the State Duma in connection with the fact that the party is not being given airtime. "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy bloc] are of the opposite view. The PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and "12 December Alliance" partly share the same platform. The democratic factions believe that the task is not to create their own television and radio company, but to be given the opportunity to talk about events taking place in the State Duma in proportion to the coverage of the activities of the government and the president. Unfortunately, the balance is actually upset at the moment. The State Duma's work is not reflected objectively enough and in sufficient detail on television. For example, the Duma took a very significant step when it adopted on first reading part of the Civil Code. This is effectively the "foundation" of legislation, but our television and radio companies somehow pass by such significant matters without informing viewers and listeners of them. If there is an important event taking place in the Duma, society must be kept informed, perhaps with comments by the leaders of various factions. We need programs that promote the inculcation of the ideas of parliamentarianism within society. We can manage without rigid, fixed airtime for parliamentarians. But a clear understanding is needed. All deputies and factions must be treated fairly. We believe that all deputies with different views must have equal opportunities to appear on television, regional as well as central. The decree on creating the television and radio service was put to a vote repeatedly. When the LDPR faction stormed out of the hall there were obviously not enough votes. But the "Women of Russia" faction then played its part: First the deputies wavered, but in the end they voted for the motion. Our committee has now been instructed to elaborate a blueprint for television coverage of parliament's activities. Of course, the Duma will now seek to create its own television and radio company. But it will cost an enormous amount, millions of dollars! The Duma is unlikely to be allocated that kind of money. Will "Parliamentary Hour" return on the "Rossiya" television channel? That depends on how the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company conducts itself. As I said before, according to the legislation, it need not play these games. Most likely some compromise will be found. In my view, this decree is another excuse for speculation by representatives of the various factions, for another political spectacle. [Nisnevich ends] The deputies' wish to have their own television company is understandable, although it looks to the public like a strange caprice. They will probably want to take the money to set it up out of the state purse. But the government has failed of late to find sufficient funds to finance existing state television companies. Television is being called "destitute." In this situation the creation of a television and radio service to satisfy the deputies' vanity is another piece of political nonsense. Unfortunately, we have gotten used to this kind of thing, grimly waiting for the moment when sober-mindedness and common sense prevail.
