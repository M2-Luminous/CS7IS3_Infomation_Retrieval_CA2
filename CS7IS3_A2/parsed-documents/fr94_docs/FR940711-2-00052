FR940711-2-00052 FR940711-2-00029 [FRL&hyph;5010&hyph;7] Public Water Supply Supervision Program Revision for the State of South Carolina AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the State of South Carolina is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy Program. South Carolina has adopted drinking water regulations for Volatile Organic Chemicals, Synthetic Organic Chemicals and Inorganic Chemicals (known as Phase II and Phase IIB of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Regulation) and for Lead and Copper. EPA has determined that these State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding federal regulations. Therefore, EPA has tentatively decided to approve the State program revisions. All interested parties may request a public hearing. A request for a public hearing must be submitted by August 10, 1994, to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public hearing is made by August 10, 1994, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his/her own motion, this determination shall become final and effective August 10, 1994. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing; (2) a brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination and a brief statement of the information that the requesting person intends to submit at such hearing; and (3) the signature of the individual making the request, or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity.
