According to the academician, recent open hearings at the State Duma on chemical disarmament excluded a possibility of speculations on this issue. He said that specialists disclosed all secrets of the "classified arms". A refutation was also published by the Russian Defence Ministry, which clearly said that Russia does not develop or produce biological arms. Academician Fedorov and other experts wonder why "sensations" casting aspersions on the Russian reputation appear at a time of Russian stabilization. Ecological problems are most often used in these "exposures". Rumors claiming alleged Russian holding of ecologically-dangerous weapons were spread under the pretext of environmental protection. According to well-informed sources, another attack to use consequences of Russian nuclear programs is being prepared. In the opinion of specialists, chemical disarmament problems are concentrated around technologies for elimination of combat poison gases. They have an economic competition basis, and biological arms problems have a clear political coloring.
