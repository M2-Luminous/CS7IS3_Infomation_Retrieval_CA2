Through patient diplomatic efforts and rational measures -- which fulfilled 99 percent of the UN Security Council's demands -- Iraq was able to contain the stands of three of the five permanent members of the Security Council. This step was a political achievement in Iraq's interest because it succeeded in surrounding the hard-line stands in the Security Council and in bringing states, which a few months ago were revolving in the U.S. orbit, to Iraq's side. Iraqi sources said that the split within the Security Council is a gain for the international majority and supports Iraq's rights in the face of "the idols," as stated in AL-QADISIYAH, the paper of the Iraqi Armed Forces. The reaction in Baghdad ranged between optimism and reservation. Meanwhile, some sources believe that what took place within the Security Council was an important diplomatic gain from which Baghdad will benefit in the consultations to take place next May. Other sources, however, believe that it is too early to talk about the results now. A source at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, who asked to remain anonymous, said that Iraq's reaction will be decided after Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns to Baghdad. The source said that 'Aziz, who will return after two days, will brief the Iraqi leadership on what took place in the corridors of the Security Council and the possibilities that he came up with after his talks and meetings there. These sources, however, are still leveling accusations at Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN Special Commission, describing him as a puppet of Washington and London. Iraqi newspapers yesterday did not devote their editorials to this subject, but rather carried news reports [as published]. This strengthens the opinion that the government's reaction has been delayed until 'Aziz returns from New York. 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin, former military spokesman and President Saddam Husayn's press secretary, told AL-DUSTUR in a telephone conversation that if the economic embargo continues Iraq will be forced to take certain measures, including noncompliance with Security Council resolutions. He added: So long as the Security Council does not abide by its resolutions, Iraq will be free to cooperate unilaterally with a number of countries and can resort to many measures that will affect U.S. interests in the region. Muhsin, however, did not reveal the nature of these methods, but said that Washington's insistence on continuing the embargo smacks of Zionist desire. This, he added, simply means that the aggression against Iraq and the imposition of the blockade were not just because of Kuwait, but were planned even before the Iraqi forces' invasion of Kuwait. Muhsin added that renewing the blockade is an attempt to exhaust Iraq's military and economic potential. [passage omitted] An Iraqi source told AL-DUSTUR that a delegation led by the chief of the Political Desk at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry is currently on a visit to Baghdad to hold talks on political and oil issues. The source added that the three-man delegation met the day before yesterday with experts from the Iraqi Oil Ministry. An economic source revealed figures on the size of Iraq's commercial activities before the international embargo resolution was issued. The source said that Iraq has the potential to be the largest trade market in the region and that its imports -- which were estimated at $25 billion in 1990 -- will increase to $40 billion when the embargo is lifted. The economic source said that the economic cycle in the region is now crippled because one of its basic links is paralyzed. The source advised Britain, in particular, to realize this fact, and asked ridiculously: Why does London prefers a 1-billion dollar market in Malaysia to a 40-billion dollar promising and strong market? Interviewed by AL-DUSTUR in Baghdad, political analysts expressed their astonishment at the pretexts created by Washington and London to continue the economic embargo on Iraq. They said that the issue of the Kuwaiti borders is a bilateral issue that cannot be placed under anyone's tutelage. They called for leaving the issue for the future and did not rule out better circumstances in the future to reach results regarding it. Regarding the file of the Kuwaiti prisoners, whom the Kuwaiti regime claims are held in Iraq, this file cannot be closed easily three years after the Gulf war. [passage omitted]
