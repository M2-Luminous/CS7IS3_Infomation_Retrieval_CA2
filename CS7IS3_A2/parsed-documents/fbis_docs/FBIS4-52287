FBIS4-52287 "dreas089_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan IAEA Asks Measurement of Unaccounted Plutonium IAEA Asks Measurement of Unaccounted Plutonium OW0905131894 Tokyo KYODO in English 1301 GMT 9 May 94 OW0905131894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The United Nations atomic watchdog has asked the Japanese Government to reconfirm the amount of plutonium held up in processing equipment of a Japanese nuclear fuel fabrication plant after learning the amount was unexpectedly high, sources said Monday [9 May]. The sources said a massive 70 kilograms of plutonium was held up at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. facility in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, over the past five and a half years since the plant started operations. The fact has alerted the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since such a large amount of plutonium held up in the plant could hamper effective application of safeguards against unauthorized diversions of plutonium, the sources said. A corporation spokesman stressed, however, that employees at the facility have confirmed the existence of the plutonium through measurements done with special equipment and denied the plutonium in question is unaccounted for. But the sources said the IAEA is concerned that any discrepancy in calculations could compromise its purpose as a body established to regulate the use of nuclear fuel and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The facility, which began operations in October, 1988, supplies fuel to the fast breeder reactor Monju on the Sea of Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. Sources within the nuclear power industry said that in April, the IAEA requested that the government confirm whether the amount of plutonium held up in the plant actually matched the corporation's own measurement. Equipment to monitor plutonium amounts in the facility was jointly developed by the corporation and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S. state of New Mexico. A measurement by the equipment is believed to have a margin of error of 5-10 percent, which means that if the amount of held-up plutonium is as much as 70 kilograms, enough plutonium to make an atomic bomb could easily escape detection. Paul Leventhal, president of the nongovernmental Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute said 70 kilograms is more than the amount of plutonium North Korea is alleged to have secretly diverted from its own nuclear facilities. Leventhal said there is no proof Japan is diverting plutonium for a weapons program, but called on the IAEA to closely regulate the Japanese facility to ensure fair treatment for all countries using nuclear power. In a letter dated May 4 to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Leventhal calls for the shutting down of the facility. Leventhal told Christopher the 70 kilograms, about 10 percent of the annual plutonium output at the plant, is "an astounding figure." "Under the circumstances, Japan should be prepared voluntarily to suspend operation of the plant in the interest of its often-stated commitment to the complete transparency of the peaceful nature of its plutonium program," Leventhal wrote. A spokesman for the Science and Technology Agency's safeguards division said the IAEA and the government gauge the amount of plutonium held up in the plant once every month, and added it is impossible to divert the plutonium from the facility.
