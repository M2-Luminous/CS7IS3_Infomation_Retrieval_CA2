FR940721-2-00013 FR940721-2-00010 [A&hyph;588&hyph;086] Revocation of the Antidumping Duty Order on Spun Acrylic Yarn From Japan AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of revocation of antidumping duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic yarn from Japan because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ann Ngo or Michael Panfeld, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;4737. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 4, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 23051) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic yarn from Japan (April 8, 1980). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. Scope of the Order Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of spun acrylic yarn from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 5509.32.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party, as defined under §353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic yarn from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d)(4)(iii). This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of spun acrylic yarn from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 1, 1994. Entries made during the period April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR §353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR §353.25(d). Dated: July 14, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
