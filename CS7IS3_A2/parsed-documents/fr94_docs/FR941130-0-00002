FR941130-0-00002 FR941130-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Part 532 RIN 3206&hyph;AG09 Prevailing Rate Systems; Aroostook, ME, NAF Wage Area AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Aroostook, Maine, nonappropriated fund (NAF) Federal Wage System wage area and to redefine Aroostook and Washington Counties, Maine, as areas of application to the Cumberland, Maine, NAF wage area for pay-setting purposes. With the scheduled closing of Loring Air Force Base (AFB) on September 30, 1994, and the current downsizing of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service and Loring AFB Morale, Welfare and Recreation Department, there was not a sufficient number of employees to conduct the wage change survey scheduled in July 1994. Further, there was not a sufficient number of employees to meet regulatory requirements for establishing a survey area. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Angela Graham Humes, (202) 606&hyph;2848. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 18, 1994, OPM published an interim rule (59 FR 36351) to abolish the Aroostook, Maine, NAF wage area for pay-setting purposes and reassign its constituent counties to the Cumberland, Maine, NAF wage area. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is being adopted as a final rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they will affect only Federal agencies and employees. List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 532 Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, Government employees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Wages. Accordingly, under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5343, the interim rule amending 5 CFR part 532 published on July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36351), is adopted as final without any changes.
