This document opens paths for exchanges to ensure that "relations between the two sister nations will be maintained with patience but without interruptions" Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia said yesterday. It will produce reciprocal benefits in the areas of education, sports, culture, and science and technology, said Raul Taladrid, vice president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation. The agreement also outlines investment possibilities in the fields of tourism, mining, communications, aeronautics, and energy, and it embraces the possibility of exploring other fields such as fishing and textiles, among others. It includes the marketing of Cuban medicines, particularly the Colombian purchase of the hepatitis-B vaccine and future negotiations for the purchase of the meningitis vaccine. The document also confirms that an agreement will soon be reached by Colombian and Cuban university rectors during a meeting to be held in Havana in November. The Colombian deputy foreign minister said he thinks that meetings between the Colombian and Cuban presidents in Cartagena, Colombia, and recent visits to his country by Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State, and Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina contributed to the current state of their bilateral relations. The issues of petroleum sales to Cuba and the debt that the island owes to this South American nation were not negotiated within the joint commission, Garcia reported. The Colombian delegation also included the deputy ministers of education, communications, and environment, Antonio Jose Lizarazo, Jaime Uribe, and Eduardo Uribe, respectively, among other important officials. A protocol for collaboration in the field of education was signed yesterday and another one on sports is scheduled to be signed tomorrow.
