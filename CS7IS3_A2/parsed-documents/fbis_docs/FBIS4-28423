The search is an illegal and unjustifiable act, an incident beyond common sense, that will be regarded as a serious international problem, he said. He demanded that the Japanese authorities immediately stop the suppression and violation of human rights which threaten the activities of Chongnyon and organisations under it and the life of the Koreans in Japan and take appropriate steps to prevent the recurrence of such incident.
