General 'Uzi Dayan said: If the peace talks remain in crisis, the Israeli military is braced for the contingency of war. Gen. Amnon Shahaq said he did not foresee any change to the status of the occupied Golan Heights this year. Uri Lubrani, the chief Israeli negotiator with Lebanon, said those pressing for implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 do not care for peace. Observers a re unanimous that the Washington talks are about exploring ways to terminate Israeli occupation of Arab territories and bring peace to the Middle East. They are agreed that as long as Israel continues to balk at the requirement of a complete withdrawal, peace will remain an impossibility. The Arabs did not join the peace process or go to Washington to appease Israel or indulge its wishes. They went to get their occupied territories back and promote an enforcement of pertinent Security Council resolutions. Syria wants the entire Golan Heights back. Lebanon and Jordan also want to regain sovereignty over their occupied territories, no matter how small these may appear to be. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 -- the mainstays of any fair and universal settlement in the Middle East -- require an immediate Israeli pullout from the occupied Arab territory and an end to settlement activity. What is the point of the Washington talks if they are not about finding ways to implement these resolutions, remove the occupation, and clear the path to peace? Does Israel really think that the Arabs will define the shape of peace they want before the Israelis make a public commitment to a complete withdrawal as called for by UN resolutions? Those who talk about peace being in crisis and raise the specter of war are not interested in making peace. If the peace is in crisis, this is thanks to Israel itself. It is thanks to Israeli stubbornness that the two-year-old Washington talks have hit an impasse. Had Israel proved receptive to a global inclination for peace, Middle East peace would now be an established fact. The Geneva al-Asad-Clinton summit has charted the course of true peace and given added strength to international efforts to that end. If only Israel would end its intransigence and begin to act as if is bound by Security Council resolutions instead of creating obstacles and threatening a referendum on the Golan and talking about a crisis that may erupt in war. The shortest route to peace lies in the implementation of the underpinnings of the peace process -- Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which are best summed up in the land-for-peace formula. If Israel has trouble relinquishing its expansionist blueprints and handing back the occupied Arab territories, how can it realistically expect the Arabs to concede their land, rights, and tradition, and bow to aggression, when they are impatient to see peace established so that they can return to their land and homes? Syria has called for the peace of the brave. Israel must realize that unless it displays a degree of courage commensurate with the cause of peace, Middle East peace will remain an unrealizable dream. However, belligerence and saber-rattling on the one hand and courage on the other are strange bedfellows. But if the Israelis reconcile themselves to hard facts and stop showing racial hatreds and belligerent tendencies, they will be truly courageous. All the world is waiting for the Israeli rulers to adopt a positive stand in keeping with international law and the sanctity of the cause of peace.
