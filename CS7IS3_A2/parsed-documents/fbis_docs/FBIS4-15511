But, Pavlov said the deployment of strategic units of a foreign army in Belarus was out of question as it would contradict the Belarussian decision to be a neutral and nuclear-free country. In Pavlov's view, the deployment in Belarus of Russian air bases or antiaircraft units would keep Belarussian armymen in good shape. The Belarussians would familiarize with advanced know-how and be able to resolve their social problems. According to Pavlov, Minsk would study in detail every scenario for the creation of foreign army bases in Belarus.
