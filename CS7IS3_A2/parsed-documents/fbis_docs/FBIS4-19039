FBIS4-19039 "drweu071_b_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 BENELUX COUNTRIES Belgium Army Activities in Rwanda Army Activities in Rwanda LD1204171494 Brussels La Une Radio Network in French 1600 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1204171494 Brussels La Une Radio Network French BFN [Text] In its daily briefing in Brussels the Army spoke to the press, so, Annie Nameus, you have some extra details on the confused situation in Rwanda: [Nameus] First, about the evacuation of Belgian nationals: troops have been to the south, in the direction of Nyamata, bringing back the Belgians who wanted to come, but some decided to stay, because the situation appears a little calmer in the south. This convoy is now back in Kigali. It didn't meet many obstacles, just a few roadblocks. Another convoy also went out today, 20 km to the west of Kigali, and, in the northwest, some 20 people, mostly Belgians, were taken from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi, where they arrived in the middle of the afternoon, under escort by soldiers involved in military technical cooperation. I should also report that there are about 30 people at Kigali airport; they arrived after the last C-130s had left. The evacuation of Belgian nationals from Kigali is not yet over, and no final date for the evacuation has yet been fixed. It is now the second commando battalion that is responsible for the town of Kigali. They are now being called the second commando battalion and no longer UN peacekeeping troops. These troops are, so to say, putting on their green berets again under their blue helmets. The airport and the interior of the country are now the responsibility of the intervention units.
