In a statement to MENA, Ambassador Kamal said that the Palestinian leadership does not favor the idea of holding meetings like this before concrete measures are taken to protect the Palestinians, in Hebron in particular and in all occupied territories in general. He stressed that the PLO refuses to resume the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations until after Israel commits itself clearly and unambiguously to protecting the Palestinian people under their occupation. It must also agree to the presence of an international protection force as stipulated in the Gaza-Jericho agreement, disarm the settlers when they are outside their settlements, release the Palestinian detainees, and discuss the issue of the settlements as a whole as soon as the executive agreement on self-government in Gaza and Jericho first is signed. The Palestinian ambassador revealed that Palestinian-Israeli contacts were held through a third party in the wake of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre regarding holding meetings in Oslo between Palestinian and Israeli officials, but the PLO refused to hold such a meeting. On the other hand, informed Palestinian sources in Cairo stressed that the wording of the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre, which will be voted on on Monday, will determine whether the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will be resumed or not. The sources said that citizens in the occupied territories want the international community and especially the Security Council to take a clear stand on the Israeli crime and to ensure their safety from the Israeli settlers' barbaric actions. They noted that the Palestinian people in the occupied territories reject a resumption of the negotiations without achieving these demands. Observers believe that PLO cannot not make agree to resume the negotiations without such a resolution from the Security Council, otherwise it would face such popular wrath that it might affect its position. The Palestinian sources said that if the Security Council issues an appropriate resolution, the negotiations will be resumed in Washington at the beginning of next week and this will be followed by meetings in Cairo to discuss the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.
