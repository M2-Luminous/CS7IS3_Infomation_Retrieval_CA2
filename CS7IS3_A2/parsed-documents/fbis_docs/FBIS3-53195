Since the reactor was established, however, there have been no mishaps, leaks, or radioactive contamination incidents. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling was told by the IAEC that the monitoring stations merely serve as a security valve, whereas the safety operations are carried out within the reactor's laboratories. The IAEC has implemented the lessons of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster relating to emergency preparations and relaying reliable information to the public.
