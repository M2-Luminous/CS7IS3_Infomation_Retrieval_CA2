It hopes to reduce production costs by 30 percent. By the end of the year, Arianespace will have put in an order for the last 20 of the batch of 50 Ariane 4 rockets that went into production four years ago (batch P9) and started production on the first 14 series-produced Ariane 5's intended for operational flights that the launch firm will carry out by the year 2000. That was one of the main "messages" which Charles Bigot, Arianespace's chief executive officer, conveyed last week--through the press--at the same time that he reported the company's "excellent operating results" for 1993 (see AIR & COSMOS, No. 1454). Last year, despite a late start (12 May) caused by the unavailability of a satellite from Hughes (United States), the launch firm successfully completed seven scheduled launches putting 10 large satellites into orbit. The result is that Arianespace's turnover will be "on the order of Fr4.5 billion," with profits "equivalent to those in 1992." But most important, Arianespace signed 16 new firm satellite launch contracts last year, whereas its competitors as a whole received only six orders. Those 16 contracts cover satellite launches with a total value of about Fr7 billion and bring the backlog of orders to 37 satellites to be launched at a total value of Fr16.9 billion (as of 1 January 1994). This does not include the order from Intelsat that is currently being negotiated for the launching of two more Intelsat 8's (F3 and F4) in addition to the first two (F1 and F2), which have already been entrusted to Ariane 4, or the three second-generation Meteosat satellites covered by the signing on 10 January of the first "convention" (or framework agreement) between Arianespace and the European organization Eumetsat [European Organization of Meteorology via Satellite] for launching the new MSG's between the years 2000 and 2006. Because of its "very full" order book, Arianespace has decided to order from its manufacturers the last two series of rockets in the P9 batch of 50 Ariane 4's--all of which will therefore be produced--and simultaneously to speed up the pace at which Ariane 4's are produced, going from the current eight rockets per year to nine and then to 10 per year in 1994 and 1995. "Production will increase by at least 50 percent over three years," Bigot announced. The reason, he said, is that "the goal is to launch 30 rockets in 36 months." That is 50 percent more than were launched over the past two years. "It will require a big industrial effort," he said, "because we must allow for the unexpected and therefore be prepared to make considerably more than one launch per month in order to guarantee 10 flights per year." And it must be done without altering launch preparation procedures. Because, as Bigot stressed, "we must not jeopardize the `Ariane operational product,' which has now reached a satisfactory level of quality." The solution, then, consists of shortening production and launch times. As a result, the average time frame for launching an Ariane 4, which formerly included a minimum interval of 22 working days, has been reduced to 20 days. The feasibility of this new schedule was demonstrated at the end of 1993, and it will enable Arianespace to launch 10 Ariane 4's per year from 1994 to 1996. 15 Ariane 5's Marketed In addition, Arianespace has already started negotiating contracts with manufacturers for series production of the new Ariane 5 [AR5] launcher. At the end of October, the European agency asked the firms concerned to make a special effort to reduce manufacturing costs "by an average of at least 30 percent" (see AIR & COSMOS, No. 1446). "All the manufacturers concerned received a letter from Arianespace establishing two objectives with respect to cost reductions: one for the first 14 series-produced rockets (after the two very first rockets, which are part of the development program) and the other for the rest of the series beginning with the 15th AR5. Bigot told us that so far, "no manufacturer has achieved that 30-percent reduction." Negotiations will therefore continue--and be speeded up--this year because, he said, "we plan to order the first batch of 14 AR5's (perhaps in installments) in 1994." The result is that over the next three years, Europe should have launched at least the first three Ariane 5's: AR-501 in October 1995, followed by 502 and 503 in April and October 1996. And according to Arianespace's CEO, "everything is to be in order for operational flights beginning in 1997." The next phase, he said, is to be "another three-year period during which the AR5 will become increasingly popular, with two, three, and then four launches per year (that is, nine rockets over a three-year period). That will be followed by the AR5's nominal launch rate (reduced since cancellation of the Hermes) of five launches per year beginning in 1999. "All of our contracts already stipulate flights with the Ariane 5," said Bigot. He explained, however, that at first, "AR5 will be offered at the same price (within 3 to 5 percent) as Ariane 4," the argument being that Arianespace will sell either Ariane 4 or Ariane 5 but will have to compensate for the additional cost of the--less than optimal--operation of two launchers during the three-year transitional period. The fact is that productivity will not be as good during that period, with only nine AR5 launches and 9 or 10 Ariane 4 launches. But the transition may proceed faster than expected, said Bigot, who explained that the company would take charge of marketing Ariane 5 beginning with the second rocket (AR-502). The ESA [European Space Agency] has (also) just put that launcher on the market, since it is no longer reserved for the Artemis experimental relay satellite, development of which is already six months behind schedule even though work has just begun--meaning that it will no longer be possible to launch Artemis (for free) on AR-502. On the contrary, the agency will have to pay at least $115 million for space on a commercial AR5 flight! Arianespace is therefore already preparing to operate about 15 Ariane 5's, with flight 502--which is still part of the Ariane 5 flight qualification program--being marketed especially for the ESA. From that point on, Arianespace plans to have only double launches of AR5's (and probably no triple launches other than on an exceptional basis), while gradually speeding up the launch rate to the point that by the end of the decade, there will be five launches per year to put 10 satellites--half the worldwide market--in orbit. Beginning with European satellites, of course, because, as Bigot announced, "currently all the ESA projects are being reworked to make them compatible with AR5." But, and this is another new "message" from Bigot, "Arianespace also wants to be the firm handling all elements of space transportation in Europe," including, he said, the new logistic elements of infrastructure or orbital service operations such as the ATV "space tug," the CTV manned capsule, or the ACRV rescue vessel. But that will depend on the decisions made regarding those programs at the next ESA council meeting on 18 January 1994 and then at the conference of European ministers early in 1995!
