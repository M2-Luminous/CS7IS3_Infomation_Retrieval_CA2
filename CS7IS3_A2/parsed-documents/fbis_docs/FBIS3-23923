Russian Government Wants Foreign Credit Only Under Its Own Conditions"] [Text] The Russian Government intends to put an end to the practice of past years and take a firmer stand regarding the so-called "tied" credit granted by state export-import banks of foreign countries. This conclusion can be drawn from the negotiations that took place yesterday among First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin, and representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and the Mitsui Corporation. "Tied" credit was an extremely popular form of foreign borrowing for a long time--mainly because of the obvious advantage for the creditor country. This is explained by the fact that almost all the funds granted to Russia were ultimately spent on paying for products or services in the country that granted the credit (Russia was also obligated to pay interest on this credit). Moreover, for Western bankers the guarantees from the Russian Government were also extremely attractive. They eliminated all the commercial risks of such credit (in the words of Aleksandr Shokhin, the former Governments of the USSR and Russia gave these guarantees in an amount of $9 billion). The Russian Government managed to achieve "independence" of credit from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for the first time last summer--"oil credit" was granted without government guarantees. But they did not manage to get rid of the other essential shortcoming--the actual support of American machine building (through obligations to place orders only in the United States). The delegation from the Japanese Export-Import Bank, headed by Vice President Makoto Sunagawa, imposed much stricter conditions, which can even be called political. In addition to government guarantees for two projects--modernization of the Yaroslavl Nefteorgsintez Association and the creation of a Transsiberian telecommunications system (overall cost of $3 million)--the Japanese made further cooperation conditional on Russia's fulfillment of agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club of creditor countries. This position was completely unsuitable to the Russian side: In the words of Oleg Soskovets, for Russia "there is no point in giving government guarantees for commercial, paid projects." The government, in the words of the economics minister, is prepared to guarantee the Yaroslavl Plant unchanging export quotas assigned for this project and to exempt it from payment of customs duties. Additionally, the technical and economic justifications for the projects considerably dampened the government's enthusiasm--according to Russian figures, 85 percent of the equipment was to be purchased from Japan and the rest of it from third countries. (Makoto Sunagawa, to be sure, sees this ratio differently: 55 percent in Japan and 45 percent in third countries but not Russia.) Taking into account this polarity in the initial positions of the parties, one can say that the negotiations ended in a "draw," or, to look at them from practical positions, nothing. The Japanese confirmed their participation in two projects and the Russians, stating for the sake of argument that the local market could be taken up by Americans, convinced the bank leaders to do clarification work with their government and get them to back off from the strict linkage between credit and Russia's agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club.
