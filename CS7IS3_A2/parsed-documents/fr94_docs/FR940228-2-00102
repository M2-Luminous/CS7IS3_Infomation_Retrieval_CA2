FR940228-2-00102 FR940228-2-00060 Borrowings under the Overhaul Loan Facility may be made from time to time until August 7, 2007, and would bear interest at a rate per annum of 3% in excess of the rate of interest per annum publicly announced by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company as its commercial reference rate, or certain substantially equivalent rates of interest per annum if Morgan Guaranty Trust Company ceases to announce such a rate of interest. Borrowings would be repayable on a fixed amortization schedule over the lesser of three years or the remaining term of Berkeley's restructured Lease (August 7, 2007). The obligation of GECC to make each loan under the Overhaul Loan Facility would be subject, among other conditions, to the delivery of certain documentation, the absence of a material adverse change in the financial condition of Berkeley, the showing by Berkeley in form and substance satisfactory to GECC that Berkeley will have sufficient cash to repay the loan and the absence of a default under, among other agreements, the amended Lease and the amended Credit Agreement. Berkeley also proposes to make the following amendments to the Credit Agreement: (1) Provide for the Overhaul Loan Facility with GECC and borrow thereunder from time to time prior to August 7, 2007 in amounts of up to $1 million at any time outstanding and issue to GECC its promissory note evidencing such borrowings; (2) change the aggregate amount of the borrowings which may be outstanding at any time thereunder to the lesser of $1.25 million or $1.5 million less the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement; (3) extend until August 7, 2007, which is the end of the term of Berkeley's restructured lease, for borrowings to be made and letters of credit to be outstanding under the Credit Agreement; (4) provide that borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, such as certain documentation and the absence of a default under, among other agreements, the amended lease and the amended Credit Agreement; and (5) provide for an origination fee of $2,500 for the issuance of letters of credit in replacement of those presently outstanding under the Credit Agreement, plus an annual fee of 1% per annum of the face amount of any such replacement letter of credit. Acquisition Corp. also proposes to enter into a pledge agreement with U.S. Trust Company of New York, the owner trustee and lessor or Berkeley's facility under its lease, pledging Berkeley's stock as security for Berkeley's obligations under its amended Credit Agreement and in connection with the Restructure. Outstanding borrowings under the amended Credit Agreement would be required to be repaid in full annually and the amended Credit Agreement would contain certain other mandatory and optional prepayment provisions.
