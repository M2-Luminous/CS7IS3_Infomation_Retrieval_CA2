Things will be difficult this time for Big Giulio. The man who likes to shake up political relationships will have the task of managing and civilizing relations between parties and factions. The man who likes to put down any sacrilegious individual who opposes him will have to learn how to convince that individual gently. The man who has preached the need for a charismatic leader endowed with full powers will have to learn the art of stroking one of the most tumultuous parliaments of West Europe. If Silvio Berlusconi did indeed place this kind of man in the wrong job, it was probably because he did not want to miss the opportunity to have at his side a man trained in politics and its techniques--training that is not possessed by many new cabinet ministers. Giuliano is accordingly returning in person to the front line of politics, which was the passion of his youth. It was also the passion of his family, starting with his grandfather Mario--a prominent Liberal of the 1920's--and followed by his father Maurizio, who was one of the most volcanic and partisan Communist journalists in the 1950's and 1960's before becoming a Liberal and "rightist" Communist in the 1980's. And then there is his uncle Giovanni (Maurizio's brother), a Republican, who is certainly not the least factious member of the family. Factious, in the sense of a total and disruptive passion for your side once you have chosen that side. It is a kind of passion that does not allow for halfway measures or modulated tones and indeed demands that the scimitar mercilessly cut off hands and heads. That is the way Giuliano is. I remember Giuliano in 1981, just after he had resigned as secretary of the PCI [Italian Communist Party] federation of Turin because he was tired of communist politics in general and the Piedmont PCI in particular. He had no job and no money. He would stroll through Piazza Navona with his handsome German shepherd and his close friend Giampaolo Pansa at his side. His friendship with Pansa subsequently ended with threats of a punch on the nose, just as his friendship with Saverio Vertone, one of his two buddies in Turin (the other was Vittorio Sermonti), ended in a bruising brawl. And just as I had been having dinner with Giuliano and Carlo Ripa of Meana--a dinner among friends--only a few days before the two were flaying each other in public with lawsuits and countersuits. I love Giuliano like a brother, but I know that if our views ever diverged, he would let the scimitar fall upon my head mercilessly. This is partly the product of the Communist modus operandi, one that is never abandoned, and partly a manifestation of the curse of the Ferraras. Giuliano's intellectual bravado is something else again. It is the pridefulness of someone who does not want to row with the crew, and I was very pleased at the tenacity with which Giuliano continued to defend Bettino Craxi after Craxi had fallen into disgrace. As for Ferrara's independence, I recall the time when he proclaimed openly on British radio his disagreement with Craxi, who had just signed--together with Achille Occhetto--a document deploring the American bombs that had killed civilians in Iraq. To be sure, bombs are horrible and do kill innocent people; but the person responsible for those deaths was Saddam Hussayn, who had aimed his chemical missiles at Israel before the UN decided to take action against him. What did the complaint against the Americans have to do with this? And Giuliano said just that, boldly, his big beard pointing to the sky, indifferent to the curses of the pacifists. I phoned him immediately to congratulate him.
