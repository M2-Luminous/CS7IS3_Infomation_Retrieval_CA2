Nzuzo Matiwane, suspected of involvement in the SADF [South African Defense Force] raid on an Umtata home in which five youths were killed, has been held in detention under Section 47 of the homeland's Public Security Act for the past four months. Lawyers for Human Rights have tried unsuccessfully to free him and are now working on alternative ways of challenging his detention. Approached for comment on Monday, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the organisation remained steadfast in its opposition to detention without trial. "The position of the ANC has always been that any person who has been detained as a suspect should be brought before a court of law as speedily as possible," Mr Mamoepa said. He repeated this statement six or seven times when asked whether Gen Holomisa, who is 13th on the ANC's national election list, was not causing embarrassment to the organisation. He maintained that the Transkei police and not the homeland leader was responsible for Mr Matiwane's arrest and continued detention. Asked whether the ANC planned to approach Gen Holomisa to discuss the situation he said: "As far as I know we don't have any plans to intervene in the matter." In an interview earlier, Gen Holomisa questioned how he could be considered an embarrassment to the ANC when the organisation, as a member of the Transitional Executive Council, had agreed to postpone the abolition of the detention without trial clause. He blamed South African "agents provocateurs" for the continued existence of Section 47 on Transkei's statute books. "We were about to remove the act in 1990 but after the attempted coup we had to stall the process. Anyway, that law has only been used against South African agents provocateurs. "We are in the process of removing all other related laws but we can only take a final decision on Section 47 after we have completed a threat analysis," he said. While the multiparty talks decided that all laws which inhibited personal freedom should be scrapped, Gen Holomisa said he feared South Africa might continue to destabilise Transkei in the run-up to the election.
