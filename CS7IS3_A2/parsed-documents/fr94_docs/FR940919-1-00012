FR940919-1-00012 FR940919-1-00004 List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;88&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 382, 382B, 382E, 382F, and 382G series airplanes, as listed in Hercules Service Bulletin 382&hyph;57&hyph;74 (82&hyph;688), dated January 31, 1994; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent structural failure of the outer wing assembly, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, or prior to the accumulation of 18,000 total flight hours, whichever occurs later, perform an ultrasonic inspection to determine the distance between the edge of each of the six most outboard fasteners on kingpin riser number 18 and the edge of the riser, in accordance with Appendix A of Hercules Service Bulletin 382&hyph;57&hyph;74 (82&hyph;688), dated January 31, 1994. (1) If all six of these fasteners are positioned 0.31 inch or more from the kingpin riser edge: No further action is required by this AD. (2) If any of the six most outboard fasteners is positioned less than 0.31 inch from the edge of the kingpin riser: Prior to the applicable threshold specified in Table 1 of Hercules Service Bulletin 382&hyph;57&hyph;74 (82&hyph;688), or prior to further flight if that threshold has been exceeded as of the effective date of this AD, perform an ultrasonic inspection to detect cracks in the kingpin riser, in accordance with Inspection Procedure SP&hyph;265 (Appendix B) of the service bulletin. Note 1: For airplanes on which an outerwing replacement is installed, the total flight hours threshold is counted from the time of outer wing replacement. (i) If no crack is found, repeat this inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7,400 flight hours. (ii) If any cracked kingpin riser is found, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. Repeat this inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7,400 flight hours. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Atlanta ACO, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Atlanta ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on September 13, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
