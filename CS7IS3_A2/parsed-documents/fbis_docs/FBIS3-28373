He said the first obstacle is whether or not the definition of royalties should cover intellectual property rights and other rights, as well as fixing appropriate tax rates. Second is whether or not the definition of air and sea transportation services covers other activities, such as sea and air charters, as well as determining their tax exemption. Third is what types of activities should be included in the definition of a "permanent establishment." Fourth is the problem of fixing an appropriate tax rate for interest earnings. There is a wide gap between the two countries' tax rates. Thailand collects 15 percent of the interest earnings of banks, while the United States charges 30 percent. Revenue Department Director General M.R. Chatumongkhon Sonakun has disclosed that 19 issues will be brought up for discussion during the negotiations. He anticipates encountering more difficulties in these negotiations than with the other countries that want to amend their treaties with Thailand on avoiding double taxation. This is because there are many interest groups involved, and they are openly lobbying their government. The director general said: "The major obstacle to the Thai-U.S. negotiations, which have been dragging on for many years, is that many lobbyists have been pressuring the politicians. If this round of negotiations is unsuccessful, it will be postponed until next year. Still, I am not sure that the two sides will be able to reach any agreement." The director general noted that Thailand is at a disadvantage in this round of negotiations because it is a smaller country and its exports to the United States account for 25 percent of its total exports. In addition, the United States imposes a mere 1 percent tax on Thai imports, which is minimal when compared with other countries. For this reason, the United States may show leniency toward some of the Thai side's requests. The director general stressed that the government attaches great significance to this round of negotiations. Everyone hopes that it will succeed and be equitable and fair to both sides. He said: "That is why the talks will take three full days -- from today until 10 February. This is longer than similar talks we have held with other countries."
