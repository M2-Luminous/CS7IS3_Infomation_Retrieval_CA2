He said the aim of this meeting is to coordinate stances on resuming the Arab-Israeli peace talks and discuss the effects of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre on the peace process. In exclusive statements to MENA, Subayh said that Egypt is making intensive diplomatic moves with the United States, the Palestinians, and the Israelis to find a way out of the deadlock that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations reached following the massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that Egypt's efforts aim to convince Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to show more flexibility toward the fair Palestinian demands to resume the peace negotiations. He noted that the Palestinian demands focus on the need to provide international protection for the Palestinian people, reduce the number of settlements, disarm the settlers, and release the Palestinian detainees.
