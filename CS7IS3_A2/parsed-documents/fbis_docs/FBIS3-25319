He said factional fighting within the Royal Lesotho Defense Force had put the country's fledgling democracy to a severe test. King Letsie was speaking at a banquet in Maseru last night which he held for the Botswana president, Sir Ketumile Masire, and the Zimbabwean president, Mr. Robert Mugabe, who went to Lesotho to discuss the recent fracas in that country. He noted that the soldiers returned to the barracks after mediation by church leaders and international and regional organizations, including SADC [Southern African Development Community] and Frontline States leaders. King Letsie said Basotho were encouraged to realize that the SADC-Frontline States region was now adopting a more proactive role in matters concerning regional stability and peace. He called on Basotho and the government to use the opportunity provided by the return to peace to pursue, deepen, and broaden national reconciliation to include all areas of national endeavor to encompass all sectors of Lesotho without any exception. President Masire and Mr. Mugabe held meetings with Lesotho's parliamentarians and former King Moshoeshoe II this morning. They later met opposition leaders and were expected to meet army commanders. Sir Ketumile is expected to address a press conference at the airport before leaving for Gaborone this afternoon at 1530.
