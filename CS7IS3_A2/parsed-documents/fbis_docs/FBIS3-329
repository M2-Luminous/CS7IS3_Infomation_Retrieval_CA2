We found it surprising because there is no indication whether the author of the article is Katangese. Moreover, the author's anonymity is not even disturbed when he speaks on behalf of all members of the HCR. This is why we insist on making the following clarification: Members of the HCR from Katanga Province of all shades of opinion have formed the Katanga Parliamentary Group governed by a bureau, which is the sole organ authorized to speak for them. No decision of the kind mentioned in the article has been made by its plenary session. A decision to engage in or withdraw from the premiership race is the responsibility of the plenary session of their parliamentary group, which acts freely and independently in matters under its jurisdiction. We therefore categorically deny this information, which is likely to harm Katanga's interests. We call on you to publish our rejoinder in the same place the original article was published for the sake of justice. [Signed] For the Bureau of the Katanga Parliamentary Group: Copresidents Mulongo Mukalai, HCR member, and Mpondo Wabanga, HCR member
