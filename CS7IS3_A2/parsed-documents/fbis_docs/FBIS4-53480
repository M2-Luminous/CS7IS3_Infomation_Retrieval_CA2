Cavallo said that trade and investments between the two nations will increase as a result of his visit. The economy minister and Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong on 17 May signed an agreement for the reciprocal protection of investments in both countries. Cavallo said that Argentine export of products such as fruit, fish, leather, oils, and beef to Korea, which have recently dropped, will increase significantly in the future. On 16 May Cavallo met with Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok and other high-ranking South Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry officials. Minister Cavallo also met with the directors of large South Korean conglomerates such as the car manufacturers "Hyundai" and "Daewoo" in order to discuss investment opportunities in Argentina with them. The Argentine minister also talked about the possibility of exploiting Argentina's natural resources with representatives of companies such as "Samsung," the largest South Korean manufacturer of household appliances, and "Lucky-Goldstar," among others. Cavallo denied reports that Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay have decided to postpone for three months an agreement on free trade that was scheduled to become effective in January 1995. Argentina exports mainly agricultural products and raw materials to South Korea, and imports equipment. Last year the South American country exported a total of $66 million worth of products to South Korea, some 42 percent less than the previous year, while Argentina imported South Korean products for a total of $535 million, 15 percent more than the year before.
