For the past three years, numerous politicians have either acquired or regained a reputation by staking positions on the Bosnian conflict. While it is impossible to doubt the good faith of those concerned with this situation, it must be admitted that many of our deputies used the Yugoslav tragedy more for their own purposes than to help the martyred population. At a time when the situation in the field is modified by the stated will of the Western powers to intervene, the discretion observed by the professionals of humanitarian-military intervention should be noted. Everything is now occurring as if only one man is in charge of the issue, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe, who is putting a new face on cohabitation. The president and the prime minister remain silent, letting Juppe--and, to a certain extent, [Minister of Defense] Francois Leotardl--occupy first place, a situation not devoid of political and institutional consequences. It has been clear for 10 months that the "reserved domain" no longer exists. The second cohabitation has profoundly modified the distribution of responsibilities between the Elysee [presidential office], Matignon [prime minister's office] and the government. No longer does the president possess all the power in military and diplomatic matters. The "reserved domain," which does not exist on paper but has been constant practice since 1958, is now the "shared domain." Foreign policy handling has provoked no incidents since the advent of the Edouard Balladur government. The essential agreement between the president and the prime minister on important issues such as the GATT, but also the will of the two men to avoid messing up France's image following a political confrontation, have allowed France to speak with one voice. Shared Domain This does not mean that the Elysee and Matignon are in sync on all foreign policy or defense issues, as illustrated by the nuclear testing question, where it was indicative that the criticism expressed by part of the majority was directed at Edouard Balladur more than at Francois Mitterrand. Those within the Right who contest the "shared domain" are accusing Matignon and no longer the Elysee. Thus, foreign policy has become a domestic policy issue within the majority. If the competition between the two heads of the executive branch was obvious in foreign affairs between 1986 and 1988, the second cohabitation is characterized by the absence of confrontation--at least publicly--in this field. This situation renders Matignon and the Elysee relatively discreet. The minister of foreign affairs thus is called upon to be much more present on the media scene than his predecessors, all the more so since, in Alain Juppe's case, he is not the spokesman for Matignon, nor, of course, for the Elysee. [passage omitted] With regard to the Bosnian conflict, it seems that Juppe is the true head of the general staff, alone on the front lines and seconded only by Francois Leotard. Super Star Juppe never misses a chance to note that he handles the issue in perfect accord with the president and the prime minister. However, Mitterrand and Balladur's silence leave the starring role to Juppe, omnipresent on radio and television and seemingly the only leader. France is speaking through him. If, tomorrow, French firmness were to foster the conclusion of a real cease-fire and the acceleration of the Geneva negotiations, Matignon and the Elysee's voice surely would be heard. Nevertheless, Juppe would still derive a legitimate benefit. Thus the foreign affairs minister is playing an important personal game. If the policy France advocates leads to a happy solution in the former Yugoslavia, Juppe will be the man who unblocked the situation. He will have proved that the statesmanlike qualities attributed to him are indeed real. He will also be able to claim new responsibilities in the future, beginning with the leadership of the single list of the majority for the European Parliament elections. The Bosnian issue, which has been poisoning French political life for months, will then have served to restore reasonableness to the majority.
