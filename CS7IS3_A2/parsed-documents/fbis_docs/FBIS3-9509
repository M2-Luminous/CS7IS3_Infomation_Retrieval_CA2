They discussed and determined the proposed law on electing president of the country. This law states the country's president will be elected during general, direct, and secret voting, for a 5-year mandate. It will take a group of at least 10,000 voters or 30 parliament deputies to nominate a presidential candidate. If no candidate gets the necessary majority of votes in the first rounds of election, the second round will include the two candidates with biggest number of votes from the first round. The Government also adopted the proposal on changes in the law on appointing and replacing parliament deputies and committee members. The Macedonian Parliament will be consisted of 140 deputies. 120 of them will be elected by the majority principle, and the remaining one by the proportionate one. The number of members in township committees will be determined by a Statute. The news in this law is that the second round of elections will include only candidates who have gotten at least 12 percent of the total number of voters in the first round. Government members also adopted the proposed law on political parties, regulating procedure and conditions for founding, registering and ceasing to exist of political parties. The law allows no registering of parties with a program, statute, or activities aimed to forcefully overthrow the government, urging or calling to military aggression, and introducing religious, national, or racial hatred or intolerance. The package of laws is expected to appear on the parliament agenda during its 74th session, announced for March 29.
