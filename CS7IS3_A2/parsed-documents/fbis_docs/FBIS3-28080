Quoting its own source, YONHAP reported that the anti-establishment underground movement operated secretly from late 1991, mainly with students from the Kim Il-song University, but that the North Korean university students who took part in the underground organization were arrested by the authorities because moves by Chinese students studying in the North, who were part of the organization, were exposed by the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang in early 1992.
