FR940204-2-00119 FR940204-2-00088 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Maintenance Inspection Procedure Public Workshop SUMMARY: The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) will hold a public workshop on March 31, 1994, to conduct initial discussions regarding the draft maintenance inspection procedure developed for use by NRC inspectors to verify the implementation of 10 CFR 50.65, ``Requirements for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants'' (the Maintenance Rule). The effective date of the Maintenance Rule is July 10, 1996. NRC draft Inspection Procedure ``Maintenance Inspection Procedure XXXXX'' has been developed to ascertain compliance with the Maintenance Rule and to verify that licensees using NUMARC 93&hyph;01 ``Industry Guidance for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants'' have satisfactorily implemented the Maintenance Rule. The commission believes that it would be beneficial to obtain public comment on this procedure from all interested parties at a public workshop. Participants are encouraged to ask questions and provide written comments on the procedure during the workshop. Written comments received from interested parties unable to attend the workshop will also be considered through April 14, 1994. At the workshop, NRC representatives will present an overview of the inspection program, the contents of the maintenance inspection procedure and, as applicable, issues related to the Maintenance Rule and the NUMARC 93&hyph;01 industry guidance. NRC regional inspection representatives will be available to participate in the discussions. The workshop will provide the participants an opportunity to ask questions, make comments during the discussion or submit written comments for NRC consideration. The workshop will conclude with a summary of the major issues identified at the meeting. The planned use of the procedure during pilot inspections will also be discussed. In order to ensure that adequate seating is available for the meeting, persons planning to attend the workshop are requested to either call the contact designated below or complete and forward the attached registration form to the same contact by March 25, 1994. A block of rooms has been reserved at the Holiday Inn Crown Plaza Hotel (1&hyph;800&hyph;638&hyph;5963) for the convenience of meeting attendees. These rooms will be available at a reduced group rate until March 9, 1994. Attendees should identify themselves with the NRC Maintenance Workshop, # 4093, in order to ensure the group rate. The NRC however, does not encourage nor support frequenting this or any other specific establishment. The hotel will collect a ten dollar fee at room check in or the morning of the workshop to cover expenses for morning and afternoon refreshments. The draft procedure ``Maintenance Inspection Procedure XXXXX'' is publicly available at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 by referencing a memorandum from Gary G. Zech to Elizabeth J. Yeates, dated January 25, 1994. DATE AND LOCATION: The meeting will be held from 9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m. on March 31, 1994 at: Holiday Inn Crown Plaza, 1750 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 20852, (301) 468&hyph;1100. WRITTEN COMMENTS, REGISTRATION FORMS OR FURTHER INFORMATION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO: Thomas Foley, M/S 10&hyph;A&hyph;19, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone (301) 504&hyph;1036. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 10, 1991, the NRC published the ``Requirements for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants'' as ยง50.65 of 10 CFR part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The Commission determined that a Maintenance Rule was needed because proper maintenance is essential to plant safety, especially as plants age. The Maintenance Rule will become effective on July 10, 1996. The five year period to implement the rule permits time to develop implementation guidance, inspection procedures and sufficient time for licensees to implement the rule requirements to ensure full conformance by July 10, 1996. Shortly after the Maintenance Rule was published, the NRC and the Nuclear Management and Resource Council (NUMARC) embarked on parallel efforts to develop rule implementation guidance. The NRC staff determined that the NUMARC document provided an acceptable method for licensees to implement the requirements of the Maintenance Rule. In June 1993, the Commission issued Regulatory Guide 1.160, ``Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants,'' which endorsed the NUMARC guidance, NUMARC 93&hyph;01, ``Industry Guideline for Monitoring the Effectiveness of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated May 1993. Subsequently, NUMARC conducted a verification and validation (V & V) program, with NRC staff observation, to test their guidance on several representative systems at nine nuclear units. The V & V effort concluded that the guidelines were adequate to implement the Maintenance Rule. The NRC staff has developed an inspection procedure to be used by NRC inspectors to verify the implementation of the Maintenance Rule requirements. The NRC staff expects to validate the inspection procedure during pilot inspections at selected nuclear power facilities following the March 1994 workshop. After considering the comments obtained from the workshop and information obtained during the implementation of the pilot inspections, the NRC staff expects to revise the inspection procedure as necessary, and conduct another workshop to provide interested parties an opportunity to participate in discussions on the results of the pilot inspections and any revisions to the inspection procedure. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thomas Foley, Senior Operations Engineer, Division of Reactor Inspection and Licensee Performance, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
