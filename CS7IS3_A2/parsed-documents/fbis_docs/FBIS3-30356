The idea of inviting the Polish guest to pay a visit, which is regarded by the Swiss as the year's most important state visit, was first put forward by Otto Stich, finance minister and the Confederation's president for this year. The visit will be an opportunity to "establish closer contacts between the two countries," according to Mario Carrera (President Stich's press spokesman), in a statement to RZECZPOSPOLITA. Issues linked to both countries' membership in the same group within the IMF will also be discussed. It is worth recalling here that last year President Stich came out strongly in favor of Switzerland's joining the IMF, and he also made efforts to have Poland included in the same group [within the IMF] as Switzerland. Even though a lot of time is still left in which to define a detailed program for the visit, it is already known unofficially at this stage that President Stich would like to play host to his guest in his home canton of Solothurn. The city of Solothurn plays quite a significant role in the history of Polish-Swiss contacts. Tadeusz Kosciuszko stayed and died there in the years 1815-17. To this day in the city, there is a modest but very beautiful museum devoted to the Polish national hero.
