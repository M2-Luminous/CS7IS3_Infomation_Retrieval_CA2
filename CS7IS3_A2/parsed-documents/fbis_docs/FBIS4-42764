This, according to the Federal Economics Ministry, is the aim of the revised version of the export list, which the federal cabinet approved today. The revised version also brought with it both an easing of export regulations and a simplification of procedures. The raising of the limits in the computer and electronics sectors is worth particular emphasis. This will noticeably reduce the number of export permits required from the Federal Export Office. This will, in its turn, take a considerable burden off the export sector. The situation following the abolition of the common export controls by the Western world for goods suitable for military purposes (COCOM) was given consideration when the new version of the export list was drawn up.
