Beaubrun said: Bayonets lay down the law, which is what we are experiencing today. He denounces the behavior of everyone involved in the current crisis: [Begin Deaubrun recording, in Creole] First of all, to return to a constitutional framework, we should first [last word in English] resolve the Haitian crisis. Nothing can be accomplished in a crisis situation. In a crisis situation, it is normal for bayonets to lay down the law, while the Constitution goes unheeded [bayonet se fe; konstitisyon se papye]. When we say bayonets lay down the law, we see bayonets in the hands of Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the international community when it uses embargo, when it uses blockade, when it uses pressure, and when it uses threats. All these things are bayonets. We also see bayonets in the hands of the Haitian Army when it represses... [pauses] I will not say repress because the word repress is not appropriate, when the Haitian Army oppresses, when it randomly destroys, arresting people arbitrarily, abnormally, anarchically. Then bayonets lay down the law, while the Constitution goes unheeded." [end recording] Beaubrun invited the senators to show their patriotism by disentangling the crisis. He revealed that the Chamber of Deputies would soon be looking into the crisis in the Senate because Senator Sansaricq sent a letter to the office of the lower chamber mentioning sanctions that are being considered by the unofficial office [of the Senate] against the senators who are chronically absent.
