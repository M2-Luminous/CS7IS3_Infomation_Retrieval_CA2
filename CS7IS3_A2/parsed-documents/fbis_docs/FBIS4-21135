We need resources and assistance even from the U.S. State Department. [Begin Gallo recording] The State Department can help in obtaining assistance for Nicaragua's police apparatus to combat it. You know how precarious the National Police budget is. [end recording] The law is also being drafted to fight money laundering, which has not taken hold in Nicaragua. [Begin Luis Humberto Guzman, Christian Democratic Union deputy and National Assembly president, recording, in progress] ...the report does not review the volume of financial transactions in Nicaragua's banks. We could not necessarily talk of money laundering; at least not for now. [end recording] Nicaragua has not reached the level of drug trafficking of other countries. [Begin Guzman recording] Perhaps Nicaragua's only implication is that its territory and air space are used as a drug-trafficking and transshipment point. [end recording] The law may be passed in the next four weeks. Controversial topics will be DEA operations in our country and the extradition of nationals, something our Constitution bars.
