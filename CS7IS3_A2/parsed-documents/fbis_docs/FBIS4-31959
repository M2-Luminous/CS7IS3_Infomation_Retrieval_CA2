Milutinovic: "New Story--Sad Ending"] [Text] By mid-May, the commercial banks had loaned to the domestic economy about 800 million dinars of credit to "invigorate" production. Thanks to that financial injection, Yugoslav industry increased its output 12.4 percent in February, 21.3 percent in March, and another 3.4 percent in April. At first glance, the authors of the program for monetary reconstruction and economic recovery have reason to be content. But at the same time there are also many reasons to be concerned. In the first four months of this year industrial production is all of one-fifth below what it was in the same period of last year. Let us remind those who are forgetful: The country's social product last year was equal to the one in far-off 1963. "Overnight Coverage" The commencement of Avramovic's program was characterized by markedly "animated" credit activity of the banks, which recently has essentially dwindled. Only here and there do you hear that any of the more than 100 commercial banks has granted a new loan to the economy. Faced with this development of events, the National Bank of Yugoslavia [NBJ] has on two occasions tried to get additional funds for new loans by reducing the legal reserves (5 percent at the moment). But that effect melted away in just a few days, so that many bankers are demanding more and more loudly that the rate of the legal reserves be reduced to zero, that is, be done away with. In that case, that is, every dinar deposited could be loaned out. The same objective is behind the demand to bring back once again the principle of "overnight coverage," which would mean that the negative balance of any bank could temporarily be covered from the accounts of another bank. Up to now, it was very expensive to go "in the red," and any negative balance had to be covered through a sale of foreign exchange to the central bank, and so the bankers were much more cautious. This, unfortunately, did not last long, and the principle of mandatory coverage of a negative balance with foreign exchange was very quickly abandoned. Government bodies and agencies are continuing to insist on new bank loans in order to increase output. That is quite understandable. It is in the interest of the state for as many enterprises as possible to be in operation, because that also means fewer unemployed workers, who have to be financed from the garners of the state. At the same time, neither the federal nor republic government nor the central bank really cares all that much in the end whether and when any of those loans will be repaid. The risk falls only on those who actually invest the money in certain firms, and that means the bank and its depositors. Because most bankers are aware that even the banking sector will not be able to survive long without financial rescue, none of them is really all that anxious to reproach those who will later decide whether a bank is going to go into bankruptcy or perhaps be rescued. That is why the present situation might be described in just four words as "shut up and give." Rescheduling Incidentally, there is no other way to explain the fact that many firms are coming for a second round of loans when they still have not repaid the first loan. Even though the date for repayment of the principal and the accrued interest agreed to has already passed. Still more strangely, many banks are meeting those demands more and more frequently and in that way turning themselves into "wishing wells," and only the rare ones dare to slam the door in the face of delinquent debtors. The daily press has been writing about this quite a bit in recent days. The example of the Motor and Tractor Industry [IMT] in New Belgrade is a typical example: On 10 May, it applied for a new loan from Beobanka, although it had not repaid the previous loan of 19 million dinars. In order to improve the chances of their management, the workers at IMT went on strike--instead of asking the top management of their firm where the millions obtained in February disappeared. The colleagues from IMT were soon joined by trade union officials of IMR [Rakovica Motor Industry] in Rakovica, 21 Maja, Precizna Mehanika in Zemun.... It all inescapably reminds us of the old tried-and-true formula. The only essential thing is to "channel in the right direction" the anger of the workers, and the loan is certain to be forthcoming. They are forgetting that this is the best way of destroying the stabilization program for certain. If decisions on the granting of new loans should be made by trade union officials together with inept managers of large firms, this will be a sure sign that the money is going into a bottomless hole. And because there is no bottom, there is no source from which to return what has been borrowed. Return of the State In the present phase of realization of the program for economic recovery, the bankers are supposed to forbid access to their vaults to all those who still have not repaid old loans. Otherwise, they will never again be able to say "no" to anyone. Rescheduling automatically means that there will be no money for projects for which credit support of the banks is also indispensable. In this connection, there was the rather symptomatic announcement of the most responsible government officials that some firms cannot be left hanging and must be provided new loans although they have not repaid those already granted. This is justified on the alleged grounds that production has still not been rounded out. At the same time, it is not clear why this state does not loose the strings of "its own purse" and finance such programs from the budget, if it is so convinced that the market will confirm their value. Governor Avramovic himself has been mentioning Zastava in Kragujevac more and more loudly, although it is clear to everyone that the average Yugoslav does not have money for a Yugo, and those who have managed to get rich in a short time prefer a Mercedes. The state must decide once and for all where its interest lies and then finance that itself, leaving everything else to free competition on the market, in which it will not be issuing any indirect orders as to who should do what. It is clear to everyone that the growth of production is one of the conditions for economic recovery. But people seem to be forgetting that production is not an end in itself and is worth nothing until it finds a customer on the market. What is more, enterprises must discharge their obligations not only to the state, which in spite of all difficulties, has been collecting its tribute quite regularly, but also to the bank from which the loans were taken. Incidentally, if all the loans granted so far had been repaid with interest, nearly 900 million dinars would very quickly build up once again in the banking system. Only then could bankers freely decide how much of that money to lend to whom in the future. This way, one can get the impression that what has been borrowed is being repaid only by firms that have no one of their own in the top government leadership or in the management of the bank. The Credit Financing of Losing Operation Attention should assuredly also be paid to the fact that the commercial banks have begun to extend foreign exchange loans to the NBJ. This has already been done by Jugobanka, Beobanka, Investbanka, Union Banka, Komercijalna Banka.... Nikola Stanic, M.A., NBJ vice governor, has even boasted in public that he has had no time for anything except concluding contracts with the bankers for foreign exchange loans. The basis for that is contained in the law recently adopted for the FRY to borrow $300 million in foreign exchange and to use the foreign exchange collected in that way as support for the new dinar. It has already taken in several tens of millions of marks in this way, and this is giving rise to new dilemmas. Aggrieved foreign exchange savings depositors are wondering how the banks have foreign exchange to lend to the state, when at the same time they say that they are unable to pay them their foreign exchange savings? The bankers justify themselves by saying that this is the foreign exchange of their customers, large socialized or government-owned firms, as though there is writing on every mark, dollar, schilling, or franc saying to whom it belongs and who deposited it in the bank. One gets the impression that this justification does not really hold water. But everything is possible here. At the same time, the question arises of what interest the bank has here, when we know that the repayment period for those loans is two years, and there is a grace period of one year, and the rate of interest is the rate of interest in the country from which the currency comes? These conditions, which are not overly attractive, give rise to the suspicion that this is some kind of government "racket," so that certain bankers have no other solution than to take the foreign exchange from their vaults and "voluntarily" turn it over to the central bank, that is, to the state. This version becomes quite convincing when we realize that many firms are ready to offer much more favorable conditions than the state for foreign exchange loans. But for them there simply is no foreign exchange. This suggests the conclusion that it is not all as voluntary as they would like to portray it. For the present, the story about those foreign exchange loans is very much like what happened with the loans to invigorate production. The media are overloaded with the numerous deals that have been concluded, and almost no one asks how and when those loans will be repaid? In what way will the state be able to repay the interest and accrued interest in a period of two years? If it does as it has done up to now--all those who have given their money can say good-bye to it. By way of consolation, there remains the hope that at some point the state might change. Finally, the conclusion can be drawn that the public will soon be confronted with a new form of credit financing. This time they would have the principal role and would be using their money to help to increase production and support stability of the national currency. The idea of the new loan for "economic rebirth" has been launched by Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, NBJ governor, with a justification that sounds a bit naive, to the effect that he did not even know about the previous loan and what happened to it. New projects and programs that will compete to use the money obtained by floating the public loan are to be gathered over the next month or two. So, whoever wants to, let them do it. In order to correct at least to some extent the impression, the government would first have to force the enterprises who have so far borrowed money from the banks to repay those loans. Otherwise, the public will not be able to expect its money back either. And that would then mean that there is yet another story on the horizon with a sad ending.
