The German GNP will grow by 1.5 percent this year, according to the spring report by the Hamburg HWWA Institute for Economic Research, the Munich Ifo Institute for Economic Research, the Kiel University's Institute for World Economy (IfW), the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH), and the Essen-based Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI). Only the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) is skeptical, predicting a 0.5 percent growth for the whole of Germany. Yet, the institutes are dampening the politicians' optimism: "The improvement in the economic situation does not, however, mean that the course has already been set for a strong growth of the west German economy and for a high level of employment," the report says. The economic researchers' assessment of eastern Germany is equally cautious: "While industrial investment has been strong so far, it cannot be ruled out that the initial development may gradually lose momentum, after major investment projects by Western companies have been completed." Also, many investors seem to have planned projects that they are now unable to realize. The institutes are pinning their hopes on an increase in foreign demand. Private consumption will, however, remain slack. After all, the macroeconomic total net wages and salaries will go down by just under 2 percent due to higher social insurance contributions and tax increases. This could result in more restrained consumer habits. Just as in previous years, the majority of the institutes urge politicians to conduct a moderate wage and fiscal policy. Investments must come from private funds to enable the creation of a large number of jobs. The researchers confirm that the public deficit will decrease considerably in 1995. A lower public budget deficit does not, however, imply a more sound financial policy. With the agreed massive tax increases, consolidation threatens to become an end in itself as far as fiscal policy goes. Yet it is quite natural that those private investors contributing most to the net product are hit the hardest. After its reintroduction next year, the solidarity surcharge should be gradually abolished, starting in 1996. Since the Federal Constitutional Court demands a change in the tax-free subsistence level as of 1996, "reforms of taxation" should be tackled, all institutes except for the Berlin-based DIW say. The progressive rate will be kept, and the income level for the maximum tax rate should be increased. The institutes reprimand the government for thinking that the economy virtually has to earn tax cuts by means of rapid growth and increasing tax receipts. "Tax cuts are not the climax of economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively economic development," the report says. Also, the state must promote structural changes by deregulating markets and making them more flexible. Market power threatens to be misused in the fields of energy supply, waste disposal, and in part of the transport and financing businesses. Thus, banks achieving higher profits during the recession than other sectors do during a boom, indicate a lack of competition and markets being sealed off. The Bundesbank is urged to continue to announce money supply targets in spite of the recent unusually high increase in the money supply. For 1994, the institutes consider a money supply target of 5 to 7 percent appropriate, which is slightly more than the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 percent. The increase in money supplies is expected to go down considerably over the next few months. Even if interest rates in the United States continue to increase, the Bundesbank could lower its key interest rate by another 2 percent in the course of the year. Long-term interest rates in the capital market could move below 6 percent. The DIW is much more skeptical. With private consumption expected to go down considerably, the Berlin researchers are forecasting a further setback in production in the second half of the year. The DIW also holds a different view on financial policy. Instead of tax cuts, the DIW considers a mixed strategy of tax increases, lower social insurance contributions, and cuts in expenditure appropriate.
