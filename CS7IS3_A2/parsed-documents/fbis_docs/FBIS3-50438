The three Electoral Tribunal magistrates presented the Morena Party credentials to the leaders of that political organization. After complying with this requirement, Morena has the full rights to participate in the electoral process and to present candidates for this event. Morena President Pedro Vallarino said that the party will attempt to be the vehicle for Panamanians who have not had the opportunity to participate in politics to do so. He added that Morena has talked to several parties, but, until now, has not agreed on any alliance for the upcoming elections or to back any presidential candidate. According to Vallarino, Morena prefers to join independent groups and avoid the political parties, because once the latter reach power they end up fighting for political spaces. A Morena source also reported yesterday that there is a possibility that the group of former Christian Democratic Party (PDC) members, who are called "The Brown Ones," may enter the Morena party ranks. This decision could be announced next Wednesday in a political event that will be attended by Morena party leaders and representatives of "The Brown Ones." According to Vallarino, the party has several presidential candidate hopefuls, including former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles and Joaquin Jose Vallarino. He said, however, that the Morena presidential candidate will be chosen at the national convention.
