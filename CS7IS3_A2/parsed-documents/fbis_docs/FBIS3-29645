The new policy would not serve anyone's interest in Japan, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) who declined to be named. The electronics industry was plunged into confusion when a senior official at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry on Tuesday unveiled a plan to switch from an analog system to a digital system in the format of razor-sharp high-definition television (HDTV). The Posts Ministry has supported the analog system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), and the electronics industry has invested huge sums of money into its development. The sudden policy change is "unconvincing" and all segments of Japan -- NHK, electronics makers, retailers and consumers -- will be affected negatively, the MITI official said. Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau at the Posts Ministry, announced the switch at a news conference, explaining that NHK's adherence to the analog HDTV system could spawn a new source of trade friction. NHK has been experimenting with analog HDTV broadcasting, known as hi-vision, since 1991, and consumers have purchased hi-vision televisions. The sudden move toward a change in high-definition TV system standards took consumer electronics companies by surprise, leaving them worried about a possible drop in sales of the HDTV systems now on the market. "It's certain that sales of the existing products (based on NHK's analog system) will drop," said an official at Sony Corp. Sony and other electronics companies have been betting on the analog HDTV's success to provide them with a long-awaited hit product. "Our industry as a whole has invested some 300 billion yen," said an official at one major electronics company. But the official and others noted that a shift toward a digital HDTV system will be a benefit in the long run and it is not so hard for them to go after such a system. If HDTV standards are unified into a digital system, it could save time and money needed to develop different systems and the benefits of mass production could be expected, the official said. "If there is a change in standards, we will be able to respond to it with the development of a decorder for a digital system," said an official at Toshiba Corp. NHK itself reacted with anger to Egawa's remarks, saying they hinder the promotion of HDTV systems and run counter to audience expectations. "Mr. Egawa's remarks, which imply a review of the muse system, hinder the progress of hi-vision promotion, spoil the efforts hitherto made by the concerned parties, run counter to audience expectation, and are thus very regrettable," NHK said in a statement. "Nhk will promote hi-vision as ever, respecting the report by the Radio Regulatory Council to the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications published last May, such that the council considers...The muse system as the proper broadcasting system of HDTV in Japan in the post BS-3 broadcasting satellite era," the statement said. A senior official at NHK, which has been aggressively promoting the analog-based hi-vision system, branded Egawa's remarks as a personal view. "They are a personal opinion by the director general rather than the view of the ministry," the official said. NNNN
