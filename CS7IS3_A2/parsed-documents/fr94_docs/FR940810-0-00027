FR940810-0-00027 FR940810-0-00015 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD13&hyph;94&hyph;024] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulation; Reactor Compartment Move, Puget Sound, WA AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone 300 yards around the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS, the towline and the barge NESTUCCA while in transit from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, through U.S. navigable waters until south of Latitude 47 ○32 ’N, Queets, Washington, at 8 a.m. (PDT) on August 18, 1994. The zone is needed to protect the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge NESTUCCA from safety hazards associated with onlookers and others who may wish to view the barge at close quarters. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation becomes effective on August 17, 1994 at 2 a.m. (PDT). It terminates when the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge are south of Latitude 47 ○32 ’N, Queets, Washington, at 8 a.m. (PDT) on August 18, 1994, unless sooner terminated by the Captain of the Port. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT. J.D. Gafkjen, c/o Captain of the Port Puget Sound, 1519 Alaskan Way South, Seattle, Washington 98134, (206) 217&hyph;6232. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since immediate action is needed to prevent potential hazards to the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge and other vessels that may transit the area. Less than 30 days notice was given to the Coast Guard by the U.S. Navy, thus, there was not sufficient time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide a delayed effective date. Following normal rulemaking procedures would be impracticable. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are LT J.D. Gafkjen, project officer for the Captain of the Port, and LT L.J. Argenti, project attorney, Thirteenth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulation The event requiring this regulation will begin on August 17, 1994 at 2 a.m. (PDT). Upon request by the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard is establishing a 300 yard moving safety zone around the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS, the towline, and the barge NESTUCCA while the vessels are in transit from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, through U.S. navigable waters until south of Latitude 47 ○32 ’N, Queets, Washington, at 8 a.m. (PDT) on August 18, 1994. This transit may result in a large number of vessels congregating near the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge or in their paths. Concern is justified due to the limited maneuverability of the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge and for the safety of the mariners who may attempt to approach the tugs BARBARA/RICHARD FOSS and the barge during their transit as well as other vessels in the immediate vicinity. This moving safety zone will be enforced by representatives of the Captain of the Port Puget Sound, Seattle, Washington. The Captain of the Port may be assisted by other federal agencies. This Regulation is issued pursuant to 33 USC 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165. Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment This final rule has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.
