Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin also told reporter David Essing that Israel has decided not to participate in international peacekeeping missions abroad. [Begin recording] [Beilin] Our only decision is to take part in humanitarian efforts in Angola. We are ready to do that, and I will inform the UN secretary general about that decision. Maybe later on, in due time, such a decision that you are referring to will be taken, but time is not ripe now to take it. [Essing] What kind of participation will Israel be giving to this Angolan project? [Beilin] We are speaking about establishing and controlling a hospital in Angola, sending doctors and some other medical services to Angola, and to keep this hospital for a while. [Essing] Any time frame for this? When will this be taking place? [Beilin] There are still many conditions, and the first one is that there will be peace in Angola. This is far from being the reality, and the fighting between Savimbi and Dos Santos in Angola still takes place, so we cannot know exactly the timing of such a decision, but it won't be tomorrow. [end recording] In an address last night, Beilin said also that two representatives of countries he declined to name recently visited Israel seeking advice and training in the resolution of disputes. He did not elaborate.
