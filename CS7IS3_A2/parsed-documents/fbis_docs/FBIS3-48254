We would like to make a decision on the draft budget before the U.S. trip." However, he also explained: "In view of the (tumultuous) political situation, we need to coordinate with the deliberations (within the ruling parties) on the taxation system, and discussions at the government Tax Commission before making a final decision. I have a feeling we are running out of time." He thus indicated that there is a possibility that the government's draft budget may be delayed depending on future developments. Regarding economic stimulation measures, which are scheduled to be announced within this week, Takemura said: "The (government and ruling parties') conference on economic issues will be convened as early as possible this week, instead of next week, while deliberations on political reform are also in progress. Since (economic stimulation measures) are an issue of great interest to the people, we would like to deal with this issue while working on political reform even amid the present turmoil."
