But there has been one: The leu, contrary to gloomy forecasts, which predicted for it the fate of the Ukrainian karbovanets, is still keeping afloat. Supported by nothing but transfusions from international financial organizations, the leu is nevertheless remaining stable. It is the hardest currency among the CIS republics, the "Logos-press" economic review maintains, citing specific figures in confirmation. At the beginning of January the exchange rate stood at 364 Moldavian lei to U.S.$100, and at the end of March at 399 to $100, i.e. an increase in the dollar against the leu of just 9.6 percent, which is not that much. Michael Blackwell, IMF representative in Moldavia, also makes an optimistic assessment of the national currency's position. The rate of inflation has fallen sharply. Whereas it stood at 50 percent in December, in February it was down to 26 percent. The IMF representative predicts 1-3 percent a month by the end of the year -- no higher than in other developed European countries. M. Blackwell sees as the reason for this stability of the leu the strong reform program chosen by the Moldavian Government and the rigid control over the financial policy of the National Bank, which has limited total credit and is abiding strictly by the memorandum signed with the IMF. If the National Bank continues to keep to the chosen line, Blackwell believes, then soon "healthy economic growth will begin" in Moldavia, while the strong currency will make enterprises adopt "more rational decisions." So the leu is stable, which cannot, alas, be said of the state of Moldavia's industrial potential. It is steadily declining. The nonpayment of wages for several months in many sectors has become a chronic illness in the Republic. Far from everyone in Moldavia shares the IMF representative's optimism. In particular, A. Muravskiy, parliamentary deputy from the Agrarian Democratic Party, believes that the IMF financial policy resembles the actions of surgeons who treat all diseases in just one way -- with a surgical operation. International consultants rigidly apply the same yardstick to Nicaragua, Poland, and Moldavia, regarding them as some experimental test bed. But only a few people are familiar with the memorandum, which the chief program of the financial policy, and it can be judged only on indirect signs. These are not very reassuring. "If the optimum point is not seized," Muravskiy remarked, "a social storm could blow up and sweep aside both this parliament and this government." The Moldavian Union of Industrialists believes that it is the anti-inflationary monetary policy according to other people's prescriptions that has put the Republic's industry in a grave financial position, and it has demanded that the memorandum be examined in parliament with a view to amending it. Prime Minister A. Sangheli has reaffirmed, however, that the government will not alter the chosen course and will take the path of reforms. The very near future will evidently show whether Moldavia will succeed in improving the health of the economy or whether the leu's stability will remain a local "economic miracle."
