Two other human rights reports published this week call for an independent public inquiry into alleged collusion between security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. President Clinton will be briefed on the State Department report before he meets the Prime Minister in Washington on February 27. Its contents, should they be raised at the meeting, will further sour the "special relationship" between the two countries, strained by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's visit to New York last week. The report gives details of recent killings and judicial proceedings. "Although no deaths resulted from shootings by security forces (in 1993), charges continued that soldiers resorted to lethal force precipitately and carried out a `shoot to kill' policy," it says. "Security forces, both the army and Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC], frequently harass citizens verbally, particularly young people in areas where community support for terrorists is considered strong. Security forces have also been accused of more serious incidents of physical mistreatment." In Political Killings in Northern Ireland, published today, Amnesty International accuses the Government of evading its duty to investigate "mounting evidence of collusion between government forces and groups like the banned Ulster Defence Association [UDA] that oppose any change in Northern lreland's status quo.... The Government must make every effort to show equal concern for all members of the population, by guaranteeing equal protection." And the Belfast-based Committee on the Administration of Justice has this week published a report on allegations of harassment in connection with incidents involving the use of lethal force. Of 20 families interviewed by the Committee, nine reported that their deceased family member had received death threats by police or soldiers. All three reports note the killing of some 350 people by the security forces since 1969. Most were Catholics, about half of whom were unarmed. Up to 1991, 21 security force members were prosecuted for killings using firearms. Nineteen were found not guilty, one was convicted of manslaughter and given a suspended sentence. Only one, a soldier, was convicted of murder. Although given a life sentence, he served just over two years and was then reinstated in the army. Amnesty says: "The pattern that has emerged is one of repeated allegtions that suspects are arbitrarily killed rather than being arrested, that members of the security forces believe they can operate with impunity, and that this is reinforced by government failure to take steps to prevent unlawful killings. "The Government evades responsibility by hiding behind an array of legal procedures and secret inquiries." It calls for an independent inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane, a lawyer shot dead in February 1989 by the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the role played by Brian Nelson, a UDA member and army informer sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment last year for conspiracy to murder. It also calls for the widening of the Stevens inquiry, which in 1989 investigated security leaks to loyalist groups and which was reopened last year after Mr Nelson's trial. "The apparent failure of the security forces to take significant action against UDA `death squads' was not addressed before the court," Amnesty says. The report considers allegations that the RUC has been negligent in gathering evidence about loyalist attacks on catholics, that it has failed to respond adequately to demands for protection and has failed to deter loyalist paramilitaries from entering catholic areas or to detect them despite surveillance. "The facility with which loyalist gunmen raid homes in stringently monitored and controlled Catholic neighbourhoods and then leave witout hindrance has contributed to the lack of confidence in the RUC," Amnesty says.
