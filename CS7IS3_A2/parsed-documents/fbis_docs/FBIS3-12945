Pakistan has also made it clear to the monetary organization that the new dimensions of dangers posed to this region due to the increase in the Indian defense budget cannot be ignored. Financial organizations like the IMF have adopted a policy of imposing tough conditions when providing aid and loans to needy, developing countries. Generally, conditions like a cut in defense expenditure and the number of armed forces personnel are set in cases of Islamic countries. Pressure has also been exerted on Pakistan to accept this condition. However, India has been exempted from it. The Pakistan Government has been severely criticized by the opposition and some other political circles, and it is not possible for the government to easily reject these criticisms. By deciding to increase the defense budget, the government has silenced its political opponents, and the people have expressed their satisfaction. By informing responsible persons in the IMF about the decision, the Government of Pakistan has also made it clear that it is not willing to put its security and existence at stake merely to secure loans from a financial organization. The fact is that India's aggressive designs in this region is no secret and Pakistan faces the gravest danger from the Indian buildup. This is because it is with Pakistan that India has the most serious dispute, in the form of Kashmir. India considers Pakistan as the biggest hurdle in this region to the fulfillment of its designs. Pakistan has already been the target of Indian aggression thrice. Therefore, it cannot afford to ignore Indian activities. Under the circumstances, the Government of Pakistan's decision is an appropriate and sensible one in the interest of the country's security and a strong national defense. The government should scrupulously adhere to the decision. Pakistan's position is very strong and forceful and this is why it is not possible for any country or organization to ever counter Pakistan's arguments at any forum.
