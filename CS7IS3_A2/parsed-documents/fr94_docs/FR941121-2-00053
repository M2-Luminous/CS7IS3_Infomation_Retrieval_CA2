The power sales contracts will be structured so that if a member withdraws from either ICPA or UMPA, the member retains its entitlement of PRP power. VII. Term of Contract. The power sales contracts will become effective upon execution and shall terminate on September 30, 2008. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: Western has complied with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through preparation of an environmental assessment on the impacts of the proposed marketing changes and has issued a Finding of No Significant Impact on November 8, 1994. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS: Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that (1) this rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866: DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required. Issued in Golden, Colorado, November 8, 1994. J.M. Shafer, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28684 Filed 11&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
