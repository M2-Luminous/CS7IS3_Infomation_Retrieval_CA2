In our editorial room, we received several telephone calls reporting the military movements. Meanwhile, upon being asked, the Army Information and Press Department reported that normally early in every month, members of the Zavala Marshal Brigade, the Honor Guard, or La Aurora Guard, a former tactical detachment, conduct routine military training. Following the referendum on 30 January, the rumors of a possible social outbreak or, worse yet, a coup d'etat remain in the air. Political leaders who were asked but who chose to remain anonymous said that, in reality, they were also alerted by friends or relatives of a potential military movement by the government's military leadership. One of the interviewees recalled that after the visit by U.S. Ambassador Marilyn McAfee to Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Vielman Ruiz last Friday, rumors regarding destabilizing movements against the government have been going around, and even though they have not been confirmed, they have not been denied either. In diplomatic circles, no opinions were given on the current situation. The ambassadors who were asked, said only that there currently is an effort under way by Guatemalans to demand respect for order and legality.
