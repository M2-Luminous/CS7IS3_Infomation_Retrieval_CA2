This statement was made as His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and his queen were returning to the country and after government forces had captured the Khmer Rouge's important region of Pailin and other positions along the western border. Samdech Son Sann gave the following as reason: "The conflict in Cambodia has caused untold sufffering to the people. Of all the major problems that they have faced over the past two decades, the serious Khmer Rouge problem is yet to be solved." In point one, Samdech Son Sann explained that "the settlement of the Khmer Rouge problem must be achieved through peaceful means..." because any military solution would only bring tragedies and deaths to the people and cause shortages of food, medicine, and so on. Samdech Son Sann said: "We believe that solving the Khmer Rouge problem militarily can only delay Cambodia's rehabilitation and reconstruction. It can only frighten away foreign investments to neighboring countries." He pointed out the eventuality that "such an action would instead help the neighboring countries suck up all the economic advantages and would plunge Cambodia into a state of insecurity." In the second point of his statement, Samdech Son Sann proposed that to solve the Khmer Rouge problem and put an end to the tragedies, "the Royal Government and all parties in the National Assembly must make sacrifices and concessions." Samdech Son Sann urged the parties to consider not just their own interests but also those of the nation and to reconcile with one another in accordance with the peace proposal of King Norodom Sihanouk, the architect of national reconciliation. Samdech Son Sann stated: "The Constitution is the work of the National Assembly. Therefore, the National Assembly has the right to amend it" for the sake of national unity and national concord. He made this remark in reference to certain provisions in the Constitution that do not agree with the king's proposal to give cabinet positions to some persons within the Khmer Rouge leadership. In the third point of the statement Samdech Son Sann declared on behalf of the BLDP: "The party supports the king's five-point peoposal made on 23 November 1993" and "we appeal to the Royal Government to agree to solve the Khmer Rouge problem on the basis of this five-point proposal." In the fourth point of the statement Samdech Son Sann also voiced support for the king's communique dated 7 March 1994 concerning the dangerous consequences of a war between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces and the forces of the Khmer Rouge. He went on to say: "We would like to emphasize that without national reconciliation there can be no peace, there can be no reconstruction, and the question of territorial integrity cannot be settled." Some analysts noted that the timing of Samdech Son Sann's appeal seems to be wrong because, first of all, the Royal Government has already controlled the Khmer Rouge areas at Anlung Veng and Pailin, thus bringing changes to the situation although the door to negotiations is said to remain open. They think that there is now a tendency to use military means rather than talks. On the chessboard, the government side has the upper hand as it is winning one Khmer Rouge "pawn" after another, and it is even on the verge of checkmating the Khmer Rouge "king."
