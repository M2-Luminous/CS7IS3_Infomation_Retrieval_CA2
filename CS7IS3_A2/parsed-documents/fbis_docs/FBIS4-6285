The Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiation started in Punta del Este, Uruguay, over seven years ago. Negotiations were repeatedly deadlocked, but finally achieved a historic success. Including agreements on trade, farm products, textile, antidumping, and trade subsidies, the Uruguay Round worked out documents numbering over 20,000 pages. Thus, the rule book of international trade was drastically revised, and new rules were provided for farm and service trade, as well as protection of intellectual property rights. We would like to extend our congratulations to all persons who contributed to the settlement of the unprecedented negotiations. The new trade framework will play an important role in preventing bloc economy like in the 1930's. The world economy is undergoing fundamental changes. Economic growth of industrialized nations is slowing, but such nations as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and Turkey are becoming new key players with stronger competition power. In particular, China is demonstrating its presence as a major economic power that leads fast-growing Asia. Uneven growth in the world economy is intensifying frictions and tension between existing and new emerging economic powers. In January 1995, GATT will be replaced with the World Trade Organization (WTO). As a new watchdog of the free trade system, it will mediate trade-related disputes, and fight against protectionism and bloc economy. Here, we would like to stress how Japan and the United States played important roles in the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. After the G-7 summit in Tokyo last July, the two nations jointly contributed a lot to the successful conclusion of the round. To achieve the goal, Japan had to endure great pain of the partial liberalization of its rice market. The initiative of Japan and the United States is very important for the WTO. Since some quarters in the U.S. Congress are against U.S. ratification of the WTO agreement, President Bill Clinton is supposed to try his best to obtain support from his nation. Meanwhile, during the Marrakech conference, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor failed to agree on a resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. In the "economic reform guideline," Japan has pledged to hammer out tangible measures for settling the top three trade disputes with the United States -- macroeconomic policy, government procurement, and insurance and auto trade -- before the end of June. We hope the government will try its best to carry out reduction of trade surplus and expansion of imports for the sake of the Japanese public. At the same time, we have some requests for the Clinton administration. The United States should drop its demand for "objective criteria" which may impose restrictions on trade partners as target figures. The United States is proposing "labor criteria," which is intended for controlling imports from developing nations on the pretext of inadequate wage and labor right policies of these nations. However, this should not be brought in the new trade framework because this is another form of protectionism. Regarding ways of handling trade disputes, the United States should not lean on unilateral measures such as the Super 301 provision (which stipulates sanctions against unfair trade practices of specific nations). Such an attitude is to neglect the WTO's grievance mechanism from the starting point. Aggressive market opening policies may bring about deindustrialization, but Japan cannot be free from competition in the world market. Based on a concept that the free trade system makes the world prosperous, both Japan and the United States must overcome temptation of protectionism, and jointly support the WTO at any rate. Such positive approaches will benefit Japanese and U.S. public eventually.
