In touching on the process of debates now under way in Cuba, TRABAJADORES said the basic objective is assessing the economic and financial conditions at each working center to evaluate the country's economic situation and the effects of financial imbalance in the economy. The editorial stressed that with the authority they have earned by staying in their jobs, workers, today more than ever, are demanding high standards of labor discipline, because what is at stake is the defense of the genuine interests of workers, peasants, and students. The editorial said that Cuban workers are concerned and reject the intolerable presence of crime, its ties to the black market, and its incidence in social and labor discipline, and the editorial demanded from the authorities the implementation of drastic and exemplary measures at all levels. It added that reality has forced us to make economic adjustments, which we will model after a socialist and Cuban pattern, using democratic formulas that are really unthinkable within other societies.
