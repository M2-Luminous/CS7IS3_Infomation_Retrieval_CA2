Miller, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, held a news conference in the just-renovated American House on 19 January devoted to the tripartite Declaration signed by Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents in Moscow last week. As expected, the ambassador highly praised this document and the efforts by the leaders of the three countries -- especially the courage displayed by President Kravchuk -- directed at nuclear disarmament. The ambassador also recalled the history of nuclear disarmament dating back to late 1960's. William Miller himself has been working on this problem for a long time, and he also personally knew Andrey Sakharov, the father of a hydrogen bomb who ardently fought to rid the world of nuclear weapons. The signed tripartite Declaration, stated the ambassador, is seen by the United States as an important element in intensifying and strengthening bilateral relations with the United States, especially in the economic and cultural spheres. In the words of the American diplomat, the entire list of the conditions put forward by the Supreme Council regarding the ratification of START I and the Nonproliferation Treaty was included in the agenda of Ukrainian--American-Russian negotiations. And all of them have been fulfilled. Of course, the ratification of the Moscow agreement by the Supreme Council is an affair of the Supreme Council itself and the Ukrainian people. However, Mr. Miller believes that when they understand all provisions of the document and the scale of events it affects, everything will be fine and the agreement will be ratified. An interesting discrepancy should be noted here. Both the American ambassador and Russian officials refer to the document as an "agreement" [preceding word published in English] and talk about the need to ratify it. On the other hand, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry officials explained that the Declaration signed by the presidents is not subject to ratification. What should be ratified is START I and Ukraine's adherence to the Lisbon Protocol. The Declaration simply points to a mechanism for their implementation. Russians have already started to talk about the scrapping of Ukrainian nuclear weapons as an accomplished fact. Does this mean that each side sees in the document what it likes? The issue of money was also brought up at the news conference. Why so little (in our opinion, of course)? Mr. Miller assured that the United States would not stop at the $175 million earmarked by the U.S. Congress for the dismantling and removal of the missiles. The United States will now orient its foreign policy toward expanding comprehensible contacts with Ukraine and establishing closer cooperation with it. Asked about nuclear security of a nonnuclear Ukraine, the ambassador gave a very diplomatic answer. As for actions by international organizations and the United States in the event of an assault on Ukraine by some nuclear state, Mr. Miller said that in this hypothetical case, the mechanisms established by the UN and CSCE Statutes would be initiated. "Let's hope that these international organizations will prove strong enough and be able to put in motion all powers that they have." A very promising perspective, considering the UN's smashing success in settling conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, etc. -- not to mention indirect aggressions in the sub-Dniester Republic, Southern Ossetia, or Abkhazia, which received its own powerful Armed Forces out of nowhere -- as well as the great respect for international public opinion exhibited by such politicians as Zhirinovskiy elbowing his way to the Russian leadership. Yes, let's hope that nothing will happen to us -- just like in that famous Russian fairy tale.
