FBIS4-42986 "drweu112__a94012" FBIS-WEU-94-112-A Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs Poll Reveals Voters Divided on EU Issues Poll Reveals Voters Divided on EU Issues PM0106130294 London FINANCIAL TIMES in English 1 Jun 94 p 4 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PM0106130294 London FINANCIAL TIMES English BFN [David Marsh report: "Voters Divided on EU's Important Issues"] [Text] Europeans generally favour enlarging the EU [European Union] northwards and eastwards, but are deeply split over the desirability of deepening integration as laid down by the Maastricht treaty, according to an opinion poll commissioned by the FINANCIAL TIMES. The poll, carried out for the FT and seven European newspapers, reveals great diversity among the 12 EU member states on attitudes towards the European parliament and the future of European cooperation. The detailed findings are as follows: Only 31 per cent of British people surveyed said they wanted a more integrated Europe, compared with 61 per cent favouring a looser form of European cooperation. Similar votes were seen in eastern Germany, Denmark and western Germany, where scores were 33 per cent to 62 cent, 26 per cent to 61 per cent and 37 per cent to 58 per cent against Maastricht-style integration respectively. By contrast, between 64 and 72 per cent of respondents in Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Belgium favoured more integration. Residents of Ireland and the UK appear to believe most strongly that a single currency in at least three EU states will be established by the end of the century, with 63 per cent and 64 per cent respectively saying they believed this was either "very likely" or "fairly likely." Greatest scepticism in this field came from the "hard currency" countries, with 61 per cent of east and west Germans and 52 per cent of Dutch respondents holding the view that this was unlikely. Asked about responses to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, 38 per cent of respondents throughout the EU, spread fairly evenly among the 12, argued in favour of continued diplomatic efforts to end the fighting. Only 16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively called for combat troops or air strikes to bring peace. Regarding the European elections, 72 per cent of all respondents said they were "absolutely certain" to vote, while 7 per cent described their turnout as "very likely," 8 per cent as "fairly likely" and 6 per cent as "not very likely." Only 49 per cent of British said they were "absolutely certain" to vote, compared with 93 per cent in Greece, 89 per cent in Belgium and 83 per cent in Luxembourg (in all three countries, voting is compulsory). By contrast, 76 per cent of respondents in western Germany and 67 per cent of those in eastern Germany said they were certain to vote. Of those "absolutely certain" to vote, 56 per cent of the Irish, 55 per cent of Portuguese and 53 per cent of east Germans said they would do so to support their countries' governments. Only 35 per cent of Britons and Danes and 15 per cent of Belgians gave this as a reason. A protest vote seems particularly likely in the UK and Spain, where 25 per cent and 23 per cent of respondents respectively said they would vote to voice opposition to their governments. Denmark recorded the highest score -- 35 per cent -- of respondents saying they were not certain to vote because they "do not understand the (European) issues." Others who admitted failure to understand European affairs were the British (32 per cent) and Italians (29 per cent). On enlargement, the proposed extension of the EU on January 1 1995 to Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria is given particular support by west Germans (87 per cent), east Germans (88 per cent), and Italians (86 per cent). Even those most lukewarm on enlargement to the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries -- the Spanish and Portuguese -- are 70 per cent and 72 per cent in favour. There is more divergence over enlarging the EU to former Communist countries. The largest scores in favour of bringing in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia came from Italy (69 per cent) eastern Germany (60 per cent) Belgium, The Netherlands and Spain (56 per cent each). The lowest scores were seen in western Germany and Portugal (47 per cent), Luxembourg and Britain (45 per cent) and Denmark (33 per cent). British and Danish respondents stood out as thinking the European Parliament has too much power, with 38 per cent and 37 per cent of respondents respectively holding this view. By contrast, 60 per cent of east Germans, 55 per cent of west Germans and Italians, and 54 per cent of Greek and French respondents said parliament has too little power -- a view held by 46 per cent of respondents throughout the EU. Britons and Danes also believe the European Commission is too powerful, with 58 per cent and 51 per cent of respondents taking this line. The main defenders of the European Commission seem to be the east Germans, Spanish, Italians and Belgians -- between 40 per cent and 43 per cent of these respondents say the Commission has too little power.
