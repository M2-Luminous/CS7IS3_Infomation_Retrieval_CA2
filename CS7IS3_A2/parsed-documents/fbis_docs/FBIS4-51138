Zhu Sheng-wen, the deputy mayor, said Harbin was attempting to restructure these enterprises by way of sale or lease to foreign investors, or transform them into shareholding companies. He said the city intended to privatise half of these enterprises by the end of this year, and privatise all of them by the end of next year. The restructuring programme had the approval of the central government. For large state enterprises, the privatisation will be through the issue of H shares, B shares or joint ventures with foreign partners, he said. Mr Zhu is leading a Harbin trade delegation to Hong Kong. The delegation is offering foreign participation in about 200 projects, including textiles, machinery, electronics, chemicals and light industry. Seventy-five small to medium-sized Harbin state enterprises are on sale to foreign investors. New China Hong Kong Group, headed by businessman Tsui Tsin-tong, yesterday entered into deals for the restructuring of the Harbin Brewery Plant and an electrical machinery factory. The brewery joint venture will involve investment of about 580 million yuan (about HK$516.2 million). New China Hong Kong holds a 54 percent stake in the project, according to Harbin officials. The electrical machinery project will cost U.S.$30 million, and will expand and upgrade production. New China Hong Kong has a 45 percent interest in the venture. Mr Zhu said about 40 percent of Harbin state enterprises were loss-making and restructuring was needed. There were about 1,380 foreign-funded enterprises in Harbin, involving investment of $2.2 billion. A total of 652 such enterprises were funded by Hong Kong capital, worth a total of U.S.$560 million, he said. In the first four months of this year, a total of 98 foreign-funded enterprises were approved, involving a total foreign investment of U.S.$110 million from foreign partners, he said.
