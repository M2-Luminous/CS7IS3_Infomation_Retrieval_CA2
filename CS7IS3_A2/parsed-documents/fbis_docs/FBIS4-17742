In an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin, the movement's leaders Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin motivate their suggestion by the fact that on the threshold of the accord's signing the newspaper IZVESTIYA carried an article with anti-constitutional calls by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- LDPR] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Zhirinovskiy proposes that "sovereign republics be done away with," "the sovereign presidents unwilling to transform into governors be medically examined in Moscow," that former Soviet republics reunite with Russia as provinces, and a crusade southwards to the Indian Ocean be launched. Ponomarev and Yakunin wonder for this reason "can the presidents and leaders of the republic within the Russian Federation put their signatures on the accord next to that of Zhirinovskiy?" They insist that Zhirinovskiy should either publicly renounce his anticonstitutional calls or be barred from signing the document.
