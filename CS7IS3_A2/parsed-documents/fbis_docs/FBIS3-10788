He thinks that one of the reasons for Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's rejection of this plan is supposedly that it was going to be approved by the Army. Daly Valet interviewed Desjardins: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desjardins] I am not disappointed, because I was there; I experienced all the events and I knew Aristide would not agree. That is the reason we entered here especially to meet with the Army because you know you have [changes thought] this plan involves [preceding word in English] the Army too. So (?we wanted) to see whether the Army would not agree as well; but we knew that Aristide would not agree. The reason is that most of the time Aristide agrees with what he believes the Army will not accept and disagrees when he feels that the Army will agree. Perhaps -- feeling that the Army would agree with the plan even if it does not agree now, that it will eventually agree with the plan -- Aristide will not, that is all. [Valet] What is your position concerning the Army? It is said that the Army has reservations regarding this plan. What is your stance? [Desjardins] Yes, it says he has reservations, but it does not say it does not agree. I represented -- I do not say I unofficially represented the Army, but as a National Cooperative Action Movement deputy, they present me as a neo-Duvalierist -- I realized that my duty was to defend the Army because.... [pauses] It is always said that the Army of a country is that country's honor. I know that if I criticize the Army, I automatically criticize my country. So I was obliged to defend the Army. [passage omitted] [Valet] As for Gen. Cedras' departure: Do you think the Army agrees or, at least, as you say you are close to the Army, do you think the Army has consented to the general's departure? [Desjardins] I do not say that I am close to the Army. I said that I am a member of the 30 September [1991] family. So, if I am a member of the 30 September group, this automatically means that I am part of the Army. I cannot tell you that Gen. Cedras has agreed with it 100 percent; but I believe that if he studies the plan and identifies with it, he will agree. [end recording]
