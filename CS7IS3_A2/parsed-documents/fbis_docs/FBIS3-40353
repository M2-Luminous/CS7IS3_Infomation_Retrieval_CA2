Wolf of the German Aerospace Research Institute's Central Space Systems Analysis Department: "The Evolutionary DSL Space Carrier Concept"; first paragraph is DLR-NACHRICHTEN introduction] The DSL space carrier concept constitutes a promising component for a future space launcher family. The following paper sets the concept out in detail and presents the initial results. In comparison with launch systems currently in use or under development, such as Ariane-4, Ariane-5, the Space Shuttle, etc., future space launch systems must basically be cheaper to launch, more reliable, safer, especially when used for manned missions, they must allow launches in rapid succession and on demand, and be environmentally acceptable. Aerospace planes, a rough term for horizontal-takeoff space launch systems with air-breathing engines, meet many of these requirements. Their horizontal takeoff and air-breathing engines give them significant inherent safety and reliability advantages over conventional vertically launched systems. For instance, a horizontal launch may be aborted at practically any point in the whole launch phase, as the abort maneuvers are considerably less critical than with a vertical launch. Aerospace planes also permit a relatively high launch frequency, as they only require a conventional runway, not a special launch pad with a launching tower. DSL is a two-stage space launch system with a supersonic carrier aircraft as its first stage and a variety of types of second stage. The potential range of second stages for the DSL stretches from conventional expendable systems, via the partially recoverable systems of the immediate future, to the fully reusable systems of the distant future, with either straight rocket or combined air-breathing and rocket engines. The DSL concept thus paves the way for the evolutionary development of a fully reusable space carrier family using a supersonic carrier aircraft that will remain more or less the same. This in itself holds out considerable further development potential, for instance in the direction of a supersonic carrier. Development Characteristics of the Supersonic Carrier Aircraft The design of the DSL supersonic carrier aircraft is determined by the following requirements: 1. Avoidance of heating-up problems as in hypersonic first stages; 2. Use in principle of available aircraft technology; 3. The second stage to dock into a recess on the underside of the fuselage. To meet the first design criterion, the carrier is a relatively simple modification of the supersonic carrier aircraft in current use. The operational maintenance, servicing, and overhaul requirement for first stages generally rises in proportion to the thermal stress to which they are exposed, or in other words, to the potential or actually obtainable Mach number, especially when an extra thermal protection system is required. For instance, hypersonic first stages must be inspected after every flight and the structure, which is exposed to high thermal stress, and thermal protection system must be overhauled. In the DSL concept, therefore, the separation Mach number is limited so as to obviate the need for an extra thermal protection system for the supersonic carrier aircraft. In terms of materials and construction methods, the use in principle of available aircraft technology means employing conventional materials such as aluminum, titanium, and alloys thereof along with carbon fiber-reinforced plastic components etc. The top design separation Mach number is therefore determined by the maximum operative range tolerated by these materials. In terms of the propulsion system, available technology means using kerosene turbo engines. Although it is not state-of-the-art, the use of liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets is being analyzed in parallel, with a view to evaluating and assessing the impact of this technology on the overall system. Both these propulsion concepts allow for an optional extra rocket engine, as this can facilitate acceleration to separation Mach number and have a positive effect on the overall mass of the carrier aircraft. No aerodynamic support is required as a result of having the second stage dock into a recess on the underside of the supersonic carrier aircraft. Moreover, it gives the DSL concept flexibility as to the type, size, and mass of the second stage. Potential Types of Second Stage The range of potential types of second stage is as follows: -- Conventional expendable stages for carrying payloads (e.g., similar to the Ariane-5 central stage with payload cladding), which could be replaced at a later stage of development by a reusable propulsion and avionics module. Instead of a payload, various smaller systems can be carried in this stage, for example: a) capsules (including supply module); b) winged systems for personnel transport (such as Hermes or the PLS personnel launch system); c) logistics vehicles (such as the ATV automated transfer vehicle); d) demonstrator vehicles (for demonstrating "tail on" or "head on" reentry and vertical landing on Earth, for example); -- Reusable winged systems with rocket propulsion, both conventional-design systems and CCV (control configured vehicle) systems or lifting bodies being conceivable; all these concepts can be either manned or unmanned; -- Reusable systems with air-breathing propulsion, of the ramjet or scramjet type, for instance, both manned and unmanned versions being conceivable. In particular, the supersonic carrier aircraft can be used to carry experimental ramjet and scramjet aircraft. The supersonic carrier aircraft can also be used to launch smaller multistage systems such as Pegasus or a hypothetical "supersonic Pegasus." Separation Mach Number Ranges The first two design criteria for the supersonic carrier aircraft give a top separation speed in the Mach 3-3.5 (Mach 4) range. As the separation Mach number should be as high as possible with rocket-propelled second stages so as to achieve a high payload-mass ratio, these systems are basically separated from the carrier at the top sustainable or obtainable Mach number. With second stages with air-breathing (ramjet or scramjet) engines, on the other hand, the separation Mach number is in the Mach 1.5-2.5 range so as to exploit the full potential of air-breathing propulsion. As a result, the DSL concept has two potential separation Mach number ranges, one from Mach 1.5 to 2.5 and the other from about Mach 3 to 3.5 (Mach 4). Implementation Stages and Potential Spin-Offs In order to limit the development risk and, consequently, keep development costs as low as possible, the first generation of the supersonic carrier aircraft will in all probability use kerosene turbojets. The shorter the development timeframe available, i.e., the earlier the system is scheduled to enter service (for instance, as the successor to Ariane-5), the likelier this is. The second generation of the supersonic carrier could then use liquid hydrogen- burning turbojets, which would comply with the main first generation design criteria, i.e., basically, a maximum separation speed in roughly the Mach 3.5 range. However, it cannot be ruled out that, for example, the first generation of the supersonic carrier aircraft might already use liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets for ecological reasons or with a view to creating spin-offs for aviation. In order to avoid a high development risk in connection with the second stage as well, conventional expendable systems can initially be developed. As explained in detail above, the further development potential of small reusable systems for carriage with the expendable stages in place of a payload extends right up to air-breathing second stages, and various second stages or types of second stage can be run in parallel. The various types of second stage, however, reflect various levels of progress, primarily in the structural and propulsion technologies. Merely building them thus constitutes an evolutionary development. The DSL space carrier concept with the supersonic carrier aircraft and the expendable second stage thus represents the true beginning of an evolutionary development toward a fully reusable space carrier family. As far as materials and construction methods are concerned, experience with earlier systems, such as the central stage of Ariane-5, can contribute to the development of the expendable second stage. As will become apparent below, the rational solution for this type of second stage is a rocket engine with characteristic parameters such as mixture ratio and specific impulse similar to those of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) or the RD-0120 Energiya central stage engine. The development of the small reusable manned carrier will be able to benefit from know-how and experience acquired to date from the Hermes and Hermes Technology programs, although there is an enormous development requirement here with regard to materials and construction methods, thermal protection systems included. The evolutionary development of the fully reusable types of second stage is expected to produce spin-offs in materials and construction methods from the small carrier for the type of reusable second stage with rocket propulsion, and from this system for the type of second stage with air-breathing propulsion. Nevertheless, they all present a considerable development requirement. As far as the propulsion system is concerned, the rocket-driven type of second stage benefits from engine development for the expendable system, especially if a reusable propulsion and avionics module for the expendable system is developed in the course of time. Nevertheless, a new engine type for this type of second stage could bring advantages. Compared with the current state of the art, the type of second stage with air-breathing propulsion requires considerable development work on the propulsion, including engine-fuselage integration. The development of the air-breathing propulsion can benefit from the experience, know-how, and developments provided by the German hypersonic technology program and the French Prepha program, and further know-how in this area might be acquired from the CIS states. In one potential development building on the supersonic carrier aircraft, the separation speed will be substantially higher than Mach 3.5, for instance Mach 5. The advances expected by then in materials and construction methods, in particular with regard to hot bearing structures, should make it possible to retain most of the advantages of the supersonic carrier aircraft. Basically, this means avoiding an extra thermal protection system. Various propulsion concepts are conceivable for this carrier aircraft, for instance liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets plus rocket engines or liquid hydrogen-burning turboramjets. Spin-offs from the air-breathing second stage type are to be expected in the latter case. Basically, only reusable rocket-driven systems are being considered as potential second stage types for this generation of the carrier aircraft, expendable systems not being ruled out for carrying heavy payloads. As the higher separation speed gives second stages with air-breathing propulsion no advantage, there is no point in developing a second generation of these systems. The DSL concept is expected to produce further spin-offs in several areas. Firstly, the supersonic carrier aircraft could result in spin-offs for aviation, primarily with regard to turbojets and materials and construction methods. The development of aerospace planes, which is conceivable in the distant future, could exploit the technologies of both the supersonic carrier aircraft and the various types of second stage. The main impact of spin-offs from the supersonic carrier aircraft would be on propulsion systems (LH2 turbojets, possibly LH2 turboramjets), whereas those to be expected from the various types of second stage would mainly affect materials and construction methods and air-breathing propulsion. Nevertheless, single-stage aerospace planes still require considerable development work on materials and construction methods and on the propulsion system. In addition to the aforementioned spin-offs for aviation and/or for the single-stage aerospace planes of the distant future, the DSL concept holds out unique opportunities for an international space carrier system. For example, the supersonic carrier aircraft could be developed as an international or world program. However single countries with their own space programs could pursue the development independently of one another. The second stages can also be developed by single countries with their own space programs according to their specific needs and their level of technological progress. Initial Results Initial studies on the DSL space carrier concept were carried out at a separation speed of Mach 3.5. In order not to exceed a pad weight of about 500 Mg [myriagrams] for the overall system, the pad weight of the second stages immediately after separation from the carrier aircraft was set at 200 Mg for the purposes of the studies. In addition to analyses for an expendable second stage, the same calculations were also performed for a reusable second stage with rocket propulsion. Both Vulcain-derived and SSME-derived engines were used as the propulsion for both types of second stage. The resulting payload weights for a 400-km orbit are set out in figure 5. The SSME derivates gave the expendable second stage a payload capacity of just under 19 Mg and the reusable second stage one of approximately 8.5 Mg. The propulsion concept considerably affects payload capacity. Using Vulcain derivatives reduced the payload capacity by about 5 Mg in the expendable second stage and by about 3.5 Mg in the reusable system. Initial analyses for the supersonic carrier aircraft gave a pad weight of around 300 Mg: about 200 Mg empty weight plus 100 Mg fuel. The carrier aircraft is propelled by a total of eight scaled Olympus engines with an overall installed ground thrust of about 2,860 kN [kilonewtons]. The vehicle is about 70 m long and has a wingspan of approximately 50 m. The payload capacity of the reusable second stage propelled by SSME-derived engines is about 1.6 percent of the pad weight of the entire system. This payload ratio is only marginally worse than in the Saenger with an unmanned upper stage but is achieved with a first stage of substantially more conventional technology. Using liquid hydrogen-burning turbojets in the carrier aircraft raises the payload ratio, which ought even to exceed that of the Saenger. Not least in the light of these results, the DSL concept constitutes a promising version of a future space carrier system or family and merits further, more detailed studies with regard to both concept verification and potential spin-offs.
