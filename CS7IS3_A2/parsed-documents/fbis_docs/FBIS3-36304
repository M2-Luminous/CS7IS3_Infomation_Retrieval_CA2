Talks have been held between the heads of states and the official delegations. After statements by the heads of state, Vlachislav Vasilievich and myself will give you a possibility to ask questions in turn, but please ask questions only at the microphones. Boris Nikolayevich, as our guest, we ask you to make a statement. [Yeltsin] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Today's visit by the Russian delegation to the Republic of Georgia is proceeding quite successfully. A major, joint work has been carried out. The time has come already to sum up with you at least the preliminary results of the meeting. I think that we have every grounds for satisfaction. The fates of our peoples are closely intertwined. From ancient times, Georgia has seen in an alliance with Russia the guarantees for preserving its culture and for saving the nation from plunging into catastrophe. Our bonds are strong and many-sided, and mutual fondness is genuine. Everybody in Russia knows Ilia Chavchavadze [famous Georgian writer, poet, and public figure] and honors the memory of Grand Duke Bagration. Everybody has heard about Meliton Kantaria [Georgian soldier in WW II]. History itself calls on the peoples of Russia and Georgia to live in peace and agreement. There is no other sensible solution. We have gone through difficult times in the past as well; however, our great predecessors used to always find ways to guarantee a calm and respectable life for our peoples. We have no right to destroy what we have inherited. The aims of Russian policy are clear and concrete--establishing not simply friendly but also allied relations with Georgia, of course, mutually taking into consideration legal, state, and national interests. As you know, Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze and I have signed a comprehensive agreement on friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia. This was the main official aim of the Russian president's visit to Tbilisi. We assess the agreement highly. The agreement lays a solid legal basis for our cooperation. I hope that it will work effectively for the development of future Russian-Georgian relations. Altogether, 25 documents have been signed. Eduard Ambrosyevich and I have exchanged opinions on bilateral cooperation, on regulating the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, on pressing international issues, and on the situation in the Transcaucasus. The Russian side supports a fundamental improvement of relations with Georgia in all fields, the speediest restoration of broken economic, cultural, and spiritual bonds, and a gradual rapprochement and integration. Joining of efforts will help our countries to find a way out of the complex economic situation in which they found themselves after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. I would like to stress once again that Russia is proceeding from the necessity of observing Georgia's territorial integrity and fully securing the interests of the multinational population of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia supports a full-scale settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts through peaceful political means and supports mutually acceptable solutions regarding state and political arrangements. The Russian representatives will continue, together with the Georgian and Abkhaz sides and the CSCE, to participate in efforts directed toward regulating the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. They will keep on achieving considerable growth in the number of international observers, both military and civilian, and in using peacekeeping military forces in the conflict zone. The issue of refugees from Abkhazia is an acute one. Russia is ready to assist in resolving it. We are, once again, addressing the sides to launch a full-scale operation for supporting peace in Abkhazia. The Russian contingent could also take part in it. The main goal of these forces is to guarantee a secure return of refugees. It is necessary to keep on searching for mutually- acceptable solutions to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia that will help turn the Caucasus region into a zone of solid peace and stability. The issue of ethnic Russians is vulnerable for us and, although the official stance of the Georgian authorities must not give us a cause for alarm, the departure from Georgia of 150,000 Russian- speaking people over the last two years cannot but put us on guard. There have been instances of oppression at the social scale--usurpation of servicemen's apartments, etc. We expect an active counteraction against such negative occurrences and others. It is in the interests of both of the countries and in the interests of deepening friendship and cooperation between our peoples. Russia is ready to cooperate bilaterally with Georgia, within the CIS, and on the international arena. Only under the circumstances of peace can economic and democratic developments be safely guaranteed. Using this opportunity, I would like to express my gratefulness for a warm, friendly welcome extended to the Russian delegation in friendly Georgia. Thank you for your attention. [Shevardnadze] Ladies and gentlemen! Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! Thank you for participating in the news conference, and for the attention you paid to the first official visit of the Russian president in our country. I have already said at the negotiations that it is a significant event in the 200-year-old history of relations between our peoples. This event undoubtedly deserves great attention from both of our countries. I think that the negotiations and the documents signed here in Tbilisi--and not only negotiations--will assist in strengthening friendship and cooperation within the framework of the CIS and the region as a whole. For the first time in the ancient history of relations between Russia and Georgia, we have been presented with a chance to build them on a totally different basis. For the first time, unlike in the past, we have decided to confirm each other's strategic aims and interests as two equal and independent states. For the first time following a long period marred by a string of events, the aftermath of which we will still have to be overcome through joint efforts, there is a hope for restoring traditionally friendly relations between our peoples. The importance of the visit by Boris Nikolayevich and such an imposing delegation goes beyond the boundaries of Russo-Georgian relations. The normalization of these relations is closely connected with the complexity of regulating the Caucasus and the Black Sea regions and of achieving peace and stability here. Boris Nikolayevich and I talked about activating the Caucasian factor in the process of regulating all conflicts about which the whole of the world knows. It is a great tragedy for peoples of the Caucasus. We have talked about the necessity of holding a dialogue on the Caucasian issue with the participation of the three Transcaucasian states and, naturally, with Russia's participation and about inviting the Russian Federation subjects. I mean the North Caucasian republics. By the way, I discussed this issue the day before yesterday with my colleagues, [Azerbaijani President] Geydar Aliyev and [Armenian President] Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who support this idea with great enthusiasm. We have just signed a comprehensive agreement between the Russian Federation and Georgia. I suppose that the name speaks for itself. It includes friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation. This is what, for several centuries, Georgia has aspired for in connection with its great northern neighbor. A package of documents containing many agreements have been signed. Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned the number of the agreements. I would only like to name several that are principally important for our countries: agreements on free trade, culture, education, relations, international highway links, regulating the processes of migration, guarding the human rights of the dispossessed, and preventing and (?liquidating) emergency situations. Several agreements on regulating military cooperation have also been signed; I mean the issues connected with border troops and, on the whole, the status of the Russian Army, and many others. We have, in principle, agreed to create bases for Russian troops. I think that it is in accordance with the interests of Georgia and Russia and the whole of the Transcaucasus. We have signed a protocol about setting up a special working group that will study all aspects of granting the presence of the Russian Army a new principle. Our primary aim is that the terms of the treaty and other agreements signed today be implemented as soon as possible. It is in the interests of Russia and Georgia and the whole of our region and, of course, the world's peace and security. It was the main subject for our present talks and negotiations, which were a continuation of the dialogue that had been started a long time ago. We have examined in detail and thoroughly the status and the prospects of developing relations between our countries. I would like to stress a mutual aspiration for a comprehensive improvement of relations. The conclusion has been drawn that the current situation is favorable for this and that we will make every effort in order to achieve the realization of these goals. Much time, and maybe the most significant time, was naturally devoted to Abkhazia, to the political settlement of this and other conflicts under the auspices of the United Nations and with Russia's most active participation and mediation. All aspects for regulating the Georgian-Ossetian conflict have been discussed. I told Boris Nikolayevich that I did not see the reasons why we could not resolve these most complex issues of modern times in the near future. They are the most complex issues, but the traditions of friendship that are centuries-old and the relations between the Georgian and Ossetian peoples--the Georgian and Abkhaz peoples--and the favorable influence of Russia and the whole of the world public, give us a chance to resolve these issues in the near future. We have also discussed the situation in the Transcaucasus on the whole and expressed our own views on the situation. As Boris Nikolayevich has already mentioned, there are no serious gaps between us in connection with all these pungent problems; I mean the region and the CIS on the whole. The subject matter of our talks also included the issues of perfecting the activities of the CIS. Skimming through the international situation, we fixed our attention on the issues of guaranteeing collective security and the different forms of strategic cooperation in this important trend between regional and intergovernmental structures. Naturally, the results of our negotiations will help establish peace and calm in the Transcaucasus, strengthen the CIS, strengthen the alliance of the Black Sea countries where Russia is playing a very active role, as well as Georgia and our neighbors--Turkey, Ukraine, and other states, such as Azerbaijan and Armenia. Naturally, there are no conflicts between those international organizations and the European structures with which we are collaborating. Great prospects are opened, and I would like to express deep gratitude to the president of Russia, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and all members of the delegation for the good will displayed to us and the wish to establish principally new relations with independent and democratic Georgia. Thank you. [Rcheulishvili] I would ask the journalists to introduce themselves, and since there are a lot of people here and not every one of you will be able to approach the microphones, I would request you to state your questions loudly. [Unidentified moderator] The first question is from Ilyashenko, RIA Novosti. Louder. [Ilyashenko] Boris Nikolayevich, have the issue of Georgia's joining the ruble zone or the issue of granting credits to Georgia been discussed during talks today? [Yeltsin] Both these issues have been discussed. The issue of credits has been decided on the governmental level, and a definite sum of money will be earmarked for Georgia. As for the ruble zone, when Eduard Ambrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and I were having tete-a-tete negotiations, we agreed that considering the complexity of this issue, we would set up working groups that will weigh everything, all pros and cons for both Georgia and Russia. Only after that will we make decisions. [Shevardnadze] There are a lot of talks about the issue of the ruble zone. Some are protesting; others demand that we join as soon as possible. As far as I understand it, the door has not been opened yet, so to say. The issue should really be researched. [Moderator] Ibervisia TV company. [Correspondent] The "Monitor" program, Ibervisia Independent TV company. Boris Nikolayevich, what has caused such a negative attitude by the Duma toward your visit and the signing of the treaty, and why does the aspiration for the stabilization of the situation in Georgia stir up such a negative attitude in North Caucasia? [Yeltsin] I do not know from what sources you draw this sort of information, that the Duma regards this visit negatively. This is an official state visit of the president of the country; therefore, the Duma will ratify this treaty. There is another thing. There will apparently be certain discussions during ratification, and this is not ruled out during the ratification of any international agreement that is being signed. I do not remember a treaty being ratified immediately, without any discussions. We also expect discussions on this issue. Nevertheless, I am certain that the Duma will regard this full-scale treaty with the independent Republic of Georgia positively. [Correspondent] What about North Caucasia? [no reply given to this question as heard] [Grushenko, INTERFAX correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, can you tell us please to what extent the comprehensive political treaty can assist the growth of Russia's potential for stabilizing the situation in the Caucasus and the Transcaucasus in this region. I think that Georgia also must have the say. Could the head of the Georgian state, esteemed Eduard Ambrosyevich, comment on this question too? Thank you. [Yeltsin] During our one-on-one discussions and talks, we devoted most of our time to this very issue. If we do not regulate properly the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, then there will be difficulties in the development of our future relations. Thus, the key aim for us is to regulate these relations. As to how and in which way we will do it, we have agreed that we will be working jointly--Russia, the UN, and the CSCE will all act to introduce peacekeeping forces there [in Abkhazia]. Subsequently, Georgia must grant a definite political and legal status to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This is so that Abkhazia and South Ossetia will work together with Georgia on the draft of the new constitution that is being worked out now. It will also improve the situation. Therefore, I hope that with joint efforts we will manage to regulate the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. [Shevardnadze] I agree with Boris Nikolayevich, and I would like to add that resolving these conflicts--if we are talking about strategic goals, then it is the most important issue--is in Georgia's interest in all aspects because the country is on the brink of starvation, literally on the threshold of poverty. Our strategic interests coincide completely, and there is a complete, mutual understanding in this respect. As for how we understand strategic interests, I have already said during the talks that several months ago--I think it is worth remembering--I asked Boris Nikolayevich what Russia's strategic interests in the Caucasus and, in particular, Georgia, were. Boris Nikolayevich answered that they wanted to deal with the single, integral Georgia, the integral state that would develop democratically and have good-neighborly relations with Russia. I think that we understand it correctly that Russia, naturally, has its geopolitical and strategic interests. We have found a complete and mutual understanding when we talked about strategic interests. [Unidentified correspondent] Georgian News Agency. I would like to ask how the Russian president and the Georgian head of state assess the last UN resolution on Abkhazia, passed on 31 January, and how you visualize the return of refugees to Abkhazia, or whether all this will remain on paper. Before I receive an answer to this question I would like to make use of an opportunity and hand over to you, Boris Nikolayevich, an appeal by Georgian correspondents and their Russian colleagues about the fate of a well-known Sukhumi correspondent, Aleksandr Berulava, who is still... [Unidentified woman, interrupting] You can hand it to me later. [Correspondent] All right. [Yeltsin] I regard the UN resolution as the one that meets the interests of both the Abkhazian and Georgian peoples, as well as the interests of Russia as a mediator. [Correspondent] Mr. President, will you please allow Georgian TV to ask a question? [Shevardnadze] I beg your pardon, but I would like to remind those who ask this question or those who are interested by this problem that the resolution, the last UN Security Council resolution, was drawn up with the active participation of Russian representative at the United Nations. Thus I can say that we have a complete agreement with regard to the views and interests over this issue. [Moderator] Sergey Medvedev, Ostankino Television, please. [Medvedev] I have a question for the two leaders. [Moderator] Only one question, please. [Medvedev] Boris Nokolayevich, I would like to hear an answer to the following question: Boris Nikolayevich, The Abkhazian side, a conflicting party, is very concerned about the Union agreement -- let us put it this way -- with Georgia, with regard to the fact that Russia will participate in building up the Georgian Armed forces, and it is concerned that this will not encourage a peaceful settlement of the conflict. although I have been warned, I would like to get an answer to another question. Do you think that the economic situation Georgia has found itself influences this treaty, or that the signing of a document like this is a conclusion to a strategic trend? [Yeltsin] As regards Paragraph 3 of the agreement, which reflects the issue of rendering assistance in building up the Georgian Armed Forces, we certainly do not mean a huge army. Georgia is unable to feed a big army. We mean a minimal number of forces in these armed units, assistance with equipment, and so on. And this is not expected today or tomorrow. This is a ongoing topic and it will be enough to help settle the Abkhazian issue. This is a common army. It is not planned for the territory of Georgia without Abkhazia and without Ossetia. No. This is an army of an integrated Georgia, and the Abkhazians do not have to be nervous about it. Moreover, we will be in complete control this issue. [Shevardnadze] As for the army, we are not intending and actually we are not able to have a gigantic army. No one will threaten us, and it is unreal that we will threaten someone. Therefore, we will be building a small army. Without Russia, we are unable to create even a small army. I think this is in Russia's interest, too. Regarding what we had in mind when signing the comprehensive treaty and a package of economic and other agreements, I agree it was the economic situation. I believe that it was a mistake, a big mistake, when Georgia isolated itself. It did not gain anything. Neither Russia nor any other countries who cooperated with us gained anything. But not only economy. I have already spoken of a strategic interest between Georgia and Russia, and the interests of the Commonwealth states, of our neighbors. So, the approach was a complex one. And there was complex interest toward building new relations with Russia. [Moderator] Introduce yourself, please. [Bakhtadze] Vakhtang Bakhtadze, the FORUM newspaper. A question to Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze. It is known and it is a fact that the Republic of Georgia became the 179th member [not further specified] on the basis of the Act of Independence and the results of a referendum held on 31 March 1991, when 99 percent of the people said yes to independence. It was said that everything infringing independence is unlawful. Do you not think that the agreements signed by you in the spheres of credits and finances, [words indistinct] and customs, as well as in the military sphere, are contradictory, to say the least, and can be regarded as a different interpretation of the definition of total independence and total sovereignty. Will you please state what you mean by the definition of the independent state of Russia and the independent state of Georgia. Thank you. [Moderator] Thank you for your speech. [Shevardnadze] I will answer. When drawing up and signing all the documents, the comprehensive treaty, the economic package, and all the rest, which regulate relations between the two countries, the interests of Georgia and the interests of Russia were fully considered. And if some compromise approach can be observed in some cases, I believe that it is impossible to survive without compromises during our time. I am stating with full responsibility that neither all these treaties nor all these agreements contradict the act you mentioned. They comply with the interests of Georgia, and not only the present Georgia but also tomorrow's problems and prospects. [Rcheulishvili] Thank you very much, and for God's sake excuse us, but the time is up. [Moderator] The stipulations of the protocol demand that we finish the news conference.
