"It would be ridiculous to have any geographical prejudices: It does not matter whether it is in Milan or in Palermo. If the principles are these, what poor principles they are! The meeting will be held however." MSI [Italian Social Movement] and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini lights a cigarette in his office in Via della Scrofa, under a conspicuous tricolor flag which is the "bone" of contention with Bossi "from the Po." He states: "There were three obstacles and only the first communication problem has been overcome. This seems to be a trivial matter, but it is not, given the insults made during the election campaign. A real accord will only be possible after having come to an agreement on a program, without making any bungles, pretenses, or reciprocal teasing." [Ventura] The first obstacle is communicating. The second is the program. And what about the third? [Fini] Choosing the ministers. If the government is born, it must not have any children or stepchildren; there must be dignity on an equal footing between the allies as sanctioned by the voters. [Ventura] There is talk of [League lower house floor leader] Maroni as the deputy prime minister and also minister of internal affairs. [Fini] Independent of the names and ministries it is a matter of finding an accord. And a program. [Ventura] To what extent will you concede to Lombard federalism? [Fini] The starting point is the accord signed by Maroni and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and torn up by Bossi: Italy is one and undivided. We will then see if the Northern League will accept compensating federalism with the presidentialist republic's guarantee of unity. [League ideologue] Miglio was against this, but we also have to reckon with parliament because the rewriting of the Constitution will require a two-thirds majority. [Ventura] Miglio proposes the institution of macroregions. [Fini] We agree with the elimination of the regions and the provinces and the creation of an intermediate body that we could call, department, district, macromunicipality, or microregion. The important thing is for the state to retain the primary jurisdiction over defense, foreign affairs, the Bank of Italy, justice, but also education and internal affairs. My son has the right to study the same subjects whether he lives in Belluno or in Trapani, and any hypothesis of a regional police force as there is in the United States is entirely unacceptable. [Ventura] Where is the compromise then? [Fini] The microregion would have legislative authority over matters that are strictly linked to its territory. We also concur on fiscal autonomy: Part of the taxes paid must remain in the area where the wealth was produced. There are two conditions: part, not all of the taxes, and that these should not be extra taxes but substitutive taxes. We support unity and solidarity: we will defend the rights of the South, not in an ethnic, but in a national context. [Ventura] The election results are bringing up the issue of the rigid structure of the public bodies.... [Fini] There has been a political turning point in Italy, we will therefore have to renew not only the government but also the nomenclature, because the power has been guaranteed by the entire management structure of the state: from banks to the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], to state-controlled enterprises...everything. [Ventura] With a spoils system of the opposite sign? [Fini] Anything but this. The criteria will no longer be party membership, but capabilities, merits, and competence. As far as I am concerned the current superbureaucrat can remain in his job even if he is a Christian Democrat or a Socialist, provided that he is good at it and honest. However, if he is only there because of his party membership, he will have to go home. [Ventura] The same applies to those replacing him.... [Fini] Of course. We are leaving a regime to free ourselves, not to enter into another regime. [Ventura] There is a double problem in RAI: nomenclature and legislative reorganization.... [Fini] I am not in favor of privatization but RAI, a public body, must be managed like a private company, with competent managers and balance sheets that correspond to the rules of a free market economy. The television fee, publicity, and leveling off the deficit at the end of the year at the expense of the taxpayer can no longer continue. [Ventura] Will the "professors" move out of Via Mazzini [RAI headquarters]? [Fini] The entire management structure must be reexamined, including all the news and channel directors. We must not be tempted to purge and to perform indiscriminate head chopping. The old regime chased away the unreliable people to put reliable idiots in their place. From now on no more DC [Christian Democratic], progressive, or right-wing news. It is the party spirit that must be canceled. [Ventura] There is already somebody who his trying to recycle himself.... [Fini] Jumping on the bandwagon is Italy's national sport. [Ventura] Will the universities also change? [Fini] Privileges must gradually be eliminated. I do not care whether the professor is red, white, gray, or tri-colored, the selection must be based on merits, and without preestablished competition. [Ventura] The center is showing signs of breaking up. Would you be ready to accept moderates from the Italian Popular Party [PPI] like Buttiglione and Formigoni? [Fini] The progressives clearly will become the opposition while those from the PPI run the risk of becoming minor members who therefore will have to choose: either one side or the other.
