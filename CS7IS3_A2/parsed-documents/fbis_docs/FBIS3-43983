Senator Evans says he is encouraged by what he heard during the meeting. He says pressure from the Somali population, which is tired of the fighting in the African nation, could also force the rival clan leaders into agreement. Our correspondent, James Schofield, reports: [Begin Schofield recording] Sen. Evans' surprise meeting with Aidid came at the end of a week-long visit to the Horn of Africa, during which Evans also discussed Somalia with the presidents of Ethiopia and Eritrea. But Evans said he had not come to broker peace, but will evaluate the situation in Somalia. Fears have been expressed that the withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of March could return the country into anarchy. But Evans said his contacts with Aidid and Ali Mahdi were encouraging, and that Australia has no intention of pulling out its remaining service personnel just yet. [end recording]
