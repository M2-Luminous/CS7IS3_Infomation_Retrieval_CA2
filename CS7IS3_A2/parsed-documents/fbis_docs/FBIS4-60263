After Washington, Mr. Benbitour is expected to arrive in Tokyo later to meet with Japanese financial circles. Here are more details with Bachir Hedibek: [Hedibek] Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour yesterday ended his tour which had taken him to Washington, after visiting Paris and Brussels. During his visit, the Algerian minister of finance met the U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury in charge of finance, the president of the world bank, and the IMF general secretary. Mr. Benbitour affirmed from Washington that he had received Western financial circles' full support for the government's program for economic revival and that they were fully prepared to give all the necessary aid to secure the success of the program, particularly the flexibility of debt rescheduling and the release of new loans. Concerning the debt rescheduling, Mr. Benbitour pointed out that the aim was that Algeria should receive a percentage of loans to build an acceptable level of money reserves in order to avoid a fresh request for debt rescheduling in the future. Algerian demands received great understanding and support from American financial circles, he added. Mr. Benbitour pointed out that furthermore, he had dwellled upon the program of loans for supporting the Algerian institutions and the Algerian monetary and banking system, estimated at 175 million dollars from the World Bank and 150 million dollars for the Export- Import Bank of Japan, with the director of the World Bank. The minister had guarantees that the abovementioned loans would be released as soon as possible and that a new plan with the World Bank would be drawn up. His meeting with IMF director general Mr. Camdessus was an opportunity to deal with the development of the situation following the dispatch of Algeria's letter of intent to the Fund. The Algerian file, including the program for economic revival will be the subject of a serious examination by the IMF board, which is due to meet on 27 May. Also, the Paris Club will be holding a meeting later this month to examine the rescheduling of Algeria's foreign debts. Always in Paris, the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has also disclosed that Washington and Tokyo had agreed to reschedule Algeria's debts.
