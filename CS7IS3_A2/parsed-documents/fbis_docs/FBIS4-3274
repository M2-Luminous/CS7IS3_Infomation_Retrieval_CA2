The new military and diplomatic initiatives will be presented to NATO allies for discussion this week in Brussels, the ASSOCIATED PRESS quoted a senior administration official as saying. The decision was made after two sessions of meeting between President Bill Clinton and his foreign policy team, but no further details were released yet on the latest U.S. Bosnia policy. Washington would also continue consulting with Russia and the United Nations on Bosnia, the official said. Earlier today, when appearing on the MTV, Clinton said he welcomed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement urging the Bosnian Serbs to honor their cease-fire pledges but saw the Russian suggestion for an international conference on the crisis as premature though it "deserves serious consideration." Without further elaboration, Clinton said he will announce a new U.S. policy on Bosnia very soon. At the Pentagon, Spokesman Dennis Boxx said Clinton and his national security advisors discussed both military and non-military options on Bosnia. Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman has returned from Bosnia to join the consultations in Washington. Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked twice on Monday with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd over the phone and would call French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe today, State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said.
