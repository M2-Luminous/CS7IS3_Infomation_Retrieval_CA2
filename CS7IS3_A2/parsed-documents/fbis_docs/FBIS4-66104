One day after the new president was elected by the Federal Assembly, the two sides had a fierce exchange on the circumstances surrounding the election and the first speech by the new head of state. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the FDP had not been trying to find the best president for Germany but to "protect their power." Kohl was playing tactical games with the presidency. The FDP has completely yielded to its CDU/CSU coalition partner and has ceased to be a political force of its own, he told journalists in Berlin on Tuesday [24 May]. But the SPD will cooperate loyally with Herzog. To make use of the impetus from the population's support for SPD presidential candidate Johannes Rau, the SPD will make the European elections the "fourth ballot" of the Federal Assembly. The chancellor and CDU chairman sharply rejected the Social Democrats' accusations. The criticism of Herzog's first speech after his election is also "completely unacceptable" and is degrading to the new president's character. The SPD is proving to be a "bad loser." Herzog's words of thanks after the election were not his inaugural speech, Kohl said. It is, therefore, intellectually unfair to draw wrong conclusions from it deliberately. He is convinced that Herzog will carry out his duties in a convincing way. CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the SPD's criticism is incompatible with the dignity of the office. Respecting majority decisions is part of democracy. FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel defended the FDP delegates' vote for Herzog. It was right also in view of the FDP's strategic line in the 1994 election year, he said in Berlin. He warned the SPD against taking "political revenge" on the FDP. Kinkel is optimistic that the party's "clarity and straightforwardness" in the presidential election will have a positive effect on the upcoming elections. CSU Secretary General Erwin Huber rejected the SPD's criticism of Herzog as undemocratic. The Social Democrats should stop their "propaganda" against the new head of state. Scharping called upon Herzog to conduct his office in an absolutely impartial way and to continue the tradition of his highly respected predecessor, Richard von Weizsaecker. He criticized misleading statements on the reasons for Germany's division and on overcoming it: "History is neither a coincidence nor a miracle," Scharping said in connection with Herzog's statement that the division came about in 1945 "by coincidence" and that unity is a miracle. Other leading Social Democrats were also dismayed about "nationalist comments" that were present throughout the speech. In addition, he did not say a word about the recent xenophobic violence.
