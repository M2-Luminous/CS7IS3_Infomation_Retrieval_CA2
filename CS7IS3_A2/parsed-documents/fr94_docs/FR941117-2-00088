Terry Lubeck, Section Chief Gil Ohana, Esq. U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 10th & Constitution Avenue, Washington, DC. RE: United States v. Microsoft Corporation Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1564 Comment in accordance with the Tunney Act Dear Messrs. Nanni, Lubeck and Ohana: In furtherance of comments provided to your office dated October 17, 1994, we have enclosed a copy of a draft Amendment submitted to I.D.E. Corporation (``IDEA'') by Microsoft Corporation (``Microsoft''). As was stated in our earlier comments, although the Consent Decree (``Decree'') grants IDEA the ability to renegotiate the terms of our Agreements, the Decree does not grant us a remedy for the recovery of $2,000,000 of prepaid royalties. The attached draft Amendment evidences Microsoft's unwillingness to refund prepaid royalties. This Amendment indicates that: ``*␣*␣* prepaid royalties shall be recoupable against earned royalties *␣*␣* only to the extent such prepaid royalties could have been recouped had the minimum commitment payments existing prior to the Amendment remained in effect.'' I therefore submit that by amending existing agreements in this manner Microsoft continues to impose minimum commitments and does not comply with the Decree which requires that it discontinue its practice of imposing minimum commitments. Again, we respectfully request that the Final Decree stipulate a remedy to IDEA and similarly situated companies with respect to prepaid royalties. Microsoft's most recent draft Amendment supports our belief that Microsoft will not refund prepaid royalties unless they are so ordered. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Wanda Washington, Corporate Counsel.
