Yao Kaiwen and Gao Xiaoliang were found guilty of "organising and leading a counter- revolutionary group" by the Shanghai Intermediate Court on December 23. Meanwhile the authorities have released Yang Zhou, a member of the Beijing-based peace charter movement after detaining him without charge for 45 days in a centre for tramps and migrant workers. Sources in Shanghai said last night Yao, 53, a former teacher, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and deprivation of "political rights" for three years. Gao, 28, a former worker, got a nine-year jail term in addition to a two-year suspension of his rights. The verdict said the two, who were detained last May, had in late 1992 organised a counter-revolutionary ring called the Mainland Headquarters of the Democratic China Front. A third organiser of the group, Yao Tiansheng, was released last September after a four- month detention. The three-page verdict reportedly said that last September, Yao Kaiwen drafted a 10-point manifesto whose aim was "ending the dictatorial rule of the communist regime". The manifesto allegedly said the front was ready to take "peaceful and bloody, legal and illegal, domestic and foreign-aided actions" to further their goals of promoting democracy. Prosecution authorities in Shanghai also accused Gao and the two Yaos of hatching an "anti-government" plot while meeting in a small local park last November. The trio reportedly discussed an action plan which included street demonstrations, forming brigades of workers, occupying radio and TV stations, and detaining municipal party and government leaders. The verdict said: The three were the "core organisers" of the front and that "they had decided upon their division of labour". It also said the group had mapped out plans to publish an illegal journal called Free China. Summing up the Government's case, court officials claimed that the accused had admitted their actions, which amounted to "attempts to topple the administration of the people's democratic dictatorship as well as the socialist order". They said the heavy sentences were called for because the two had committed their "crimes" less than three years after being released from re-education through labour camps. Yao Kaiwen, who was an individual entrepreneur upon his detention, spent 18 months in a labour camp after having been found guilty in early 1990 of trying to smuggle himself out of China. And Gao, who used to work at a pharmaceutical factory, was given a two-year term in August 1989 for taking part in the pro-democracy movement. Members of China's dissident community said last night they were shocked by the severity of the sentences. Friends of Gao and Yao said they belonged to the relatively radical fringe of the democracy movement. "There is no evidence to suggest the front has ever had more than four or five active members," a Shanghai source said. "That adherents of the front do not seem to have ruled out acts of violence in their theoretical discussions does not mean they will actually commit them." The source added that even if accusations made by the prosecution were true, the punishment was severe because the organisation had never put their ideas into action. Meanwhile, on New Year's Eve, authorities in Shanghai freed Mr. Yang, one of nine dissidents who put down their names to a draft of the peace charter released in Beijing on November 14. The so-called peace charter movement espouses "national reconciliation" through a non-violent campaign for a multi-party system. Mr. Yang, whose activism dates to the late 1970s, was detained by Beijing police hours after the release of the document. The dissident was held in a centre for tramps and transients in Beijing until December 5, when he was taken under guard to a similar facility in Shanghai. However, another signatory of the charter, Wuhan-based activist Qin Yongmin, who was arrested together with Mr. Yang, is believed to be detained in the central China city. Mr. Yang, who said he lost a tooth and a few kilograms during his ordeal, said it was illegal for the authorities to hold him in a centre for illegal migrant workers. "I had no recourse to the judicial process and I was not allowed to contact my family," he said in his Shanghai apartment yesterday. Mr. Yang said he would continue his non-violent campaign for democracy, warning that Beijing's continued refusal to tolerate the peaceful expression of dissent could spawn acts of violence by more radical factions of the movement.
