FBIS4-38557 "drsov105_u_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Latvia Diplomatic Problem in Relations With China, Taiwan Viewed Diplomatic Problem in Relations With China, Taiwan Viewed WS0106103194 Tallinn BNS in English 1632 GMT 31 May 94 WS0106103194 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Riga, May 31, BNS -- The Latvian Foreign Ministry is closely studying the issue how to regulate the Latvian-Chinese- Taiwanese relations, State Secretary Maris Riekstins told reporters. The People's Republic of China diplomats were present at the opening ceremony of the new premises of the Latvian Mission to the United Nations and the meeting of President Guntis Ulmanis with U.N. Security Council officials. The fact is remarkable because Chinese diplomats last contacted the Baltic country late in 1992 before the Latvian Government established official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. Riekstins explained the presence of Chinese diplomats with their awareness of Latvian intentions to improve relations with mainland China. During Ulmanis' trip to the United States, the U.S. Government approved the most favored nation status in trade with China. "Even a power like the United States cannot disregard this country with 1 billion residents and a huge market," Riekstins said. On the one hand, Latvia is interested to forge economic ties with Taiwan. On the other hand, Latvia has "no serious relations" with China, Riekstins noted. Ulmanis underscored that Latvia should seek to form diplomatic relations with China, simultaneously looking for a correct settlement of the Latvian-Taiwanese relationship. When asked whether China is setting conditions for the improvement of relations with Latvia, Riekstins said that the Chinsese position stems from the Latvian-Chinese 1992 agreement. According to this document, Latvia makes a commitment to avoid establishing official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Simultaneously, China is aware that Latvia cannot afford sharp curves in the sphere of international relations, Riekstins added. Ulmanis claims that the issue of Latvia's relations with China is also "an issue of the Latvian prestige" and Latvia should avoid sharp fluctuations in relations with foreign countries. Latvia established diplomatic relations with China in September, 1991. In January, 1992, Latvia agreed with Taiwan on the exchange of General Consulates after what China withdrew its embassy from Latvia though retaining official diplomatic relations. China, with 1.2 billion population, regards Taiwan, with 21 million residents, as a renegade island province ruled by the rival Nationalist government, which fled the mainland in 1949 after losing a civil war, according to The Associated Press. Taipei and Beijing both claim to be the sole legitimate ruler of all China. A growing rapprochement between the rival sides, however, is observed on the trade, cultural and private levels, AP said.
