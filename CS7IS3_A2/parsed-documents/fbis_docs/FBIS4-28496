First, it will begin development with the Mazda main-force "Familia" car class as the base and produce it with the three poles of Japan, the United States, and Europe beginning in 1998 or 1999. The Familia is a mass-sales car amounting to about 700,000 cars annually in Asia and North America combined, with the cars sold by Ford. It appears that the plan is to combine this with the same "Escort" car class of Ford Europe, and the idea is for both companies jointly to gather momentum in international strategy by expanding production scale further and cutting development costs. Besides the Familia, a strong candidate for "world strategy car" where the same model will be sold throughout the world is the "Festiva" that is being designed centering on Mazda. Considering that it "would like to promote development of world strategy cars in a wide class of cars" (Mazda chief executive), it is possible that it will in the future include midsized cars and above, which are the forte of Ford. The outline will be firmed up in June and it is scheduled to develop side by side various class cars beginning at the end of the year. Both Ford and Mazda will position the "Familia," the next after next after the current model that will be put on the market in 1998 or 1999, as a world strategy car, Ford will produce it in the United States and Europe and prospects are that they also will export it. Mazda will center on production and sales in Japan. Besides being able to share development expenses with Ford, Mazda can also expect the supply of parts to Ford. Ford is promoting unification of its U.S. and European organization and consolidation of car classes. The over 2,000-cc "Mondeo" which Ford Europe handles is considered a world strategy car. It is already on sale in Europe and production will begin in summer in the U.S. market also. It is aiming at annual production of 800,000 cars. However, there remains an overlapping of car classes by the various Ford-related companies in the United States, Europe, and Japan, and they are cultivating the next-generation car with a "Familia" base as a world strategy car in the 1500-cc class by U.S. and Japanese cooperation.
