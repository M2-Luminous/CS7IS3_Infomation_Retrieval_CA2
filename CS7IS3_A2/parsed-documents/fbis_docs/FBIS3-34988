Your Excellency: Can we say that the distress is about to be removed, that the cloud is about to dissolve, and that the crisis is about to be resolved, now that there has been agreement on signing the pledge and accord document in Amman on Sunday [20 February]? [Salih] Thank you very much. God willing, this cloud will dissolve. It has damaged Yemen's reputation on the international level and also on the level of the Arab family and the Yemeni homeland. God willing, this cloud will dissolve by signing the pledge and accord document in Amman, perhaps on Sunday. God willing, we will then address another concern: implementing the articles of this accord. These articles are not difficult; they are rather very simple indeed. This agreement was basically part of the government's policy statement on whose basis the government won the House of Representatives' vote of confidence. The only new thing in this accord is that the Political Forces Dialogue Committee signed it. One who follows up the government's political program, according to which it won the confidence, will find that most articles were already included in this accord. [Reporter] Specialists say that unity does not require a search for points of convergence, but for differences in order to avoid them and fill the gaps in them. Is this what is actually taking place in the united Yemen? [Salih] The unity was actually achieved. However, each crisis has its own negative and positive aspects. Thus, there is nothing new. The pledge and accord document has been finalized. We will move to the phase of implementing it. God willing, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and other state organs and institutions will reunite. We believe that reuniting these institutions will end the crisis. However, if other state institutions do not reunite, the crisis will not indeed end. [Reporter] It was reported that former Yemeni presidents and some Arab leaders will attend the signing ceremony in Amman. How true is this report? [Salih] This issue concerns the hosting state, and does not concern us as Yemenis. This is because we will sign the pledge document outside Yemen, so this matter concerns the hosting state. [Reporter] The world viewed Yemen with much admiration and appreciation for your democratic and unionist steps. Are there subsequent steps to enhance unity and democracy? [Salih] I believe that the steps will involve implementing the pledge and accord document, enacting the constitution, benefiting from the crises that happened, and assessing the negative and positive aspects of our democratic experience. We will also do our best, within the framework of solidarity of the whole leadership, to tackle the repercussions of the crisis. In fact, the crisis has produced bad repercussions. [Reporter] Do you plan to add a Constitutional amendment that would only allow two presidential terms for the president of the republic? [Salih] Within the framework of the peaceful handling of authority and not monopolizing the authority -- and in order to give hope for anyone who aspires for leadership, and also to prevent coups and conspiracies -- I earlier announced that a president's tenure should be confined to only two terms. [Reporter] Your Excellency the President: May I move to another issue, namely, Yemen's relationship with foreign countries? What is the nature of Yemen's relationship with the Gulf states? [Salih] During a certain period of time, this relationship slowed down as a result of the Gulf crisis repercussions. Intensive and mutual efforts are being exerted with some brothers in the Gulf states to return matters to normal. Relations are now good with the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Relations with Saudi Arabia are somewhat good, and are improving day after day. They are also good with Kuwait and Bahrain. In other words, there is a new start on returning matters to their previous situation. [Reporter] Yemen has had known positions on the Palestine question. Does the recent agreement between 'Arafat and Peres on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First accord agree with your positions? [Salih] In fact, we support the well-being of the Palestinian Arab people. We, however, were aspiring for something more than what was reached in the Gaza-Jericho First peace agreement. Our aspiration was larger than this agreement. However, as a result of the rift that befell the Arab family, we accepted these results. We were aspiring for something greater. Had the Arab nation experienced solidarity and closed its ranks as part of both the new world order and the economic and political blocs and groupings, results would have been better. However, we support the well-being of the brothers in Palestine. [Reporter] Your Excellency the President, the last question is: What is your assessment of Yemeni relations with the United States at present? [Salih] Our relationship with the United States is excellent and advanced. I believe that my visit to the United States in 1990 produced a positive outcome. These relations are advancing and growing. We are satisfied with the level of relations with the United States. [Reporter] Your Excellency President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: We thank you for this meeting, and I wish you success in your endeavors.
