"Each of the deputies went to elections, knowing that he would be elected for two years," Volskiy declared at a news-conference in Moscow Friday, noting that the prolongation offer was "very mean towards the State Duma and Federation Council." He also criticized the presidential anti-crime decree since it presupposes the right of arbitrary rule. However, he quoted a number of industrial managers as saying that most people are in favor of the decree. "The best thing would be to erase from the decree the rubbish like the right to detain people for 30 days," Volskiy said. According to him, "it was in fact Russia rather than the USSR that collapsed" in 1991. "The rupture of economic ties was the chief reason for production decline," he remarked. In his opinion, Russia and other former USSR republics should set up a really workable economic union, if they want to overcome the crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, enterprises will have to establish direct ties, he said. The problem could also be resolved by forming transnational corporations across the former USSR.
