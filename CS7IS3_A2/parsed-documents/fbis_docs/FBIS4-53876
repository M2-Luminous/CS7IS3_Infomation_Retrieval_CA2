Siriphong Thongyai said. ACM M.R. Siriphong said the Air Force had told Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari of its position. He said some aspects of the purchase agreement draft needed correction. The contract could not be signed until this was done as it could cost the country a lot more money. He declined to elaborate apart from saying the issue had not been finalised. The Air Force has provided the Supreme Command with a number of options in dealing with the problem. Air Force sources said the urgency of the deal appeared to have been overtaken by other priorities after a long delay in the purchase process. Supreme Commander ACM Woranat declined to comment. He is awaiting an official explanation from the Air Force.
