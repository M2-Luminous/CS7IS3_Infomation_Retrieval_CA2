He told Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Bishkek on Tuesday that a program was being drawn up to stabilize the position of Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking population, the aim of which was to reduce Russian speakers' emigration from the republic. One of the objectives of the program is to prevent attempts to cut down the teaching of Russian, a language used in contacts between different CIS states, Akayev said. As an example of support given to Kyrgyzstan's Russian-speaking community, he cited the Kyrgyz-Russian Slavonic University, set up last year. It has 200 students at present and is expected to have about 1000 in future. The creation of the university "ought to reassure the Kyrgyz Slavs, whose children can receive an education in their native language," the president said. It is only jointly with Russia that Kyrgyzstan is able to solve the problems of its Russian-speakers, he said. "We can solve the psychological problems and create a favorable atmosphere, but it would be difficult for Kyrgyzstan to handle the economic aspects of the problem on its own," he said. Akayev said Kyrgyz enterprises were short of raw materials and components, while the customs barriers and dual taxation raised the cost of their output tenfold. However, not only Kyrgyzstan and Russia but also other Commonwealth states needed goods produced by those enterprises, he said. He expressed the hope that the visit of Kozyrev, who arrived in Bishkek on Monday, would help solve some of those problems, which would have a serious positive effect on Kyrgyzstan's industry, where many of the republic's Russian speakers are employed. The president said Kyrgyzstan's former military enterprises should have the same access to raw materials as such enterprises in Russia. "This won't be a one-way street. Let Russia own many of the shares in Kyrgyz enterprises. Thereby we will keep those enterprises going, providing work for tens of thousands of people," he said. It will also strengthen "the Slavs' confidence in their future," he said. Kozyrev handed over to Akayev a letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who expressed support for the comprehensive stabilization program for Kyrgyzstan's Russian speakers, work on which was being guided by Akayev. Russia is ready "to continue helping fraternal Kyrgyzstan economically as much as it can," Yeltsin said. Kozyrev told Akayev Kyrgyzstan was one of Russia's closest allies. "I've always said that we are not indifferent to each other, although these days I'm accused of imperialism for such words. What can be more normal than saying that we are vitally interested in each other," he said. "We, the people of Kyrgyzstan, are only too glad to hear that," Akayev responded. Kozyrev said Russia's attempts to protect the Russian-speaking population in other former Soviet republics had nothing to do with imperialism. But "we cannot remain indifferent to restrictions put on the rights of Russian speakers, who are, for example, being ousted from Latvia," he said. Akayev said he could trace no imperial ambitions in Russia's foreign policy. "Eurasia cannot be stable without a powerful and great Russia," he said. According to Kyrgyz Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Aitmatov, the Russian speakers' position in Kyrgyzstan does pose a problem. "It is a fact that there are certain things the (ethnic) Russian are concerned about. But at the governmental level everything is being done to eliminate the causes of that concern and ensure equal rights for the Russian-speaking population, as for all other citizens of Kyrgyzstan," he told INTERFAX. In his opinion, the dual citizenship issue should be put before parliament. However, Akayev, addressing the First Congress of Peoples of Kyrgyzstan last Saturday, said dual citizenship could be granted to residents of the republic on the basis of bilateral agreements and the right to it should not be formalized in the Constitution. He said all decisions on the issue would be determined by Russia's role as Kyrgyzstan's "main partner in all spheres." Earlier Akayev's press service said work on the dual citizenship problem would be "a constitutional process," not "an arbitrary decision by the president."
