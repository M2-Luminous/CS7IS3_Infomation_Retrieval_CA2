While the former favors what the Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement term intensification [preceding word in English], the latter prefers to wait until the Gaza-Jericho autonomy has established itself. The nature and timetable of the next stage will be decided at Rabin and Peres' upcoming summit meeting with 'Arafat in Paris next week, when the three men will be awarded a special UNESCO prize. The occasion will be used for political talks. The Foreign Ministry top echelons held a discussion yesterday on the next stage of negotiations. Their approach can be summed up by saying that they support accelerating the negotiations and expanding them beyond the five areas Israel is to transfer to the Palestinians. The five areas are direct taxation, health, education, tourism, and labor. The Foreign Ministry believes the Palestinians should receive additional powers in economic spheres. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday reiterated his position that the residents of major cities in the territories should be allowed to run their lives by themselves. [passage omitted] The prime minister's bureau has a different opinion. In Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's view, the first thing to do is to ascertain that progress is being made in Gaza and Jericho and that civilian spheres are being attended to, in addition to the already operational police force. He believes that only at that point should the next stage of negotiations be contemplated.
