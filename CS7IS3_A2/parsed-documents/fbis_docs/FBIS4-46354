Intense land and air searches were conducted over a broad area of eastern Sucumbios Province, along the border with Colombia. U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero confirmed on Tuesday the disappearance of his countrymen Elliot Neil Norton and Karl Nolan. The U.S. citizens, employees of the Intradil Green drilling company, had been missing since last weekend when they were seen in the oil town of Shushufind. Press reports in Quito indicated that as a result of the investigations conducted in Sucumbios in the past few hours the police had arrested several suspects, apparently Colombians and Ecuadoreans. According to sources close to the police, the oil technicians were presumably taken by their captors to the Colombian side of the border, which would further hamper the rescue. Commander Ruben Barahona told newsmen that different organized crime groups operate in this conflict-ridden area of Ecuador's Amazon region. Barahona added that in that area drug traffickers, among their other activities, are responsible for the transfer of precursor chemicals that are used in Colombia to process the drug. "Criminal and drug activities have made the place very dangerous," the official indicated. Despite intense operations by the Armed Forces and the police, whose collaboration was requested by the diplomatic mission, authorities conceded today that they do not have any concrete leads to find the missing persons. At least five U.S. citizens, including two technicians of U.S. oil companies in Sucumbios, were kidnapped in past years. In most cases, the kidnapees were rescued, but no specifics exist on the conditions or the ransom agreed upon for their release. Administration Secretary General Carlos Larreategui denied that the recent wave of kidnappings registered in various locations of the country is related to a subversive group. Larreategui blamed the kidnappings on common crime and stressed that the only armed group known in Ecuador, referring to the "Red Sun," announced its demobilization and turned its weapons in to military authorities. However, presumed "Red Sun" militants who broke away from those who negotiated the peace have told the media from hiding that they will continue their activities and the armed struggle.
