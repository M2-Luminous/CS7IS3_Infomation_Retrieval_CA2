Henri Emmanuelli practises blunt speaking. "I would always prefer to be a left-wing brute who works rather than an anesthetized Parisian intellectual," he explained last September. "Nuances," he also said, "are valuable for thinking but a hindrance to action." Since he entered politics, this man has been unable to escape his caricature. It can be summed up in a few words: gloomy, irritable, archaic, and sectarian. It hampers him, serves him, and protects him all at the same time. On Sunday, 19 June, it made him first secretary of a Socialist Party [PS] which is seeking an identity. He brings to the party the perfect background of the grandson of a Corsican shepherd, the son of two Communist militants, orphaned early in life by the death of his working-class father, who was electrocuted in a work accident in 1958. He also offers it the career of a child whose fragile health and modest background did not prevent him from becoming a student of political science, and then starting his career through the prestigious door of the financial company of the Edmond de Rothschild bank. He also has a long record as a militant, close to Mitterrandism, within the Convention of Republican Institutions, and then the PS. He also brings the support of his region which, from his election in 1978 as deputy for Les Landes, and his accession, four years later, to the chairmanship of the regional council, has never been disputed. His entry into government as secretary of state for the overseas departements and territories from 1981 to 1983, then secretary of state for the budget until 1986, confers on him a national political dimension. His election in January 1992 as speaker of the National Assembly made him the fourth-ranking person in the state for a year. Loyal to the President This model career would suffice to give him legitimacy. Events have added a dramatic dimension. In July 1992, the day of the opening of the PS congress in Bordeaux, the man who was the party's national treasurer learned, in the press, that he was to be charged by Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, who was investigating various cases to do with the activity of the consultancy offices providing the PS' secret funding. For the members meeting that day, Henri Emmanuelli became a symbol. In order to "restore" his "honor," the following year, when he was brought before the magistrate, Henri Emmanuelli was bold enough to resign as deputy and verify with pride that he still had the confidence of the voters in Les Landes. These successes conferred on him a freedom of speech which he has never abanoned. A loyal supporter of Mitterrand (the president's residence at Latche is in his constituency), he can also be surly and rebellious. In March 1990, he contributed to the failure of Laurent Fabius' first attempt to take control of the PS in the battle of the Rennes congress. At the time, Fabius's supporters did not have words harsh enough to mock the "archaism" of the deputy for Les Landes who, having become president of the National Assembly's Finance Committee in 1991, sometimes virulently opposed the political and economic policiesi of Pierre Beregovoy. Paradoxically, this same "archaism" became one of Henri Emmanuelli's major assets on Sunday [19 June] in his accession to the post of first secretary of a party desperately seeking to regain a left-wing label. As for the sectarianism with which the deputy's name is associated, it has proved capable of change: from April 1993, when he was the architect of the "coup" perpetrated by the Rocard clan against Laurent Fabius, to this June Sunday which marked his collaboration with his former enemy to succeed Michel Rocard.
