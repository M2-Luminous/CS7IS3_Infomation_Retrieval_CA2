In a lengthy article with subtitles "`We Serve the People Exclusively'" and "Even if the Earth Is Broken", the author says the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is confidently leading the whole party, all the people and the entire Army to the victory of socialism with his spirit of devoted service to the people, distinguished leadership ability and iron faith and will. Shulman, far above 80, visited Korea several times from August 1945 when Korea was liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism. He says: What I cannot forget any moment among many unforgettable things in my life is the great personality and outstanding leadership ability of Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great leaders of the Korean people, and the brilliant looks of socialist Korea which is soaring imposingly above the clouds in the east. Pointing to the superior health care system of Korea where doctors visit residents, before the patients come to them, everyone gets medical assistance without paying a penny, and is provided with all conditions for the promotion of health by the state, the author says: The noble human love, great human love of Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a panacea for the longevity of the people in good health. He went on: Korea which was a colonial agriculture country with backward economy for many years and, worse still, was reduced to ruins in a three-year war built solid foundations of an independent national economy diversely developed and equipped with modern technologies in a few years. This is a miracle and change which can be brought about only in Korea where everything serves the people and their strength is the driving force of social development. The imperialists in the West are decrying the economy of Korea, alleging that it has gone bankrupt. But this is a sophism to mar the image of socialist Korea. I fully grasped the greatness of the leader through the reality of Korea which is constantly developing politics, economy and culture with main emphasis on the ideological, material and cultural life of the people. Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of the quality, personality and ability to make everything serve the people, believing them as heaven, is, indeed, a man for the people, the greatest of the great. There were in history great men who earned fame with wisdom, famous generals who earned fame with martial arts and politicians who won popular sentiments with benevolence. But none of these great men can be equal to the great personality of Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military accomplishments, loyalty and filial duty, iron will and grit. Socialism collapsed in some countries at present. But Korea is firmly defending socialism and winning victory after victory, smashing the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists. Now the people of many countries question what is the secret that Korea, not a big country, is fighting the United States singlehanded and overwhelming it thoroughly at a time when even influential politicians cringe if the U.S. shout at them. I clearly saw the source of the strength of the Korean people while visiting Korea. The singlehearted unity of the party and the popular masses united rock-firm around Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, is the source of invincible might which can create something out of nothing and defeat any formidable enemy. It is the distinguished merit of Comrade Kim Chong-il possessed of outstanding idea and theories and preeminent leadership ability that the singlehearted unity of Korea is so solid and virile as today. The outstanding leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il in strengthening the working-class party, the general staff of the revolution, enhancing the leadership role of the party in every way, effecting a fundamental turn in the building of the revolutionary Armed Forces and fully displaying the advantages of socialism in economy, culture and all other domains has instilled deep into the hearts of the entire people the firm faith and will that when they uphold his leadership, they can surely occupy any fortress in socialist construction, drive back the counterrevolutionary offensive of all the enemies and always win victory. The singlehearted unity of Korea is so powerful because the whole society is overflowing with this faith and will. What I want to stress as regards the singlehearted unity of Korea is that it is a crystal of benevolent politics, politics of love and trust of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il. The mighty unity of the entire people like the singlehearted unity of Korea can be achieved only by the strength of idea, the strength of politics and the strength of love of such illustrious leader as Comrade Kim Chong-il who enjoys undisputed trust of the people. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a country guided by the illustrious leader, where the people is the master of the state and society and the singlehearted unity of the entire people has been achieved, will further prosper, displaying its might to the whole world as a fortress of socialism and a beacon of the hope of mankind.
