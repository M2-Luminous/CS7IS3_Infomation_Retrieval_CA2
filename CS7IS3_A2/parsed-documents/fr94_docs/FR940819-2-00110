FR940819-2-00110 FR940819-2-00066 ``If the customer does not intend to include a Microsoft operating system product with a New System, the Customer does not need to notify Microsoft at any time of the creation, use or sale of any such New System, nor does it need to take any particular steps to market or advertise the New System.'' ``Under Microsoft's License Agreement, there is no charge or penalty if a Customer chooses at any time to create a New System incorporating a non-Microsoft operating system. If the Customer intends to include a Microsoft operating system product with the New System, the Customer must so notify Microsoft, after which the parties may enter into arm's length negotiation with respect to a license to apply to the New System.'' In the case of OEMs with Per Processor Licenses treated as Per System Licenses pursuant to Section IV (J), the notice shall include the following paragraph at the beginning of the notice: ``All models covered by your Per Processor License are now treated as subject to a Per System License. You may exclude any such model from being treated as subject to a Per System License by notifying Microsoft in writing. Such notice to Microsoft must include the model designation to be excluded from the Per System License. Such exclusion shall take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter next following Microsoft's receipt of such notice.'' (H) Microsoft may not use any form of Lump Sum Pricing in any License Agreement of Covered Product(s) executed after the date of this Final Judgment. It is not a violation of this Final Judgment for Microsoft to use royalty rates, including rates embodying volume discounts, agreed upon in advance with respect to each individual OEM, each specific version or language of a Covered Product, and each designated Personal Computer System model subject to the License Agreement. (I) OEMs that currently have a License Agreement that is inconsistent with any provision of this Final Judgment may, without penalty, terminate the License Agreement or negotiate with Microsoft to amend the License Agreement to eliminate such inconsistent provisions. An OEM desiring to terminate or amend such a License Agreement shall give Microsoft ninety (90) days written notice at any time prior to January 1, 1995. (J) If an OEM has a License Agreement that is inconsistent with any provision of this Final Judgment, Microsoft may enforce that License Agreement subject to the following: (1) if the License Agreement is a Per Processor License, Microsoft shall treat it as a Per System License for all existing OEM models that contain the microprocessor type(s) specified in the License Agreement except those models that the OEM opts in writing to exclude and such exclusion shall take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter net following Microsoft's receipt of such notice, and (2) Microsoft may not enforce prospectively any Minimum Commitment. (K) Microsoft shall not enter into any NDA: (1) whose duration extends beyond (a) commercial release of the product covered by the NDA, (b) an earlier public disclosure authorized by Microsoft of information covered by the NDA, or (c) one year from the date of disclosure of information covered by the NDA to a person subject to the NDA, whichever comes first; or (2) that would restrict in any manner any person subject to the NDA from developing software products that will run on competing Operating System Software products, provided that such development efforts do not entail the disclosure or use of any Microsoft proprietary information during the term of the NDA; or (3) that would restrict any activities of any person subject to the NDA to whom no information covered by the NDA has been disclosed. (L) The form of standard NDAs will be approved by a Microsoft corporate officer and all non-standard language in NDAs that pertains to matters covered in Section (k) above will be approved by a Microsoft senior corporate attorney. (M) Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Final Judgment, Microsoft will provide a copy of this Final Judgment to all OEMs with whom it has License Agreements at that time except for those with licenses solely under the Small Volume Easy Distribution (SVED) program or the Delivery Service Partner (DSP) program.
