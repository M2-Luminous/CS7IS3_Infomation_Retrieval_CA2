FR940119-0-00023 FR940119-0-00005 Proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), which has no counterpart in the Federal regulations, provides a limited exemption from the requirement to restore AOC when the operation is an underground mining operation that contains a highwall or face-up area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.3., this exemption is no less effective than the Federal regulations. Proposed rule 4.14.1(2)(g) provides an exemption from the requirement to restore AOC for remining operations initiated on sites that contain a preexisting highwall. For the reasons discussed in finding No. III.4., this exemption is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(3) and (f), 817.102(a)(3) and (f), 816.106(b) (1) through (4), and 817.106(b) (1) through (4). Existing Rules 2.06.5 and 4.27.4, which were previously approved by OSM, provide an exemption from the requirement to restore AOC in steep-slope mining situations. This exemption is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulation exemptions at 30 CFR 785.16, 816.102(a) (1) and (2), 817.102(a) (1) and (2), 816.133(d), and 817.133(d). Existing Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides that, for an underground mining operation, excess material not required to eliminate all highwalls and depressions need not be returned to AOC as required by the general grading requirements at Rule 4.14.2 if the operation demonstrates compliance with the applicable hydrologic balance, topsoil, excess spoil, and revegetation requirements at Rules 4.05, 4.06, 4.09, and 4.15 and the Division approves this practice. Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), which was previously approved by OSM, has no direct counterpart in the Federal regulations but has a general counterpart in the Federal backfilling and grading regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1). The applicable part of this regulation requires that disturbed areas for underground mining operations be backfilled and graded to achieve AOC. Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) provides a specific underground mining exemption to returning or blending excess material to AOC. The Director interprets this rule to mean that an underground mining operation's disturbed area, including all highwalls and depressions, must be backfilled and returned to AOC and that any excess material deposited outside the disturbed area must be blended with the surrounding terrain to achieve AOC. When narrowly interpreted in this manner to apply to underground mining activities, and not to surface mining activities, and only to excess spoil material remaining after AOC of the disturbed area has been achieved, Rule 4.14.1(2)(e) is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1). The Federal regulations corresponding to proposed Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(1) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(1). Like the proposed rule, the Federal regulations contain specific references to the portions of the Federal regulations that provide exemptions to the requirement to restore AOC. Since the proposed revision would add specificity and clarity to the existing rule, and since each exemption referenced by the proposed revision is no less effective than the counterpart exemption in the Federal regulations, the Director finds the proposed revision to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations and approves it. (2) Colorado's proposed exceptions to the requirement to completely eliminate all highwalls. Existing Colorado Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) also provides that spoil must be graded to eliminate all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions. Colorado proposed to further revise Rule 4.14.1(2)(a) to provide for two exceptions to this requirement. The first exception provides that spoil need not be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is an underground mining operation that meets the criteria of Rule 4.14.1(2)(f). The second exception provides that spoil need not be graded to eliminate all highwalls if the operation is a remining operation on a site mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977, pursuant to Rule 4.14.1(2)(g). The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2) provide for two exceptions to the requirement that all highwalls be eliminated. The first exception is for small depressions pursuant to 30 CFR 816.102(h). The second exception is for highwalls in previously mined areas pursuant to 30 CFR 816.102(k)(3)(iii) and 30 CFR 816.106.
