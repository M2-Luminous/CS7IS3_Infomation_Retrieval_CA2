While military conflict seems very distant, the relationship between the three has not been worse, or more inherently unstable, for decades. In China, a terrified Government awaits the death of the third communist emperor, Deng Xiaoping, and the almost inevitable and potentially destabilising power struggle to follow, even as it presides over astonishing economic growth and social transformation. In Tokyo, a courageous but partly crippled Government is beset with rising corruption allegations as it struggles to implement economic liberalisation and political reform. In Washington, an administration grappling with its own spiralling scandal management problems is weak before a protectionist and sectional Congress. President Bill Clinton, who has constantly avowed the overwhelming priority for domestic issues in his administration, has identified only two themes in foreign policy of any consequence -- the use of foreign trade to promote American jobs, and the international promotion of human rights. The interaction of these priorities with Japan and China means the US now risks seriously destabilising China and its reform program, at almost incalculable risk to Australia and East Asia, as well as stalling the Japanese economy, corroding the practice of free trade and undermining the global rules-based trade system. In the end, the stakes are nothing less than war and peace, for a China bloodied by vicious American trade sanctions will be unpredictable at best, and if the US persists with its unreasonable abuse of Japan, a nationalist reaction there cannot be ruled out. Moreover, Japan could be forced to respond to Chinese instability. Australia must try to pick its way through a chaotic and unpredictable clash of forces. The Keating Government has consistently opposed America's basic policy on Japan and China, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, sitting calmly beside US Secretary of State Warren Christopher at their recent joint press conference in Canberra, and saying that threatening to withdraw most favoured nation [MFN] status from China was neither right in principle nor effective in practice. But there is a deeper historical process at work here. The staggering economic growth of East Asia is challenging US global dominance in a way the one-dimensional military challenge of the Soviet Union never did. We are now in a pivotal phase in the development of the triangular relationship, a time when we can make some provisional judgments and identify some looming moments of truth. It is now clear, for instance, that the completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade did not signal a renewed American commitment to free trade. Instead, the US will take what benefits it can get from GATT and multilateralism, will also seek special-favour regional deals where possible especially in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and will increasingly use its might to bludgeon bilateral concessions out of individual trade partners such as Japan. Several crisis points are near. In June, the US will have to decide whether to renew China's MFN status. MFN is the normal trade status afforded to virtually everybody. Not renewing it would be a savage act, tantamount to an act of economic war. Then in September, the provisions of the newly re-activated Super 301 trade legislation will come into play. Super 301 will allow the US to declare the Japanese unfair traders and take punitive trade sanction actions against them. MFN in June, and Super 301 in September -- the US stands poised to take two of the most destructive, anti-free trade actions in its history, actions which could have devastating consequences for Australia. How did it get to this ridiculous impasse? With Japan, the US complaint is an old one, that Japan discriminates against imports through invisible trade barriers and this is why it runs a trade surplus with the US of nearly $US60 billion ($84.17 billion). The problem is the facts do not square with this analysis. Japan imports, per head, about the same value of products as many affluent West European countries. Moreover, Japan is already moving as rapidly as reasonably imaginable towards a more import-friendly and deregulated economy. According to a study by the East Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Japan's manufactured imports tripled between 1985 and 1991, rising to $US113 billion, and falling very slightly the next year because of Japan's recession. In recent years Japan's imports have reached as high as 8 per cent of its gross domestic product, compared with about 9.5 per cent for the US. The prospect for continued growth in imports is good. The real story of the second half of the 1980s was America's declining market share in Japan. The US share of the Japanese market for manufactured imports fell from 35 per cent in 1985 to 27 per cent in 1992. The big winners in the Japanese market in that period were China, South Korea, South East Asia and the European Community. A huge part of the US deficit with Japan is thus unquestionably caused by American lack of competitiveness. US administration figures from Clinton to Christopher, and trade representative Mickey Kantor, say they are not trying to impose managed trade on Japan. They want Japan's markets opened up to all comers but they want this opening measured by conformity with numerical targets. But as Australia's trade minister Senator Bob McMullan pointed out to Christopher, with all the political pressure coming from the US obviously Japan could be pushed into accommodating that pressure by giving special preference to the US against other suppliers such as Australia. The US's rough-house tactics of threatened sanctions against Japan even led to the remarkable sight this week of the European Union coming to Japan's defence. The European trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said the US was being "discriminatory" in its policies towards Japan. He also raised the question of the US's hypocrisy concerning its own vast array of trade barriers. Brittan said Europe had "a very long list of US trade barriers" that it wanted the US to remove. He also said "Any attempt to force (Japanese) markets open through numerical targets risks above all being counterproductive as well as being incompatible with Europe and America's mutual commitment to free trade and multilateralism." American policy-makers should also know their actions have brought American prestige in Asia to an all-time low. There is not a single Asian opinion maker of consequence who considers the US's behaviour justified. Indeed, Japan is assuming heroic status for resisting "managed trade". Even Prime Minister Paul Keating congratulated former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa for resisting US pressure for managed trade. It is clear the completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT has done nothing to solve the US-Japan tension. Moreover, Australia's brave attempt to multilateralise the Tokyo-Washington problems by putting them in an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation [(APEC] context has also so far been unsuccessful, although APEC remains immensely constructive. But if the US is successful in its Super 301 harassment of Japan, it will undermine many of the gains won in the Uruguay Round. The GATT system cannot really function if the world's most powerful economy flouts its spirit and devotes increased attention to one-on-one deals where its huge size is most effective. In this kind of a world, trade blocs and regional trade associations will flourish, as smaller nations seek to combine for protection against the US. With Australia a natural member of no significant trade bloc, our interests would be very hard to protect. Even worse for us, and for the region, would be cutting off China's MFN status if it does not make substantial improvements in its human rights performance. China and Russia represent opposite models of giant nations making the transition out of communism. Russia chose democracy (glasnost) first, and economic restructuring (perestroika) second. As a result it is a shambles and its prospects remarkably poor. China went the other way, opening up its economy first while delaying political reform. As a result human freedom is increasing almost exponentially in China. It is the fastest growing economy in the world. In Guangzhou, in Shanghai, in Fujian, the authority of the central Government is weakening; regional and personal autonomy is growing. There are two great threats -- a savage clampdown by the central Government or the breakdown of all coherent government authority and the emergence of chaos on a big scale. Removing MFN status makes both much likelier. If economic reform fails because of American trade sanctions the Chinese Government will have a chance of re-establishing legitimacy on the basis of fervid nationalism and anti-Americanism which most Chinese in such circumstances may well share. Evans drew Christopher's attention to the damage that would be done to Hong Kong's economy by revoking China's MFN status. Similarly, Taiwan and other regional economies would suffer. At worst, the region could be dealing with millions of Chinese refugees because of American trade sanctions against China. China today is at a unique moment in its history. For the first time tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of Chinese have a chance of escaping from the poverty and tyranny which has normally been their lot and making a transition into a modern economy (which would eventually produce a modern polity). Allegedly in the interests of human rights, Washington is prepared to jeopardise all that. As Richard Solomon, the US assistant secretary of State for East Asia under George Bush said this week on US television: "Its illogical. Why? Because I think there's a general realisation there has been really dramatic improvement in the situation in China if one takes a 10 or 20-year perspective. Economic growth and the trade that's been a driving force behind that has been a real force for positive improvement. To threaten to pull MFN is to undercut one of our major sources of positive influence for improving the situation in China." China has always resented being pushed around by the West. During Christopher's visit, its leaders made absolutely clear they will make no significant concessions to the US to secure MFN status. But if Clinton backs down on his MFN threat, he will look to a domestic US audience like a hypocrite and a wimp. As Solomon comments: "The administration has boxed itself in." Either Clinton will maintain his credibility domestically and cause havoc in China and East Asia, or he will give in. The world may be very badly served by having a Democrat Congress and a Democrat President. Reagan and Bush governed in spite of Congress. As a result they were not afraid of taking Congress on, which is essential in foreign policy. Congress could have passed resolutions cancelling China's MFN status every day of the week and twice on Sundays and Bush would have vetoed every one. But Clinton needs Congress. East Asia could easily be thrown into chaos in order to salvage the Clinton health plan, such are the complexities, and the absurdities, of the trade-offs between the Congress and the White House. The final irony is that the success of both China and Japan is a consequence of earlier farsighted American foreign policy -- its benign administration of Japan after World War II and Richard Nixon's brilliant innovation in bringing China into the wider world in the 70s. But the quality of American leadership in those days was very different from today. While there is some indication that senior administration figures understand the extreme danger of their current Asian brinkmanship, and while fortunately no military rivalry is as yet involved, a stable relationship between the three giants of the Asia-Pacific looks a distant prospect.
