Mogultay and Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk visited the Palestinian Embassy in Ankara and signed a memorial book which was dedicated to the 63 Palestinian victims of the Ibrahim Mosque massacre in Hebron by a Jewish settler last Friday. Mogultay expressed condolences to Palestinian Ambassador Fu'ad Yasin over the incident. Yasin called for international protection for the Palestinians living in Israel. Israel and the PLO signed a treaty in Washington on Sept. 13, 1993 that provides autonomy for the Palestinians living in the Gaza strip and the city of Jericho. Mogultay said Israel and the PLO should continue a constructive dialogue as the peace process is in a critical point. He said a lasting and peaceful solution should be found to the problem.
