SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the State of Georgia is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy Program. Georgia has adopted drinking water regulations for the Phase V (Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC), Synthetic Organic Chemicals (SOC), and Inorganic Chemicals (IOC) Rule.

A request for a public hearing must be submitted by September 26, 1994, to the Regional Administrator at the address shown below. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional Administrator. However, if a substantial request for a public hearing is made by September 26, 1994, a public hearing will be held. If no timely and appropriate request for a hearing is received and the Regional Administrator does not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, this determination shall become final and effective thirty (30) days after publication in the Federal Register . Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing; (2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determination and a brief statement of the information that the requesting person intends to submit at such hearing; (3) The signature of the individual making the request, or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity.
