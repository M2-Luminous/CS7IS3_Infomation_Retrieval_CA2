Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa categorically denied this. They said such claims tarnish the image of Yemen and obstruct the implementation of the pledge and accord document signed in Amman to achieve Yemeni reconciliation. Defense Ministry sources in Sanaa said an officer called Colonel 'Ali al-Hadi, a member of the South Yemeni Socialist Party and armament director at the Defense Ministry, is currently in an East European state to make a deal to purchase long-range missiles against the will of the Defense Ministry in Sanaa.
