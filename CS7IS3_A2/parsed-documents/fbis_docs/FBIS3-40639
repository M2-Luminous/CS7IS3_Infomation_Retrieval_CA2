Now India does not consider it an insult to have an East India company come in and call the shots. Now East India companies are surrounding us on all sides. We have taken the position that even if we do not accept the proposals, foreign powers will attack us on the economic front. In the eyes of the world, this would be appropriate. Provisions were made in the Dunkel draft for this contingency. We expressed our consent. Parliamentary investigatory committee's Bhagwan Shankar Ravat has made this claim. He is worried that the government is viewing their stance as neutral, while in fact, the results will not bear this out. The budget will suffer and our economic losses will be great. Just when we were making strides in deficit reduction. Shri Ravat is also worried about that Indian industry will not get a boost under the Dunkel proposals. Of course, industry has thus far been under the protection of the government. After the implementation of the Dunkel proposals, Indian industry will be under the thumb of foreign governments and the multinational companies. India is sooner or later certain to find itself in this situation. Protection of foodstuffs will end. Farmers all over the country will be laboring for the multinationals. Small and marginal farmers will be reduced to penary. Ayurvedic medicine, along with the whole range of medicines, will no longer be affordable to the comman man. Indian brains will think for foreigners. Indian scientists and researchers will be in a similar position. Shri Ravat thinks the proposals will have an adverse affect on national unity as well. Center-State relations will be pushed off a precipice. Tensions will skyrocket. Shri Ravat regards acceptance of the Dunkel proposals as unconstitutional. The Indian government does not have the right to barter away economic sovereignty. Secondly, the Indian system of punishment will be dealt a severe blow. Now, the accused stands innocent until proven guilty. Guilt has to be proven. The Dunkel proposals assume guilt, requiring innocence to be proven. Shri Ravat says that developed nations are not really signing on to Dunkel out of free choice, but under the paternalism of the U.S. U.S. imperialism is on the rise and requires the economic surrender of every nation. Balkrishnan Jutshi, India's representative at the treaty talks, has falsely said that the proposals do not threaten the nation. He claims we are a developed country and have the same interests as Western countries. Shri Ravat says the government has not taken into consideration what effect the proposals will have on the country. They have not researched the issues involved or considered the details in the proposals. The government, instead, has already made the decision to sign before sitting down at the table. Shri Ravat says that the government is deceiving people regarding the imminent shortage of seeds, agricultural incentives, ration shopsa and medicines. Assurances on the part of the government are a mere smokescreen. The truth is that the policy is one of reverting to economic slavery. The engine of international economics is run by multinational companies. They have long ago signed on to the Dunkel proposals. They get 15 percent equity forgiven. Why did India find itself all alone on the international stage? Shri Ravat feels that India lost its role as leader of the third world which Nehru had established. Developing countries, for their own reasons, followed separate patterns of development. Each system has different problems. India's lack of leadership over this time has pigeon-holed us. Foreign policy is done on a wing and a prayer. Swadeshi products, self-reliance and self-respect were abandoned by the present government. They give liitle importance to gaining the respect and trust of other countries. They know they don't deserve it.
