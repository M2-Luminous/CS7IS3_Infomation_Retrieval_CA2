Cooperation between both parliaments, world ecology, the stockpiling of nuclear arms, and the proliferation of nuclear technologies were discussed, ITAR-TASS said. Rybkin says that NATO's Partnership for Peace program was "a bit restricting for Russia." Collective security in Russia was also discussed, with the Duma's Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in the chair. Despite the end of the cold war, it was impossible to prevent conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, he said. Partnership for peace and Russia's participation in peacemaking missions were also discussed. British members of parliament were told that Russia was concerned about its servicemen having to protect the CIS borders in what was a legally unclear area. "While analyzing the political and military aspects of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the British members of parliament expressed the hope that democracy in Russia `works long-term,'" ITAR-TASS said.
