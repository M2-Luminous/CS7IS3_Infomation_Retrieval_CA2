[Begin (Albert) recording] Acting Haitian Prime Minister Robert Malval, breaking a six-month silence with a bold act of defiance, on Monday called on Army chief General Raoul Cedras to resign immediately. Shaking with anger, Malval accused Cedras of disgracing his uniform and locking the country in the darkness of night by defying international sanctions, and demanding the return of democracy and of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in the 1991 coup. Malval also called on Haiti's civil servants to disobey orders from the provisional regime installed by the Army last week. Malval has been Haiti's acting prime minister since resigning his post in December after the breakdown of the UN accord restoring Aristide to power. [end recording]
