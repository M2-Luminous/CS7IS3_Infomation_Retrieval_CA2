FBIS4-1779 "drchi064_n_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-064 Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 Economic & Agricultural `Dense Oil' Technology Reaches World Advanced Level `Dense Oil' Technology Reaches World Advanced Level OW0204155694 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0719 GMT 1 Mar 94 OW0204155694 Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service Chinese BFN [By reporter Zheng Feifei (1728 7236 7236)] [Text] Shenyang, 1 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Gaosheng Oilfield has explored and found a whole set of technologies for recovering dense oil [chou you 4464 3111] from deep wells and enabled China's dense oil industry to reach the advanced world level after tackling key problems during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," the completion of necessary accessories during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," and improvement and perfection during the first three years of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan." The Gaosheng Oilfield is under the jurisdiction of the Liaohe Oilfield Administration, and is located in areas of Panshan and Taian Counties, Liaoning Province. It is a base for recovering dense oil from medium and deep wells. The total area with oil is 14.5 square kilometers and the total geological deposit is 100 million tonnes. Most of the deposit is irregular [yi chang xing 8381 1603 1840] dense oil, and the oil horizon is as deep as 1,500- 1,700 meters. It is one of the deepest dense oil fields being tapped in the world today. In 1977, the Petroleum Industry Ministry decided to turn the Gaosheng Oilfield into China's first dense oil development and experimental zone and make a plan to "gain experience, train talented people, and yield output." "People in Gaosheng" plunged themselves into the work of opening up the oilfield in the spirit of "giving their lives for science." During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, they imported and absorbed advanced technologies from abroad. They tested self-gushing by means of hot water circulation under the well, self-gushing by means of lowering an electric cable under the well [jing xia dian lan jiang zhan zi pen 0064 0007 7193 4968 7100 4724 5261 0899], self- gushing of oil with water flooding under the well, the conventional method of extracting heavy oil with water flooding under well, extracting oil by lowering water [chan huo xing shui jiang zhan chou you 2296 3172 1840 3055 7100 4724 2132 3111], and other technologies. They successfully explored the "12-character" complete technology suitable for recovering dense oil from deep wells, namely "big machine, long pump, thick tube, strong lever, deep under, and tap oil [chan you 2296 3111]," which can be used as a model for reference by other dense oilfields. They honorably received the state's scientific and technological progress prize of the first class for their experiment in recovering dense oil. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the Gaosheng Oilfield entered a period of high production and reached the goal of producing 1 million tonnes of petroleum steadily and annually three years ahead of the development plan. Their oil recovering speed exceeded the average speed of thin oil fields in the country. Gaosheng Oilfield became the country's only dense oilfield receiving the title of "oil field with high efficiency." Despite their achievements, they have not slackened their efforts to tackle scientific and technological difficulties and achieved another major breakthrough in oil recovery technology. In recovering dense oil, they carried out large-scale experiments on sucking and discharging steam, and gradually used domestically produced boilers. Their research and manufacturing of air-filled oil wells [zhu qi jing tian 3137 3086 0064 3944], heat separation tubes, gas sealers, and other items all reached or were close to the world advanced level. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the Gaosheng Oilfield also completed a ground transportation system for petroleum, and changed the past practice of carrying oil by horse-drawn wagons and oil drum cars. It has also realized fully automatic computerized management technology, and its oil transportation technology also reached the world advanced level. Since entering the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, the Gaosheng Oilfield continued to raise its oil recovery rate and engaged in difficult scientific and technological research projects, including steam flooding technology [zheng qi gu pei tao gong yi ji shu 5544 3086 7517 6792 1152 1562 5669 2111 2611], steam sucking and discharging technology, sand prevention for oilfields, and other subjects. In recent years, it has been carrying out over 10 technological innovations each year and maintaining the oil production quantity. As of the end of last year, the Gaosheng Oilfield produced an accumulated total of 11.81 million tonnes of oil for the state.
