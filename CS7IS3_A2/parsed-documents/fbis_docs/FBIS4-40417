Moscow Worried Over DPRK Special Services' Activity"; first two paragraphs published in a box] [Excerpts] State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lukin told the public recently that Russia ought not to be guided by "ideological considerations" in relations with North Korea. He was thereby actually urging that it be treated almost the same as normal states. In the meantime, world community flare-ups with that country will obviously continue as long as the chuche idea has a state shape. This is a quite natural state of things. Of course, the United States and the other countries shaping today's geostrategic balance cite rather sober arguments as the basis for a tough reaction to the North Korean threat. For example, a nuclear bomb in the hands of the irresponsible leaders of the chuche state is capable of scaring anyone. And if these leaders are bluffing, the very scale of the deception makes one believe that they are capable of unleashing a conventional war as well. [signed] SEGODNYA Sergey Stepashin, head of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, stated at a press conference in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk yesterday that the activity of the DPRK special services causes "special anxiety" in his agency. To give an example, he recalled the deportation from Moscow of five North Korean citizens who tried to take out of the country what are called "components of nuclear arms production." [passage omitted] Despite the fact that North Korea has long overstepped all the permitted limits, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated yesterday that international sanctions against the "nuclear blackmailers" from the DPRK "should be phased" and be regarded "as the last resort."
