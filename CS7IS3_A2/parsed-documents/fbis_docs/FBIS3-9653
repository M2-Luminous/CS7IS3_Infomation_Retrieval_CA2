If it finds itself in the same situation in the next four years, in what areas can we expect continuity, adjustments, or perhaps changes? [Csoti] The electors can expect continuity, primarily in foreign policy. We plan to continue the foreign policy that bears the stamp of Jozsef Antall, adapted naturally to the given circumstance -- because the world is changing in the meantime -- and eliminating the minor mistakes that we made during the four years of government, because we naturally were not perfect. However, there will be no change in the main line: The basic, determining factors in Hungarian foreign policy are to join the process of European integration and the handling -- and solution where possible -- of the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the borders, naturally in coordination with the good relations to be shaped with neighboring countries. [Keleti] Let us look more closely at the individual areas, including integration with Western Europe. We will soon officially submit our accession application to the European Union [EU]. We know that this in effect could be on the agenda in around 1996 or 1997. What aims does the MDF have in this area until then? [Csoti] Many things must be done concerning the further development of relations with the EU countries. Many things must be done here in Hungary so that we catch up economically, so that we adapt our legal system to the European norms. So there is plenty to do. [passage omitted] There are members of the [European] family, primarily Mediterranean countries, whose economy is not much stronger than ours. For this reason, we expect -- and we have received promises to this effect from our West European partners -- that our accession will be a political decision, that having achieved the necessary minimum, accession will enable us to be part of the system of European integration, and that by this they should ensure us the possibility of further economic progress. [Keleti] The other sphere that is being mentioned a lot recently is our relationship, our military-security relations, with NATO. The situation has become somewhat clearer with the announcement of Partnership for Peace and with the signing of the framework agreements on this. Nonetheless, what does the MDF expect from NATO specifically, within this cooperation, and according to the MDF program, in what specific areas must Hungary take steps so that there is closer cooperation? [Csoti] What we expect from NATO is that within the Partnership for Peace program we -- and other countries in the region that are ripe for this and wish to gain this status -- should have the genuine possibility to gain full membership. It is very important to emphasize that the European security system must always cooperate with Russia and Ukraine -- because this is inconceivable contrary to them or without them. However, they do not even wish to be full members, and it is inconceivable that a considerable proportion of the countries in the eastern half of the region will become members in the near future. For this reason, what we expect is that within Partnership for Peace, everyone in the trans-European [as heard] region should be a [NATO] partner, a cooperation partner, and the central European countries who have completed the essential phases of transformation and who want it should be full members. [Keleti] The next big foreign policy issue is the place and role -- in diplomacy -- of the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the borders. Let us begin with Vojvodina, since the situation there is special because of the southern Slav conflict. It has been raised recently that a conflict, a conflict of interests could develop between our rapprochement to NATO and the protection of the interests of the Hungarians there. What do we expect in the future, and what does the MDF wish to do in order to avoid such situations? [Csoti] I do not think that this would mean a conflict. Indeed, I say the opposite. For example, the fact that Hungary -- together with some other central European countries -- might at a given moment be a member of NATO and a few neighbors of ours might not, would not endanger the given country and would not (?give rise) to tension between the given neighboring country and us, since it is important for the neighboring country, in the present case Serbia, that there should be stability and security in the region. The wider the area embraced by NATO -- thereby strengthening NATO and stability in the region -- the more it should be in interest of Serbia, if it wants a peaceful and stable Europe, trusting that the war there will come to an end as soon as possible, that the situation there will be normalized, and that the other countries of the region could take a similar path. Therefore, I do not believe there is such a problem there, nor do I believe there is any vis-a-vis Romania or other countries. The theory -- which the Socialists represent and, I do not wish to speak on their behalf but they say this everyday -- that Hungary should enter NATO together with all of its neighbors is not realistic. If Hungary, and let us say, Slovakia, Austria, and Slovenia, as four potential, aspiring countries were to be excluded [from NATO membership], this would have a detrimental impact on us, on the region, and it would not help at all. Indeed, to the contrary, by perhaps increasing instability it would impair Romanian and Serbian interests as well. [Keleti] Concerning the question of autonomy: One often feels that when this question is raised in Hungary and in the neighboring states, let us say Romania or Slovakia, it is approached on the basis of entirely different viewpoints, entirely different ways of thinking. There, it is regarded as provocation against the nation-state; we regard it -- autonomy for the minorities -- as a natural application of European thinking, European legal-political norms. [passage omitted] Is there any chance of hoping for psychological bridge-building, rapprochement? This is one factor among many. [Csoti] It is definitely possible and necessary. I believe that it is an indispensable condition for finding a solution. These two neighboring countries [Romania and Slovakia] must come to terms with the fact that the peoples, ethnic groups.... [brief break in reception] Right cannot be applied selectively. An over 2-million-strong ethnic group or a 700,000-strong ethnic group, nation -- because the expression co-nation could also be applied to them in the given country -- is entitled to the same rights as those of the majority nation. Regarding the psychological factor: A historical reconciliation would be necessary, where there was a precondition that we should fully grasp one another's problems and ways of thinking, that we should have empathy with one another. If the Slovaks and the Romanians try to grasp fully the Hungarian situation, what Trianon meant for us, what the traumas, the historical blows to this country during various dictatorships meant, and that it has not been possible to recover from these to this very day, then obviously there will be a rapprochement between us. However, we must also imagine ourselves, for example, in the situation of the Slovaks, who did not have an independent state for centuries -- that this as well is a bad situation, it influences the current political forces and public opinion. This is what we must grasp. If we jointly comprehend fully one another's traumas we will be able to understand one another and it will become clearer to us that we in this region are interdependent. We should not work against one another but hand in hand when building the future, the Europe of regions where the borders will not have any significance, and where we can prosper to one another's benefit and to our benefit.
