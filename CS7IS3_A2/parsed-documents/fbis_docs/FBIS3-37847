The main goal of today is to prevent another aggravation of the situation in Bosnia, Russian Special Presidential Representative, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference in the Moscow airport "Sheremetievo-2" after his arrival from Germany today. Churkin said the main outcome of a meeting between representatives of the UN, EU [European Union], Russia, the US and Canada in Bonn is the creation of "a political coalition for the settlement of the conflict in Bosnia." He added that meetings of this kind will be continued. "The experience demonstrates that such a meeting can be convoked within 24 hours," he said. The diplomat put a special emphasis on the fact that the Bosnian crisis was attended on the highest level both in Russia and other countries. "This creates pre-conditions for pushing the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a peaceful settlement. However, the last word rests with them," he said. Speaking on the transfer of the Russian battalion within the UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia to Sarajevo, the deputy minister said "their security cannot be guaranteed by 100% as they serve in the most dangerous area, on the line separating Serb and Moslem armed formations." "Security of Russian servicemen is our priority. We have done our best to politically guarantee their security," Churkin said. In his opinion, there is no need for a stronger Russian contingent in the region so far. "However, we need to prepare an additional contingent. As soon as a ceasefire is established in Bosnia, Russia will need to reinforce its peacekeepers," he was quoted as saying. Churkin said he was satisfied with the contacts with the Serb political leadership and military command. "Russia lays no claims to the Serb side which solved issues of deblockading Sarajevo very flexibly," the diplomat stated. Churkin said Russia's relations with the NATO "may change only for the better." "The present crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a lesson for all of us. It must be evident for the Western partners that Russia's positions in Europe are highly influential," he said. In his speech, Churkin warned against euphoria. "The situation in Bosnia remains tense. There are many dangers. However, it is important not to slow down the pace and achieve a peaceful settlement. If no settlement follows, the present psychologically favorable moment may be missed," he said. Asked whether Yeltsin's initiative to convoke a summit of five world's leading nations interested in settlement in Bosnia could come off, Churkin pointed out that "it is too early to speak of this seriously." "There are many variants of meetings with the participation of Russia and other states involved in the peaceful settlement, including those on the highest level," he said. However, no specific proposals have been made so far, Churkin added.
