"We demand an apology from the US government over the involvement of its two diplomatic staff in the crime of drug trafficking," said members of the group, which claims to belong to the Front for Indonesian Youths Saviour. One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Muslim world and was always forcing its interests on others. "America, out... America, AIDS ...America, narcotics ..." the crowd alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging of the two embassy staff. The crowd, which according to police estimates numbered 2,000 people, delivered a statement to the US Embassy. The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment. The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from Washington. Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-populated nation, to open ties with Israel.
