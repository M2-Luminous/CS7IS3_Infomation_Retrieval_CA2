The Society for Threatened Peoples organized the vigils in front of the embassies of Great Britain, Russia, and the United States, as well as other places. The Society says that about 400 people joined the demonstrations. Tilman Zuelch, chairman of the Society, demanded the calling of a special session of the North Atlantic council. He stressed that "the ending of the genocide in Bosnia should not be left to the United Nations any longer." Without NATO intervention the 70,000 trapped Bosnians in Gorazde will be "destroyed" by Serb troops. In addition, Zuelch demanded a special Bundestag session on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
