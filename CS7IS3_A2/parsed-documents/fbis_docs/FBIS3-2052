The ministries, including major economic decision-makers, told the National Conference on Poverty Reduction that they will continue to support economic and social development in poor areas, making water, electricity, education, roads and telecommunications services available to China's 80 million poverty-stricken citizens. Chen Yaobang, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission (SPC), said that SPC will continue to give priority to the poor areas in industrial and agricultural planning, investment allocation and material distribution. Most of the 80 million poor live in remote mountainous regions, plateau areas and remote deserts, making it an arduous task to produce enough food, have adequate drinking water and access to electricity, and provide education and health services. Despite the difficulties, the minister said he is optimistic about the completion of the poverty reduction plan. The experience China has gained from past poverty reduction efforts, the growing awareness of the whole society and expanding international cooperation, will help fulfill the task. Vice-minister of Finance Li Yanling promised to increase investment to the best of the ministry's ability. According to Vice-Minister of Power Industry Lu Yancha, 120 million people had no access to electric power by 1992. Under a plan drawn up by the ministry, the majority of all the towns and villages will have access to electric power, making it available to 95 percent of rural families. Vice-Minister of Communications Li Juchang said that inaccessibility is one of the major causes for the backwardness in poverty-stricken areas. The huge potential for economic development in China's vast poor areas, which are rich in land, mineral, forest, labor and tourism resources, cannot be tapped without convenient communications, the minister said. Vice-Minister of Water Resources Zhou Wenzhi promised that water conservancy departments will step up the construction of water supply projects in rural areas and work hard to complete the task set by the central government to solve the drinking water shortage for the majority of the poor and their domestic animals. Officials from other ministries, such as the Ministry of Telecommunications, the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Labor, also announced their plans to help the poor areas.
