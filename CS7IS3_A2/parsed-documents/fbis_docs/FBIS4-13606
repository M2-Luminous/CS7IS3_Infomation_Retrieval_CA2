The paper emphasizes the fate of the Palestinian and Iranian organizations and of other extremist movements such as the Kurdish Workers Party. During the meetings over the past few weeks, the United States reviewed a list prepared by the CIA of hundreds of leaders and members it claimed to be terrorists. It asked Damascus to define its stance on these members either by deporting them from Syria, arresting some of them, or handing over others to Western countries on terrorist charges that go back to the mid sixties. The U.S. Congress asked the U.S. Administration to apply pressure on Syria to normalize ties with the Zionists in return for striking Syria off the list of countries supporting terrorism and to hand over several leaders of organizations labelled extremist to stand trial in U.S. federal courts, including Ahmad Jibril, Abu-Nidal, and approximately 70 other Palestinians.
