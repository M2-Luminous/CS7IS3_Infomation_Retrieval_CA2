City Smog Guidelines Exceeded Twenty-Four Times Pollution guidelines have been violated 24 times in Cape Town so far this year, says medical officer of health Michael Popkiss. Whether smog is visible depends on weather conditions, when warm air traps pollutants in a process known as inversion. But even if pollution is not visible, it is there--and suspicion is directed mainly at petrol-driven engines and wood-burning in areas without electricity. ``The only way to reduce air pollution is to get it at source, and you can do that only by making cars with cleaner-burning engines, with catalytic converters and a proper fuel economy system,'' said Dr. Popkiss. He said unleaded petrol was a prerequisite for cleaner air--but warned that using unleaded petrol in cars without catalytic converters could worsen air pollution. However, unleaded petrol and catalytic converters were not enough. ``You have to stop cars ... and for this you need a better system of public transport.'' The solution is to increase drastically the cost of using private cars to raise funds for public transport, says a city council report. A city planner's draft report on a future public transport policy said that even if traffic growth increased more slowly, travelling speeds would drop by about 40 percent as congestion worsened. ``The detrimental impacts on the health of Cape Town people and tourism, worth about R1,4 billion a year, will be severe.'' The report said Cape Town had to focus on public transport if it was to become one of the great cities of the world. This could be done by introducing policies on parking provision and fees, planning and development. ``Such a policy will undoubtedly be unpopular with many because for public transport to succeed, the playing fields must be levelled and motorists must start to pay the true cost of using cars.'' ``Motoring will become more expensive and the revenue collected should be used to finance public transport improvements.'' A metropolitan transport authority ``with sufficient statutory power, accountability and financial clout'' was needed to coordinate bus, rail, and minibus taxi services. The population of metropolitan Cape Town was growing by about three percent a year and most new residents would be poor people living on the periphery of the city. The number of travellers, and distances travelled, would increase dramatically. Most would have to use public transport. A policy was needed to ensure public transport was affordable by all and offered an attractive alternative to car commuters. ``It is likely spending in the new South Africa will focus on people's basic needs--housing, jobs, education and health.'' ``Convenient, affordable and efficient transport will be essential in restructuring the apartheid city, but given the backlog of needs the construction of transport facilities is likely to be a low priority on the government's shopping list,'' the report said. Proposed policies included: - The city council supporting the principle that the motorist should meet the true cost of car commuting, and funds raised in this way be used to subsidise public transport. - The council investigates and promotes measures to dissuade commuting in single-occupant vehicles. - The council recognises the urgent need to improve public transport termini. - Subject to availability of funds, the council will give priority to the provision of public transport facilities. - A parking policy that encourages use of public transport. - A review of public transport subsidies to benefit users. - Support and promotion of high-density development along public transport routes. City planner Neville Riley and medical officer of health Michael Popkiss said the report should be put to the metropolitan transport advisory board and the Western Cape Economic Development Forum for discussion.
