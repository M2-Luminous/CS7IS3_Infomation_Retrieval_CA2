Stressing that Turkey wants stability in the Balkans and in Europe, Demirel indicated that once the two-year human shame in Bosnia-Herzegovina is eradicated, the region will enter a new cooperation environment. This morning Demirel held a news conference in Bucharest where he is on an official visit. TRT correspondent Ertugrul Bulent Danaci reports from Bucharest: [Danaci] Demirel held a news conference at the Turkish Embassy in Bucharest on the second day of his visit and answered Turkish correspondents' questions. Pointing out that his contacts in Bucharest were very favorable, Demirel stated that Turkey and Romania have no problems and that a state-to-state and people-to-people friendship exists between the two countries. Explaining that the infrastructure which will constitute the basis of the bilateral relations has been in preparation for the last four years, Demirel recalled that several agreements were signed within this framework. Demirel said that Turkey, a Balkan country and therefore a European country, aspires to a peaceful solution to the problems within the Balkan countries. Indicating that today Europe is faced with a security issue, Demirel said that the CSCE is part of this issue and that the CSCE could not function as expected during the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation. Pointing to raised hopes in terms of things running smoothly in the world after the Soviet Union's dissolution, Demirel recalled that this was not achieved. In spite of all this, Demirel stressed, regional countries should work toward a composed and long-term cooperation for the happiness of their people. Within this framework, Demirel added, Turkey and Romania have good cooperation. Recalling that Turkey supports Romania's inclusion in the European organizations, Demirel noted that Romania was the first country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO. Wishing Romania success in its efforts toward democracy and market economy, Demirel said that Turkey and Romania have good relations within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [BSEC]. Demirel announced that following his meetings with the concerned heads of state, he would call for a BSEC summit meeting. Answering a reporter's question on Turkey's depreciation by international financial institution, Demirel said that he cannot comment on Turkey's credit points dropping from 3B to 2B, since it was meaningless, and added that credits to be extended to Turkey should not be measured according to the B's. Demirel said: God help us if we are indexed to the B's. Turkey has difficulties and we have to accept them. Would we not have any difficulties if we had not dropped from 3B to 2B? I think that you should all believe that we are going to overcome these difficulties. Turkey will overcome all these difficulties. Demirel will continue with his contacts in Bucharest in the afternoon.
