FBIS4-26 "cr00000021894001" 13 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-049--JAPAN JAPAN: Changing Views of Bureaucrats on Japan-U.S. Relations JAPAN: Changing Views of Bureaucrats on Japan-U.S. Relations SUMMARY: In a number of recent press articles, several Japanese academics and journalists offered assessments of the changing views of the Japan-U.S. relationship within the Japanese bureaucracy. All of those surveyed agreed that Japan's new generation of bureaucrats view the United States differently from their elders. Several writers asserted that the new generation of bureaucrats believes it is time for Japan to move away from its close association with the United States and toward closer ties with Asia. Focusing on how negotiators from the ranks of Japan's bureaucracy took the unprecedented step of saying "no" to the United States in the recently-broken off U.S.-Japan framework talks, several academics and journalists analyzed the changing views of these bureaucrats toward Japan-U.S. relations. None of the writers expressed surprise over the reaction to the breakdown of the framework talks by Japan's negotiators who, according to the 13 February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, showed "pride, confidence, and delight that they had defeated [sic] the United States for the first time in trade negotiations." Bureaucrats' Reliance on Economic Theory - Writing in the 9 February ASAHI SHIMBUN, Motoshige Ito, a Tokyo University economics professor, asserted that Japan's bureaucrats based their negative response to U.S. demands on what he referred to as the "internationally recognized economic theory" that numerical targets will lead to managed rather than free trade. He said that "the contemporary mid-level bureaucrats who are responsible for working- level negotiations" no longer ignore economic theory in trade negotiations. Unlike their predecessors, who, he claimed, believed in strong government economic intervention, contemporary bureaucrats understand and apply in their arguments "internationally recognized economic theory, which they learned while studying in U.S. graduate schools." This change in the thinking of bureaucrats "will be an important factor in Japan's trade negotiations over the long run," Ito observed. Ito criticized the U.S. Government for allegedly not following economic theory "that is prevalent in American universities." Contrary to the above trend among Japanese Government officials, he wrote, the U.S. Government "appears to be moving away from arguments based on economic theory." Ito cited numerical targets as one example, claiming that "no authoritative economists" in the United States support numerical targets. Generational Change, Emergence of Multilateralism - Former Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official Yukio Okamoto, writing in the 11 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, pointed to a "generational change" among Japanese negotiators as one reason they could say "no" to the United States. He observed that the present generation of bureaucrats "do not feel a debt to the United States" for its postwar assistance to Japan. This "diminished appreciation of past favors," combined with "accumulated frustrations from many years of dealing with what, in their view, has been an excessively demanding United States," is a factor that is "small but impossible to overlook" in the politics of negotiations. Alongside younger bureaucrats "diminished appreciation" of the United States, there is also reportedly a trend toward a more global Japanese approach to diplomacy. According to an article by Tokyo University political science professor Takashi Inoguchi in the 22 February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Japanese MOFA bureaucrats have been steadily "globalizing" Japan's diplomacy since the collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party government last year. According to Inoguchi, they are beginning to treat the Japan-U.S. relationship as just "one element" in the overall "formation of global economic and security rules." Although the Japanese-U.S. relationship is still "preeminent," Inoguchi observed, the relationship has "changed in quality" and is likely to be handled from a "multilateral perspective." In a similar vein, ASAHI SHIMBUN economic reporter Kenji Takeuchi in a 9 February article pointed to the emergence within the Japanese bureaucracy of a "multilateralist faction," which maintains that Japan should shift the focus of its trade policy from Japan-U.S. bilateral trade to trade with other countries. According to Takeuchi, contemporary Japanese bureaucrats prefer multilateral negotiations to bilateral talks with the United States because multilateral talks are more "open" and based on "universal rules." Younger Bureaucrats Influenced by Pan-Asianist Arguments - Writing in the 15 March issue of EKONOMISUTO, Kenji Suzuki, a MAINICHI SHIMBUN editorial staff writer, contended that the breakdown of the framework talks was a "logical consequence" of the views of young Japanese bureaucrats, who are "cool" toward the United States and "inclined" toward Asia. Suzuki went on to say that the views of Kazuo Ogura, former director general of MOFA's Economic Affairs Bureau, who is now ambassador-designate to Vietnam, have provided the theoretical grounds for the emergence of "Pan- Asianism, or nationalism under the name of Pan-Asianism," among young bureaucrats. He noted that, while Ogura carefully avoids the term "kenbei" (dislike of the United States) and "openly emphasizes" the desirability of cooperation with the United States, his writings have "provoked nationalism" among young bureaucrats, "even though they are not the mainstream views in MOFA." Suzuki claimed that Ogura's articles have attracted young MOFA bureaucrats chiefly because he focuses on the "cultural" aspects of Japan's foreign relations rather than "technical" aspects of security and economic relations, as many bureaucrats allegedly did in the past. He noted in particular that two of Ogura's articles- -"Crack Between the Empire of Ideas and the Lost People" published in the June 1991 GAIKO FORUM, and "For Restoration of the Rights of Asia" published in the July 1993 CHUO KORON -- have influenced young bureaucrats. In the GAIKO FORUM article, Suzuki observed, Ogura termed U.S. demands put forth in trade negotiations as an attempt to make Japan its "mental colony" by forcing the Japanese to "have the same sense of values as Americans." In the CHUO KORON article, Suzuki wrote, Ogura called for restoring the "tradition and spirit of Asia," since "Western civilization--an endless pursuit of greed and self-assertion--cannot resolve the world's problems." Suzuki also claimed that the best-selling book written by Ichiro Ozawa, co- leader of the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Blueprint For Building a New Japan--"which has been enthusiastically read" by many young bureaucrats--has been used by them as a source of "Pan-Asian" inspiration. To support his conclusion about the thrust of Ozawa's book, Suzuki cited the passage in the book, in which Ozawa calls for a shift from "Western to Oriental values." Suzuki asserted that "most" young diplomats are "fed up with negotiations with the United States, which give working-level bureaucrats nothing but many troubles and pain" and are influenced by the idea of "returning to Asia." He noted that young diplomats now want to be assigned to Asia, where they feel "much more comfortable," rather than serve in the United States. According to Suzuki, this "inclination" is spreading to other ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. He claimed that the young diplomats often say: "If things do not work with the United States, there is always Asia." (Author: Innes.
