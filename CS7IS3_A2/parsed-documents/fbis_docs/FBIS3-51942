The police repression came on the heels of a government announcement at midnight on Tuesday of a package of measures to benefit the transportation workers. The workers rejected the offer as insufficient and threatened to strengthen their protests against fuel prices. Roberto Gonzalez, leader of the National Transportation Commission (CNT), denounced the arrest of "more than 100 companeros," while the Sandinist Radio Ya reported 299 arrests. Government and police authorities have yet to confirm the figures. Bus transportation was at a total standstill in the capital and various other locations around the country today. Some people erected barricades with bricks removed from the streets in parts of the city, reporters have confirmed. The largest barricades were erected in the eastern part of the capital opposite the Parrales Vallejos Bus Cooperative, whose members are wearing masks to avoid being identified by the authorities. The cooperative members are apparently unarmed. Riot police have been discreetly deployed in different parts of the capital to keep the peace. Despite the blockades erected in three parts of the capital, the flow of private vehicles is normal. Supermarkets, banks, and businesses have kept doors open, but few people are on the streets. Finance Minister Emilio Pereira asked that order be reestablished and said that "a country cannot be held hostage." He accused transportation workers of wanting to "stop the vehicle called Nicaragua," thus preventing the nation from overcoming its current serious economic stagnation. Pereira reiterated the government's decision -- announced last night -- to freeze the price of gasoline, currently at $2.35 per gallon ($3.78 liter), until April. However, transportation owners demand that the price of fuel be reduced to the level of Central American prices, which are below $2.00 per gallon. The government also froze the price of kerosene and butane gas until April and decided to reduce the price of diesel to the price that existed in June 1993. The finance minister also announced the delivery of coupons to taxi drivers and the elimination of the tax on license plates and traffic permits. Government authorities called on transportation workers to form a transportation commission so a transportation law can be drafted quickly, as is demanded by the CNT, which is promoting the strike. With these provisions, according to Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil, "there is no reason to prolong the strike," although it seems to be getting worse, according to the strike leaders. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta warned last night that the Riot Police, Special Disarmament Brigades (BED), and other security corps have been deployed to safeguard order.
