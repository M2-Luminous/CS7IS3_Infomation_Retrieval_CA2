He said: The question of the RM8 billion [Malaysian currency] (RM2.7; U.S.$1) airport is irrelevant. Whether it will be ready in time is not the issue because the reports were very damaging to the nation and its leaders. It is a very serious issue, especially when it involved leaders, including the prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed. Dr Ling commenting on the cabinet decision Friday to stop giving new contracts to British companies, particularly those involving government aid or assistance. Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who announced the decision, said that all agreements with British companies that had been signed would be honoured. Dr Ling said it was very disappointing that the media in Britain acted in such an irresponsible manner towards the leaders of a friendly trading nation with which it had historical ties. He said the government was right in imposing the sanction against British companies, especially when the reports were disgusting and untrue. Asked about the future of the Anglo-Japanese airport consortium (AJAC) involved in the construction of the airport, he said: The A (Anglo) might be out while the J (Japanese) will remain. The modern airport, equipped with the latest facilities, was scheduled for completion in 1997. Dr Ling also noted that as far as his ministry was concerned British companies would not be offered projects.
