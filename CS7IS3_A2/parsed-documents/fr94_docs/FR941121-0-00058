FR941121-0-00058 FR941121-0-00008 Also changed under the administrative amendments provisions of the rule is the list of actions qualifying as administrative amendments (ยง71.26(c)(1)). A new provision (ยง71.26(c)(1)(v)) allows certain additional permit revisions to be treated as administrative amendments provided that the Administrator determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a proposed revision is similar to those qualifying actions already specifically listed. The new provision is based upon a similar provision in the part 70 rule and is a response to certain commenters requests for additional flexibility to make relatively insignificant changes at an early reductions source without having to wait for a lengthy EPA approval process. Under the new provision, EPA would be able to process through administrative amendment procedures certain changes not listed in paragraphs ยง71.26(c)(1)(i) through (iv) but which are ministerial in nature and therefore do not require the exercise of judgment on the part of EPA, or review by the public or affected States. 5. Another proposed provision deleted in the final rule was the requirement that specialty permit applications contain a statement indicating the source's compliance status with any applicable enhanced monitoring and compliance certification requirements of the Act. This provision was included in the proposal because a similar provision appears in the part 70 rule. However, upon further reflection, EPA has realized that the provision is not relevant to early reductions permit applications. This specialty permit program focuses narrowly on implementing the Early Reductions Program for a defined early reductions source and associated HAP emissions, and within that context the only monitoring and compliance certification requirements applicable to the early reductions source will be those delineated in the specialty permit issued later to the participating company. Each specialty permit will implement the Act directive to provide for enhanced monitoring on major sources by specifying monitoring requirements tailored to the early reductions source and consistent with the characteristics of the Early Reductions Program. Compliance certification requirements also will be imposed to comply with title V of the Act. However, it is inappropriate to ask a source to discuss, in the permit application, its compliance status for these requirements because they do not yet exist. In the proposed rule preamble, EPA requested comment on whether the final early reductions permits rule should contain procedures for minor permit revisions. Such procedures would be used to process changes that could not be processed as administrative amendments but which encompass relatively minor changes to the source or its operation and, therefore, would not warrant the longer (12 month) review and issuance process allotted to significant source changes. Two commenters requested that EPA include minor permit revision procedures in the final rule to provide sources the ability to make certain changes in the early reductions source quickly, which they consider to be key to remaining competitive within their respective industries. The EPA has carefully considered the commenters' requests for a more expedited permit revision procedure, and has decided not to include such a procedure at this time. There are two primary reasons for this decision. First, the part 70 permit revision procedures are currently the subject of litigation in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In part as a response to this litigation, EPA has proposed revisions to these part 70 procedures. The current uncertainty over EPA's legal discretion to provide for expeditious permit revision procedures cautions against providing for any such procedures here in this final rule. Second, as stated in the preamble to the proposal of this rule, EPA believes the nature of these specialty permits, containing limitations that are uniquely tailored to the facility, should reduce the need for permit revisions. Another factor that deemphasizes the need for a more expedited revision procedure is the fact that a specialty permit will, relatively soon after permit issuance, be transferred to the jurisdiction of the State, following which it will be subject to the revision procedures of the State program. The EPA may in the future decide to revise this rule to provide more expedited procedures for minor permit revisions. However, EPA currently intends await the outcome of the revisions to part 70 before taking any such action. As noted earlier, this notice also contains amendments to the Early Reductions Rule. One of the amendments, proposed along with the early reductions permits proposal, is promulgated without change and appends to enforceable commitments made under the Early Reductions Program the information on emission reduction measures employed to achieve early reductions. Such information is required as part of a participant's post-reduction emission demonstration. The other amendments mirror the changes described in item 1 of the above list pertaining to the post-reduction emissions demonstration. These amendments make the Early Reductions Rule consistent with the permits rule promulgated in this notice.
