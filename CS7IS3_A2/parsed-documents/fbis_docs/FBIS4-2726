Gao Dezhan pointed out: Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. As the suburban-type agriculture holds a particularly important position in Tianjin's entire economy, we should all the more attach great importance to it. We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference and make sure that we truly attach importance to agriculture and exert efforts to make agriculture and rural work successful. At present, we should concentrate on spring plowing, spring sowing, and wheat field management, conquer the drought, and strive for a good harvest this year to make contributions to Tianjin's reform, development, and stability. During a discussion, Gao Dezhan and the participants conscientiously analyzed Tianjin's current development of agricultural production and rural economy and studied ways to implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference rapidly. He said: The rural work conference recently held by the party Central Committee was a very important conference. Conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the conference not only has very important significance in the endeavor to achieve success in agriculture and rural work for this year and for some time to come, but, in particular, it also has important immediate significance in accomplishing the general task of the work of the entire party, promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development, and safeguarding social stability. We must conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's reality, make earnest efforts and adopt effective measures to address the existing problems and weak links and promote Tianjin's agriculture and rural work with great efforts. Gao Dezhan said: To successfully implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, the municipal party committee held a meeting of secretary and deputy secretaries to study and arrange this work, which, it decided, will be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, beginning immediately, we will conduct investigation and study on Tianjin's agricultural production and existing problems and concentrate efforts on spring plowing. In the second stage, we will hold a municipal rural work conference in early April to tackle some fundamental problems in line with the guidelines of the central rural work conference and Tianjin's reality. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Tianjin has won great achievements in agriculture and rural work over the past few years, but to win greater development in the new situation of establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly still requires large amounts of painstaking work. We should first solve well ideological problems and acquire a new understanding of the position of agriculture as the foundation not only of the national economy but also of reform, development, and stability. Reform and development need a stable social and economic environment, which first depends on the stability and development of agriculture and rural areas, the ample supplies of farm and sideline products, and the basic stability of the market. As ours is a suburban-type agriculture, we should all the more attach importance to the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and we also have the conditions to make a success of it. The "vegetable basket" is the key link of the suburban-type agriculture. We should strive to raise the quality, improve the efficiency, and expand the scale of this type of agriculture. Agriculture should be restructured on the premise that the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops is stabilized. To increase the income of peasants, we should rely both on the development of township enterprises and diverse production and on the great development of agriculture and rural economy. Gao Dezhan pointed out: The basic task of Tianjin's agriculture and rural work for this year is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference and achieve success in 1) ensuring the production and supplies of grain, cotton, edible oil, and the "vegetable basket," 2) developing the rural economy in all sectors to increase peasants' income, 3) strengthening rural spiritual civilization and maintaining rural social stability, and 4) further improving rural grass-roots organizations. Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further strengthen party leadership over agriculture and rural work. Ideological understanding and all work should be in place. When work is not in place, we cannot say that we have attached importance to or strengthened leadership over agriculture and rural work. We should conscientiously institute the system of responsibility for work targets and assign tasks and targets to lower levels and to every person. Districts and counties engaged in agriculture should hold responsibility for the planting areas, output, and peasants' income. Success in agriculture is a task for the entire society. All trades and professions should attach importance to and support agriculture, voluntarily do practical work for agricultural development, and serve it well. We should send a group of cadres to rural areas as soon as possible to help with their work. Gao Dezhan particularly emphasized: As we have entered the crucial period for agricultural production, we should seize the right farming season and concentrate efforts on stabilizing the areas sown with grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops and on winter wheat management, spring plowing, and spring sowing. We should mobilize the masses to combat drought to plant crops and protect seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest of summer grain and a bumper harvest for the whole year. The municipal party committee and government decided to adopt resolute measures in the near future to make sure that rural comrades have sufficient time and energy for spring farming. Pertinent departments of the municipality should be determined to reduce meetings and go down to rural areas to help solve problems. Responsible comrades of the districts and counties engaged in agriculture should avoid going out of town. They should devote more time to rural areas and concentrate on the current spring farming. Fang Fengyou, standing committee member of the municipal party committee and director of its organization department; and Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general of the municipal party committee; participated in the investigation and study activities.
