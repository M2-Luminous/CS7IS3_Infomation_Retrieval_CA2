To be fair to Saparmurad Turkmenbas, there wasn't a single question which gave him cause for self-justification or self-congratulation. The only quality which he did permit himself was to be frank and to detailed. It is no coincidence that he frequently talked about the Niyazov of old -- the communist who sincerely believed in the party's ideals and then believed in Gorbachev and perestroyka. What has changed his attitude toward the things that he held sacred? Where is that dividing line between his past and present? How did this happen and how quickly was it achieved? Why is Turkmenistan, which was the last to leave the USSR and which, incidentally, made no efforts to rock it, now rejecting the very idea of any superstructure -- be it political, economic, or humanitarian? Furthermore, Turkmenistan has been putting forward initiatives to which others have been affiliating. Whereas the Ashgabat meeting of CIS heads of state determined the consultative nature of the Commonwealth and its voluntary strategy, the recent Moscow meeting was a reflection of the practical approach, as observers could not fail to notice. In any event the new consultative structure -- an economic commission in place of the proposed suprastate committee -- was proposed by Turkmenistan and all the other members of the economic union voted for it. So what kind of country is Turkmenistan -- visited by Le Pen and Mitterrand, a magnet for where Western investors, where the Constitution proclaims a secular democratic system, where there are portraits of the president wherever you go, and where his picture appears on the currency? There are questions to be answered there. There are answers, too. But how would you like us to develop? Yesterday it was "with Lenin in mind," but today: What? Nature abhors a vacuum. Way back, we drove out religion; then we exalted communism; and now we want democracy. And where do we want it -- in the East? Yes, the president agrees. "The East is a subtle thing." He recalled how in India he was presented with a figure of a smiling man. Turn it round and you are holding a saber in your hand... But to return to the Politburo.... Gorbachev himself admitted that there were people there who would embrace you and at the same time, perhaps, wanted to strangle you.... Now try to guess which place is more enigmatic, the East or the West? And in what way? People are people everywhere and, as we know, there are no bad peoples. There are unfortunate people. Take the Turkmens: They used to produce vast amounts of oil and gas, but still could not "force" a school out of the USSR State Planning Committee without being subjected to insults. There is still no drinking water in the west of the Republic, where they are presently holding the fourth international tender to prospect for hydrocarbons (the country is fourth in the world). So what does this mean -- are we to go back under one roof again, the president asked himself? We do not deny the merits of the system, he said, which ensured us universal education and gave us access to Russian culture and the cultures of other peoples. We do not deny the obvious, he said, and that means first and foremost the indissoluble spiritual link between our peoples. But we are opposed to everything that is artificial because we have seen from our experience that it cannot exist on living soil where real people live. How does the "life" of the portraits tally with that claim? Do not bother to look for a hidden oriental meaning in this, Niyazov said. If a colossus such as Lenin has been toppled, the time will come when I, a mere mortal, will also be cast down. What private property owner am I foisting my portrait on? What factory owner am I forcing to name his factory after me? He would laugh, and that would be that. Furthermore, Niyazov, in his own words, is not foisting anything on anybody right now. He tried to ban the celebration of his birthday, but the Assembly unanimously turned down his request. Niyazov, who in eight years has not arrested a single dissident and who has not used the least force against anyone, reasonably reserves to himself the right to not to ban anything, including his own portrait. However, he does not hide the fact that he sees some point in creating the image of a national leader, whoever it may be. "Until they acquire peace and material sufficiency, the people must believe in someone and something. Otherwise there will be chaos." That is the Turkmen president's main creed, which he used as the basis of his main program "Ten Years of Stability." A transitional period and a popular consciousness unprepared for the market are the alpha and omega of his political activity. If you bear in mind the kind of political cocktail that this consciousness entails in the post-communist East, it is not hard to understand Niyazov's logic: Like a pharmacist, he is forced to weigh all the moods in society in his political scales. "Do you think that everything has gone smoothly here?" he asked his guests. "Not at all. Ashgabat and Nebitdag have experienced their first-ever interethnic pogroms. The intelligentsia held rallies to defend the exclusive right of the national language." A transition from social to private ownership or vice versa is, of course, very difficult. That is why the transitional period is so important. In Turkmenistan this means a phased transition to different forms of ownership, the privatization of enterprises -- the small ones first, and then the large ones -- and the flotation of leading sectors of the economy. But an outlet into the world market was needed for gas products -- the main national product, and one has been found. At the moment it is still at the planning stage, admittedly, but these are very important plans. One gas pipeline will go via Iran and Turkey to Europe, another via China to Japan. The East and Asia will be linked by a transcontinental railroad through Turkmenistan. It is already being built, and quite quickly, too. However, everything takes time. "We are not crowing about our successes," the president said. "We are proud of our stability and of the bridges that we have built with the people through the provision of free gas, water, and electricity, and of our consistent social policy. As for everything else, matters are not going very well here -- which is true of everyone. So that we are no better than anyone else." As for the feature, which distinguishes him from the rest, he says that it is the fact that he has been working with his team since day one of the proclamation of independence. Indeed, Niyazov has replaced virtually no one in that time because he believes that, first, you do not changes horses in midstream and second, change for change's sake is absurd. Here, too, he is frank, and asserts that when you cannot emerge from the womb of socialism and become a marketeer overnight. For that you need property, and that is true even of a high-ranking official. "You want people to criticize me," he told the journalists. "But you try to make them do that when everyone is still afraid for his own job -- a fear dating back to the times of `communism' -- and is thus afraid for the future of his family and children too." But why criticize without genuine cause? There are arguments within Niyazov's cabinet, but no one has any intention of airing them in the press. That would be ridiculous. Judging by how attentively the journalists listened and the way that their facial expressions changed, you could tell that Saparmurad Niyazov's words had an effect on them. In any event the Moscow visitors were convinced that Turkmenistan is indeed going its own road, that peace reigns here, and that this is the most valuable thing of all....
