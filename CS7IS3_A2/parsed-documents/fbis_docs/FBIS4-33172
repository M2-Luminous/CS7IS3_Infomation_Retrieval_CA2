FBIS4-33172 "drlat107_a_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba New Sea, Air Transportation Fees in Effect 1 Jun New Sea, Air Transportation Fees in Effect 1 Jun FL0206113094 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 1 Jun 94 FL0206113094 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] Beginning today, new sea and air transportation fees went into effect nationwide following the 31 May publication of Resolution 694 of the Ministry of Finances and Prices in the Official Gazette. The resolution points out that children younger than two years of age travel free -- proof of age is required. It also stipulates that children between two and 12 years of age will pay 50 percent of the fee, in other words, half the cost -- proof of age is required. Beginning today, a Havana-Santiago de Cuba ticket costs 90 pesos, and a Havana-Baracoa ticket costs 108 pesos. Other examples: a ticket to Camaguey costs 72 pesos, and a ticket to Isle of Youth is 22 pesos. The hovercraft service between Batabano and Nueva Gerona is 11 pesos for adults and 7 pesos for children. The maximum luggage weight included in the ticket price is 20 kilograms. Excess luggage, in maritime transportation, will cost two pesos for each additional kilogram. It is important for the people to be aware that this measure, which is part of the effort to correct the national finances, is not enough to cover the subsidy which the state gives to the national aviation carrier in order to serve the population. Air transportation of tourists accrues hard currency, yet this is not enough to cover the expenses incurred in transportation services for the people.
