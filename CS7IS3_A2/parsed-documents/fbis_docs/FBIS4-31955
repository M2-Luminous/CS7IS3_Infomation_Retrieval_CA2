The statement was prompted by a NEW YORK TIMES report from Sarajevo alleging that an "ethnic cleansing" campaign in Banja Luka in western Bosnia-Herzegovina has intensified and that more than 3,000 Moslems and Croats have fled the town under Serb pressure in the past two months. The U.N. secretary-general's spokesman Joe Sills said that a Moslem offensive had abated after having raged for weeks and that the truce signed by Bosnia's belligerents at Geneva on June 8 was holding in the main, except for fierce fighting around Bihac in the west between rival Moslem factions loyal to hardliner Alija Izetbegovic and his moderate opponent Fikret Abdic. Abdic and his supporters rebelled against Izetbegovic's war-mongering policy and last autumn proclaimed their autonomous province of western Bosnia and signed peace accords with Bosnian Serbs and Croats. Sills said that Bosnian Serb forces had been holding a Nordic medical convoy near Rogatica, southeast of Sarajevo, for the past three days in violation of an agreement on free passage throughout Bosnian territory. Asked if it was true that the convoy had refused to submit to a routine check, Sills replied that, according to his information, the Serbs were asking for more than a routine check, which he said was giving rise to concern.
