The delegates returned to their communities to explain the contents of the document. According to reports obtained here, the analysis process in the Zapatist communities will begin during the weekend. EZLN delegates have told this newspaper the discussion in the communities will take some time, because the wording of the commitments is "complicated," and the communities are very distant. At the end of the first phase of the internal consultation, they reiterated their concern over the "continuity" of the commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas, in light of the upcoming change of the federal executive. "We do not know if the proposals will be complied with by Salinas' successor," the delegates have argued. CCRI representatives have considered the federal government's compliance will be a fundamental "condition" for true peace in Chiapas. Committee delegates Pedro, Romeo, Carlos, and Emanuel have said the consultation in the communities will take some time, because the wording of the government commitments is "complicated," and the Zapatist communities are very distant. About 300 CCRI representatives who participated in the first phase of the study began returning gradually to their hometowns on 16 March. Meanwhile, the delegates have said the EZLN has not yet decided whether there will be a second phase of dialogue with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis or the manner in which the contents of the 32 peace commitments will be approved. During a short conversation in a CCRI-controlled area, the representatives have said the advancements of the consultation in its initial stage are minimum. The delegates have analyzed point by point the commitments for an honorable peace in Chiapas. "We are not in a hurry," and the most important thing is to understand the contents of the texts, they have said. Emanuel has remarked the Clandestine Committee has analyzed carefully the government commitments, "and if they are not fulfilled, we will continue the war. We are very tired." The Zapatist representatives have returned to their communities with the texts translated into Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Chol, and Tojolabal, so as to explain to children, youths, and elderly people the scope of the proposals. "They will say what they think, but we do not think the government will comply," he has said. It is necessary for all members of the communities to understand "there is nothing yet" from the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas; there is no agreement, he added. CCRI delegates have said, however, the EZLN is interested in the follow-up of the government commitments, given the change of president. "Salinas' departure is nearing, and we do not know if his successor will maintain his policies," Emanuel has said. Romeo has warned the federal government's compliance with the political and social requests is a fundamental "condition" for true peace in Chiapas. [LA JORNADA] What is going to happen with the weapons? [Romeo] The weapons. One can never surrender the weapons, but the government must meet the people's needs. This is the only thing for what we are asking; we are asking for at least for democracy. We want our rights to be considered. All our comrades, men, women, children, and elderly people are practically abandoned. "You are realizing how the regions and towns are; they are very screwed up. Just look at the roads, the pasture grounds, how pasture grounds grow on stony grounds. We want the government to hurry up. We can give the government a short term for meeting our needs. We want the government to supply for what we are asking, because we are dying. "Years and years of death. So far it would be better to die while fighting, but if the government meets its word, we would be glad. We want a real and lasting peace, not just words: We want deeds," Romeo has added. The delegates have returned to their communities, many of which are located four or five days away by foot. The initial stage in the communities will begin during the weekend, according to the CCRI.
