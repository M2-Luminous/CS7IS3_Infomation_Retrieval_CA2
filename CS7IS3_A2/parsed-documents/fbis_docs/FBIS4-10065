According to Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar, Honduras has promised an adequate solution, but any solution must always be within the law. Republican Congressmen have proposed the suspension of economic aid to Honduras as a means of pressuring for the solution of demands by U.S. citizens who have been victims of expropriations. They also asked that the United States oppose the granting of multilateral credits to governments that do not respect the rights of their citizens abroad. Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar reacted to the Republican Congressmen's proposal as follows. [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] The U.S. Congress is now debating the general issue of expropriation of property belonging to U.S. citizens abroad. Honduras falls in this group because there are a number of cases, apparently 10 or 11, in Honduras. We have asked the U.S. Government to give us some time to solve all these claims. You may recall that these claims are over four years old; they existed prior to our administration. They are very old claims. They are now pressing for a solution. The Honduran Government's position is that this is going to be solved appropriately, within the law, respecting the law, analyzing each case. Each case is different. It is possible that in some cases the claimants are correct, while in others they may not be. Another matter is that under international law, it is normal for foreign citizens who live in our country, when they feel unprotected, when justice is denied, or when there is a delay in the administration of justice, to appeal to their diplomatic missions and their corresponding governments to defend their interests. International law establishes this. [end recording] Although Honduras recognizes that some expropriations cases do exist, the foreign minister said not all U.S. citizens' complaints in Honduras are specifically related to this issue. [Begin recording] [Paz Aguilar] I would like to say that not all are expropriations cases. Some are disputes, some conflicts. These might be between Hondurans and U.S. citizens; these might be between the Honduran state and U.S. citizens. Therefore, each case must be analyzed. I believe whoever is right will win the case in our courts, as these are the only bodies that can bestow justice. [Unidentified reporter] Is there a time limit for Honduras to solve these cases? [Paz Aguilar] What we have said is this new government has barely taken office. We have not been in power for even 70 days. We said it would be unfair to sanction Honduras for events that occurred in the past. We are only asking for an opportunity; we are asking for some time to resolve these problems, within the law's framework. [end recording] Reports presented by Republicans to the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee suggest that visas be denied to foreigners who are deemed responsible for confiscating U.S. citizens' properties in their respective territories. The foreign minister was asked if this was related to the U.S. Embassy's decision to deny former Immigration Director [words indistinct] a visa. [Begin Paz Aguilar recording] These are merely [word indistinct] measures; they are pressure tactics. Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate that the right to grant a visa to enter a nation is that nation's option. That means the United States has every right to grant or deny a visa. Honduras can do the same, or, it does the same. It is the Honduran Government that decides if it grants a visa to a foreign citizens. [end recording] Honduras, along with Nicaraguan and Costa Rica, was singled out. There are 1,603 cases of the expropriation of U.S. citizens' property between the three countries.
