Other Considerations In addition, the following funding factor will be applied in determining funding of approved applications. A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications in a discretionary program, or favorable adjustment of the formula which determines the grant award in a formula grant program. It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. Funding Preference The statutory preference identified in section 767(b)(2) and the statutory preference identified in section 791(a) of the PHS Act have been combined in the following preference which will be applied to Allied Health Project Grants for fiscal year 1995: Preference shall be given to qualified applicants that_ (A) Expand and maintain first-year enrollment by not less than 10 percent over enrollments in base year 1992; or (B) Demonstrate that not less than 20 percent of the graduates of such training programs during the preceding 2-year period are working in medically underserved communities (high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities); or (C) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' The minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' were established in FY 1994 after public comment (59 FR 23889, dated May 9, 1994). The Administration is extending these minimum percentages in FY 1995. ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic year 1992&hyph;93 or academic year 1993&hyph;94, whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings. Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 15741, dated April 4, 1994. Information Requirements Provision Under section 791(b) of the Act, the Secretary may make an award under the Allied Health Project Grants only if the applicant for the award submits to the Secretary the following information: 1. A description of rotations or preceptorships for students, or clinical training programs for residents, that have the principal focus of providing health care to medically underserved communities.
