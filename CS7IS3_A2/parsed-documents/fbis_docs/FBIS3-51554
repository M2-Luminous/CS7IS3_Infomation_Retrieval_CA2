Lacayo met yesterday with members of the American Chamber of Commerce and affirmed that businessmen, rather than creating problems, think of opportunities for greater cooperation between government and business for the benefit of the country. The agenda for the meeting between Lacayo and the businessmen included topics such as finance, fiscal matters, laws for foreign investments, the labor code, and the attention public employees give to businessmen. When a reporter asked him if the four deputy presidency ministers were named to pave the way for his presidential campaign, he replied, somewhat annoyed, that "to talk of a campaign in 1994 is irresponsible. I hope I am not asked that question again." He was satisfied that the National Assembly began work with great stability, overcoming a year and a half of conflict. He also noted that a renewed Supreme Court of Justice will give a great boost to the Judicial Branch. Business leader Carlos Reynaldo Lacayo indicated that great stress was placed during the meeting on the need to promote investments so that at the start of 1996 "we will have a well consolidated free enterprise system." Banaexpo [expansion unknown] Manager Gilberto Wong stated that businessmen asked Lacayo for a general revision to allow banks more flexibility with fewer restrictions. The bankers demanded a nondiscriminatory banking system, "because we have watched with concern the large withdrawals by autonomous entities to be put into state banks." This measure, according to Wong, can cause serious inconveniences to the financial system, since it restricts credit and makes operations more costly.
