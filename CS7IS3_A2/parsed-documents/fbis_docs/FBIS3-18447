Minister Kolodziejczyk is on an official three-day visit to France. On Thursday he is to take part in a trilateral meeting of the French, Polish, and German defense ministers. [Words indistinct] Leotard and Kolodziejczyk, Volker Ruehe will also be taking part. Military cooperation with France is very highly appraised by the Polish side, as Minister Kolodziejczyk pointed out at a news conference after his meeting with Minister Leotard. He especially highlighted its technical aspects -- assistance by French industry in modernizing Polish army weapons and adapting them to West European standards. Without French assistance, the Polish minister said, adapting our defense structures to the level of Western Europe would have been incredibly difficult. Kolodziejczyk also drew attention to France's role in speeding up actions aimed at integrating Poland into a European security system. In connection with the envisaged granting to Poland of associate member status of the Western European Union [WEU] (a decision is to be reached at the WEU Ministerial Council on 9 and 10 May this year), he expressed the view that at present this was the greatest opportunity for such integration and at the same time a way of getting into a European security system. According to Kolodziejczyk, Poland's future full WEU membership could overtake the economic integration with the European Community. According to sources close to the French Defense Ministry, France wants Poland's actual association with the WEU to take place as early as possible. At a news conference on Wednesday Leotard recalled that it was the position of France and Germany which speeded up the process of bringing Poland closer to the WEU. At the same time he emphasized that WEU associate status is a transitory stage, leading to full membership in that military organization. During the talks between Kolodziejczyk and Leotard the issue of Poland's possible participation in the European Corps in Strasbourg was also raised. The Polish minister expressed his belief that such a solution is possible and necessary. Leotard, who regards this issue as complicated, believes that the first step could be the presence of Polish observers at the corps. This subject will be discussed, among others, during the Thursday meeting of the Polish, French, and German defense ministers. Leotard said it would be desirable to hold such meetings regularly, every year, and for trilateral cooperation in the field of defense to supplement political cooperation, an expression of which are the regular trilateral consultations among these countries' foreign affairs ministers which have now been taking place for two and a half years. The heads of the Polish and French Defense Departments also talked about joint maneuvers by the two countries' armies. It was reported that maneuvers with the participation of French Alpine riflemen will take place this June in southern Poland. Also this year there will be joint maneuvers by the Polish and French Navies in the Baltic. This will be the first joint exercises by units of the two armies since the end of the Second World War. They will also be the first in which French units will participate together with units from a central European country. Specific details of these intentions will be discussed during the coming visit (9-12 March) to Poland by Admiral Jacques Laxande, the chief of the General Staff of the French Armed Forces. He will visit Warsaw, Poznan, and the triple city [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot].
