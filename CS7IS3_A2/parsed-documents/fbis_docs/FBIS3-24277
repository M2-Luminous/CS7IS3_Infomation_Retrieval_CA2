Which also guaranteed criminals protection from any form of social control, including on the part of law enforcement organs. Individual major scandalous trials of that period (for example, trade, fishing, Sochi) only created the illusion of an uncompromising attitude on the part of the authorities in the protection of legality. But in fact this was a reaction to a violation of the rules of the game established in the higher strata of society, and had nothing in common with the law and the morality that was being propagandized. Gathering strength, organized crime began to monopolize all spheres of unlawful and asocial activity that secure material profit. Like any social, managerial structure, it developed in the form of a pyramid, including lower levels of "unskilled labor" and "bureaucratic" strata that ensured the efficiency of the system and its security, and also its ideologically ruling elite. An economic analysis of the financial-economic activity of some Soviet republics conducted at the end of the 1980's by specialists indicated that the volume of shadow turnover in them increased their budgets. Actually, this indicated the full criminalization of social relations in them. Risking being accused of inciting national discord and offending national feelings, I will not name specific regions, although in some of them the present rulers have already become hostage to the interests of mafiosi clans. What has been said is quite sufficient to answer the question that was raised. The authorities themselves turned out to be interested in the existence of organized crime and in the corruption that was imminently inherent in it. One of the main reasons for the offensive development of organized crime is that it was the only truly market structure in the state under any conditions, which also enabled it in all periods to quickly (in a mobile way) adapt itself to changes. And not simply adapt itself, but at the same time derive the maximum material and political advantages. The country's entry into market relations opened up unprecedented prospects for our mafia. In contrast to other countries, where organized crime developed in an underground market of commodity and service shortages, our mafia, protected together with its highly placed official patrons from any forms of control (including the law enforcement system), in recent years unpardonably, with forceful methods, also took legal forms of entrepreneurship under its control. State-mafiosi relations are becoming a way of life of today's authorities, who, together with the leaders of the criminal world, determine economic and political realities. Although why today's? After all, we see in the offices of power the very same persons we saw 10 years ago. But the new "lucky ones," who made their way through to the distribution of the property and authority pie regardless of their political attachment, in a majority of cases accepted the standing rules of the game which assure them numerous personal benefits. At the present time the mafia is already monopolizing virtually all directions of legal business that bring in super-profits, not counting the traditional underground directions. Therefore: --it is not accidental that it is by no means the producers of goods who receive quota, license, customs, tax, and other privileges, but those who are accustomed to living in the corridors of power; --it is not surprising that the militia is being equipped with technical means with the active participation of the mafia and through the mediation of the authorities (naturally, not without profit for the latter); --it is quite natural that the law enforcement organs are now already guarding not only the representatives of authority but also the mafiosi structures against all accusations; --it is natural that the popularity and social rating of the leaders of organized crime is growing, and they continuously appear on television as "patrons" and "philanthropists." Under similar conditions, the creation of numerous new controlling organs (in the fight against corruption and organized crime, for control over the issuance of licenses and granting privileges to entrepreneurial structures, and in the fight against abuses in the division of property, etc.)--is nothing more than a valve for an apparatus that is unfit for use to let off the steam of civil dissatisfaction. This is only the emergence of new stillborn bureaucratic structures, whose burdensome maintenance is laid on the taxpayer. Can there be any serious talk about branches of authority that will be able to oppose organized crime and corruption? As a rule, the mafia does not give a damn about the numerous exposures in the mass media--is this authority? The court, which remains hostage to local and higher authorities, is intimidated and being bought by the mafia--is this authority? The legislator, who out of poverty begins work to resolve his own material interests and wonders whether he will be shot in the event of a dispute with another "branch"--is this authority? It is simply stupid to rely on the law enforcement organs. In addition to the fact that these organs themselves are corroding more and more from contact with the enemy, they cannot objectively--no matter how much they wish to--get into the game outside the boundaries of the established rules. It is characteristic that their leaders reduce the task of confronting a dangerous phenomenon in a majority of cases to a fight against trivial bandit groups that constitute, undoubtedly, an extremely important element, but only the lower executive element of the global structure of organized crime. The key is simple: Today this is the limit of the capabilities of the law enforcement organs. At the same time, an overwhelming majority of registered murders are not solved, inasmuch as in a number of cases this would lead to scandals at a rather high level. An alarming symptom: To effectively fight the mafia, some people are demanding extreme measures and the assignment of additional powers to special subunits. This is the wrong path, which is, in fact, the recidivist psychology of communist lawlessness and terrorism and which has shameful examples in the form of "extraordinary commissions." New lawlessness is capable of giving rise only to lawlessness with numerous abuses and a protective reaction that is difficult to predict. Also absurd are the numerous hopes for toughening the criminal sector in legislation. This is just another myth. And the existing criminal law makes it possible more effectively to oppose organized crime and corruption. Therefore, the problem today lies not in its toughening (although undoubtedly a whole series of categories of crimes resulting from specific market relations should be introduced immediately), but in the capability to employ it without being afraid of invading the sphere of interests of the powers that be. Is the mafia longing to gain power? Undoubtedly. But it would be naive to think that the "godfathers themselves" are burning with desire to occupy key posts in the power structures, thereby assuming responsibility for the political, economic, and social situation in the country, and are staking their well-being on this. The modest role of stage manager is quite enough for them. And they are handling this role successfully. Our Russian mafia can really do everything. Apparently, someone still remembers that in 1988 the USSR officially put forth its candidacy to conduct the Olympic Games in the year 2000...in the Black Sea city resort of Sochi. Organized crime was behind this. Just the fact of the promotion was quite enough for the conduct of large-scale machinations in real estate. A whole series of events that occurred in Russia in the last year characterize for me occurrences of this order: For example: --the exchange of money, as a result of which only poor people suffered. On the other hand, thousands of commercial structures appeared in the sphere of control of organized crime which to this day exchange tens and hundreds of billions of Soviet bills for rubles of the new type with unquestionable profit for the mafia; --the decision to allocate $500 million for the construction of a new parliamentary center in Moscow, as a result of which not only does the new parliament compromise itself immediately (in any case), but a substantial amount of hard currency that is released for nontraditional construction will be stolen; --the collapse of the ruble in January of this year, on which quite a few persons multiplied their fortunes in several days. There they are--real signs of the activity of organized crime, quite remote from banal bandit formations. But who will fight against this?
