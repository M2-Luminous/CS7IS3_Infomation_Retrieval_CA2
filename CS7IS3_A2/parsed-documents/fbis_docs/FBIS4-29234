Korea" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The puppets staged a large-scale "civilian defense training" all over South Korea Wednesday by mobilising a great number of people, according to radio reports from Seoul. They kicked up a dust with training of taking shelter and training under simulated conditions of "chemical, biological and radioactive attack" under an imaginary "emergency state." The South Korean bellicose elements blared that it was a training of taking shelter in the wartime "to be prepared against the situation caused by the 'nuclear issue' of the North." Earlier, the puppets announced that a massive military exercise will be staged involving various means of war, with 6.5 million men of the "civilian defense" forces and even U.S. troops present in South Korea participating in the training in the future. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are frequently staging war drills with increasing intensity, driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. This indicates that their war hysterics to stifle the North has reached a very reckless stage.
