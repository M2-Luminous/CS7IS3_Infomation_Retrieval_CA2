FR941003-0-00106 FR941003-0-00018 Interested persons were invited to submit comments in Docket No. FR&hyph;3027 on or before Nov. 15, 1993. III. Description of this Final Rule Background This rule implements two statutory provisions. Section 142 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Reform Act) requires that the appraisal of all property securing an FHA-insured mortgage be performed in accordance with generally approved appraisal standards. 1 Section 322 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Cranston-Gonzalez) provides that single family Direct Endorsement (DE) mortgagees may choose the appraisers who evaluate properties securing FHA-insured mortgages and states that those appraisers may be legal entities as well as natural persons. 2 Furthermore, as explained in the proposed rule, HUD, on its own initiative, has been revising its procedures for qualifying appraisers and for requiring their use in various FHA programs. The objective is to identify under each program the particular method of determining who is qualified to perform the appraisal, consultancy or other type of evaluation, based on differences inherent in the broad range of insurance programs that comprise Titles I and II of the National Housing Act (Act, NHA). 1 Section 142 of the Reform Act added section 202(e) to the National Housing Act (NHA, Act), 12 U.S.C. 1708(e). 2 Section 322 of Cranston-Gonzalez amended section 202(e). As a consequence of the Congressional mandates and its own initiatives, the Department published the proposed rule which elicited 384 written public comments. Some of these comments raised a single issue, while others expressed multiple questions or concerns. Many were repetitive. In this rule, a number of changes are the direct consequence of, or are easily traceable to, public comments, as explained below. Also being adopted are changes originated by the Department as a result of having further considered its proposal. Mainly, these modifications are designed to simplify the rule in its final form and to address comments which objected to the burdensomeness of several proposed requirements. In addition, there are a number of editorial revisions that were needed to correct errors and improve readability; they are self-explanatory and are not discussed. Differences Between the Proposed and Final Rules This rule differs from the proposal in two general respects. The first difference is in response to a view expressed by several commenters that the proposed rule was difficult to follow and should be split into separate rules covering single family and multifamily programs, respectively. HUD does not believe that such radical restructuring is necessary but does recognize that FHA's single and multifamily programs differ enough that a division of the proposed rule's content along those lines would be helpful. Consequently, the final rule has reorganized the new part 267 into three subparts. Subpart A includes material common to both single and multifamily programs, subpart B relates exclusively to single family programs and subpart C relates only to multifamily programs. This revision has necessitated a technical, non-substantive redrafting of various proposed sections, e.g., the definition of ``appraisal'' has been tailored to fit subparts B and C, but these changes do not affect meaning. Not as obvious is a shift in the final rule toward a less incursive regulatory posture that gives greater recognition to accepted industry standards and practices. Several HUD standards contained in the proposal are being deleted and the Departure Provision of the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) is being acknowledged with respect to single family programs. Regarding this latter change, FHA currently requires that all single family appraisals be ``complete appraisals'', as that term is defined under Standard 1 of USPAP, but instances may arise when the Departure Provision will be invoked to authorize ``limited appraisals'' under specific circumstances and on a case-by-case basis. In general, we are increasingly convinced that, with legislative prompting, the appraisal profession is moving in the direction of effective self-regulation and that HUD should limit its role to adapting industry requirements and practices to particular FHA needs rather than competing with broader ongoing efforts to improve the reliability of residential appraisals and the overall performance of the appraisal industry. Set forth below is a discussion of significant changes from the proposed rule contained in each of the three subparts of new part 267. Subpart A_General In ยง267.1 (applicability), paragraph (b)(2) has been changed to add a reference to ยง201.23(b)(3) regarding the ``trade-in'' of a borrower's equity in a manufactured home. As a result, part 267 now excludes appraisals used in determining the borrower's equity in an existing manufactured home traded for a new manufactured home to be purchased with a Title I loan. This reference was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. Also, in paragraph (b)(3) of ยง267.1, the exception for property improvement loans has been broadened by changing the phrase ``one- to-four family dwellings'' to ``property'' since the exception should cover Title I commercial and multifamily property improvement loans as well as one-to-four family dwellings. The paragraph has also been revised to reflect a recent decision by the Department to enhance the Title I program. 3 Specifically, the $15,000 threshold of borrower equity in the property undergoing improvement, below which no mortgage is required, has been eliminated. 3 See News Release issued by the Department on June 28, 1994.
