During a Latin American seminar on military spending being held in Santiago, Arancibia made an overall analysis of the decisionmaking process and changes within this context. He emphasized that this type of meeting permitted one to see "the progress achieved in technical and academic relations between civilians and the military." During the conference's first day, which was designed by the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies [Academia Nacional de Estudios Politicos y Estrategicos] (ANEPE), and by the Latin American School of Social Sciences (Flacso), the agenda included defense policies, new security concepts, the economic balance, and military spending in developed countries.
