However, it sees as its top priority the establishment of mutually beneficial relations with Belarusian neighbors, first of all, with Russia as well as Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. This was declared by the largest legislative faction at its meeting with a European Parliament delegation in charge of cooperation with CIS states headed by Magdalene (Hoe). In the words of Gennadiy Kozlov, "Belarus" acting coordinator, the faction is intensively working on strengthening integration with Russia proceeding from, as was emphasized, the sovereignty of the Belarusian state, and perceives Germany as the main partner in Europe.
