Cetin is currently in Paris for the European Stability Pact conference, which aims to prevent the ethnic problems in Eastern European countries from causing new clashes similar to those in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin replied to reporters' questions. The foreign minister stated that the conference is seeking a kind of diplomacy that will avoid conflicts. He said that minority and border issues were discussed at first. Stressing that disputes must be resolved between neighbors, Cetin remarked that countries which will join the European Union [EU] must first solve their problems with their neighbors. Greece is such an example, Cetin noted, adding: It was admitted into the EU without resolving its problems with Turkey and these problems are now causing trouble for the EU. Recalling that Turkey solved its problems with Bulgaria in a friendly manner, Cetin declared that the clashes in the Caucasus constitute a great loss both for the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians. The foreign minister, who held meetings with his Russian, German, and British counterparts in Paris, also met with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.
