He stressed that Ukraine had to face the problem of deported peoples alone, although the Ukrainian leadership had addressed the CIS states with a request to help it. Kravchuk repeated that the CIS agreement on mutual assistance with settlement of problems concerning deported peoples signed in 1992 had not been ratified by the CIS parliaments and had never come into effect. Kravchuk said that migration had become spontaneous. Displaced persons often find themselves in Ukraine with no means for living since they fail to sell their property for fair prices. He urged the Ukrainian parliament to adopt a law which will clearly define the status of deported peoples, including Crimean Tatars. Deputy Chairman of the Crimean-Tatar parliament, Refat Chubarov, called on the Ukrainian leadership to address the UN in order to solve the problems of Crimean Tatars. He suggested the assistance on the part of the UN would also improve the situation in Crimea in general. Chubarov pointed out that the issue could be resolved only through joint actions by the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities and the Crimean-Tatar parliament. Currently, there are about 250,000 Crimean Tatars living in Crimea. In accordance with the quota given to them, Crimean Tatars have fourteen seats in the new Crimean parliament.
