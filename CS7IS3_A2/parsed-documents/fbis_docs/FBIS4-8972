Asked what is happening in the HDZ, Dr. Radic answered in a nonchalant way, not letting himself be provoked: [Radic] Nothing special; we are becoming stronger. The HDZ is undergoing the process of growing from a movement into a party, which is in accordance with the decision of the Second General Congress, and this is the time in which it will be undergoing minor turmoils; not in a destructive sense, but rather in the way that will result in the HDZ emerging as a real party; firm, well- connected, a party that is necessary to Croatia and the Croatian people. [Novak-Srzic] However, you cannot claim that it is only an intraparty conflict. Since the issue is the party in power, the conflicts in it reflect on the overall political life of Croatia. How come Mesic has remained president of the Chamber of Representatives and member of the party Presidency despite the fact that some of his criticism was harsher than that of Manolic [president of the Chamber of Counties]? [Radic] It is normal that all the events in the HDZ reflect on the events in the overall political life of Croatia, as Croatian politics are actually the HDZ politics. However, we in the party view the Manolic problem and the Mesic problem separately. The Manolic problem was on the agenda, certain decisions were made -- primarily the decision of the party president through which Manolic was relieved of his party duties. On the other hand, after a talk with the President Mesic agreed to observe the party rules. At a certain point he reacted in the heat of the moment, perhaps unpleasantly provoked by certain party members, which is normal, human. I firmly believe that Mesic will observe the party rules. Moreover, he has promised the president that he would become an active HDZ member. It is important to point out that Manolic was offered the same, on several occasions, including one at the Club of Representatives, but he refused. [Novak-Srzic] Do you think Manolic can harm the HDZ? [Radic] He certainly cannot harm the HDZ as a force, as a party. [Novak-Srzic] Many say that when Manolic was being relieved of his high party duties the party went by the rules of the procedure, but insisted on the urgency of the process when he was being relieved of his state functions. Some have called it a Stalinist method, and they believe that the HDZ members in the Chamber of Counties have done it in a clumsy, even arrogant way. [Radic] Those who have attempted to portray Manolic's replacement that way wished it that way, but that is not how it happened. [Novak-Srzic] We watched it on TV. [Radic] Very few people remarked on that program; the committee has also shown that Mr. Manolic was not right. The remarks relate to some collection of signatures before the session.... [Novak-Srzic] There is talk that after the HDZ Presidency session, during lunch at the president's, someone started the action of collecting signatures of those in favor of Manolic's replacement. [Radic] That is simply not true. After the Presidency session, a session of the Club of Representatives of the Chamber of Counties was held, which I attended, and so did Mr. Manolic. There was a vote on whether he should be relieved of the position of president of the Chamber of Counties, as he had already been under party suspension at that time. It was at that Club session that the decision was made that Mr. Manolic be relieved of his post, with three votes against. It was at that meeting, and not before or after lunch, as some have stated for the papers. Since 36 representatives voted in favor of Manolic being relieved, the president of the Club of Representatives said: "All right, now we have to formalize the decision, collect the signatures." Namely, the request for his replacement had to be conducted in compliance with the rules of procedure. It would be biased to say that signatures were being collected with some other motives. [Novak-Srzic] Mr. Manolic has announced the founding of a new party, and said that a great number of HDZ representatives would go over to his party. Could the HDZ lose the majority in the parliament, and could there be a parliamentary crisis -- there has even been mention of early elections? [Radic] It is human to hope. It would be crazy if someone were to undertake an action believing it would fail. By the same token, it is allowed that others also make judgments and present their positions. My personal judgment is that it would be unrealistic to expect that Mr. Manolic will attract a great number of HDZ members and question our majority in both Chambers. There is no danger of a parliamentary crisis, and thus no reason for early elections. There is a danger of violent methods being used, which is when you want to be something by all means, although the majority are against it. That is violence. Democracy is the rule of the majority. The individual opposing the majority is not democracy. The HDZ will insist on democracy being the position of the majority, and we will insist on the observance of the procedure and the normative deeds. In this case the issue was the conflict in interpreting the procedure. In any law, the last resort is that the act be interpreted by whoever passed it. If the rules of procedure are passed by the Chamber of Counties, then they will be interpreted by the Chamber of Counties. As far as our style is concerned, I accept the criticism, I agree that not everything was organized well and that some individuals were not prepared well. However, that is one of our organizational weaknesses, but also strengths, since it is from instances such as these that we learn not to repeat such mistakes. [Novak-Srzic] What is your comment on Mr. Mesic's statements about Bolshevist, Communist, Stalinist, non-democratic actions in the HDZ? [Radic] I am sure that Mr. Mesic does not believe that. [Novak-Srzic] After the tragedy in Sesvete [reference to the explosion at a military warehouse on the outskirts of Zagreb], which occurred while the changes within the party were taking place, there appeared the demand for Defense Minister Susak's resignation. [Radic] Naturally, I am sorry, as is any person when a tragedy occurs. We must all do everything to relieve the consequences of the tragedy, but we must make even more effort to prevent the possibility of similar accidents happening, or at least to reduce it to the lowest possible level. All these committees, from the president's to the parliament one, will do everything to learn the truth about the causes of the accident. We are, in a way, still at war, and thank God there have not been more such events and tragedies. As far as the demand for investigating the liability of any member of the government is concerned, it is a normal procedural possibility of the Croatian parliament. Not only does the parliament have the right to do so, but it is obliged to, but it is also obliged, as is any group, to demand a resignation on the basis of arguments. I think that the Croatian parliament has done well by deciding that there be an investigation into the real causes and possible culprits. You know what the church says: You can sin by thought, word, deed, and omission. [Novak-Srzic] However, there are also moral reasons for insisting on Minister Susak's resignation, are there not? [Radic] There is a lot of politics and petty politics in this, especially now. Remember, the reasons behind the demand for Susak's resignation are different every day. You can therefore not not put it all together. Minister Susak will personally make a maximum effort to determine the causes of the accident. However, there are some who would like Gojko Susak not to be defense minister. What if it is established that there is a possibility that those who want Susak to leave are responsible? I would not prejudice anything. Let the facts speak. [Novak-Srzic] Do you consider the process of the "transformation" of the HDZ completed, and do you not think that the issue is in fact the postponement of disunion? [Radic] I do not consider this process finished. I believe that the process of the HDZ growing from a movement into a party will last several years. It is impossible to achieve that in one moment, with one act, or one decree. It is a process. It is a normal sequence of events in which the HDZ will calmly, as well as in turmoil, as that is also part of life, carry out its transformation -- not for its own sake, but for the sake of Croatia. [Novak-Srzic] Who will be dropped in the process? [Radic] Those who do not accept the program and statute of the HDZ. All the members have been able to participate in the creation of each act and the overall policy of the HDZ, but when the majority -- and I would like to stress that it is the majority -- adopts something by a democratic procedure, the others must implement it. We remain a broad enough party to allow for differences within the program, but not in the important aspects. We must be recognizable precisely in these important aspects, and those who are not recognizable in this way will not stay. We are open to former communists, but not to those who are still communists. [Novak-Srzic] Ivic Pasalic has recently stated in an interview that the HDZ was starting the process of de-communization. What could that mean? [Radic] There is something there. There are remnants of the communist system in our society, and the same holds true for the HDZ. You can see this danger in other countries that are leaving the socialist world, but in which Communism is returning. We are a party that will not allow Communism to return either among our members or in Croatia as a whole, because we are the essential political force in Croatia. Our aim is not to have communist remnants among us. I would like to emphasize that the issue is not whether someone used to be a communist, but what they support at present. I must point out that all this does not indicate the HDZ is turning right; we remain firmly in the center. [Novak-Srzic] You have mentioned remnants of the communist society. Is it possible that the apartments that some high state officials, members of the HDZ, have been given, as was the case with Mr. Mudrinic [minister of transport and communications], could also be a remnant of the privileges following the pattern from the past? [Radic] Personally, I have and will always be against people having privileges, especially illegal, only because they are in politics. The party must work hard on that, and it must clarify things with those who support it. However, we often tend to grasp individual cases that we then transfer to the entire system. I am in favor of changing the system by not allowing such omissions. I have not been informed of this specific case, so I cannot tell you anything about it. [Novak-Srzic] Do you have a state-owned apartment? [Radic] No, I bought my apartment before I entered politics.
