Based on a typical chauvinistic Serbian logic, a very known one, without respecting the most natural principles, it says Albania is deliberately contributing in the rise of the incidents' number at the Albanian- Yugoslav border, seeking to make tensions in the relations with Yugoslavia and in order to find the time for taking Kosova, thus realizing the idea of the Greater Albania. After detailing the Serbian charges, the memorandum offers dialogue which is not anything else but a show for political consumption. The charges are similar with the dictators' speeches which aim to revive the blind belief of the people and not the truth. The so-called "bordering incidents and provocations by the Albanian side" are known very well inside and outside Albania through the denunciations made by the Albanian state. According to the Albanian competent organs and the monitoring missions of European Union, the main cause of the bordering incidents have been the firing by the Yugoslav border guards toward the Albanian citizens which have not been dangerous at all having no arm with them. The 21 killed and wounded in the Albanian border, since the beginning of 1993, have been all Albanians and no one of has been Serbian. Naturally such acts as deliberate provocations and a part of the Milosevic's tension and war strategy will bring about unforeseen consequences. The Republic of Albania has stated more than once that it is not for changing the borders by force and Albanian bordering organs has been trying and are trying to respecting and well keeping the borders. Albania has been always preoccupied to have a quiet situation at the borders, to cooperate with its neighbours including the Yugoslav competent organs. Thus the charges made to Albania are intentional defamations which we reject as false ones. They do not speak of the Belgrade's preoccupation and a constructive approach in the relations with Albania but they seem to be the Serbia propagative campaign before starting the aggression on its northern borders. As a democratic state, Albania not only has been openly declared and in a repeated way, but it is regarded as a stability and peace factor in the Balkans. We want to remind to the Belgrade leaders that Albania for the very reason is for peace and stability and it is interested and will care for the future of the 2 millions Albanians in Kosova, who are not a minority as Belgrade considers them but they are ethnics and they live in their own land. The Albania's interest for them has legal basis which are sanctioned in the international charters. It is not Albania which have caused the tense situation in Kosova, but it is the Serbian policy, the tanks and the presence of 50 thousand Serbian police and soldiers, the violence and the terror created by them, which has caused a tragical situation where even the children are deprived the right of studying in their native language. It seems flagrant to say in that memorandum that the Albanians have all the rights. This is a grave defamation to the UN Security Council, the European Parliament, CSCE and the other international institutions which have ascertained through their documents the difficult position of the Albanian population in Kosova. In its policy on Balkans and in its relations with the far and close countries, the democratic Albania has had and it has the purpose to serve the preserving of its state sovereignty and peace in the region. Albania has never been an alarming object for the region and Europe. Otherwise the peace-loving forces would have put sanctions on it and ultimatums as well. The international community knows very well who are the very forces seeking to set the Balkans on fire and to endanger the peace in Europe and broader. The known Belgrade's policy pursued so far in Kosova toward the Albanians there who live in their own land and the defamations and continuing charges to Albania regarding the openness of its foreign policy and the relations extending with its friend countries show clearly a pathological and anti-Albanian approach. The politicians of the Milosevic's centralised state should know very well that the road toward the dialogue doesn't depend on the democratic Albania which has it on the basis of its social system. You will go to dialogue nor with preliminary conditions no with psychological pressure. Once more the Albanian Foreign Ministry rejects the memorandum recently published by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the memorandum as another anti-Albanian step, with a provocative and defamatory character. The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs makes known that about this it will fully inform the UN Security Council, the CSCE and the all public opinion.
