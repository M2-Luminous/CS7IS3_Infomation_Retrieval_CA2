But then both parties must be prepared to compromise. Unfortunately, I must say that in these confusing times we cannot count on much understanding and support from our friends and allies in the West. Even at this critical moment, now that the democrats need full support, we are hearing Western threats that economic cooperation with Russia will be limited. Some comments show an almost manic desire for a world with just one great power: the United States. This is not very realistic. The United States cannot deal with all the world's problems on its own; if it were to try, it would just weaken itself. Moreover, even in this difficult transitional period, Russia remains a superpower. Not just because of its arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles, but also because of its natural resources, technological skills, and strategic location. There are reactionary forces in both the United States and Russia, the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes that are afraid of losing influence, that are striving for an end to the present cooperation. They are spreading myths: "Since Russia is simply condemned to eternal totalitarian governments, always in confrontation with the outside world, it can never, from a historical point of view, travel the same path as the West." It appears that some Western politicians, in Washington and elsewhere, see Russia as a younger rather than an equal partner. In this view of things a "good Russian" is always a follower and never a leader. Right from the start, politicians in both Russia and the West who thought pragmatically based their policy on two assumptions. First, Russia is predestined to be a great power, not a second-rank power. Under a communist or nationalist regime it is aggressive and a threat, while under a democratic government it would be peaceful and prosperous. Second, cooperative links, like those between the United States and Russia, do not prevent forceful and even aggressive policies to defend self-interests. This can sometimes lead to disagreement. That is not serious, as long as the situation remains one of compromise rather than confrontation. It is naive to expect that great powers like Russia and the United States must and can always live together in harmony. A particularly promising example of cooperation was the U.S. readiness to involve Russian experts in determining the principles for the export of militarily useful technology from the West to the former Communist countries and countries which are accused of supporting terrorism. How should the Russian democrats answer the new chauvinistic wind blowing in Washington? Russia cannot agree to playing a subordinate role in the world. That would be unjust and politically dangerous. Extreme nationalists and other reactionaries would quickly reap a profit. While the idea that the Americans are in charge of the world is dangerous, there remains an urgent need for U.S. leadership because of the special position of the United States in the G-7 and NATO. NATO was set up to resist communism and defend the Western democracies from the threat emanating from it. But nowadays NATO is no longer sufficient for two reasons: It no longer has communism as its greatest enemy and Russia is not a member. What role could NATO play in solving the big international conflicts? The organizational problems could be solved in part by the Partnership for Peace proposed by the United States, which various countries in Eastern and Central Europe have in the meantime joined and which is also acceptable to Russia. But even this should not be seen as true cooperation, as has been painfully demonstrated in the Bosnian crisis. The NATO ultimatum on Sarajevo was made while Russia was not involved in any way. It is unacceptable to exclude Russia from attempts to solve the situation in Bosnia, where Russia has present and future interests. We must urgently make a start on a strategy for achieving a mature and realistic relationship -- dare we call it realpolitik?
