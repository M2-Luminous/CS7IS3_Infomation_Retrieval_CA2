Kunihiro told Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan that the basic stand of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa would be "to make great efforts for future-oriented relations between Japan and China," an embassy spokesman said. Tang said the Chinese Government "was reacting with restraint" over the Nagano affair, but seeing the enormous political repercussions the issue has aroused, they "felt indignant and very concerned," the spokesman said. The Chinese vice minister said his government will pay great attention "to the manner in which Japan deals with Nagano." Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano caused an uproar Wednesday when he denied that Japan waged a war of aggression in Asia during the 1930s and World War II and massacred hundreds of thousands of Chinese in Nanjing in 1937. Chinese newspapers Saturday reported Nagano's public retraction of his remarks and apology on Friday and also the possibility of his resignation after Hata's return from a trip to Europe. Tang told the Japanese ambassador to convey to the Japanese Government that Nagano's statements "greatly hurt and angered the people of China," the spokesman said.
