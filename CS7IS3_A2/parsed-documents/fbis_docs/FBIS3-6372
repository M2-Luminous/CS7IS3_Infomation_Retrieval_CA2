Wisner, in Seoul since Monday, met with Han for an hour-long talk to evaluate the current crisis over nuclear inspections in the North and stalled inter-Korean dialogue, said Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the American Affairs Bureau. The two officials discussed what to expect next -- either North Korea meeting the South Korean and U.S. demands or continuing with its present attitude of refusal, he said. In case of the latter, Han and Wisner agreed their countries may need to enter into a new phase of countermeasures. "Countermeasures are under preparation for such an event," Chang said. Asked whether they talked about deployment of Patriot missiles and resuming this year's South Korea-U.S. joint military drill "Team Spirit," Chang indirectly said yes by adding, "of course, issues related to security in light of the present situation were addressed."
