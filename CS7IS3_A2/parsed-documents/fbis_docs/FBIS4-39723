"We must sign the treaty on the setting up of Russian bases on the Republic's territory by 1 September," he said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX. The inter-governmental agreement on the status of the Russian forces in Armenia was signed in 1992 and ratified by the former parliament of the Russian Federation in February 1993. Sargsyan pointed out that the Republic's leadership is not insisting that Moscow pay rent for the land for these bases and for communal services. In his words, the Armenian leadership proposed that Russia's military department train Armenian citizens in Russian military colleges also "free of charge." In addition, it was proposed to grant an opportunity to a contingent of Armenian servicemen to serve in the Russian military bases to be created in the Republic. Commenting on the upcoming trip of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to Baku, Sargsyan said he thought it unlikely that Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev would join the agreement on the settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Russia, which acted as mediator, signed a document on this issue on 17 May in Moscow. "After the statements of the Azerbaijani leaders stating that there will be not a single Russian soldier on the territory of the republic there can be hardly any progress on peaceful settlement of the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh," said Serzh Sargsyan. "They have burnt all their bridges by their statements," he added.
