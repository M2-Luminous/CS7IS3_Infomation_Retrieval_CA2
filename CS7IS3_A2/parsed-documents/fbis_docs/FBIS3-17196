Chubays explains the second stage of the privatization process, which is due to begin in 100 days. He says the main point of the process is that cash will take the place of vouchers. Svanidze suggests to Chubays that he has many opponents and asks him who his supporters are. The main ones, Chubays says, are the president and the prime minister. In 1993, the volume of revenue from privatization amounted to 480,000 million rubles. Svanidze challenges Chubays on his popularity in parliament over the privatization process and queries the chances of his vision of privatization being endorsed by the Duma. Chubays says he is clear of one thing: If the Duma tries to derail this process, it will rebound on it. Finally, Chubays warns people to be on guard against swindlers making capital out of vouchers they have obtained by fraud.
