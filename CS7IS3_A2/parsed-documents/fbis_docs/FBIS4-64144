FBIS4-64144 "drsov104_c_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-104 Daily Report 27 May 1994 Federal Assembly Duma Votes To Establish Own TV, Radio Service Duma Votes To Establish Own TV, Radio Service LD2705175694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1348 GMT 27 May 94 LD2705175694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] On Friday the State Duma voted to set up its own TV and radio service as a department in the apparatus of the lower chamber of parliament. It will be in charge of preparing daily radio and TV programs on activities of representative power bodies in Russia. 265 deputies voted in favor of this resolution, only 62 were against. Deputies were not stopped by a statement of the presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov made the day before, in which he described the creation of such a TV and radio service as reanimation of "infringement of the former parliament on prerogatives of free mass media" and as an attempt by the State Duma "to create information privileges" for itself. Kostikov's statement said: "The president is concerned that the resumption of information dictate may lead to the fall of the Duma's prestige, and this in turn will damage the process of strengthening the civic accord." The press secretary also drew attention to the fact that neither the president, nor the government, nor the Council of Federation have their own broadcasting service. "The president urges deputies of the State Duma to show wisdom, political tact, and to take into account lessons of living history," Kostikov resumed. Most observers doubt that such a step by the State Duma may lead to a serious complication of its relations with the president. Some experts, however, believe that the latest actions by the lower chamber of the parliament confirm the recent apprehension expressed by Boris Yeltsin in a conversation with the faction Union December 12 about insufficiently constructive and fruitful work of the Duma. On Friday most deputies attending the Duma session (189) spoke in favor of putting on the agenda the issue "On anti-constitutional decrees by the president" proposed by a representative of the communist faction. He had in view a package of six reformist "economic" decrees by Boris Yeltsin made public earlier this week. However, the positive decision on putting this issue on agenda ran short of 36 votes. On the same day the State Duma postponed the discussion in the second reading of a draft law on the federal budget for 1994 until June 8. IF Note: According to the treaty on civic accord signed by the chairman of the State Duma and a majority of its factions, the lower chamber pledged to pass a law on the federal budget for this year already in the first half of the year.
