The two infected Cypriots are both 32 years old and the third is 20. All of them contacted the virus from sexual intercourse with an AIDS carrier most likely outside Cyprus, probably Greece or Thailand, the announcement added. Since October 1986, 163 people - 91 Cypriots and 72 foreigners - were infected by the deadly disease. Of the 91 Cypriots, 80 of them are men. Seventy-seven of the total number of Cypriot carriers live on the island while 14 live abroad. So far 16 Cypriots suffering from AIDS have died, while two other carriers died from other causes. The age group 20-29 concentrated 42 of the 91 Cypriots carrying AIDS. The second high-risk group is between 30 and 39 which concentrated 29 cases. The most common way (76 percent) of contacting the disease is through sexual intercourse, the announcement said.
