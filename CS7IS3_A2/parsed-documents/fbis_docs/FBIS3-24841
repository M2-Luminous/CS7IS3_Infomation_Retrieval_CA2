AVF Press Secretary Stephen Maninger said the NPF represented the re-emergence of the African National Congress' [ANC] armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and could not be trusted with the safety of the South African public. The NPF was not apolitical, and was ill-disciplined and unreliable, he said. "We predict that once this force is deployed it may become South Africa's version of (Zimbabwe President Robert) Mugabe's `5th Brigade,' sent to suppress all political opposition in places such as kwaZulu or other areas where the ANC does not have complete control." The AVF statement was referred to the Transitional Executive Council's sub-council on defence for comment.
