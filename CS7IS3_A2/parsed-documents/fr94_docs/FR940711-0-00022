FR940711-0-00022 FR940711-0-00003 The new advertising and promotion program is intended to enable the almond industry to have an advertising and promotion program which better reflects its current needs. The Board believes that there is widespread industry support for the new program. Overall, the new Credit-Back program is expected to foster the worldwide demand for California almonds through the provision of a more efficient and effective program which will encompass both generic and brand advertising and promotion. Discussion of the Comments As was previously stated, USDA provided two comment periods for the new Credit-Back program. The first comment period ended on September 16, 1993. One comment was received during this period from Cal-Almond, Inc., an independent almond handler. The second comment period ended on March 2, 1994. During this period, seven comments were received. Five comments were from independent almond handlers. They were Wiggin Farms, Arbuckle, CA; Western Nut Company, Chico, CA; Waterford Nut Company, Waterford, CA; Rotteveel Orchards, Dixon, CA; and Cal-Almond, Inc., Hughson, CA. A sixth comment was received from the U.S. Small Business Administration, Washington, DC. The seventh comment was received from Mr. Rodger Wasson, President and CEO of the Almond Board of California. All of the comments will be discussed below. Because many of the comments by the independent almond handlers contained similar concerns, they have been combined where appropriate and are addressed collectively. In its first comment submitted on September 14, 1993, Cal-Almond, Inc., stated that the issuance of an interim final rule rather than a proposed rule to establish the new Credit-Back program was arbitrary and capricious. The commenter asserted that the former creditable advertising and promotion program has been substantially altered by the interim final rule and the burden on handlers has been drastically increased. It is the Department's position that the issuance of the interim final rule met each of the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) which pertain to the promulgation of regulations. The Board requested that the new regulations for the Credit-Back program be effective for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year. The only way to accomplish this was through the utilization of interim final rulemaking procedures, as authorized by the APA. Also, the Department was advised by the Board that the action was widely supported by the industry. While there was one dissenting vote among the ten Board members who voted on the establishment of the new program, that person was opposed to the imposition of any advertising assessments on members of the industry. The dissenting Board member had no specific criticisms of the new Credit-Back program. Finally, contrary to the commenter's assertion, the interim final rule represented a relaxation of the then-existing regulations. Moreover, the new Credit-Back program, as modified in this final rule, is further relaxed. The new program is carefully structured so that the rules which govern its efficient administration are no more extensive than necessary to meet the desired industry goals of increasing almond sales and enhancing grower returns. The new program substantially increases the advertising and promotional activities for which handlers can receive credit against their assessment obligations. At the same time, it decreases the number of reporting deadlines and recordkeeping requirements imposed on handlers. Cal-Almond further asserted that the Department does not have the authority to regulate how handlers pay growers and that the new Credit-Back program's elimination of the provision which allowed handlers to receive a 150% credit against the promotional advertising portion of their assessments because of concerns about grower returns was therefore arbitrary and capricious. The commenter contended that: (1) the Almond Marketing Order does not permit the Department to insure that growers receive a certain amount of returns on their products, and (2) the Order does not permit the Department to become involved in contracts which handlers have with their growers. Contrary to the commenter's assertions, the interim final rule establishing the new Credit-Back program does not specify how handlers should pay almond growers, nor does it seek to regulate the returns which growers receive for their almonds. It is, however, the Act's intent that marketing orders help growers and handlers to work together to solve problems which affect their industry. Thus, industry practices which have a potentially negative effect on growers should be considered when making recommendations on changes to marketing order regulations. Cal-Almond and another independent almond handler, Western Nut Company, also commented that the new Credit-Back program requires handlers to make expenditures of $3 in order to get back $1, thus placing an incredible financial burden on handlers. Cal-Almond stated that this, in turn, will reduce handlers' initial payments to growers. In addition, independent almond handler, John Rotteveel on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, indicated that he did not believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any investment in the program. Grant Ecker on behalf of Waterford Nut Company, stated the new Credit-Back program places a larger economic burden on small handlers than the old program did.
