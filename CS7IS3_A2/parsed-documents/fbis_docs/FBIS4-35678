An informed official at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant gave an interview to the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI in which he announced the above. He said: Following the preliminary agreements made with the Russians in the last few months, construction to complete the first unit of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts of electrical power began early this year with a four-year schedule. Russian experts and specialists are now working on this power plant. He added: So far 30,000 tons of essential parts for the power plant have been shipped into the country from Germany and are being properly stored in warehouses. At the same time, unfortunately about 7,000 tons of the power plant's essential parts, whose price has been paid and legally belong to the Islamic Republic of Iran, have been impounded in German ports. Continuing, this informed official noted: Fortunately, 90 percent of the damage to the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant caused by the imposed war will be repaired by the capable hands of skilled domestic specialist manpower, and the rest will be repaired in the course of the plant's operation. It is necessary to explain that the 5.8-billion-mark [DM] contract to build the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant was signed on 10 Tir 1355 [1 July 1976] between the Iran Atomic Energy Organization and the West German Kraft Werk Union Company. Based on this contract, the aforementioned company was required to build a nuclear electrical power plant consisting of two pressurized light water units, each with a thermal capacity of 3,715 thermic megawatts [MW] and an electrical capacity of 1,296 MW on an 18-km site in the southwestern part of the province of Bushehr. Of this amount, so far DM5.8 billion has been paid by Iran. In addition to this, separate contracts have also been signed to procure the needed fuel and 200,000 cubic meters of drinking water for this complex, for which more than DM137 million and DM394,000 and $43 million, respectively, has been paid to Germany by the Iran Atomic Energy Organization. Based on the same report, to implement these contracts so far about 85 percent of the construction on the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant has been completed, and about 65 percent of its mechanical, electrical, and other installations have been installed. On the other hand, in KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's contact with the office of Engineer Mohsen Mehr 'Alizadeh, general manager of power plants for the Iran Atomic Energy Organization, it was announced that the full details of Iran's contract with the Russians to complete the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant will soon be announced.
