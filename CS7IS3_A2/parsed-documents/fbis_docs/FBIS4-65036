Idiz] [Text] Ankara--The allied force deployed in Turkey under "Operation Provide Comfort," for protecting Northern Iraqi Kurds, should go because it sets a precedent for countries such as Russia to intervene in other areas, a senior Iranian official said on Wednesday [4 May]. First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, brother of Iranian president Hashemi-Rafsanjani, added that there was no longer a risk of Iraqi aggression because it had lost its economic and military strength and was alone in the world today. Hashemi, answering questions by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS and the daily HURRIYET after two days of political consultations in Ankara with his Turkish counterpart, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ozdem Sanberk, also said that the deployment of foreign troops in Turkey could lead to regional crises but did not elaborate. On the Bosnian question Hashemi said that Turkey and Iran had to work together to seek a way for Islamic countries to send arms to the Bosnian Muslims, who are faced with murder while international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO simply looked on. Referring to his contacts in Ankara, Hashemi said that this was his first visit abroad after his appointment as First Deputy Foreign Minister and suggested that this signalled the importance his country attached to Turkey. He said that the need for enhancing economic, commercial and industrial ties between the two countries was one of the bilateral topics discussed at the Ankara talks. Hashemi said that the sides had also agreed on the need to enhance cultural ties which have been noticeably low in the past. Indicating that security matters were among the priority issues discussed when taking up bilateral issues, Hashemi said the cooperation in this sphere between Iran and Turkey "had reached the desired level." "The Turkish side has thanked Iran for its close interest in this area. They are happy that we have returned PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] militants to Turkey and I will convey their satisfaction in this area to Iran" he said. Hashemi was referring to the recent extradition of militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is fighting a separatist war in southeast Anatolia, and which has used Iranian territory as a refuge and a base for mounting attacks against Turkey. Hashemi also said that they had agreed during the talks on the need to increase the number of high level contacts between the two countries in the security field. Pointing out that Iraq was one of the topics discussed at great length, Hashemi said that the two countries agreed that the territorial integrity of Iraq had to be preserved. Hashemi indicated that there was a consultative mechanism between Turkey, Iran and Syria for assessing developments in Iraq and Northern Iraq. "We are bothered by the presence of foreigners in the region. This problem can only be solved with the participation of regional countries. The problem can not be solved without Turkey and Iran" Hashemi said, making a clear reference to Operation Provide Comfort. He added that Iran also wanted to see more contacts and more activity between his country, Turkey and Syria under the "triple mechanism" set up to discuss Iraq. He said that Tehran wanted to have these contacts not just at the level of foreign ministers as has been the case to date but also at other levels. Asked how the deterrence provided by Provide Comfort could be replaced if this force left Turkey, Hashemi said "they had their serious doubts" about this whole matter. He said that if foreign forces are to be deployed in the region, as they have been in Turkey, then this could set a precedent for countries such as Russia to intervene in other areas. "Although the Soviet Union has gone, today's Russia has pulled itself together militarily and has significant military power at its disposal. It comes out in the press from time to time that Russia wants to intervene in Azerbaijan, and it has intervened in Tajikistan" Hashemi said, clearly reflecting his country's concern about developments in the former Soviet Union. Hashemi also said that "public opinion" was also opposed to the presence of foreign troops in the region although he did not mention which country's public opinion he was referring to. "If public opinion does not want to see foreign soldiers in the region, then this means that whatever foreign troops there are in the region are there by force" he said. Hashemi added that they saw "no necessity for these forces to be in the region." "If we look at Iraq today it is no longer the Iraq of seven or eight years ago. Both economically and in terms of its military power Iraq is in a difficult situation today. It does not have its old power. Apart from this, eight years ago Iraq used to receive international assistance from many countries. Many countries would supply it with arms and many countries, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, would give it financial assistance. But today this support does not exist. Iraq has been left on its own" he said. Hashemi added that Iraq had failed to get what it wanted after eight or nine years of fighting with Iran as it had failed to secure anything from its attack on Kuwait. "So Iraq has lost its strength and contrary to what is thought and claimed, it cannot rise and threaten the region again. Especially not when there is a strong Turkey next to it on one side and Iran on the other." He said because of this they saw no need for foreign forces in the region. "The presence of foreign forces, in my opinion, has also caused concerns in Turkey. We are aware of these concerns. I think the presence of these foreign forces can in the future leave the region facing problems. They can force a crisis in the region. I think their presence there, rather than acting as a deterrent is for creating problems in order to lead the region into a crisis." Hashemi also said that Iraq country was suffering greatly from the U.N. imposed embargo and this necessitated the lifting of the embargo. He underscored, however, that it was incumbent on Iraq--whose policies he said had destabilized the region by its great mistakes--to comply with U.N. resolutions for the embargo to be lifted. Referring to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan Hashemi said that Armenian forces which had invaded Azeri territory had to withdraw immediately. Reflecting the ongoing tension between Tehran and Yerevan because of the recent downing of an Iranian plane over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, allegedly by Armenians, Hashemi referred to Armenian attacks in the region as "brutal." He said that these were the results of a plan of "those enemies of Islam who are against stability in the region" but did not elaborate on the countries whose plan this was. Hashemi said that there was a need to solve the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave within Azerbaijan, by means of the mediation of countries that both sides could trust. Asked if he thought recent positive developments in ties between Turkey and Iran--which have often been strained in the past--were due to a convergence of regional interests forcing the two countries into a "strategic relationship" Hashemi said, "I agree with your assessment on this." He said that both Iran and Turkey were important countries in the region and they were working together for regional economic and political stability.
