FR940919-2-00152 FR940919-2-00061 [Docket No. 03016055] Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (Byproduct License No. 34&hyph;19089&hyph;01); Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Staff has received a Petition dated August 19, 1994, filed by William B. Schatz, on behalf of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (``Petitioner'' or ``NEORSD''). The Petition requests, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206, that the NRC take action with regard to Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (AMS), to amend AMS's License No. 34&hyph;19089&hyph;01 to require AMS to install, maintain, and operate a radiation alarm system on all drains at 1020 London Road, Cleveland, Ohio (AMS Facility) that lead to either sanitary or storm sewers. Petitioner asserts as the bases for this request that it views the quantity of cobalt-60 waste in the basement of the AMS facility as a major threat; that the NRC admits that the existing contamination at the AMS Facility continues to pose a risk; that the contamination that exists at the AMS Facility is estimated to be 393 curies of loose, ``talcum-like'' cobalt scattered upon the floor of the waste hold-up room in the basement; that cobalt-60 contamination was found in the sewer line connecting the AMS Facility to the public sewer and was found in the public sewer directly under the AMS discharge; that the NEORSD has already incurred costs of nearly $2 million addressing loose cobalt-60 contamination at its Easterly and Southerly Wastewater treatment plants; that the NRC has been unable or unwilling to explain the source of the cobalt-60 on the NEORSD property and unable to identify any likely sources for the cobalt-60 other than the AMS Facility; that the quantity of cobalt-60 at the Southerly Plant exceeds that which the AMS records show was released by AMS into the sewer system; and that License Amendment No. 10 to the original license for this site, issued to Picker in 1962, contained a requirement for an alarm system to detect unmonitored discharges. The Petitioner states that such an alarm system was not a condition of the subsequent AMS license despite a recommendation from Oak Ridge Associated Universities that such an alarm system be installed along with control valves to shut off flow to the sewer if the alarm sounds. The Petition has been referred to the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. As provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken with regard to the specific issue raised by the Petition in a reasonable time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2110 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of September 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Robert M. Bernero, Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
