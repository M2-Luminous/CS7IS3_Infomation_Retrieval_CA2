He believes that there may be an "electoral readjustment" in light of a second round. Angeloz stated that the runoff system gives the UCR "a better election chance than before," although he said it now depends on whether the main opposition force "can recompose itself and define an absolutely positive party on the basis of stability, not on inflation, and on the basis of clear guidelines of growth, security, and dialogue for the country." The Cordoba governor and head of the UCR's Political Action Commission (CAP) reiterated that the UCR is "an instrument that is completely out of tune," adding that he has been given the role of "tuner, seeking to get the orchestra together so that its members can look each other in the eye and have room to rehearse." This morning, when talking to a radio station, he referred to the presidential elections, saying: "We are trying to tune the instrument to faithfully play the concert" in 1995. Referring to the topic of federal coparticipation, he indicated that it "is good because it lets one know how much of the nation's cake is being eaten by each province." He recalled that in 1987, when the Cordoba Province Constitution was modified, he "tenaciously" opposed "a clause that would have established how much the municipalities were to participate in coparticipation." He admitted he "was mistaken at the time," adding that he believes the clause "helped to balance the social tensions provoked by the municipalities because now they know that when they draft their budgets, 20 percent of the corresponding coparticipation is shared out among municipalities. They know, therefore, what to expect." Angeloz reiterated that the country's trade deficit, which is estimated to total $6 billion this year, is "a red alert." He believes "the pillars of economic progress will begin to crack." He said the government "has completely disregarded health and educational processes, tossing them to the provinces where there has been a rise of about 500,000 unemployed following the implementation of the convertibility plan and where poverty has increased considerably." "We, the provinces represented in the CAP, are affected, pained, and concerned that the topics of education and health are forgotten by the nation, including crises in many sectors and regions of the country that are watching the map of poverty expand," he added. The head of the CAP, who on 8 June presided over its first meeting, said: "One's attention is called to the possibility that imports will amount to $20 billion, while exports will only amount to $14 billion." "There is a total lack of encouragement to achieve the necessary hard foreign exchange for our exports and the tasks we carry out abroad," he said. Angeloz said the objectives of the new organization are "to achieve a cordial atmosphere, to shorten distances, and to clear proposals in order to reorganize the future of the party." He asserted: "It will not become an organization parallel to the party's National Committee," adding that its goal is "harmony of proposals, conduct, and attitudes."
