None of the treaties with the former Union republics has probably elicited such conflicting and sometimes diametrically opposed assessments inside and outside Russia. And these contradictions are based in fact, so to speak -- in the supremely equivocal situation in the Caucasus. In his play "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" Brecht used an ancient legend allegorically to demonstrate the essence of this region's fierce disputes over power and land. A guy over whom two women are fighting is placed in a chalk circle. Each of the women is asked to take him by the hand and pull him to her. Needless to say, the woman who is afraid of hurting the boy gives in. The one who loves him more. Regrettably, this wisdom is beyond the political forces now operating in the Caucasus. In order to possess territory and assert their authority they are ready to inflict suffering on thousands and thousands of people and literally tear this truly beautiful country to bits. What role should Russia play in the Caucasus, a zone of its vital interests (there is no point spelling that out today)? Moscow cannot be the judge who settles the fierce conflicts over Abkhazia and South Ossetia in accordance with its own ideas of justice. But nor can it simply watch the bloody fighting. Because the Caucasian republics of Russia itself are already directly involved in these conflicts. Because if the coals of these conflicts are allowed to continue smoldering, the fire may break out with renewed vigor if not today then tomorrow and spread to southern areas of Russia. I think that Russia's main vital interest in this region at the moment is to ensure peace and stability in the Caucasus. And this interest can only be realized by mediating in the settlement process and acting as guarantor of the accords to be secured. This is no easy matter. It is no coincidence that most Western powers are in effect ignoring the calls from Georgia for them to act in a similar way. The obvious failure of Russian mediation last year ahead of the latest outbreak of hostilities culminating in the storming of Sukhumi is convincing evidence that this task cannot be accomplished just like that. In my view, one of the reasons for this failure was the fact that Moscow was unable to provide the parties to the conflict with real incentives to find a political solution. For Georgia its treaty with Russia might be just such an incentive. But there must be no illusions here. This will only happen if the present phase of our relations is cleansed of starry-eyed idealism and sentimentality. I was so touched by one Tbilisi leader's recent statement to the effect that after a period of alienation the two countries have finally looked one another in the face. No, the truth is that over the last few years Georgia has ostentatiously turned its back on Russia. And it is only now, bogged down by conflict, a crime wave, and total economic collapse, that it has figuratively speaking looked in the mirror. What it saw was so impressive that it had no other option than to try to integrate itself within the CIS and initiate normal dialogue with Moscow. The truth is that the incumbent authorities in Georgia, rent by internal conflict and clashes, were incapable of ensuring even the normal working of the state. They now see the restoration of their ties with Russia as their salvation. And Russia certainly needs Georgia. In order to tackle strategic problems -- guarding the CIS external border and safeguarding the Russian troops' secure legal and economic status. So, Moscow today has every chance of safeguarding its own interests in the region. Especially since they coincide, if not with the politicians' interests then certainly with the interests of the normal people living there. Obviously aid in resolving Georgia's economic and military problems should be conditional upon Tbilisi's taking a constructive approach to the political resolution of the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. If that is clear, the development of Russian-Georgian relations will not give rise to suspicion and objections from the other parties to the conflicts. In my view, the realization that the treaty signed in Tbilisi can only be ratified once a political settlement has been secured in Abkhazia and South Ossetia would be a good incentive for Tbilisi to seek a reasonable compromise. Russia's endeavor to provide Abkhazia and South Ossetia with the kind of status that would safeguard as far as possible the rights and interests of the people living there should act as an incentive for the other parties to the conflicts. And there is a normal civilized means of attaining this objective. State competence can be divided up when a new Georgian Constitution is developed. And in that case representatives of Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be enlisted to work on this constitution unconditionally. Finally, I cannot help but mention military issues. It is quite natural for Russia to only provide any aid in creating a Georgian army once a real political settlement has been secured. This settlement will necessitate wide-ranging peacekeeping operations. It is clear that Russia will have to bear the full burden here. But all the sides must provide firm guarantees that the agreements will be fulfilled. Moreover, pledges to stop the activity of those military formations which are jeopardizing the security of Russian troops are essential. Today purely opportunistic talk regarding the danger of the revival of the "Russian empire" can be heard in Georgia and the West. I do not doubt that the rigid formulation of the question of Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus gives them fresh ammunition. However, I do not think that one should pay attention to them now. If they could get by without Russia, they would probably do so. If not, then Moscow should set the terms. There is obviously an internal aspect to Russia's policy in the Caucasus today. In order for this policy to be effective a unified concept is needed not only for government departments, but also for the government and parliament. This policy needs the backing of Russia's regions. Judging by the adverse reaction to the treaty with Georgia from most State Duma factions and, most importantly, the suspicious reaction from the Federation Council, this has not proved possible to achieve. So, Russia itself must decide on its Caucasian policy. There is every indication that we have left behind the period of theoretical disputes over whether or not the post-Soviet area is an area of Russia's vital interests. Clearly it is. Today the whole point is what means Russia has at its disposal to safeguard these interests. The Caucasus will be a difficult test of this concept. And Moscow must also find out if it is possible to erase the chalk circle that has been the scene of hatred and mutual suspicion.
