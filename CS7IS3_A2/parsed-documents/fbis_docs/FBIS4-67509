Take the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Soviet, for example, Back in 1989 it approved a list of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in which conservation areas were to be set up before the year 2000. The planning was supposed to be completed this year. But none of the work is being monitored, so one cannot expect any early results. The riverbank situation in the Volga basin is no less lamentable. There are piles of scrap metal, domestic garbage, and dung. At the moment there are around 3,000 livestock units in the vicinity of the Volga basin rivers discharging effluent and waste directly into rivers because they have no treatment plants. But the saddest thing of all is to see the small amounts of money allocated by the state for ecological purposes being squandered and plundered. For instance, in Aktanyshskiy Rayon, Republic of Tatarstan, as a result of the erosion of the banks of a stream called the Syun, three livestock burial grounds are in danger of being exposed, and one of them is infected with anthrax. The money that was intended for riverbank reinforcement work and for the removal of the livestock burial grounds to sites outside the conservation area has been used by the rayon administration for other purposes. What can change the situation, I believe, is the elaboration of new statutes on water conservation areas
