V. Gusev, St. Petersburg; UDC 910.3:551.59:(621.311.22:621.039)] [Abstract] This article discusses the intermediate climatic effects of atomic power plants on the environment. The plant used as an example is the Leningrad atomic power plant, which has a boiling-water uranium-graphite reactor. The two main factors affecting the environment are the release of radioactive materials from the stack, and the release of hot water into a natural body of water (in this case a section of the Gulf of Finland). The classification of accidents in the Russian system and the IAEA is contrasted. The Russian system has two levels of accident: one which can be handled automatically by the plant (which the plant is designed for), and the other is a catastrophic accident. The accident of the Leningrad plant on 24 March 1992 is used as an example. The table presents maximum permissible concentrations of emissions for a stack height of 100 m. The figure gives dosage versus distance data for fallout of iodine from a radioactive cloud. A formula is presented to calculate possible ground level concentrations of contaminants.
