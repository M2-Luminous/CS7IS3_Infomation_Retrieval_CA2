During its fifth meeting, the cabinet continued its discussion of some economic issues that were debated during the previous meetings. When the issue of economic inflation was raised, the leader president made some remarks, saying: The Iraqi performance in terms of production and reconstruction, despite this artificial and transient inflation in the Iraqi economy, has been promoted over the past few years, thanks to the Iraqis' minds, as well as their role in building the future. The leader president added: As you are well aware, the reconstruction drive has been carried out thanks to legendary efforts made in a legendary time period, and at low cost. This is especially true if such a drive were to be conducted by foreign companies. Many times the time spent and cost sustained would have to be made available to such companies if the results achieved by the Iraqi national endeavor were to be attained. Additionally, Iraq's wealth has remained intact. It is still underground. None of it has been disbursed. It has not fallen under the domination of foreign colonialist powers. Nor has it been plundered by these powers. Moreover, oil installations have been rebuilt. Oil is ready to be exported once the embargo is lifted. His excellency the president went on to say: He who makes a naive comparison between the exchange rate of the dinar and that of the dollar is gravely mistaken. For can a man live on two dollars in the United States, or even on 10 dollars, and still eat meat? The leader president said: So, this is not the real value of the Iraqi dinar. For, the Iraqi dinar is supported by a broad and extensive base of work, activities, and accomplishments, not to mention the ration card, free education, health services, and other services. It is true that the price of 10 dollars is too much if these dollars were to be exchanged for dinars. But, as a matter of fact, Iraqis can, by paying an equivalent of 100 dollars, buy more commodities and services than those Americans can buy by paying 100 dollars. The exception to this concerns the prices of certain imported commodities. The Council then discussed red tape at state departments and its side effects. His excellency the president addressed the cabinet ministers: The disequilibrium in public offices has not emerged overnight. Likewise, we realize that it is impossible to correct it in a single day. Nonetheless, the level of your hard work at present is being felt by all citizens, who feel that their state has become more active and vibrant. To correct mistakes in administrative functions, we need to focus on some aspects concerning citizens' affairs and transactions in order to simplify them. In the same vein, we need to work energetically and actively to correct the mistakes and deviations rapidly and firmly, because this is required by the phase we are experiencing. If we do so, this will deter those who make mistakes and hearten correctors. Consequently, the determination will grow further. We want your resolve to be at a high level on the first day. We want you to demonstrate greater vigor until the day the remedial action is completed. This is because any weakness in resolve will bring about new deviations. So, what is required now is determination, increased determination, and stronger determination. The leader president said: The emergence of some deviations in our country causes us harm. It also harms the march, which you and your people seek to safeguard. Hence, we must work to make the deviant constantly feel that he will not go unpunished regardless of how long this might take. Your handling of red tape should not be guided by conventional methods. The minister himself must personally examine all transactions that concern citizens step by step. He must delve into details, cut back on the required procedures, paperwork, and references as much as he can. He must set a time limit for this, and submit proposals if necessary to amend regulations or laws. Likewise, he must submit a copy of the measures he thinks can reduce red tape to the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers so we may discuss them at our cabinet meetings.
