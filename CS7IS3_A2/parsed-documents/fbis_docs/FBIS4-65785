"This decade has shown that the changes are unpredictable and the reform difficult to foresee. Therefore, the words of Field Marshal Augustin Ehrensvard, which are inscribed at the entrance to the coastal fortification Suomenlinna, still hold true: `Coming generations, stand on your own feet and do not trust help from outside!'"
