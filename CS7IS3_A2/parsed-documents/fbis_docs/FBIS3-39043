Ethnocentrism"] [Text] The U.S. recognition of the small state of Skopje with its temporary name, which is expected within the next few hours, and our country's endorsement of the European Union [EU] decision on possible air bombings in Bosnia are not offered for domestic opposition nor for trying to be more nationalist than the next fellow. It happens that in both cases, in which we are called upon to accept or support decisions unfavorable to our country, the positions of our political parties are almost identical. No party and no Greek agrees with the air bombing in Bosnia, which would bring the disaster of the war to our borders. At the same time, there is no Greek who is not unhappy with Washington's decision to proceed with the recognition of the small state that tries to usurp the name of Macedonia. This unity of political positions and popular will represents at this time our most significant national advantage, which we ought to utilize and promote and not downgrade or sacrifice on the altar of petty political expediency and partisan prejudice. What weight (or rather political responsibility) could be used now to urge the exercise of a Greek veto in NATO or the cancellation of an EU decision--even by "utilizing" the Greek presidency--with regard to the possible bombing of Bosnia? At the same time, what political seriousness is there in suggestions for public disapproval and condemnation of Washington's imminent action as hostile to our country? Fortunately, the ordinary Greek citizen understands and realizes the restructuring changes taking place worldwide and feels particularly lucky because he belongs to the European family in which nobody--even the strongest partner--can impose his will unilaterally. In this same family, however, even the weakest member has the right to demand equality of the Community's political, social, and economic rights or achievements and, what is most important, to entrust his national security to a political solidarity and defense partnership of the Twelve, things that are safeguarded by treaties. In a similar spirit, a certain part of the Greek people have overcome their past bitterness, which suffered from an anti-American and anti-NATO syndrome. These people managed to overcome this position by merely asking themselves "how is it and why" are Albania, Bulgaria, and Skopje today hotly pursuing admission to NATO (to refer only to our bordering neighbors who until very recently belonged to the "enemy" camp)? Could it be that this simple--but not naive--question should force the remaining supporters of pure ethnocentrism to ponder things irrespective of their right-wing or left-wing origin? This is so because their recommendations finally lead to the same result: our international isolation and national weakening....
