Chaired by Charles Thomas, ambassador in the United States Department of State, and by Jean-Paul Carteron, president of the Forum Foundation, the session occasioned a presentation of opinions regarding the Partnership for Peace. In his address, Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian minister of defense, stressed that the Partnership for Peace was the sole initiative to start the evolution process that could ensure security in Central and Eastern Europe, while Romania's adherence was proving the will to integrate within European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Approaching the political dimension of the initiative, the speaker stressed that the ensurance of indirect guarantees for security could eliminate any discrimination among states, but in the conditions of tempering integration at various speeds, that could lead to new separation marks on the continent, so that the security of any country should not be conceived to the detriment of other countries participating in the partnership. In the opinion of Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), the Partnership for Peace is a serious step towards NATO's widening and consolidation. Stressing from the very beginning on the need for security, Jean Freymond, director of the Geneva Center for Practical Studies on International Negotiations, assessed that the Eastern and Central European countries should not indulge in illusions of joining NATO, "illusions that might be turned tomorrow into disappointment". The conclusions over the debates were however optimistic, the Partnership for Peace being viewed as a fundamental contribution to the security and stability, to consolidation of democratic structures and of the process of transition in Central and Eastern European states.
