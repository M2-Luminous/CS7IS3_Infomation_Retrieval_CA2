FR941202-0-00121 FR941202-0-00012 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Current Drug Testing Requirements In 1988, the Department of Transportation issued six final rules mandating anti drug programs for certain transportation workers in the aviation, interstate motor carrier, pipeline, maritime and transit industries, and expanded the requirements of the existing FRA rule. The rules included requirements for education, training, testing and sanctions. The testing component of each program included pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion (reasonable cause), periodic (for those subject to periodic medical examinations), random, and return to duty drug testing for approximately four million workers in safety-sensitive positions. After a phase-in of one year, the random testing provisions of the rule required a minimum testing rate of at least 50 percent per year. Implementation of the testing requirements was delayed in FTA and FHWA due to litigation. Employers regulated by FHWA began random testing of interstate drivers in 1991 and 1992, and will begin random testing of intrastate drivers in 1995 and 1996. FTA will begin random testing of large transit operators in 1995 and small transit operators in 1996. Current Alcohol Testing Requirements On February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7302), the FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA and RSPA published final rules limiting alcohol use by transportation workers. Four of the OA rules (FAA, FHWA, FRA and FTA) were required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. RSPA adopted similar, but more limited requirements, based on its own statutory authority. The FAA, FHWA, FRA and FTA rules require random testing of safety-sensitive employees in those industries. The rules provide for an initial minimum random alcohol testing rate of 25 percent. The industry's (e.g., aviation, motor carrier, rail or transit) random alcohol rate may be adjusted based on a performance standard related to its random alcohol violation rate. Because of safety concerns, two years of data are necessary to justify lowering the random alcohol testing rate; one year of data is sufficient to raise it. The OA (in conjunction with the OST Office of Drug Enforcement and Program Compliance) will review the data and announce in the Federal Register the minimum annual random alcohol testing rate applicable in the calendar year following publication. If the industry violation rate is 1 percent or greater during a given year, the random alcohol testing rate will be 50 percent for the calendar year following the OA Administrator's announcement that the rate must change. If the industry violation rate is less than 1 percent but greater than 0.5 percent during a given year (for two years if currently at 50 percent), the random alcohol testing rate will be 25 percent for the calendar year following the OA Administrator's announcement that the rate must change. If the industry violation rate is less than 0.5 percent during a given year (for two years if testing at a higher rate), the random alcohol testing rate will be 10 percent the next calendar year. The ANPRM On December 15, 1992 (57 FR 59778), DOT published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) requesting public comment and submission of data concerning whether there are less costly alternatives to the current random testing program that can maintain an adequate level of deterrence and detection of illegal drug use. The ANPRM asked for comment on a number of alternatives to the current 50 percent random testing rate that DOT could consider. These alternatives included: (1) Making an across-the-board modification of the rate for all DOT anti-drug programs; (2) Modifying how the random testing rate is implemented (e.g., frequency of testing, etc.); (3) Making a selective modification of the rate by: (a) operating administration (e.g., FAA or FRA could modify its rate); (b) job category (e.g., pilots, train engineers); (c) any other category that warranted a different rate based on drug use prevalence or other factors (e.g., age or geographic region); (4) Establishing a performance standard program; (5) Permitting employers who take specified additional steps to deter drug use to reduce their random testing rate; (6) Modifying the random testing rate for all operating administration rules for a specific time period, subject to reconsideration after the results are analyzed; (7) Conducting demonstration programs in each operating administration before further action is taken; or (8) Combining some of the alternatives. Comments to the ANPRM Over 115 comments were filed in response to the ANPRM. Commenters included governmental agencies, trade associations, regulated entities, unions, contractors and consultants, and individuals. Suggestions ranged from abolition of all random testing requirements to greatly increasing the current 50 percent testing rate.
