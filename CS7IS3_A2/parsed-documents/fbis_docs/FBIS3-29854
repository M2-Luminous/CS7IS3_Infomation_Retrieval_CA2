Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, told reporters Tuesday his ministry will promote the development of a digital HDTV system to replace NHK's hi-vision system. The remark stirred protests from Japanese consumer electronics companies, which are already selling hi-vision television sets. Egawa said Wednesday the ministry supports the continuation of NHK's experimental hi-vision broadcasts, to be followed by full broadcasts.
