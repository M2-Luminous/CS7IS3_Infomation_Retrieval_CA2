The executives were key members of a cartel of 66 contractors including Kajima in Saitama Prefecture. They attempted to solicit Nakamura's cooperation in blocking a probe by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) into suspected bid-rigging practices. Prosecutors have questioned some executives of the contractors as witnesses, the sources said. Nakamura, after being stripped by the Diet of his parliamentary immunity from arrest, was arrested Friday on suspicion of receiving a 10 million yen bribe from Kajima's former senior vice president, Shinji Kiyoyama, in January 1992. Kiyoyama, who is now on trial on charges of sending bribes to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, 76, was rearrested Tuesday for reportedly passing the bribe to Nakamura. The money was allegedly intended as a reward for Nakamura exerting his influence to help block an accusation by the FTC against the cartel over the scheme to rig bids on public works projects in Saitama Prefecture. The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an accusation with prosecutors, and instead ordered the contractors to stop the collusive activities. FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases of violating the antimonopoly law.
