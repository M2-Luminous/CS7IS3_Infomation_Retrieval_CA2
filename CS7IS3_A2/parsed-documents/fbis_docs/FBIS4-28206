In his speech made on World Environment Day, the head of the royal government said he wanted a law on environmental protection to be promulgated. "The war, which has lasted for over two decades, has destroyed the environment in the country," said Prince Norodom Ranariddh. "This," he said, "would plunge Cambodia into the abyss of disaster if we (the new generation) did not coordinate efforts to fight this crisis." The Cambodian leader recalled that the flood of 1991, exceptional for Cambodia, was one of the consequences of environmental destruction. The prince wanted severe measures to be taken to protect the environment, and he invited Cambodians to follow him in that direction. Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh pledged to implement the UN environmental program. He thanked international organizations for helping to save Cambodia's environment.
