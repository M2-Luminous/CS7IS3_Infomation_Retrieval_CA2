Prior to this provocative war exercise, EA-6 electronic jamming planes, which had been flown in from a Japanese base, created an electronic jam by flying into the areas over Yongwol and Pyongchang--the operational areas. Timed with this, E-3 early warning planes mobilized from overseas bases ran amok in waging an exercise of launching a surprise bombing by calling air squadrons [pihaengdaedul] out, while flying in the air where an electronic jam had been created. Converged into this extremely dangerous war were air squadrons which had come from U.S. Pacific bases and fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, and (?reconnaissance) planes belonging to the U.S. occupation air force in South Korea and to the puppet air force. In the meantime, the puppet Army's 105-mm artillery group, which held firing positions in Mago-ri, Yonchon County; and Naedae-ri, Chorwon County and (Tajon-ni), Inje County, Kangwon Province of South Korea, displayed that day a war frenzy by firing several tens of rounds at the areas near the DMZ of the Military Demarcation Line.
