[Al-Majali] When it was first formed, this government, which I had the honor of leading, began a new experiment, what we call separation of executive and legislative powers, and no one from the House of Representatives took part in it. The experiment was very good. The non-presence of a deputy in that government or in any government should not be interpreted as preventing deputies from being ministers. This is totally wrong. There is a large number of deputies who have the capability of performing successful ministerial work. Under the new reshuffle, 10 new deputies from various parliamentary blocs and various provinces in Jordan joined the cabinet. Eight new members also entered the cabinet so this is a cabinet reshuffle, not reformation. We always believe in a measure like in the military; a group or platoon is in the trenches and is replaced by another group and the process is repeated. We have a good rotation process and most times it bears fruit. Of course, it has some negative aspects, but it also has good, positive aspects. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] But surely you have a specific view of a new phase that Jordan will witness in light of this new cabinet reshuffle. [Al-Majali] As you know, the entire region is experiencing a delicate phase covering a regional order and the so-called Middle Eastern market. Al these issues are delicate and require very close cooperation between the executive and legislative authorities and require the whole country to stand together and envisage a good future for the state. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving from the cabinet reshuffle to the peace talks, there is a Jordanian-Israeli negotiations committee holding its sessions in Washington to discuss the border and participation in water resources. Let us learn about Jordan's view put forth by that committee. [Al-Majali] As you know, Jordan signed an agenda with Israel on 14 September last year and the agenda is clear, especially in the bases on which it relied. Of course, the basic topics of that agenda include the withdrawal from the Jordanian territories, our right to water, and the issue of refugees and the displaced, in addition to various other topics. It was agreed to list these issues in an agenda to enable us to negotiate on them and the bilateral talks assumed this task. Even in the negotiations on the four tracks, the Arab brothers agreed that each track has its own characteristics and thus its progress should be different but what is important is that all tracks should make the final line. Before the negotiations stopped because of the Hebron incident, there was an agreement to form a tripartite U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli committee to discuss a host of issues, including those listed on the agenda. We received information that Israel is now ready to form a joint committee to demarcate the border correctly prior to withdrawal from the Jordanian territories and committees to discuss legitimate shares of water. These two basic points have always been on the agenda but we were unable to initiate their discussion seriously. Through the tripartite committee we are now able to do that and hence came the meetings in Washington to emphasize these points and put the agreement into a mechanism [last word in English]. According to the agenda, the two sides should agree on a mechanism and phases for the negotiations to proceed on each topic. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Israeli suggests that a new road linking 'Aqabah and Elat be opened. What is Jordan's stand on this proposal? [Al-Majali] There are many points on the agenda that stipulates that all parties should cooperate in projects in the region that are beneficial to all sides concerned. These projects include, for example, a canal between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea and a road linking Egypt and Jordan via Elat. These are projects for the future and the discussion now is on whether they can or cannot be examined. There is an agreement to study these projects. ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Moving on to Arab issues, what preoccupies the Arab arena is the current situation in Yemen. What is Jordan's view on what is happening in Yemen? [Al-Majali] Jordan's stand is firm and has not changed since the problem began when the president and vice president asked His Majesty King Husayn to help them resolve the issue between them. A dialogue committee was formed, the Amman accord was concluded, and what happened afterward is known. We believe in unity. We have an absolute faith in unity and do not believe in separation because a separation that takes place in Yemen might take place in any other Arab country. We are against this. We are not against the south at all but against the idea of separation. We support unity and oppose infighting no matter what the reason.
