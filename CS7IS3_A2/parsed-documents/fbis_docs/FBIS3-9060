The topic of their conversation centered on information that appeared in certain papers over the weekend about NATO reconnaissance planes staying in Hungary's airspace and their role in settling the Bosnian crisis. [Begin Woerner recording, in English fading into Hungarian translation] First, allow me to state that the information I have heard up till now is misleading and does not represent the official NATO stance. Now I will outline our organization's official stance: What NATO is doing is not a war maneuver; it is only supporting and asserting those prohibitive resolutions the United Nations has taken. These two resolutions are No. 781 and No. 816, which prescribe a military ban for entire nations and regional organizations. What NATO is doing is to help the UN implement what it has decided. What Hungary has done, and is doing now as well, is to support the realization of the UN resolutions. I say once again: This is not a war maneuver, but an entire humanitarian action the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] are undertaking in Bosnia. This activity is not directed against any single side, but towards all those who violate the region's peace. Allow me to explain it this way. At the same time, I do not doubt for one moment that cooperation between the Hungarian Government and NATO is anything but excellent. We both respect the other's activity. Hungary is an independent nation. It can decide to cooperate, and it could also decide not to do so. We are satisfied with what your country has done, and we would like to continue to cooperate with your country. We have no doubt that our relations will continue in the future as well, since this is in the mutual interest of our organization and of your country. [end recording]
