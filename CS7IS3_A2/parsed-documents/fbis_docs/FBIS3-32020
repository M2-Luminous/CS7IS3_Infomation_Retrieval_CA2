In a press communique, the Senate, [especially] the ACP and the members elected 18 January [1993], has ordered the executive to choose a new prime minister within 48 hours after the 28 January publication of the communique. The Senate of the Republic reminds the Haitian nation that on 15 December 1993 the government of former Prime Minister Robert Malval officially tendered its resignation. The courageous Haitian citizens battling with misery and all kinds of calamities have vainly expected the designation of a new head of government who would truly look into their problems. The communique says that up to now, instead of constitutional actions aimed at putting the Republic back on track, our brothers who are our official representatives at the parliament have experienced trickery designed to perpetuate the unhealthy situation in which the country is still immersed. An example is Colin Granderson's letter of 12 January, sent to Robert Malval to inform him of his decision to have the initial elements of the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission return to Haiti. The Senate of the Republic energetically protests these tricks that Haiti's so-called friends have had fun playing, and focuses on Article 98.3 of the Constitution that requires international treaties and conventions to be submitted first to parliament for approval or rejection. The Senate reaffirms its determination as a responsible institution to control closely the actions taking place in the country, especially in this period of executive power vacuum. It believes it must also point out to the other powers and concerned authorities that if the executive power does not designate, within the next 48 hours, a new prime minister, who will have to be received shortly by parliament, the latter will be obliged to make the necessary decisions to safeguard national sovereignty. This note is signed by 14 senators, including ACP members, and 18 elected parliamentarians, excepting Senator Serge Gilles.
