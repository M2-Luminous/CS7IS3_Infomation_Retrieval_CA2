He noted that there are other issues that will be negotiated after signing the agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties on implementing self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. Regarding the Israeli-Syrian track, Peres stressed that Israel is serious about withdrawal from the Golan, although the size and limits of this withdrawal have not been determined. This came in a joint news conference held by Peres and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at noon today following their talks at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Discussing the Palestinian track, Peres said that it is possible to solve all pending issues this evening to open the way for signing an agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. He noted that the issues that will be left for negotiations after signing the agreement pertain to registration of papers, mail, telephones, naming and defining the powers of authorities, security issues, and two issues relating to legal jurisdiction. Regarding the Golan, Peres said that the size and limits of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan must be part of the negotiations. He noted that Warren Christopher may help to bring the Syrian and Israeli views closer. Christopher pointed out that he met with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat this morning and that he made sure that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations were making progress, although there are still certain issues that have not yet been settled. He said: "I want to emphasize that the Israelis and their Palestinian neighbors have some concerns about the future." He said that both the Israeli and Palestinian parties have recently suffered tragedies. This increases the importance of the role Peres and his colleagues are playing. He expressed his appreciation for the Israeli foreign minister and the negotiating team for their ceaseless search for peace. He voiced his hope that these endeavors will be capped with success. He stressed that establishing peace is the best thing to confront terrorism. Peres praised Christopher's persistent efforts to help achieve peace in the Middle East. He said: "I believe that these efforts are extremely important, particularly because we are coming close to the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians." He said: "The U.S. secretary of state's participation is important and is of considerable help to us." He noted that certain important issues remain to be discussed in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, noting that the negotiators need support and backing from the U.S. secretary of state, Yasir 'Arafat, and our friends in Egypt so that they may reach results. He said: "We are meeting in Cairo today to reach solutions to pending issues." Responding to a question on negotiations with Syria and what Israel will offer, Peres said: "We said, Prime Minister Rabin and I, that we are ready to withdraw from the Golan Heights or withdraw within the area. We did not define the limits or size of this withdrawal because this must be part of the negotiations." He added: "We believe that Christopher can bring both parties closer. "He expressed confidence that Christopher will bring closer the Israeli and Syrian parties and will take into account "all issues" and not only territory. He noted that these issues include security and the nature of peace. He said that general peace from a comprehensive perspective must involve all parties including the Palestinians. Peres said: We are serious regarding Syria. We want to achieve peace with Syria. Peace will not be comprehensive until it includes solving the problems with Syria. Peres expressed the belief that "there is no difference between the U.S. and Israeli aims toward peace in the region." Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli talks, Warren Christopher said: The basic issue now is helping the sides to reach an agreement. This is what we are working to achieve today. As the two sides have stated, they are very close to reaching this agreement. Once the agreement is ready, there will be a signing ceremony. Christopher said that the most important thing is that this agreement should enter the implementation phase. Commenting on Christopher's remarks, Peres said: There are some outstanding issues that we will discuss later today in an attempt to reach an agreement on them. Asked about Iran, Christopher expressed his "extreme anger" about the terrorism that Iran is planning, not only in the Middle East but also in other areas. He said: I believe this is one of the reasons the United States does not deal with Iran the way it cooperates with other states from the standpoint of giving them special economic privileges. Christopher added: We will not cooperate with the Iranians in this domain until they improve their behavior in various ways. He explained that this includes support for the peace process in the Middle East, which Iran rejects. He expressed the belief that "Iran deserves to be isolated." On Britain's stand on Iran, Christopher said he is not aware of any British plans toward Iran. However, he noted that he was in London recently. He believes Britain shares his concern regarding Iran. The talks between Christopher and Peres were held at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. They began with a separate meeting between Christopher and Peres, who were later joined by the members of the U.S. and Israeli delegations. The talks lasted 90 minutes.
