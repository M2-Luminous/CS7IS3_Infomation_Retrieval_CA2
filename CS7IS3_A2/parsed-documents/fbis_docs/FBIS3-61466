Shmartsev] [Abstract]A study is made of the processes which occur when GaAs layers are doped with a Zn acceptor impurity during liquid phase epitaxy from a Ga-Bi melted solution. The thickness of the GaAs : Zn or Bi epitaxial layers as a function of the melted solution composition is complex in nature. This is explained by the complicated form of the liquidus isotherm curves in the Ga-Bi- As system and the change in the mass transfer processes in the microinhomogenous liquid phase. The nature of the way atoms in the Zn mixture behave in epitaxial layers, in the substrates and in satellite substrates during the growth processes is researched by using photoluminescence methods with layer-by-layer stripping. An explanation is given for the nonlinear relationship of the concentration of Zn in GaAs layers versus the content of Bi in the Ga-Bi solvent. This explanation is associated with the change in the vacancy concentration in the gallium sublattice and the nature of the Zn diffusional transfer in the liquid phase. The constant doping level in the epitaxial GaAs layer with the given solvent composition shows that the basic doping mechanism is the capture of Zn impurity atoms from the liquid phase during the growth process.
