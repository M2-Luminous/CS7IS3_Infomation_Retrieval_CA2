Iran agreed with the Japanese trading firms, including Mitsui and Co. and Tomen Corp., to postpone payment of its trade debts due by March until 1996 to 1999, the source said. The agreement was reached after Iran promised it will put priority on using its crude oil revenues to pay back the debts, they said. Iran is delaying payment of a total of nearly 10 billion dollars in trade settlements, the sources said. In February, Germany agreed to allow Iran to defer such payments worth roughly 2.5 billion dollars.
