FBIS4-10210 "drlat068_b_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Invites Deputies To Install `New Power' Invites Deputies To Install `New Power' FL0704223094 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1600 GMT 7 Apr 94 FL0704223094 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] Professor Hubert de Ronceray, leader of the Mobilization for National Development, MDN, reacting to the cancellation of a conference with the presidents of the political blocs in the lower chamber, still believes it is up to the legislators to fill the institutional vacuum. The MDN leader, member of the Coordinating Committee, invites the legislators to cooperate in the installation of a new power. [Begin recording] [De Ronceray] I believe that the joint resolution is very clear. It says very clearly that we support a constitutional solution with application of Article 149 of the Constitution. But in case parliament refuses to follow up this constitutional demand, then parliament will be responsible for all favorable or unfavorable reactions that result from this refusal. We are therefore very sorry to see that those who are in charge of the defense of this country's Constitution, those who are mandated by the people to defend their rights, are threatening to drop the Constitution as they did so many times, but are also threatening to hasten the chaos. We hope that good sense will finally prevail. We invite all those in parliament, in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate, who still have minimal respect for this country, to accept their responsibilities and defend, tooth-and-nail, what is left of law and duty for senators and deputies. [Francois] If the situation persists, are you going to give up, or are you going to pursue the fight by developing new strategies? [De Ronceray] The fight must continue until a solution is found to the crisis. Because right now, I think that we are facing a national tragedy. There are seven million men and women who can no longer resist. There are seven million men and women who are asking the political authorities to show that they are still real men and women. I think it is our duty to continue the fight until the truth is respected and implemented. [end recording]
