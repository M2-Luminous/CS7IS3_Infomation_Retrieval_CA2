The meetings with the Russian minister are expected to produce above all a clarification of the prospects for the development of relations between Russia and NATO, and, consequently, a plan for a future European security system. Under a program announced around a month ago, P. Grachev will familiarize the heads of the alliance's military departments with the main provisions of Russia's defense doctrine, including the issues -- of concern to the West -- of the use of nuclear weapons, and the place occupied by the former Soviet republics in Moscow's strategy. But the delay in Russia's planned April accession to the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by NATO leaders, and contradictory statements in Moscow and Brussels have put this aspect of the visit at the center of attention. P. Grachev will set out Russia's corresponding position at a meeting with the NATO leadership and at a North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) defense ministers' session 25 May. Everyone in NATO agrees that a nuclear power with a major economic and military potential should play a special part in an international security system. But they do not want to formally enshrine this in the program's framework document, which has already been signed by 18 other countries apart from the alliance members, including eight former USSR republics. The framework document, NATO leaders say, is a kind of "letter of intent" that does not carry any obligations. It is planned to cooperate under an individual program -- that is, on a bilateral basis. Here too Russia's special status will be established by itself. But if Russia does not join the program, it will be hard for it to influence the formation and workings of this mechanism, and then a new barrier could arise in Europe -- on the Russian border. During his official visit to Belgium 26-27 May the Russian minister will hold talks with his Belgian colleague Leo Delcroix, who, we have learned, incidentally, was the initiator of the meeting between the 15 NATO defense ministers and P. Grachev. The Russian guest will visit a small-arms plant, an air base, and the Ostend Naval Base, and will fly by helicopter around Flanders and its ports of Antwerp, Ghent, and Zeebrugge.
