[A.J.] At this conference in Trieste, an impression has been formed that you are much more optimistic about the chances of Bosnian peace than you were before. On what do you base this? [Ljubijankic] We have indeed become more optimistic, which is mainly due to two developments. First, the deployment of the NATO planes, and because the Atlantic Alliance has given an ultimatum to the Serbs. The other factor giving hope to us is the Washington agreement between the Croatians and Bosnians on the structure of Bosnia and the division of responsibility, and the agreement on the confederation between Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [A.J.] How can these agreements promote peace? [Ljubijankic] This way, we will be in a better position on the front against the Serbs; this way, we have gained a stronger position against the Serbian expansion that we have seen over the past three years. [A.J.] Do you think that this way you will be able to drive back the Bosnian Serbs from the areas that they have occupied illegally? [Ljubijankic] These areas are not theirs and have never been theirs. We continue to emphasize that this is not a civil war and it is a big mistake to see it as such. This has always been an aggressive war in the course of which pseudo-states have been set up in Croatia and Bosnia as a first step to annexing them to Serbia. The international community has to recognize this intent. Now, as a result of these developments, we can negotiate from a better position than before. This is how I mean our stronger position: As NATO has at long last begun to talk language that the Serbs understand, it will be easier to negotiate with them. [A.J.] Does the Croatian-Bosnian confederation mean a tacit acceptance of Bosnia's division and giving up the country's unity? [Ljubijankic] We will never give up Bosnia's unity. However, this way, we establish a high-level example of local governments and local autonomy, thus even creating a kind of model that can be found in Switzerland or perhaps in other European countries, for example Belgium. [A.J.] Are you trying to "recapture" the Serbs through this model so that they will join you in the future in a new Bosnia? [Ljubijankic] I am not as optimistic as this regarding the Serbs, but we have to continue the practice that convinces them and the rest of the world that this viral infection of national socialism has to be defeated. In my view, without proving this, no one will be able to convince the Serbs to live in Bosnia. The Serbs have never been in the Vojvodina, but they are there now; they have never been on the left bank of the Drina River, and now they are there, too. This expansion should be stopped. [A.J.] Do you therefore believe that the peace that can now be achieved is only temporary and not a final settlement? [Ljubijankic] I would prefer to use the term creating an example to temporary peace. However, real peace does not exist if it is not just. Therefore, this is the first step toward establishing a just peace. [A.J.] Shall we just call this a cease-fire? [Ljubijanic] Yes, this can be seen as a kind of cease-fire.
