An altercation ensued yesterday between Transvaal Agricultural Union [TAU] President Dries Bruwer and the SACP's Jeremy Cronin after members of the TAU's general council unanimously expressed their opposition to allowing political parties on Transvaal farms for their election campaigns. Such action brings Transvaal farmers in conflict with the electoral constitution as it will prevent free access by political parties to the hundreds of thousands of black voters on Transvaal farms. Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT outright: "If the electoral constitution conflicts with law and order, then we choose law and order. All hell will break loose should they dare to touch one farmer." Challenge Yesterday Mr. Cronin directed a challenge at Mr. Bruwer to publish the document. "There is no such document," he added. Bruwer, convinced of the document's authenticity, faxed it to RAPPORT. In the document are detailed particulars on how the SACP grabbed the opportunity to negotiate with the government in order to promote its conspiracy to put into place a communist state, and how it is going ahead with these plans. Some of the sensitive statements in the document are as follows: - "We have not as yet altered our objectives. We have said, well and good, we will negotiate to reach a few compromises, but negotiations will be a form of struggle to weaken the government. We looked for ways to weaken its security forces while we build up our political force. It is also important for us to build up our armed capability. This is the reason for our double agenda." - "Negotiations have become the most important terrain of the struggle." - "The armed struggle has been suspended so as to confuse the security forces and give the SACP room to maneuver in the confusion that resulted." - "We have to organize MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- ANC Military Wing] more effectively within the National Peacekeeping Force. Meanwhile, we must spare no trouble in bringing our weaponry into the country." Two Phases - The "national democratic revolution" is taking place in two phases: The first stage is up to election day and the second will come with the introduction of the policy of reconstruction to transform South Africa into a workers' state and to manipulate the constitution-writing process with the view of establishing a socialist South Africa. - "The armed struggle has always been a 'golden thread' right through the national democratic revolutionary phase and will be as such during the transitional phase after the election. This strategy of a low intensity war in the townships and to arm the masses fits in with our strategy." Authenticity Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT yesterday he does not doubt the authenticity of the document. It has apparently been received from someone in the 'intelligence community." The Defense Force also has a copy of it, he said. This week he is to see SACP Chairman Joe Slovo about the matter, Mr. Bruwer added. "It all means that a party which still engages in violence and has a secret agenda has access to farms. Anxiety is rife among farm laborers, with tension among especially Zulus and others mounting. Political parties now want to visit them to campaign for votes, thereby setting the scene for unrest and intimidation. Farm laborers are free to exercise their political rights, but political parties must not come and meddle with us farmers. The electoral constitution is draconian." `Blatant Lies' Yesterday Mr. Cronin said that Mr. Bruwer's allegation that the SACP is preparing itself for armed action is a "blatant lie." "This allegation gives rise to the real question: Who exactly is preparing for an armed struggle? Over the last six months thousands of white farmers have been armed by the Defense Force's commando network. Right now it is not the farms of Bruwer's members, but the offices of our allies, that are being bombed," Mr. Cronin said. At the time of going to press RAPPORT had not yet established the authenticity of the document, but security experts point out that certain elements in the document "do not rhyme with the style of the SACP."
