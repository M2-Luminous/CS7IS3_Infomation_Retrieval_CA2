More than 60 percent of the visa applications rejected by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are submitted by youths, who also make up the majority of illegal departures from Cuba, the newspaper states. Because of this, the newspaper adds, the only option left is to risk their lives crossing the sea in fragile crafts to reach the United States and then be accepted without hesitation, as opposed to the treatment Haitians, Mexicans, or Chinese receive. Under the title "U.S. Visa: Preferably Dead," the newspaper makes an analysis of Cuban migration to the United States from the last century to the present and highlights some of the main causes, such as economic crises, wars, and the resulting family reunifications. According to Rafael Hernandez, a political analyst and university professor, quoted by JUVENTUD REBELDE, "the largest migratory wave -- more than 250,000 people -- left Cuba between 1965-1973, during the years with the greatest economic difficulty and their main motivation was generalized shortages." Something similar, the newspaper adds, is happening lately, although Cuban immigrants find themselves forced to state that they "go in search of liberty" or are "fleeing a totalitarian regime." As far as Cuban diplomat Ariel Ricardo is concerned, the situation of his fellow citizens has an ideological connotation that makes them different from Haitians, Mexicans, or other Latin immigrants and added that the idea is to try to show that they "are fleeing from the Castro-communist dictatorship," which is not true in most cases. Ricardo stated that one example is trumpet player Arturo Sandoval, who when replying to the question whether he would return to Cuba if communism was overthrown, said: "You are silly. Do you think I want to live in a Third World country?" JUVENTUD REBELDE disclosed that the U.S. intention of giving a political tint to all immigration from Cuba was recently questioned by Manolo Salgado, a reporter for the U.S. newspaper EL NUEVO HERALD. "Our Cuban brothers do not expect or demand that we take from here the redeeming torch of liberty. They are satisfied with food, medicines, clothing, shoes, and what is most important at this moment: dollars," Salgado stated, according to JUVENTUD REBELDE.
