Jan Subert, press spokesman of the Czech Ministry of the Interior, said this today in response to reports published in the Berlin-based newspaper DIE WELT, according to which the activities of espionage services of East European countries--above all, the Czech Republic--have increased of late. According to Subert, the intelligence service gathers information about foreign activities that might endanger the security of the Czech Republic. In cooperation with partner intelligence services, it is oriented toward the areas of global risks against civilization--such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and the illegal transfer of arms.
