The government said it would be able to announce its official position on the North Korean response early next week after fully reviewing which part of it is positive and which part is unsatisfactory. Accordingly, the government will likely hold a policy meeting with the United States in the near future in order to decide a position of the ROK and the United States on the North Korean proposal. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said today that the North Korean response was not fully satisfactory [chungbun hajinun anchiman] but it is necessary to review it. In his supplementary explanation on the North Korean position, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said that North Korea's position was insufficient to meet preconditions [chonje chogon], thus hinting that North Korea did not fully accepted our side's demands as preconditions -- North Korea's acceptance of ordinary inspections [tongsang sachal] and the South-North envoy exchange. Ambassador Kim said, however, that the ROK and the United States aim at continuing to make efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue and that they will take countermeasures [teaung pangan] after modulating [choyul] both sides' positions. By saying so, he implied that several more contacts between the United States and North Korea may be held in the future.
