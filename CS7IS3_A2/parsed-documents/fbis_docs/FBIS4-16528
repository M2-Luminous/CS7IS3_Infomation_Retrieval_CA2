In particular, on the eve of the election of the president of Crimea, a large group of ships put to sea without any agreement with the authorities of Ukraine and Crimea and without them being aware of this. Yet another proof of this is the fact that they put to sea on a mass scale on 14-15 April, i.e. on the days when the Odessa incident had not yet been settled, when the issue of the Black Sea Fleet was to be considered at the meeting of the heads of state of CIS in Moscow." In connection with this, the rear admiral believes that, proceeding from Ukrainian legislation and the norms of international law on the territorial supremacy of the law, it would be expedient that the Black Sea Fleet commander coordinate all issues related to the use of the training ground by the Black Sea Fleet forces with the commander of the Naval Forces of Ukraine. The latter, in Ryzhenko's opinion, should also give his consent for the Black Sea Fleet ships and vessels under the St. Andrew flag and the state flag of the Russian Federation to enter and leave the territorial internal waters and ports of Ukraine. The redeployment of military units, movements of military detachments, and transfer of military cargo within the boundaries of Ukraine's territory must be carried out with the consent of the chief of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. The rear admiral also believes that combat training grounds--both sea- and land-based--located within the limits of the state territory and in Ukraine's defined Black Sea territorial waters, must be subordinated to the Naval Forces of Ukraine, while it would be expedient to make Ukraine's Naval Forces aviation commander responsible for air traffic control on the territory of Crimea.
