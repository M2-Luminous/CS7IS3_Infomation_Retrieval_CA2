Encouraged by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's southern inspection tour addresses, Fujian township and town enterprises further emancipated their minds, unified understanding, and increased reform efforts and the pace of development. In 1993, they achieved a total output value of 101.3 billion yuan; the total value of delivered exports was 19 billion yuan; and total profits and taxes reached 8 billion yuan; up 85 percent, 75 percent, and 45 percent respectively from the year before and indicating simultaneous increases in the growth rate and efficiency. The characteristics of the rapid growth of Fujian's township and town enterprises are: --Increasing inputs and the continued expansion of the development scale. Last year, the province's township and town enterprises injected 15 billion yuan -- more than double the amount in the previous year -- and there were 61,800 new firms and 94 business conglomerates which developed some strong industries and widely marketed products. --The rapid growth of joint stock enterprises. An operating mechanism is adopted in which financing, benefits, accumulation, and risks are all shared. A joint stock cooperation system was vigorously promoted in rural areas, through which a total of 10 billion yuan was raised from across the province. Nineteen thousand enterprises participated in the rural joint stock cooperation system, giving new vitality to township and town enterprises and their rapid development. --Active nongovernment-run scientific research activity and notable scientific and technological progress. Township and town enterprises throughout the province last year invested 2.3 billion yuan, launched 2,799 key technological transformation projects, developed 23 new provincial- and prefectural-level products, popularized approximately 400 new scientific and technological products, and established 135 nongovernmental scientific and technological organizations, greatly speeding up the progress of township and town enterprises toward high and new technologies. --Mushrooming small industrial zones and continued expansion in operating scale. Across the province, there are now 725 small industrial zones with a certain scale. Ten townships and towns saw their output value top 1 billion yuan, while 69 villages and 40 enterprises saw their output value top 100 million yuan. --Opening up on all fronts and breakthroughs in establishing domestic lateral ties and in introducing foreign investment. Last year, the province approved approximately 1,800 new foreign-invested enterprises commanding $1.8 billion in foreign capital, approximately 800 million of which -- about 40 percent of the new investment by all township and town enterprises in the same year -- has been committed. Thirty-one enterprises located outside the province were established, and approximately 1,950 new domestic lateral projects were launched, which brought with them 3.9 billion yuan in domestic funds.
