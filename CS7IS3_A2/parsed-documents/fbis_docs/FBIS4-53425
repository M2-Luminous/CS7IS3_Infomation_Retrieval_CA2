During the talks, the Yunnan governor asked the BOI to promote Thai investment in southern China as part of the hexagon sub-regional economic development project. BOI Secretary General Sathaphon told reporters after the meeting that the Yunnan governor wanted more foreign participation to support his plan to move towards a market-oriented economy. Thailand has so far invested in 11 projects worth U.S. $50 million in Yunnan and ranks as its 6th most active foreign investor. Its businessmen invest mostly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Two of the 11 projects are supported by the BOI. During the meeting, the BOI secretary general said Thai businessmen have recognized the investment opportunities in Yunnan well, but they felt obstructed by the inadequate infrastructure. Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said a large amount of Thai investment would likely enter Yunnan when the construction of a highway linking Thailand and southern China is completed. He Zhiqiang is accompanied by a nine-member delegation including the Mayor of Kunming. Yunnan needs foreign investment to develop its economy. To date, 129 foreign investments in projects worth U.S. $500 million have been undertaken in Yunnan. Hong Kong investors are the most active, followed by the Taiwanese, Japanese, Singaporeans, Americans, and Thais. The most active sectors are machinery, agriculture, food, real estate, hotels, and chemicals. The BOI secretary general said Thailand might participate in zinc and coal mining, or in agriculture. Moreover, nearby Vietnam has a number of waterfalls that can accommodate hydro-electric plants. However, he noted that businessmen have found it difficult to transport their products from Yunnan to other areas due to the inadequate infrastructure. But, this problem will be solved soon because Thailand and China are planning to link Thailand to southern China as part of the hexagon economic development project.
