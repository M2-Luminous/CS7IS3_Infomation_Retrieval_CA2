Much common understanding was reached in cross-strait talks over day-to-day affairs last year, will there be new progress in the upcoming Beijing meeting on that basis? Will the accords of the "Wang-Gu talks" be implemented in a comprehensive way in the new year? China Mainland Pushes the Comprehensive Implementation of the Accord of the "Wang-Gu Talks" As the first contact and talks between high-ranking figures over the past 40-some years, the "Wang-Gu talks" that took place in Singapore in April 1993 raised the curtain of a new stage for the institutional dialogue and negotiation between authorized nongovernment organizations. In its wake, ARATS set out a proposal for implementing the relevant accords of the "Wang-Gu talks" in a comprehensive way, namely, negotiations on specific affairs related to repatriation, crackdown on maritime crimes in joint efforts, dealing with maritime disputes over fishery, protection of intelligent property rights, and ties and agreement between justice courts of the two sides. In addition, negotiations should be conducted on economic topics and science and technological exchanges in the spirit of the accord as early as possible. In mutual cooperation, ARATS and SEF conducted work negotiations on three occasions in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei in late August, early November and late December last year respectively. Through these negotiations, especially the work negotiations held in Taipei for the first time on 21-22 December, comparatively great progress was made on many issues by the joint efforts of the two sides. --The ARATS negotiation group participating in talks in Taiwan was a step toward implementing the "Wang-Gu talks" accords as well as anm advance in ARATS-SEF ties and exchanges. --These negotiations have further deepened common understanding in "repatriating people who have entered the other side in violation of relevant rules and regulations and related issues" and "negotiating handling of maritime fishery disputes." --The two sides have exchanged views on such routine topics as the crackdown on maritime criminal activities, such as "maritime smuggling and robbery," and "the rights and privileges of Taiwan businessmen investing on the mainland"; --The two sides reached important common understanding on "the principle of repatriation of hijackers," within the basic framework of the accord on repatriating hijackers between the two shores, by careful study of the wording of the overwhelming majority of this accord gone through. People here believe that should an accord on the repatriation of hijackers be reached between the two sides, its significance will go beyond insuring safety in air traffic between the two sides, and it will play an important role in augmenting and promoting ties and exchanges between the two shores in every respect; this being so, it will certainly be welcomed by and assessed highly by Chinese both at home and overseas. Where Lie the Hurdles That Affect ARATS-SEF Cooperation? Although a series of results at a certain stage have been scored in cross-strait people-to-people talks, no accord was eventually signed. The fundamental cause lies in the fact that Taiwan has included some political issues that were quite beyond the two sides' common understanding for the time being in the negotiations on routine affairs in an attempt to create the so-called "independent sovereignty" and "equal judicial powers" to fulfill its pursuit of "two equal political bodies." That did not fall in line with the orientation of being non-governmental, economic, routine, and functional, set by the "Wang-Gu talks" accords. Both ARATS and SEF are non-governmental organizations, and differences in political issues between the two shores should not have been brought up in negotiations on people-to-people affairs. In ARATS-SEF negotiations on routine affairs in 1992, the two sides established a common understanding by each making an oral statement that "the two sides of the strait adhere to the one China principle," thus making major progress in ARATS-SEF negotiations possible thereafter. With the accords on cross-strait utilization and verification of notaries and on "inquiries about and compensation for registered letters," especially, the realization of the "Wang-Gu talks" was itself a breakthrough; all this showed that two authorized non-governmental organizations from the two shores might settle some routine issues surfacing in cross-strait people- to-people ties and exchanges and push forward various cross-strait ties and exchanges under the condition that political differences between the two shores remain unsettled, so long as some issues lacking unanimity are avoided while adopting a practical attitude and practice. Now the Taiwan authorities insist on so-called "equal judicial powers" in routine negotiations of non-governmental organizations. Essentially, they are creating "two Chinas" in disguise; beyond a doubt, that is an impasse. Doing Substantial Work Is the Best Way To Resolve Cross-Strait Issues Thus, to resolve routine issues in cross-strait exchanges, the practical and constructive way can only be what Tang Shubei has set out that the two sides "should refrain from involving sensitive issues that lack common understanding," "avoid issues pending unanimity between the two sides with technical wordings." When Chiao Jen-ho first took office as SEF deputy board director and concurrently secretary-general toward the end of last year, he said that to adopt practical way, accumulate common understanding in routine topics, augment the foundation of mutual trust was a task of top priority for basic solutions to cross-strait issues. At the just-concluded third session of the ARATS first council in Beijing, the work agenda decided on by ARATS for 1994 included: Promoting reciprocal visits of ARATS and SEF responsible persons and pushing for the second Wang-Gu talks; continuing to promote cross- strait economic exchanges and cooperation; doing more substantial work to protect the legitimate rights and privileges of Taiwan businessmen's investment on the mainland; striving for negotiations with SEF over such issues as "the rights and privileges of Taiwan businessmen's investment on the mainland and related issues," "cross-strait reciprocal visits of figures from industrial and business circles," "development and exchanges in energy and other resources," and the issue of "cross-strait exchanges in science and technology," while striving to reach some accords; at the same time, making preparations in joint efforts for convoking a conference authorized by both sides on people-to-people economic exchanges. In addition, on the basis of the two sides acquiring common understanding in negotiations on routine affairs, efforts will be exerted to resolve existing differences and strive to sign an accord with SEF as early as possible. An authoritative figure here indicated that one of the important results of "Wang-Gu talks" was to have common understandings written down in an accord, namely, "both sides believe that there is a need to augment economic ties and make up for each other's shortages with mutual benefits." The "Wang-Gu talks" were not easily realized; the two sides should set great store by the results. Only by implementing related accords in a comprehensive way to score results in the negotiations on five routine topics, including economic and scientific and technological exchanges, as early as possible will it be possible to consolidate and develop the results of "Wang-Gu talks," thus pushing further development of cross-strait relations. People are waiting to see whether or not genuine efforts will be exerted in Chiao Jen-ho's upcoming trip to Beijing to implement the "Wang-Gu talks" accord in a comprehensive way in the new year.
