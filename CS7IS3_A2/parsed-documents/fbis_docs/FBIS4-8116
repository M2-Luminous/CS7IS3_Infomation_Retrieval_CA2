It is not quite clear from the policy statement proposal so far to what concept of transformation the government is going to adhere. Is it going to be a shock method, or are you going to continue with what some people consider to be a more acceptable method for Slovakia? [Moravcik] We tried to solve this matter unequivocally and express it in the programmatic statement of the government. We are concerned with a speedy transformation, with maintaining the budgetary deficit at a certain level, and we are also concerned for this transformation to be socially viable. These are the basic economic principles of the policy statement. [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] Are the elections going to take place at the end of September and the beginning of October, as was agreed? [Moravcik] We have no intention of lengthening this period. We consider the elections at the end of September and the beginning of October to be very necessary. [Pospisilova] Negotiations with the IMF and World Bank representatives that have taken place here seem to point to a tangible change in their attitude toward Slovakia after the change of government. Suddenly, it seems to be possible to reach the set economic aims, not only by increasing taxes and by reducing social allowances, subsidies, and similar items, but also by a complex of interconnected active measures that are not limited by the six months' period. Should the credit for this go to the first woman deputy prime minister? [Moravcik] Yes, she should also be credited for it. We have to add that Mrs. Snegnerova represents a certain type of economic and political view that is identical or very similar to the one represented by other economy ministers. [passage omitted] We were very pleased when this economic program found response in the attitude of IMF representatives. It means that our political and economic considerations are gaining an international dimension, which is very important. It means that we have come closer to the global way of thinking. [Pospisilova] Representatives of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and others expressed dissatisfaction over your government's tardiness in clarifying illegal procedures of the so-called wild privatization of the former government of Vladimir Meciar. Vojtech Bugar [MKDH chairman] openly forecasts that, if you fail to clarify this matter by the fall elections, you would lose completely. Simultaneously, he asks what was then the point of voting the former government out of office. [Moravcik] Deputies did not vote the government out of office to confront it now with its mistakes. We took this step in order to present a different policy, to introduce a different political style. Naturally, it is important to point out mistakes that were made. It must be said that, in the case of privatization, it is not such a simple matter because illegal steps were executed very cunningly. However, in the course of time, we will be able to show the public the real face of those who were privatizing in the previous government. [passage omitted] [Pospisilova] This week's visit of your Czech counterpart, Vaclav Klaus, to Moscow drew attention not only because he answered in fluent Russian the questions put to him by the Russian editor during a live television broadcast, but also because of the interesting agreements he concluded at the talks with the Russian prime minister--in particular, the agreement on settling the Russian debt to the Czech Republic. Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Snegnerova already observed that you did not want to continue in the direction taken by the former government--namely, that the Russian debt to us would be paid, for example, only by increasing import of military technology. When then are you going to visit Moscow? [Moravcik] We think that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will shortly come for a visit to Slovakia, as was agreed. [Pospisilova] Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak National Party, said that your government was a traveling one because you agreed on so many foreign trips right at the beginning of your term, that they equal all the trips of Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet undertaken in the space of more than a year. If you are not going to Moscow, where are you going to go within these six months? [Moravcik] My program is not yet clarified. It is being prepared. Concerning the reproach implied in your question, quoting Prokes, it is totally unjustified and, in principle, absurd because Slovakia is very dependent on foreign relations. To move developments in all areas here in Slovakia is not possible without very intensive foreign cooperation. It is the government's duty to develop these contacts and to align Slovakia into international relations. [Pospisilova] Tomorrow's [9 April] Cabinet session will also discuss the final report on the application of law passed by the former federal parliament that deals with the return of the Communist Party assets to the people of the federal republic. This matter has been dragging on for three years, and rumors have started to circulate about how interesting it is that, after three years of quarrels, suddenly there is a chance to put a stop to it--and this only one month after the present government came to power, sharing it with seven ministers from the Party of the Democratic Left. [Moravcik] This point will be discussed on Tuesday's [12 April] Cabinet meeting. A full stop must be put to all problems. We have to concentrate on business. [passage omitted]
