Therefore, he believes that the mechanism proposed by Congress for adjusting wages against inflation is unnecessary. Following the release of the joint communique, President Itamar Franco held a news conference during which he criticized the activities of oligopolies in Brazil and expressed hope that Congress will improve the provisional measure as far as oligopolies are concerned. Concerning wage policies, he asked that the negotiations be conducted at the ministries and the respective business sectors [camaras setoriais]. President Itamar Franco said the government has nothing to hide. Therefore, there is no reason for the workers to strike when the authorities are open to dialogue. The president added that if the workers demonstrate that the wages are actually losing their value, the government will obviously take this fact into account. Itmar Franco noted that Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's departure from the government, if it occurs, will not hurt the management of the economic program that interests the entire country, not just the government.
