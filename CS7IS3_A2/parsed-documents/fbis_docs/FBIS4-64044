The working group is being set up under a decision taken as a result of the Kiev talks earlier this week between Ukrainian and Crimean plenipotentiary parliamentary delegations. The group will include five Crimean lawmakers, as well as four experts in law. At the same time, the Crimean parliamentarians postponed at least until tomorrow debates on the issue of suspending, for the period of the group's activities, the acts passed by parliament on May 20, 1994. The session, which ajourned last week after passing a law "On Restoration of Consitutional Foundations of the Crimean Republic's Statehood", is due to approve a new Crimean Government named by President Yuriy Meshkov. Lawmakers will also discuss a programme for pulling the peninsula out of the current economic crisis and for stabilizing its agro-industrial complex, as well as endorse a series of presidential decrees. The session is proceeding in a quiet and businesslike atmosphere. Passions outside the parliament building calmed down. A mere several dozens of demonstrators still go on picketing under slogans demanding for greater independence for the Crimean republic.
