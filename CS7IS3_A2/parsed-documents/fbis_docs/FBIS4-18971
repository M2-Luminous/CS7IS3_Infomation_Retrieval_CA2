He was speaking to reporters after a joint press conference with visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Cetin said necessary protection should also be given to other regions besides Sarajevo, stressing that Turkey had called to attention the fact that Gorazde was a "critical" region, before the Serbian attacks were intensified. He underlined the fact that Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina should join the agreement signed between Bosnians and Croats, adding a healthy future for the Balkans can only be reached with the setting up of lasting and just peace. Cetin said Turkey will continue efforts for the establishment of peace in the region adding talks between Turkish-Bosnian and Croatian delegations will be held at the foreign ministers level.
