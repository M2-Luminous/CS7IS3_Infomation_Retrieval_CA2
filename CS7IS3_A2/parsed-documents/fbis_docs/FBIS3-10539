These donations were guaranteed under Agreement PL-480, which many Salvadoran farmers have criticized, because they believe it dispenses with incentives for national production. The minister has said the decline is due to food security. "El Salvador had the best corn, bean, and millet [maicillo] harvest in the country's history during 1992," Cabrales has said, adding the agricultural improvement was due to "the government's faith in the social market economy and the elimination of price distortions." According to the minister, food production in El Salvador had dropped 12 percent at the end of the 1980's, and food imports had increased 60 percent. "For example, we had a deficit of more than 600,000 quintals of beans in 1989, and rice producers had threatened they would not plant, because donations had affected them very much," Cabrales has said. Within the government's food security program, Cabrales spotlighted the importance of eliminating price controls and closing down the Institute of Supply Regulation (IRA). Likewise, the minister has announced during the four years of the administration, the ministry's size had been reduced from 7,000 employees to 3,500. According to an August 1993 UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, El Salvador is second in Latin America in cereal production per capita. Ecuador holds first place.
