FBIS4-12752 "drnes071dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Further on Hamas-PLO Cooperation Further on Hamas-PLO Cooperation NC1204184694 Paris AFP in English 1523 GMT 12 Apr 94 NC1204184694 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, April 12 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, which has opposed the peace process, is prepared to cooperate with the PLO in the police force and other public services, a source close to the group said Tuesday [12 April]. Meanwhile, Israeli troops detained 30 to 40 suspected Hamas members in the al-Shati' refugee camp and neighbouring Gaza City on Monday night, Palestinian witnesses said. The swoop came after the army announced the arrest of a local leader of the fundamentalist group in Jabaliya refugee camp. Hamas has so far bitterly opposed the peace accord with Israel and criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization for accepting it. But, the two groups held talks last week to settle their disputes. "Our national and religious duties force us to stand united," said Ahmad Bahr, who has links with Hamas. Hamas could join in the police force, provided the PLO agreed. "In any case, we will consider the Palestinian police as our brothers, we will be soldiers to them and protect them. "We do not oppose our brothers in the police force," said Bahr, who was deported by Israel in 1992 as a Hamas suspect and returned to Gaza three months ago. A 9,000-strong Palestinian police force selected by the PLO is due to be deployed in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho to maintain order during autonomy. "We will unite in all fields with Fatah, except in negotiations with Israel," Bahr said, explaining that Hamas would cooperate in education, health and public services. Rashid Abu-Shbak, a Fatah official in Gaza, said he welcomed the idea of HAMAS cooperation. He did not comment specifically on the possibility of Hamas joining the police force. "We want to start a new page based on respect between the two groups," said Abu-Shbak who is in charge of taking over buildings vacated by Israelis under the autonomy deal. A Palestinian research centre last month found that 4O percent of the Gaza Strip would vote in elections for PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah movement and nearly 20 percent for Hamas.
