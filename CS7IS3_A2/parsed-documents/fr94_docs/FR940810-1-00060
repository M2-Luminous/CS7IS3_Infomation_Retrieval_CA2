FR940810-1-00060 FR940810-1-00010 Permits and Coal Exploration Approvals Sections 903.772 through 903.785 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter G, Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permits and Coal Exploration Systems Under Regulatory Programs. The following amplifications are being proposed: For exploration applications where 30 CFR 772.12 applies, ยง903.772(b) would require that upon receipt of notification from the regulatory authority of the submission of an administratively complete application for an exploration permit, the applicant shall publish one public notice of the filing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of the proposed exploration area, and provide proof of this publication to the regulatory authority within one week after the newspaper notice is published. Section 903.772(c) would allow thirty (30) days after publication of the public notice for persons adversely affected to file written comments. Section 903.772(d) would require the regulatory authority to act upon a complete exploration application and any written comments within 15 days from the close of the comment period unless additional time is necessary due to the number of, or complexity of the issues. In ยง903.773, Requirements for permits and permit processing, proposed subsection (b) would list Federal laws and corresponding or relevant State laws that need coordination by OSM to prevent or minimize duplication of effort with Arizona. Section 905.773(c) as proposed contains the stipulation that no person may conduct coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations without first obtaining all other necessary permits from the State. This section, which lists State laws with which the Secretary will endeavor to coordinate when issuing a permit under this Federal program, is based on the list published on October 6, 1982, (47 FR 44194) and may have to be updated in a final rule establishing a Federal program for Arizona. The State laws requiring coordination are summarized below: (1) Arizona towns and cities are given long-range development and planning responsibility for their jurisdictions, are authorized to issue zoning ordinances and regulate the industrial use of municipal land and establish special zoning districts (A.R.S. Section 9&hyph;461 to Section 9&hyph;462&hyph;01). Arizona counties have general permitting authority and violation of a county building permit is a petty offense. A.R.S. 11&hyph;322 et seq. Each County's Board of Supervisors has responsibility for promulgating and enforcing the zoning ordinances for the county, and it is unlawful to use land in violation of a zoning regulation, ordinance or permit; violation of such regulation, ordinance or permit is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section 11&hyph;808, Section 11&hyph;803, and A.R.S. Section 11&hyph;821. (2) The Arizona law concerning the perfection of mining claims and the establishment of claims to mineral rights is found in A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;201 to 27&hyph;210. Notice of such a claim must be recorded within 90 days in the appropriate office of the County having jurisdiction over the recording of land claims. A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;203. (3) A mineral exploration permit is required before prospecting is allowed on public land. A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;251 to Section 27&hyph;256. (4) A permit from the Department of Health Services is required for the discharge of solid wastes and air pollutants. A.R.S. Title 49, Chapters 1 and 2. (5) An installation permit is required before any pollution-causing equipment may be installed. Before the equipment can commence operation an operating permit is required. The permits are not automatically transferable. It is a misdemeanor to violate any air pollution permit, ordinance or statute, and criminal intent is not an element of proof. A.R.S. Title 49. (6) The Department of Health Services has the responsibility for issuing water pollutant discharge permits. A.R.S. Title 49, Chapter 2. (7) It is unlawful to discharge wastes or drainage into State waters or reduce water quality below water quality standards or discharge pollutants into waters without a permit from the Department of Health Services, A.R.S. Title 45. (8) The Department of State Lands has the responsibility for issuing mineral prospecting permits for State lands. A.R.S. Section 37&hyph;231. (9) The waters from all sources belong to the State and are subject to appropriation and beneficial use. In order to appropriate water or make a beneficial use of water, a permit is required from the Director of the Department of Water Resources. The approval of the Director is required before such a permit may be transferred. A secondary permit from the Director is required before use may be made of reservoir waters. A.R.S. Title 45. Comment is invited concerning the accuracy of this list, and is also invited concerning any other Arizona laws requiring coordination under Section 903.773 which may not be included in this proposed rule, or which may have been revised or adopted since 1982.
