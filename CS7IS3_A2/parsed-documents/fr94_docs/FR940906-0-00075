FR940906-0-00075 FR940906-0-00020 In addition, this action modifies the Hurlburt Field, Florida Class D airspace area by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operations. This action also modifies the Crestview, Florida Class E airspace area by amending the area's effective hours to coincide with the associated Flight Service Station's (FSS) hours of operation. The intended effect of these modifications is to clarify when two-way radio communications are required and when weather observation services are provided when the associated control tower and FSS is closed. The Hurlburt, Florida, Class D airspace area and the Crestview, Florida, Class E airspace area will revert to Class G airspace when the associated control tower and FSS are not in operation. Economic Evaluation Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses are summarized below. Costs The FAA has determined that there will be little or no cost associated with implementation of the modification. This determination is based on the following reasons. The rule will impose no additional administrative, personnel, or equipment costs on Eglin AFB or the FAA. Any additional operations workload generated by the rule will be absorbed by current personnel and equipment resources. The cost to aircraft operators will be occasional delays and deviations from their current flight times and paths. However, the FAA contends that these delays will be so short and infrequent that they will impose little if any cost. Benefits The benefits of the rule will be primarily in the form of improved ATC efficiency and enhanced safety. Improved ATC efficiency and safety will come from the ability of Eglin ATC to better separate the flow of military and civilian aircraft.
