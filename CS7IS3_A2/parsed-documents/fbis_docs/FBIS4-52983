FBIS4-52983 "dreas095_c_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 North Korea Chongnyon Proposes Unity to Mindan Compatriots Chongnyon Proposes Unity to Mindan Compatriots SK1505091294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0836 GMT 15 May 94 SK1505091294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) sent an appeal to the compatriots affiliated with the "ROK Residents Association in Japan" (Mindan) on May 12, urging it to promote national unity for defense of national dignity and vital rights of the Koreans in Japan. Noting that the persecution and suppression of Koreans in Japan and Chongnyon organisations by the Japanese reactionaries today are by no means confined to Chongnyon, the appeal says: Militarism does not distinguish between Chongnyon and "Mindan" and between the North and the South of Korea. We cannot and must not allow the past history of humiliation and shame to be repeated, falling a prey to the malicious scheme of the Japanese militarist forces to sow discord within our nation. There is only one way for the Korean nationals in Japan to survive, defending national dignity and rights--a close unity of the nation. We are sending this appeal to you, loudly asserting that it is high time all the Koreans in Japan closely united, sharply watching the heinous militarist ambition of the Japanese reactionary forces against Korea and their possible nation alienating maneuvers. Let us all unite as fellow countrymen, irrespective of isms and views and affiliation, defend the dignity of the nation and the vital rights of the compatriots in Japan and guarantee the future of our dear younger generations. Let us achieve national reunification in the 1990s without fail by uniting as fellow countrymen of the same ancestry, priding ourselves on our long history spanning 50 centuries.
