However, after his talks with the Georgian prime minister on 3 February, he found some free minutes. Oleg Soskovets said that, historically, our peoples have always been together. Everything that is happening today reflects the aspiration of the two parties, that is, to support what was stipulated by history. One cannot gamble with the welfare of the people, but people can endure anything, including unreasonable activities, for a certain length of time. Responding to our correspondent's question about the importance of the CIS, Mr. Oleg Soskovets said: This Commonwealth is an opportunity to protect our traditions, economic relations, and industrial union. It is necessary to admit that sensible unities are justified and to realize that the life of the people and the improvement of their life is principal. Now we are independent states. We have our own policy and free economic relations. We are building them on an absolutely new basis of equality. All of this is a proof that politicians as well as people have become wiser. Asked the question, Have you discussed the issue of Georgia's joining the ruble zone with the prime minister?, Mr. Soskovets answered: We have not discussed the issue this time. We have discussed ways to arrange the restoration of broken economic relations and, in particular, possibilities to stabilize Georgia's power and fuel economy and secure transport movement between Georgia and Russia.
