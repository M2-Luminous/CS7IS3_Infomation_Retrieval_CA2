During the discussion, people's deputies were enthusiastic in expressing their views. Centering on the government work report, they aired their views on further speeding up the pace of opening up, conducting scientific and technical structural reform well, developing economy and education in areas inhabited by minority nationalities, safeguarding social order, and other items. While attentively listening to the speeches of people's deputies, Li Lanqing and Wang Hanbin took notes from time to time, and exchanged views with them on certain issues. After the deputies finished making their speeches, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said: Last year was a crucial year in which our country advanced toward the socialist market economic system. Various major reform measures were promulgated. This involved many aspects and faced great difficulties. A stable political situation and social environment were needed. Li Lanqing stressed: Doing price reform well is a key to handling relations between developing reform and maintaining stability. Governments at all levels must take practical measures to control commodity prices within a scope that the masses can bear. In particular, prices of food and vegetables, which are closely connected with people's livelihood, must be effectively dealt with. Only thus can various kinds of reform progress smoothly. Li Lanqing also pointed out: China must never rely on foreign countries to solve the problem of feeding the people. It is imperative to assign agriculture a most fundamental strategic position and develop it well. While talking about the issue of economic development in border areas inhabited by minority nationalities, which deputies paid close attention to, Li Lanqing emphasized: The central authorities have considered the development of areas inhabited by minority nationalities as a major strategic issue. Yunnan is rich in natural resources, and has many strong points. It is necessary to give play to these strong points. First of all, efforts must be made to strengthen infrastructure projects such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. We must study how to make use of foreign capital for the exploitation of natural resources. He fully affirmed our province's achievements in developing education for minority nationalities. He said: Many areas in Yunan have persisted in developing education despite difficulties. They have thus grasped the gist of the problem. As long as education is developed and qualified personnel are trained, any area can become rich, no matter how poor it is now. To get rid of poverty, areas of minority nationalities must vigorously develop education. In his speech, Li Lanqing also expressed views on transformation of government functions, promotion of clean and honest government administration, improvement of social order in border areas, and so on.
