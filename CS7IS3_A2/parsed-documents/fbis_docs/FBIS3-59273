By 1992 the red ink had spread to every specialized bank. According to studies in Hunan Province, money-losing county-level specialized banks accounted for a mere 6.5 percent of all county-level specialized banks in the province in 1982. By 1985, the proportion had risen to 15.6 percent; 1989, 34.8 percent; and 1992, 65.8 percent, having increased 6.2 percent annually on the average. Nationwide, the grass-roots bank with the most severe losses is 30 million yuan into the red annually. The main causes of this grim situation are: I. Loans Are Not Repaid on Time; More and More Loans Have To Be Written Off as Bad Debts Taking stock of their lending in 1988, 1990, and 1992, a municipal bank in Hunan discovered that in 1988 overdue loans amounted to 65 million yuan; idle loans, 52 million yuan; and bad debts, 45.58 million yuan, for a total of 162.58 million yuan, or 40.5 percent of the bank's combined credit funds. In 1990, overdue loans were valued at 95 million yuan; idle loans, 84 million yuan; and bad debts, 73.25 million yuan, for a total of 25,225,000 yuan, or 63.5 percent of the bank's combined credit assets. By 1992, overdue loans reached a high 110 million yuan; idle loans, 146 million yuan; and bad debts, 135 million yuan, for a total of 391 million yuan, 86.9 percent of the bank's total credit funds. Behind the overdue loans, idle loans, and bad debts is a multitude of reasons, of which three are most important. One, loans are being made because somebody knows somebody, or as a personal favor. There have been policy errors and dereliction of duty on the part of the leadership. Two, "eating from the big rice pot" continues to exist at two levels in a big way within the banks. For one thing, banks at the lower level continue to "eat from the big rice pot" at the expense of higher-level banks. The administrative style of management remains in place. As soon as the finance office opens its mouth, the banks write a check; as soon as the higher level gives the order, the lower level obeys unconditionally. Funds flow from bottom to the top while targets are handed down from top to bottom. Banks and leaders at the grass-roots do not take economic risk or are held economically liable. Under these circumstances, overdue loans, idle loans, and bad debts are bound to increase, not decrease. Secondly, employees continue to "eat from the big rice pot" of banks. Within the banking system today, whether or not loans and interest are recouped has no bearing on an employee's earnings. Banks over-emphasize lending but overlook management and are half-hearted in seeing that they are repaid. This is the achilles heel in banking management and operations. Thirdly, policy errors have been made and policy-making departments intervene excessively in credit work. II. Operating Costs Are Too High, Profits Have Been Declining by the Day In recent years specialized banks have been competing with one another to build the tallest buildings and office blocks, put together the most luxuriously appointed small local branches and savings banks, purchase the most upscale sedans, and raise workers' benefits beyond what is standard. Consequently, operating costs have been soaring even as profits took a nosedive. Each year the grass-roots branches of some specialized banks spend far more money to pay for the things mentioned above than what they collect in revenue, causing heavy losses. III. Excessive Government Interference Hampers the Exercise of Autonomy by Banks in Their Operations When the government wants to support certain projects or certain enterprise loans, all the banks can do is to go along. As far as this kind of loan is concerned, banks cannot hope to recoup even the principal in 90 percent of the cases. Some local governments go so far as to issue written instructions to the banks directing them not to demand the repayment of a particular loan or to stop charging interest on it. Naturally the results of such practices on the banks' bottom line are disastrous. The decision-making authority of grass-roots banks is severely constrained by banks at the higher levels. There are too many mandatory loans and policy-based loans. Also, they carry very low interest rates. In some cases, the banks even have to subsidize the interest, further squeezing their margin of profit. IV. The System of Interest Rates Is Extremely Unsound; Difference Between Interest Rates on Loans and Those on Deposits Is Small While Inflation Has Been Rising Rapidly; Together They Mean an Absence of Profits for Banks In China today, the total value of loans to be made, whom to lend money to, fund costs, and interest rates on loans and deposits are all controlled by the state through administrative methods. Moreover, interest rates on loans have traditionally been low in this country while interest rates on deposits have always been high. Banks derive little profits from this very narrow differential in interest rates. Besides, even after commodity prices began shooting up in the first half of 1992, interest rates on loans and deposits were not adjusted promptly, causing bank deposits to plummet. According to statistics, the nation's total savings deposits broke the 800 billion yuan barrier for the first time in 1991 only to drop below 750 billion yuan in the first half of 1993. In the same year, however, the amount of loans issued rose 100 billion yuan on top of what had been lent in 1991, further exacerbating the imbalance between bank loans and bank deposits. Squeezed in the middle, banks cannot begin to think about making a profit. V. The Number of Delinquent Enterprise Loans Has Jumped Sharply Even as Bank Profits Slip Year After Year That numerous enterprises have fallen behind in making interest payments to their banks for long periods is the most important reason why banks have been losing money in a big way. Take, for instance, the 10 county and municipal banks under the Bank of Construction in Changdeshi, Hunan Province. In 1988, they were owed a total of 7,332,000 yuan in interest by enterprises. By 1989, that figure had risen to 18,634,000 yuan; 1990, 29,597,000 yuan; and 1992, 36,673,000 yuan. As a result, a historically profitable bank has been reduced to a money-losing institution. In the banking system of Hunan Province, each year the amount of unpaid interest owed by enterprises is 16 times that of the combined profits realized in the same period, and the amount is growing 21 percent annually, a number significantly higher than the annual GNP growth rate of 8 percent. In Hunan Province, 75 percent of unprofitable county-level specialized banks can attribute their steep losses to enterprises which are in arrears. VI. Flawed Policy Making and Mismanagement by the Leaders The standards of thinking, operations, and management of most of the current leaders in grass-roots banks are not high. The notion of occupying a position (iron chair) for life, the idea of "eating from a big rice pot," and nepotism are deeply rooted in their thinking. Some people simply do not allow the existence of opinions different from their own. According to some studies, flawed decisions and dereliction of duty on the part of the leaders account for 75 percent of all overdue loans, idle loans, and bad debts; policy errors, 10 percent; errors caused by employees breaking the law or violating the rules, 10 percent; and other reasons, 5 percent.
