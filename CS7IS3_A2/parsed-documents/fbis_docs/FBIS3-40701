They have been on his mind for some time now. Not all of them--but many of them. Who does not know the endless swarm of clerks that plods along every morning in exhaustion at the entrance to the Qiriya, trampling outside at noon to scramble for something at the eateries of Even-Gvirol Street, walking slowly back to the offices, and, exactly at 1700--but exactly--flowing outside the gates of the Qiriya, directly into the long cork on Kaplan Street. [sentence as published] Many among us, especially those of us with combat history, call them "jobniks," or even "parasites." When we say, in the Friday salon talks, that we can cut back on offices, electricity, office equipment, and, primarily, cadres and salaries--we are referring to them. Both Yitzhaq Rabin and Ehud Baraq think so, but they are trapped. It is not possible to lay off hundreds of these clerks, and even the Israel Defense Force's (IDF) earnest attempts at reducing and cutting are not resulting in the longed for change. In the Qiriya's hallways, it turns out, marches a different army from the one along the borders and in the territories, and it has its own rules. Every few years, a new program of cuts emerges, which is "thrown" at one command or another: They cut a branch here, a section there, lip service from the aspect of many, but the primary mass still remains, and there is a veiled underemployment. Even an open one. Major General (Res.) 'Amos Yaron, former head of the IDF manpower branch, does not take issue with Rabin, but he is cautious. "In every large organization, the slogan `there is a veiled underemployment' is correct. There are many people in this bureaucratic organization known as the army, which does not always operate according to economic considerations. Every few years they say this in order to put pressure on the system, to signal to the commands that the command is on the ball and they must become efficient. And, therefore, they make cuts--but, they expand again." Yaron says that saying must be repeated over and over, because the commands each have an independent character. When you do not "sit" on them, they start to expand. For example: A lieutenant colonel who wants to promoted to colonel and begins to "rush" work papers to his boss creates new assignments for himself, all of which is under the strange heading "specialization." He demands a cadre, authorizations, officers, offices, and, of course, clerks. And commanders, as is known, love clerks around them. The staff work of that same lieutenant colonel can bear fruit one fine day, and then, suddenly, a new section pops out of nowhere, with it the cadre, and, of course, the underemployment. Yaron: "In my time, there was a daily war with veiled underemployment in some of the commands. You have to be on the ball all of the time. The current chief of general staff could cut more and does not need to be urged to do so, because there are budget problems, and he wants to cut cadres in any case. It is very good that the commands know that they are being examined, for if this does not happen, another month will pass and everything will swell up again." Sheqem director-general, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Gabi Nave, who was responsible for manpower in the navy, says that the wasteful image that has been pinned to the commands is not correct. "People get an impression from the hundreds of cars in the big cities, which are there from the command locations, and they have a sense of underemployment. In the navy, for example, there are cuts all of the time, and there is a small command there that is purposeful and very competitive. They are always making cuts in it, but the reservist who arrives and sees clerks who are sitting and not doing anything goes home and tells his friends. That same underemployed clerk does the same thing. Nave says that the veiled underemployment cannot be reduced to a minimum, because the level of activity in the army changes and is not constant. "The army will never become an economical plant with a manufacturing premium and norms. The IDF is does a lot to become efficient, and, indeed, changed to a five-day work week. If I had asked someone 10 years ago whether this was possible, they would have answered in the negative." Maj. Gen. (Res.) Yaron sharpens the point. "We must reach a state of no underemployment, and it is possible to reduce and cut a lot, but the result will be that many will not be mobilized into the IDF or will be released. This, apparently, is impossible, as long as the IDF is defined as a national army. We are in a trap. If we mobilize everyone, then the commands swell, there is underemployment. and there are male and female soldiers who do not do a thing." Col. (Res.) Nava Fels, former commander of Training Center 12, says that it is possible to cut back, and calls for starting with the Women's Corps system. According to her, the obligatory mobilization of women to the IDF should be canceled in preference to a professional army to which only those who want to and are wanted are mobilized. "I sometimes do not understand how this system works," Fels says. "Today, when I am in the simple civilian class, it is difficult for me to absorb what terrible norms of underemployment exist in the army, especially in the Women's Corps system, and no one is getting up and making a peep. This matter should be stopped immediately. The problem of the people in the army is that they are in it too much and they do not see what is happening around it. As in every plant where they examine the level of performance and effectiveness of the workers--this must also be done in the army, and the sooner the better."
