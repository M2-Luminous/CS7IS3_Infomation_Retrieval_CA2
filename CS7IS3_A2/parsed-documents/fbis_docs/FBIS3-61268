With the Same Success"] [Text] It is impossible not to indulge in rereading "A Comedy About a True Calamity Upon the Kingdom of Muscovy, Czar Boris, and Grishka Otrepyev." BORIS: For me there is no happiness, I thought to calm my people With prosperity and glory, To win their love with generous gifts. I remember how the price of gasoline was doubled before the referendum. People went wild; you could cut the cursing with a knife at the gas stations. Suddenly, the price hike was repealed. Shumeyko innocently announced that the hike had been a political mistake. Everybody immediately understood that the hike was not repealed--just postponed. Shortly before the elections, the generosity was far more extensive. A week before the fateful date, the minimum wage was doubled. (Having doubled, it rose dramatically to one-fifth of the poverty level. The only happy people are GAI [state motor-vehicle inspection] personnel, who calculate their extortion in multiples of the minimum wage). And on the eve of the elections, the favors poured as if spilling out of a worn-through sack: Yeltsin signed an edict giving the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] the right to set base salaries and the size of additional categories of cash allowances. Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions. Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions for persons born before 31 December 1931. Yeltsin signed an edict on improving the system of state allowances and payments to families with children and increasing their size. Beginning 1 January, there will be a monthly allowance for each child.... Cheap moves. Expensive inflation. Doctors, teachers, and other "budget-financed" folks all got handouts. Everybody, absolutely everybody, got some presents. And what good did it do? Commission an independent survey. Ask: Has at least one person who got a raise changed his mind in favor of Russia's Choice (the president's party)? Have they managed to buy even one vote? Has not this shower of generosity produced the reverse effect: You want to buy me cheap? here, I will show you! I opened the granaries for them, I scattered Gold in their midst.... But raging, they cursed me! They will say: This was a planned generosity, benefits conceived a long time ago. I will not believe it. Why then was this bundle of favors was announced so rudely the day before the election? Are we not people? Do we not feel humiliated by such sudden benevolence? And how can a humiliated person get even with authority? By not showing up at the polling station or by checking off--out of spite--a different square on the ballot. A sad paradox. Of the entire of Boris Godunov, we best remember "The people are silent"--a phrase Pushkin never wrote! We remember what Zhukovskiy added to the play in order to fool the censors. Pushkin had a different attitude toward the people. But look first how Grishka Otrepyev, an insolent thief, an pretender speaking different languages, talks to people: PRETENDER: Everything conspires in my favor: both people and fate --Who are you? POLE: Sobanskiy, a free Polish gentleman. PRETENDER: Praise and regard to you, the child of freedom! Give him one-third of his allowance in advance. --But who are these? KHRUSHCHEV (Russian): We are your Diligent and persecuted serfs; Disgraced, we have escaped from Moscow. PRETENDER: Take heart, innocent sufferers, Just let me get to Moscow. Czar Boris will pay for all this. Who are you? KARELA: A Cossack. I was sent to you from the Don By free hosts, by brave atamans, By Cossacks from the upper and lower reaches of the Don. PRETENDER: I used to know Don people. I had no doubt That I would see in my ranks the Cossack standards. We thank the Don host of ours. We know that the Cossacks now Are oppressed unjustly and persecuted. But if God helps us to ascend To our fathers' throne, we will honor the old tradition To favor our loyal free Don. Sounds familiar? Typical Zhirinovskiy intonations. His teacher was not stupid when she pounded into their heads: The classics always remain contemporary. Half of the voters did not show up at the polls. (Even less had been expected. By the edict on elections, one-quarter would have been enough). Some did not go out of captious snobbishness: This is beneath me, they said. Others out of a certainty that everything had been decided in advance anyway: An echo of previous decades--whether you show up or not, it is still 99.9 percent. Brothers and sisters! Our brains--all of us--still operate in the Soviet mode. The state is an enemy. It rapes us with residence permits, sticks us into labor camps, sends us to the BAM [Baykal-Amur Mainline], robs us with taxes, strangles us with forms to fill out, makes us deal with boorish bureaucrats; the militia is an enemy, the judges are enemies; they grab our young men and send some of them to the tundra and others to Afghanistan; slogans are lies, promises are lies; we-will-live-under-communism; mind-honor-and-conscience; let-us-respond-with-shock-labor-to; the food program; apartments for everyone by the year 2000; everything for the good of the individual.... For decades, the state worked hard to make people hate it. Hatred toward the government has become a part of our flesh and blood. Live by law and die. You want to live--know how to circumvent it. For decades (generations!) people lived in a country where the rulers, newspapers, radio, and television constantly lied, lied, lied. We all grew up and lived in a society where it was considered valorous to cheat on the state. And stupid to observe the rules. Our national hero is a crook. Ostap Bender. There are as many films about him as about Lenin. And an honest man is a fool, a laughingstock for everyone. An American action movie: The hero is a policeman. Our movie: The hero is a thief. Govorukhin himself played gangsters, not procurators. Hatred toward the authorities. This is how Yeltsin won against Gorbachev. The whole world loved Gorby, but the Soviet people were for Yeltsin! He took a dip, he looked extremely slumberous during his appearances in America; the KGB set traps for him every step of the way--and it all worked in his favor. Gorbachev had the Army, the KGB, the omnipotent apparatus, but the people chose Yeltsin! For his wise program? For his promise to get rid of privileges? No. Yeltsin was against our dear party-and-government. That was all. And quite enough. Now Zhirinovskiy has played this card and won. Do people really believe his babbling about free vodka? Do they thirst for Khazanov to be executed by firing squad? Do they want to fight on 33 fronts simultaneously? No. But Zhirinovskiy is against the authorities. That is all. And quite enough. BASMANOV (commander in chief of the Muscovite Army): We have sufficient forces, thank God! I shall inspire them with victory; And you--whom will you send against me? Not Karela the Cossack? Or Mniszek? And are there many of you? Why, a mere eight thousand. PUSHKIN (an adherent of the Pretender): You are mistaken; you will not find even that number of them--I myself say it, our army is rubbish, The Cossacks merely plunder villages, The Poles merely boast and drink, While the Russians.... there's no denying it.... With you I'll not dissemble; But do you know what we are strong in, Basmanov? Not in our army, no, not in Polish aid, But in opinion--yes! In popular opinion. The people are not silent. Do you understand? There is a tremendous difference between Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy. Yeltsin promised reforms, which is very difficult to do. It is hard and long, and nobody knows how to do it, and there is much theft, and many lies.... Zhirinovskiy promises war. This is very easy. Just give it a push! And then it will keep moving on its own. Once you start a war--try to stop it. Remember how the Georgians saw the suppression of Abkhazia as an easy stroll. A day or two; maximum a week. And now Shevardnadze crawls on his knees: Take us into the CIS! Give us bread! We are dying! War has devoured the well-fed, blessed, rich, resort-like Georgia. And it continues to devour, picking the bones. One thing is good--Zhirinovskiy's victory woke Yeltsin up. He finally learned the true worth of his advisers, the cunning courtiers. Stankevich, Bragin, and others have been fired. That Bragin was professionally and otherwise unfit to serve as the radio and television chief was clear to everyone from the very beginning. It was clear BEFORE he was appointed. The flight of the best people from Ostankino, the idiotic agitation and propaganda--he got away with everything. Finally, on 3 October, Bragin, out of cowardice and stupidity, shut down Channel 1, plunging the country into a shudder of horror. And afterwards--rewards, kisses, medals. God deliver me from fools. What good has the FITs [Federal Information Center] accomplished over the time of its existence? What has it accomplished at all? A gigantic, very rich agency had been bestowed upon a favorite, but other than getting into scandals with the procuracy, Poltoranin has not accomplished anything whatsoever. Actually, this is not correct. The night after the election, he celebrated at the Feast of Democracy, drank champagne to the New Political Year, and hugged Zhirinovskiy. Since Poltoranin has not given any reason to suspect him of being gay, we have to consider his heavy petting with Zh. [an allusion; both the name Zhirinovskiy and the Russian obscene word for derriere--"zhopa"--start with the letter Zh.] as having a political, rather than sexual, overtone. A farsighted political P. [prostitute]. (This is not me about Poltoranin--Lenin said this about Trotskiy). What other heroic deeds should the hapless Kozyrev commit to be dismissed from his job for innumerable flops in Russian foreign policy? Having watched Kozyrev for three years saying "Yes, yes, yes" to America and Western Europe, one begins to feel nostalgic for Gromyko, with his "No, no, no." And what did we get as a result of endless concessions? What kind of presents? Seven pills of aspirin per capita of bad population? The weak are disliked; the stupid get no respect; and liars are hated. As a result, we have icy relations with the nuclear Ukraine. And jubilation in Pentagon: Hurrah! The end of thaw! Kravchuk is clinging to his nuclear bombs; the mad hawk Zhirinovskiy has won the elections--this is enough for the Pentagon to hammer $20 million-$30 million out of Congress. Oh, the Cold War--that was a golden time! A generals' time! Why did Bragin kiss Zhirinovskiy? Why not kiss Grachev? What else does Grachev have to do to get dismissed? The Western Group of Troops has rotted on the stalk. Traders-general transport booty by military aircraft.... The Army must love and respect its commander. You cannot make people face death by giving them salaries and apartments. These are not very smart hopes. Salaries and apartment exist to keep the Army from mutiny, no more than that. They do not instill a fighting spirit. Only love, respect, and fear push people into battle. Salaries and apartments are a market. A market operates on different criteria, different incentives, different values. When you are facing a wall of firepower, an apartment is not part of your conscious mind. Does the Army love Zhirinovskiy? You bet! He promises it war and conquest. Which means medals, fame, and riches. The Army is sick and tired of being despised, of riding in tanks across the motherland and the capital. Zhirinovskiy, of course, promises money and apartments, but he does not have them. Realistically, all he can give is war. Guys! Soldiers and sailors, sergeants and corporals, officers, generals, and admirals, do understand: Zhirinovskiy is no Napoleon and no Suvorov; it is not the eighteenth century, and the time of brave conquests and crusades is over. Friend Saddam did try to stick his hand into Kuwait, plundered a bit, did some shooting, but very soon got hit on the head, and now sits in his bunker and knows that at any moment.... What the Russian Army needs is not Grachev and not Zhirinovskiy. The Russian Army needs Lebed. Very tough (perhaps even cruel), but one can see right away: He does not steal, and he is not a traitor. The Russian Army should get a person it trusts and who will not sell it off. As to Grachev.... He is a minister, of course, except for one small problem--the Army does not follow him. Give it to Lebed before Zhirinovskiy takes it. Whether Lebed will agree to take it is another question. And if again--after such lessons!--the apparat games continue.... Well, then we will continue rereading Pushkin and will keep coming across this terrible remark of the cunning courtier: SHUYSKIY: Well then? If Boris does not give up his sly ways Let us begin to skillfully incite the people.
