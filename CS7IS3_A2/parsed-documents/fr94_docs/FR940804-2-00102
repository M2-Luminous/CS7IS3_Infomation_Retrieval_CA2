SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are proposing to change policies and regulations within their Federal rangeland management programs. These actions are intended to improve and restore a significant portion of rangeland ecosystems and to improve and maintain biodiversity, while providing for sustainable development on lands administered by the two agencies. The two agencies are also proposing to revise the formula used to determine fees charged for grazing livestock on Federal lands in the 17 western states. The Bureau of Land Management, with the cooperation of the Forest Service, has prepared a draft EIS analyzing the environmental effects of the proposed changes in their rangeland management programs. The draft EIS is a national-level, programmatic analysis. It documents the ecological, economic, and social impacts that would result from alternative fee formulas and from reforming, or not reforming, other elements of the Federal rangeland management program. Five management alternatives are considered in detail: Current Management (No Action); BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action; Livestock Production; Environmental Enhancement; and No Grazing. Seven grazing fee formula alternatives are also analyzed: Current Public Rangeland Improvement Act (PRIA) (No Action); Modified PRIA; BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action; Regional Fees; Federal Forage Fee; PRIA with Surcharges; and Competitive Bidding. Dated: August 1, 1994. Jonathan P. Deason, Director, Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19075 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;84&hyph;P
