This was reported to a Trud correspondent by the chairman of the Department of Especially Dangerous Infections at the City Committee on Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, Lyudmila Alekseyeva. The patient is in the city's second infectious hospital. He is Yevgeniy Zhigunov, 48, without fixed place of abode. Before being brought to the hospital, Zhigunov, in his own words, ``had not been feeling well'' for about a week. He was working as a guard of a truck in which he also slept. He drank water from ponds and puddles where, evidently, he contracted the infection. ``This is not an epidemic'' added L. Alekseyeva. ``Individual cases like this occur annually but do not lead to any noticeable consequences.''
