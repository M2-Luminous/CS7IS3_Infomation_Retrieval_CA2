FBIS TRENDS-11MAY94-POLAND Former Communists Favor Austerity Policy Over Labor Demands Former Communists Favor Austerity Policy Over Labor Demands SUMMARY Faced with a wave of Solidarity trade union strikes, the formerly communist Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD) electoral bloc has reaffirmed its support for its governing coalition's austerity plan, branding the strikers as a threat to democracy and to free market reforms. While the SLD's allies in the government have also criticized Solidarity's decision to strike, many coalition leaders have also expressed sympathy for Solidarity's demands and called for a loosening of the government's anti-inflation efforts. END SUMMARY Seeing Solidarity's tactics as politically motivated rather than economic, SLD leaders have strongly denounced Solidarity's ongoing nationwide strikes that began on 26 April. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, deputy chairman of the SLD's main party, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP), said during a meeting with workers from the FSO car plant that he did "not accept" any union that has put "overthrowing the government as its aim" (PAP, 4 May). He went on to accuse Solidarity leaders of playing "political games for their own benefit" (Warsaw TV, 4 May). After the strikes began, a Government Press Bureau Communique blasted Solidarity, saying that "unrest and tensions are what count" for the union and that "the content itself of the demands and negotiations is of lesser importance." It further warned of the "danger to the security of the country" and threat to its "chances for economic development" posed by the strikes (PAP, 27 April). The SdRP's Trybuna daily echoed these sentiments in a front page commentary on 28 April that accused Solidarity of pushing for a "revolutionary change on the scale of what happened in the late 1980's." The commentary unabashedly added that the union will likely be disappointed to find that "the majority of Poles don't have a willingness for a withdrawal from democratic law and a return to socialism." Solidarity's Stance In announcing the strikes, Solidarity leaders issued a number of demands to ease the effects of the economic reforms on its workers. Solidarity's main demand is the immediate lifting of restrictions on wage increases in state-owned industries- -restrictions that were initiated with the inauguration of "shock therapy" in 1990 by the Mazowiecki government. Although in March the new government rescinded a previous law mandating heavy taxes on "excessive" wage increases in state firms, a new and quite similar law was then proposed by the government, and the parliament has voted to extend the taxes until the end of the year. Solidarity has also announced other demands, including lower taxes for workers, a reduction in the work week to 40 hours, "social support" for poor families, and lower fuel prices (Gazeta Wyborcza, 5 May). AA Coalition Partners' Position While Solidarity's decision to strike has been condemned by virtually every political group, some SdRP allies have been critical of the government's labor policies and have even threatened to resign from the coalition. Ewa Spychalska, head of the National Trade Union Alliance (OPZZ)--a union formed by the former communists in the 198O's as an alternative to Solidarity and a member of the SLD--admitted in a 26 April interview with PAP that although she has "doubts about the road chosen by Solidarity," its demands are "generally compatible with those put to the government by OPZZ." According to PAP, Spychalska also warned the government not to "push the unions into a corner" and "did not rule out the possibility of the OPZZ leaving the coalition." A similar sentiment was echoed by Ryszard Bugaj, chairman of a former Solidarity party, the small Union of Labor (UP), that has one member in the cabinet--Industry Minister Marek Pol. Bugaj told journalists that the strikes demonstrated that "we are gradually beginning to pay the bills for this government's measures." He further suggested that if the government's labor policies do not change, Pol might resign and the UP might "go into a definite kind of opposition" (Zycie Warszawy, 28 April), thus eliminating the government's only link to former Solidarity. Even Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, head of the SLD's main coalition partner, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), expressed sympathy for the strikers, saying that while the protests "are not justified on such a large scale," they are "a sign" for his government and "show very clearly how great the people's impatience is that these difficult matters be resolved" (Warsaw radio, 3O April). Implications While the SLD is experiencing the same difficulty that other governing parties faced before them -- maintaining a strict monetary and fiscal policy while attempting to limit popular discontent with the reforms -- it has the additional burden of living up to its campaign promises before the election. Pledging during the campaign to soften the reform's effects on beleaguered workers and pensioners, the party is now facing the hard realities of limited funds for social spending and the need to retard inflation by keeping the lid on wages. Although new parliamentary elections are not scheduled until 1997, the SLD may be hurting the chances of its candidate in the 1995 presidential elections by holding firm on its strong anti-inflationary stand, and may even be undermining its coalition with other parties and groups. Faced with increasing social unrest and possible pressure from their rank-and-file members, its coalition partners may decide to leave the governing coalition and the OPZZ might withdraw from the electoral alliance. Furthermore, the SdRP, the SLD's main party, will likely face internal pressures to moderate its policy, threatening the party either with a split or a forced withdrawal from its austerity program.
