According to prison rules, Sundays and national holidays should be nonworking days. This year, International Labor Day, that is, 1 May, happened to be on a Sunday. The following Monday should thus have been a compensation day for the convicts. However, the prison authorities announced that routine work would continue on 2 May. The decision aroused protests from the convicts, who all refused to sleep. The prisoners sang the song "Unity Is Strength" and shouted slogans, such as "guaranteeing off days, opposing forced work" and "we want to meet leaders, oppose suppression." At 2300 that evening, the convicts opened the doors of their blocks and staged a sit-in in the prison yard. Guards fired warning shots and drove the convicts back into their cells. Then, the two sides fought [as published]. It is said that there were more than 30 casualties. One prison guard was killed by rioting convicts with iron bars and three prisoners were shot dead. After the incident, the prison authorities were forced to cancel "normal work" on 2 May.
