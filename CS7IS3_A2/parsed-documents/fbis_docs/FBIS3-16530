Accompanied by Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov, first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Kray administration, the guest toured the ship and visited the navigation bridge. Subsequently, the minister of foreign affairs went down to the ship's wardroom where officers and crew waited for him. In a short talk, the minister noted that the Russian Army and the fleet, like the country, are experiencing a difficult time. However, this is not the first time that this has happened in Russia and that is why the Navy must live through it appropriately; skillfully defend the fatherland; serve the Constitution; and carry out the president's orders. The Pacific Fleet is a great fleet and we will strengthen it, and we do not intend to divide the other fleets. From the ship, Andrey Kozyrev, minister for foreign affairs, set out for Vladivostok Airport where he met Warren Christopher, U.S. secretary of state, who had arrived for talks. After the talks, a short briefing was held for Russian and foreign journalists.
