FR940110-1-00024 FR940110-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Part 103 [INS No. 1384&hyph;92; AG Order No. 1821&hyph;93] RIN 1115&hyph;AD18 Adjustment to the Examinations Fee Schedule AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This rule proposes to adjust the current Examinations Fee schedule for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in order to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing immigration and naturalization services, and to change procedures and charges for the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, Form I&hyph;129, in response to INS and user experiences. The fee adjustment is needed to comply with specific Federal immigration laws and the Federal user fee statute and regulations, which require the recipients of special benefits from Government services that are not directed to the public at large to bear the costs to the Government of providing those services. The fees proposed in this rule result from an analysis of adjudication and naturalization services and associated costs for fiscal years 1993 and 1994, and are calculated to recover the costs of providing these special services and benefits. This proposed rule ensures that funds will be available to continue to improve the quality of service to users. Its financial impact on users of the services is small. In most cases the proposed fee increase is five dollars. In the aggregate this proposed fee increase is slightly less than the projected change in the consumer price index since the last general fee increase in April 1991. DATES: Written comments must be submitted on or before February 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must be submitted in writing for consideration. Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch; Immigration and Naturalization Service; 425 I Street, NW.; room 5307; Washington, DC 20536&hyph;0002. To ensure proper handling, please reference INS No. 1384&hyph;92 on your correspondence. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara J. Atherton, Chief, Fee Analysis and Operations Branch, Office of Finance; Immigration and Naturalization Service; 425 I Street, NW.; room 6240; Washington, DC 20536&hyph;0002; telephone 202&hyph;616&hyph;2754.
