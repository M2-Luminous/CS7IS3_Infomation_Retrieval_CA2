FR941004-1-00027 FR941004-1-00005 Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. it has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this action to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Because most waterway traffic can be accommodated by the alternate fixed span channel and the rule would revert to its previous less restrictive form when the vertical clearance under the alternate fixed span was less than 52 feet, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this propsal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is innecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et al. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because the impacts of this proposal are expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) that this proposal will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism This proposal has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment This proposal has been reviewed by the Coast Guard and has been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation under the authority of 40 CFR Section 1507.3 and in accordance with paragraph 2.B.2.g.(5) of the NEPA Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B. A copy of the Categorical Exclusion Certification is available for review in the rulemaking docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges.
