Dhimitropoulou] [Text] Mitrofan Studenikin, chairman of the Russian Friendship Association with Cyprus who is visiting our country at the head of a three-member delegation, told our paper yesterday that the association will propose to the Russian parliament the establishment of a parliamentary group for contacts with Cyprus. Studenikin reiterated the support of his country and association for the Cypriot people and stressed that the purpose of their visit is to strengthen traditionally friendly relations between the Cypriot and Russian peoples, which have recently slackened because of the political developments in Russia. Studenikin stressed, however, that the association continues to act and work for the good of both peoples. Many Cypriot students, workers, and businessmen who live in Russia have frequent contacts with the association while a publications exhibition on Cyprus was recently organized in Moscow, which was successful. During their stay the delegation has met with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Archbishop Khrisostomos, the secretary and other leading members of the Cyprus-Soviet Friendship Society, and representatives of the Association of Soviet Higher Educational Institutes Graduates and exchanged views aimed at further strengthening the relations between the Cypriot and Russian peoples.
