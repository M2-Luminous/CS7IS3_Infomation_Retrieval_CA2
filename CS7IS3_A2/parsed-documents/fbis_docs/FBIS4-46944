Questions about the attitude of the domestic business community toward the presence of foreign banks in Russia come up at virtually all meetings between bankers and journalists. However, it is now becoming absolutely clear that this question is no longer topical. Nobody recalls any longer the norm of 12 percent of the combined capital of commercial banks to which foreign banking capital is restricted. Meanwhile, it is precisely this norm that currently determines the market share of banking institutions with foreign capital. The combined statutory capital of foreign banks is about $100 million. Meanwhile, the Inkombank alone will increase its statutory capital from $50 million to $100 million during 1994. The Yugorskiy Bank is placing the third issue of shares and counting on an increase in its statutory capital to R50 billion. According to the latest rating, the Inkombank ranks eighth, and the Yugorskiy Bank, 25th. The might of a Russian bank no longer hinges solely on a broadly advertised name and a rapidly developing chain of branches, but also on the division of the client market. Large clients and special exporters who are welcome guests at all banks have long opted for their domestic banking institutions. Large clients frequently purchase the stock of banks in which their accounts are open, which results in additional advantages for these enterprises. Russian banks that have attracted these clients provide the greatest possible range of services; they have grown to be large financial institutions by European standards. The final partition of the market of large clients is also confirmed by the fact that large banks are now fighting for clients who are private individuals. It is quite symbolic that the Yugorskiy Bank, which has been nurtured by the domestic exporters of oil and refinery products, rapidly implemented the restructuring of the bank and, effective 16 May, began to work with private individuals. At the beginning of 1994, the MMB [Moscow International Bank], the oldest foreign bank in Russia, revised its market strategy. The bank shifted from international currency settlements and the distribution of the credit lines of international financial institutions to full-fledged services to Russian and Western enterprises, also developing debit operations. As a matter of fact, the MMB, which was founded in 1989, joined the competitive struggle as late as four years later. Even now, new banks are not under any illusion as far as attracting currency clients is concerned. They bet on sufficiently large and medium-size Russian enterprises and organizations. The effectiveness of settlements, the accrual of interest on accounts, and opportunities for taking out credit and performing fiduciary operations are becoming the main points. The banks are vigorously developing stock market instruments--bills of exchange and deposit certificates, which ensure tax relief for their clients. Therefore, the development of a customer base is becoming a great problem for foreign banks. This base is turning out to be quite narrow in Russia because foreign banks go after large commercial and industrial customers. The offices of foreign banks do not allow them to establish services for nonresident private individuals who might prefer a domestic bank over a local bank [as published]. Foreign banks must obtain a license for each new branch. For this reason, they are now based in Moscow and St. Petersburg where the market is the most saturated. A branch of the Austria Bank sometimes acts as a clearing bank of sorts, an intermediary between regional credit institutions. However, this can hardly be called the rule. Interregional and interrepublic settlements through foreign banks are difficult. This factor also reduces the attractiveness of Western banks on the Russian market. Fundamental restrictions imposed on the development of foreign banks in Russia by the Central Bank are much more significant than restrictions on operations with rubles, which have been set forth in a presidential edict. This is all the more so because, with a tacit approval from Neglinnaya Street, foreign banks have embarked on operations with Russian currency quietly and in a planned manner. The Central Bank came out against the presidential restrictions right away. In turn, the presidential edict does not provide for sanctions against violators. The developed draft Law on the Bank of Russia and the draft Law on Banks and Banking envision that, in the future, the Central Bank will continue to regulate the operation of joint and foreign banks and their branches in the Russian territory.
