FBIS3-46627 "dreas002__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-002-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 January 1994 ANNEX Japan LDP Leader Criticizes Ozawa-Style Reforms OW0401050194 Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU in Japanese Dec 93 pp 94-109 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0401050194 Tokyo BUNGEI SHUNJU Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Special Article by Michio Watanabe, Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] member of the House of Representatives, entitled: "Ozawa-Style Reform Is Pursuing its Objectives Too Hastily."] [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], after losing its rein on government as the result of the general elections, seems to have lost its self-confidence and to be on the verge of flight. The coalition government asserts it will carry on the LDP's policies, and for all that, the LDP cannot change its way of thinking. However, it cannot be construed to be in a posture determined to regain the reins of government when the party president utters the same thing as what Prime Minister Hosokawa says and party members appear in television programs only to criticize their party's defects in expectation of popular applause. I am fully aware of the uneasy feeling of those who remain in the LDP amidst the spreading atmosphere that they have lost the chance to climb aboard the bandwagon now that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] has split off and the coalition regime enjoys high popularity ratings. However, now is the time for the LDP to make clear and have the people understand how it differs from the coalition regime and be ready to launch the battle to win back power in the near future. The LDP must apologize to the people for what it must reflect upon and prepare for the battle. The objective, however, is not to regain popular support and win the elections. The objective is to have the people understand what will be done with the power regained by the victory and how what it will do differs from what the coalition cabinet will do. I am telling young politicians frequently: "I do not think you have become politicians to put a badge on your lapels. Go ahead and do in a dignified manner the things that you wanted to do in becoming politicians." It is still fresh in everybody's memory, so I cannot say it crisply, but let me say it. In the wake of post-general election confusion, many of my colleagues held me back from being a candidate in the election for the LDP presidency for which people of other factions recommended me. I dared to run because I wanted to make clear the difference between the LDP from the coalition cabinet as well as my thoughts and ideas to recapture power to, first of all, bring business out of recession. Miscalculations led me to failure, but I feel a responsibility at all times since I received forty percent support. After the coalition government came into being, business conditions worsened. The people are bewildered by the statement of Prime Minister Hosokawa who defined the pre-war Japanese activities as the war of aggression, and they are wavering in their trust in the state. Such difficult problems are left untouched and unsolved as the state of the Self-Defense Forces, introduction of the consumption tax, and cutting the income tax, pension reforms, and liberalization of rice controls. The coalition government is fond of using the term "sense of versatile values," which means adjustment of versatile interests. And progress is not made in these political fundamentals due to the lack of seasoned political personalities and the disunited response of the eight groups. Above all, the underlying discordance among the coalition about the political reform which is the sole adhesive that puts the coalition together is widely known. Flowery catch phrases such as decentralization of power and deregulation are spoken of, but politics is not a forum. I would say that now is about the time for the coalition to emerge from the period of the "wakaba mark" [the symbol mark of a novice driver, hence meaning political freshman]. In the face of a violently changing time of internationalization, the people are disturbed if the government deals with such a situation leisurely. It is vital to possess a fresh sense, but the management of state affairs requires appropriate experience. Cars driven by inexperienced drivers are precarious, even if seasoned instructors of driving schools help control the accelerators. Now is the time, I think, that Japanese politics should be retaken into the hands of the professionals who have upheld its traditional liberalism, by fighting out the struggle for power. Our running about in confusion only serves our adversary's advantage. We have to read again the LDP's platform, and only those who resonantly agree with that spirit are urged to unite to create a new future. It does no good to follow the examples of the new political parties because they are popular. I think it is important to clarify the difference in vision and the different way of exercising power. As a result, if we come together in our ambitions, it is more than natural for us to sweat it out for the people, discarding all the past complications. `Good Power' and `Bad Power' I was one of the three candidates, including Messrs. Miyazawa and Mitsuzuka, for the LDP presidency two years ago. At that time, I put forward "Honne [real intention] and Determined Leadership" as my slogan. To develop Japan as a new world state, I offered the following as the essence of my vision: One, changing Japan to an honorable nation among the comity of nations; two, building up a social system in which a free economy with a society guided by the greying generation does not lose its vitality; three, bringing forth a society in which an affluent heart is enjoyed in daily life. I appealed that now is the time for Japan to challenge the taboo that it is a historical inevitability that a prosperous nation will perish. At that time, the Keiseikai was the largest faction and, as a matter of reality, it was impossible to become the LDP president without the faction's support. Press reports had it that Mr. Ozawa, acting Keiseikai chairman, understood my assertions. Indeed, Mr. Ozawa's "A Plan To Reform Japan" has many points in common with my thoughts. The election ended with the formation of the Miyazawa cabinet, at the nomination of Mr. Kanemaru. Since then, I have found myself many times in agreement with Mr. Ozawa in political ideal and policy matters. The reports that Mr. Ozawa and I might take the same action because of these factors are based only on an aspect of politics at this time. Contrary to many things in common in policy matters, I am saying this because our way of thinking is drastically different as it stands now about how to use power to realize these policies. However the mass media may agitate, I do not think actual politics would work without ideals and policy going hand-in-hand with the way of using power to materialize them. The realities of power that make the eight-group coalition possible do not match with my ideals. I mean that I cannot participate in power that is supported by the majority which includes not only the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which is out of the question, but also Soka Gakkai [a large religious group which supports Komeito -- Clean Government Party], the exclusive --going against the principles of liberalism -- organization of the faithful of the Ikeda sect that was excommunicated by Nichiren Shoshu [religious group]. The word "power" tends to be misunderstood, but I want to distinguish it clearly between "good power" and "bad power." Out of the question is worldly power in pursuit of status, honor, and gains. What I mean by "good power" is a democratic process with the aim of materializing policies. It requires me to win the elections and control the majority--but in doing so, the basic standards of following rules and sharing the same ideals must be observed. Politics without ideals nor policies would do no good, but if politics can be managed only with ideals and policies, professors can make a prime minister. On the other hand, those bent on getting ministerial posts in pursuit of worldly position and gain are what they call politicians. What I call "good power" is the power -- the technique that materializes political ideals and policies step by step through compromise with reality. Someone said to me: "Mr. Watanabe, Max Weber had said the same thing as you say." According to them, Weber is quoted to have said: "Politics means efforts to get a share of power and exert influence over the distribution of power. It is a matter of religion what the entities that exercise power should be." Mr. Ozawa's "beliefs" -- as I interpret by reading his "A Plan To Reform Japan" -- have many identical things with my "beliefs." As the matter stands now, "the efforts to exert influence over the distribution of power" are not the same. However, it may be permissible to a certain degree as was seen in the case of bartering policies with other parties when the consumption tax was passed. Why Leadership Was Lost The LDP's ideals, as can be defined from its platform, may be summarized as follows: Social order should be based on free competition; importance should be attached to public interests as well as human rights; the economy should be a market economy; and in diplomacy, national interests should be considered within world harmony. The actual LDP policies, however, were quite different. And many of them succeeded. During the postwar period when growth was considered a priority and when Japan attempted to get rid of poverty, growth was encouraged by providing subsidies and controlling free competition. And many such handicaps still remain in today's Japan whcih has become an economic power. In reality, it is a fact that the peculiar situation that Japan is a defeated nation has saved her from sharing the costs of international society, and that momentum continues as short-sighted insistence on national interests. It was always the LDP that has dealt with such reforms with the ideal of a political party professing traditional liberalism as its foundation. These are the Japan-U.S. declaration of alliance during the Ohira cabinet, the civilian vitality-introducing programs and administrative reforms during the Nakasone cabinet, the introduction of the consumption tax during the Takeshita cabinet, undertaking the peacekeeping operations during the Miyazawa cabinet and so on. I am astonished to find men of various political parties that expressed opposition to these reforms at those times are sitting in the cabinet ministers' seats of the coalition government, ignoring past claims and tactfully using statements as a minister on one occasion and beliefs as a politician on another. Today when Japan has become a world economic power and the world structure based on the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has collapsed, the LDP and few of the then opposition parties had ideas to change diplomatic and economic policies and social systems. The problem was that some members of the LDP were dissatisfied with the speed with which reforms were undertaken. One of the reasons behind the delay in the reforms can be traced back to a lack of leadership. I, myself, hate talking in a roundabout way as well as in indecisive terms. There were times when realization of policies was delayed and the nation despaired in the confusion due to a lack of leadership. In "A Plan To Reform Japan" are found the following passages: "The power of the LDP regime is divided between the LDP and the government;" and "it is the problem of how to free the prime minister's power which has been contained by convention and bad customs under the 1955 order." As Mr. Ozawa acknowledges, in the LDP prior to the Tanaka cabinet there was vitality originating from severe power struggles between the mainstream and nonmainstream factions as well as the leadership of the party president-prime minister. Why did that leadership disappear? The primary reason was the two-fold structure of power that Keiseikai of the Tanaka faction, the most influential and largest intraparty faction, gained giving it the key to decide who would head the regime without producing prime ministers, except Mr. Takeshita, thus actually controlling the party. The power structure of the coalition government is quite similiar. Political parties are the foundation of the parliamentary cabinet system, and they are the eight groups that form the coalition. But their power and the power of the Prime Minister's Office are apparently divided. It is the same structure of the then LDP which was the target of criticism. I wonder how Mr. Ozawa is assessing this point. Keiseikai, however, was split by the unexpected resignation of Mr. Kanemaru as the faction's chairman. The best way to accelerate reform would have been for Keiseikai to keep a simple majority within the party and to maintain its unity without Mr. Kanemaru's resignation. I heard that Keiseikai was trying "to win 200 Diet members over to its fold" and it might well have been true. The second way to accelerate reform without causing intraparty friction with other factions is to introduce principles of competition in politics under the two-party system with Keiseikai in the center. The prerequisite for this idea is reform in the electoral system, and the two-party system -- or the two great powers -- were to be born as the result of such reforms. "The process of political reform I had in mind was, first, reforming the system, followed by political realignment," Mr. Ozawa honestly confided. If the political world were reorganized as the result of changes to the system, a cabinet could have never been formed by the eight groups of different basic ideas, causing anxiety over crisis management in both diplomatic and domestic affairs. Kanemaru's resignation came like a bolt out of the blue. The ensuing struggles for leadership and dividing membership into "reformists" and "old guards" are hard to understand for outsiders. But it was true that they were divided over how to proceed with political reform as well as reform in the electoral system. Then came the split, the dissolution of the House of Representatives, and the formation of the coalition. Mr. Ozawa is a man indifferent to such worldly power as honor and status, but it seems to me that he is too hastily pursuing "good power." When the eight groups of different basic ideas employ the same method to grasp power as intraparty factions do by mustering enough supporting members, I wonder which group will take the responsibility for the failure of "efforts to exert influence over the distribution of power" in executing diplomatic as well as domestic affairs, irrespective of the righteousness of the "things" over which the power is exercised. It is awful to think of it. Mr. Kakuei Tanaka was a politician of foresight and with power of execution. Because he was too hasty in seeking power, "right things" seemed to have resulted in incompleteness. I am the kind of man who has a hasty temper, and therefore I persuade myself "less haste, less speed." As for Mr. Ozawa, who is reported to be studying the Meiji restoration, I hope and expect him to perform the role of Toshimichi Okubo whom he is said to respect, not the roles of Shoin Yoshida or Ryoma Sakamoto who were too hasty in pursuit of their objectives. Or he may be in the state of Takamori Saigo's mind, since he has no big ambition for worldly status. Coalition Cabinet Is `Provisional Being' Assuming the coalition cabinet of eight groups of different basic ideas to be an inevitable provisional shape for the purpose of speeding up reforms, a question is posed: What should the future shape of the Japanese political world be? Before answering that question, let me introduce interesting exchanges in the Diet. Mr. Imazu [Rep. Hiroshi Imazu of Hokkaido's 2d Electoral District] raised a question: "Is the present regime a provisional being?" Deputy Prime Minister Hata answered: "It could be defined as either a provisional or an unavoidable measure." Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: "We will hold fast to the aspiration that we are not a provisional cabinet." Mr. Ochi [Rep. Michio Ochi of Tokyo's 3d Electoral District] asked, "What is the central uniting element of the two big powers?" and Prime Minister Hosokawa answered: "That depends on the kind of political cause put forward at a given moment." I suppose Shinseito has feelings in the back of its mind that the coalition of the eight groups of different basic ideas is not hitting it off together after all. The remarks of Prime Minister Hosokawa were beyond political common sense, either due to the fact that he unintentionally revealed the lack of basic ideas or because he has always been riding on a winning horse. As Mr. Ozawa pointed out, "Reform of the electoral system is the means for reforming politics, and the objective itself." In my opinion, a coalition can be successful when its component members share common basic political ideas that direct both diplomatic and domestic affairs. Whether the next general election or the one following it are held under the new election system depends on the future political situation. But the elections under the single-seat electoral district system are expected to succeed in fixing the present framework of the LDP and non-LDP camps. It is all the same, even if the current coalition were an "unavoidable measure" or were formed "by a political cause at a given time," because the coalition is inevitably required to unite to defeat LDP candidates. What is the motive of Shinseito, which considers the present situation to be a provisional one and which is proceeding with the objective of achieving a "nonprovisional" political reorganization? The fact that the coalition includes Komeito, which is bent on participating in a regime without definite ideas, makes the matter complicated. Memoranda of former Komeito Chairman Junya Yano in articles published by the monthly magazine BUNGEI SHUNJU vividly expose who is exerting influence over both foreign and domestic affairs through Soka Gakkai and Komeito. When viewed from the standpoint of the people, I would rather suggest seeking the possibility of a coalition among those sharing common ideas (such as the LDP, Shinseito, Sakigake, and the Japan New Party), by discarding personal feelings and bygones prior to the elections held under the single-seat electoral district system. These were the appeals I made when I ran in the last election for the LDP presidency. We have to immediately adjust the LDP platform and draw up a chart of political reorganization in which the LDP is placed in the center as a traditional political party of liberalism determined to serve the nation under a vision appropriate to the times. I am confident that the LDP can win back popular support if it presents a new vision -- one different from the coalition -- with the aim of making Japan more peaceful and its people happier than the coalition cabinet can, thus demonstrating the LDP to be a traditional political party of liberalism with clear responsibility and vitality. If the LDP takes an ambiguous attitude devoid of the most important ideals because it is distracted by the current situation, its efforts to return to power cannot help being termed presumptuous. Because the foreign and domestic policies of the Hosokawa cabinet are inconsistent, the LDP is encouraged to be more assured about its past achievements. An example is the catchphrase of "deregulation." Abolishing and setting up controls must be based on firm political ideas. Do the eight groups of the coalition have these? How many professional politicians who can carry through the persuasion of those concerned (including those supporting the coalition) do they have? As for the field of domestic affairs, I think that the LDP should have more confidence. In foreign affairs, the concepts of the coalition are more contradictory. While Mr. Ozawa insists on Japan's becoming an "ordinary nation" with "strong national concepts," Prime Minister Hosokawa repeated in his answers at the Diet that he "would not take that course." With respect to this point, the SDJP is out of the question, and Komeito is ominous because it takes elastic stands. Therefore, I advise the LDP to be more confident about this. The eight groups of the coalition are in a state of chaos in which "those who give priority to popular opinion" and "those who give priority to the public interest" are mixed together in terms of the basis of their political thinking. I predict that they will come to a deadlock sooner or later. And that is a problem for the Japanese people. To avoid that situation, the LDP must do its utmost to let the people know the merits of the LDP's policies. I plan to make appeals to the nation myself to clarify our foreign and domestic visions and policies in concrete terms. Those assembled under the banner of traditional liberalism must be confident and must make efforts to win back "good power." To not be carried away by the atmosphere and to not forget essential things, I want to mention several points proposed by the Hosokawa cabinet. Because the coalition maintains that it will continue the ideas and policies of the LDP regime, I agree with its catchphrases -- all of them. But the problem is how to carry them out, not the proposals. It is important to pay attention to essential problems and not to pay too much attention to winning popularity. Government Political Reform Plan Inclined To Control There is no perfect election system. The current medium-sized election district system has both merits and shortcomings. To our regret, both voters and politicians became used to the system because both of them have employed this system for so long. Most scandals were the results of their failures. The medium-sized election district system alone cannot be blamed. Rather, all the political parties have become accustomed to the situation in which there have been no changes of government since 1955, and then the dregs of the 1955 order overflowed. The LDP's perennial hold on power is not the sole fault of the LDP. I think that it was due to the good-for-nothing political parties headed by the SDPJ which have been unable to present better policies than the LDP to the people and to win their support. Also, the government actually did change hands under the medium-sized election district system. But it is an extremely unstable regime composed of a coalition of eight groups with different basic ideas. Currently, discord is evident in the Diet debates, and I wonder how the Japanese Government would respond to such hypothetical situations as military tensions on the Korean peninsula or demands for peacekeeping operations. On the assumption that the United States will throw the SII [Japanese-U.S. structural impediments initiative] fastball, I think that there should be a stable government responsible for Japan's fate. Since the LDP is reflecting upon the habitual practice and inertia [idling away while having done nothing new] it enjoyed during its long period of one-party rule, it is inevitable that political reform will seek a situation under which two political parties with stable foundations for establishing an administration will work hard together to respond to the wishes of the people. For that purpose, I personally consider the single-seat election district system to be the best system. In consideration of the small political parties, however, the LDP proposes the heiritsu system [which adds the element of proportional representation], and I think that this is the second-best plan. Under the medium-sized election district system, a plural number of candidates from the same party compete in the same electoral district to make it an election of individuals. Contrarily, under the single-seat election district system, political parties are in charge of the election campaign. Voters can vote only for candidates who political parties have nominated for their districts, and party organizations rather than individuals become the center of activity. Therefore, political parties have to decide such matters as the selection of candidates, the method of the election campaign, and the distribution of election funds and personnel in accordance with open and fair rules. Under the medium-sized election district system, candidates and voters both have freedom of activity and room to act as freely as they like. Therefore, in some cases, voters and candidates abuse their freedom under the medium-sized election system, and this excessive freedom has come under criticism. In a free economy, speculations and corners are permitted. But, for that matter, those who go to extremes will be criticized as "wicked merchants." It is a matter of business morals and the human nature of individuals. Under a rationing system, "wicked merchants" may be eradicated, but the situation without them may be no better than the situation with them, for the benefits of a free economy will be lost while black marketeering and the corruption of the bureaucracy begin. Now that a reform of the system has begun, close attention must be paid so as to not lose sight of the important and essential things. There are two things that I worry about. One is that the council under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office controlled by ruling parties is commissioned to zone single-seat election districts. The other concerns subsidizing political parties and especially the use of such funds, the auditing of which the Audit Board plans to carry out. It is feared that both of these contain a lot of systematic possibilities under which the activities of opposition parties and politicians might be interfered with by public authorities, especially the ruling parties. The coalition's political reform plan gives off a hint that it would be a controlling one. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that political parties have no legal personalities; they are not juridical persons under civil law. The land and head office buildings occupied by the LDP, SDPJ, Komeito, and so on are owned by third persons, and legal violations are committed by renting them for unreasonably low rents. As an old Chinese fable says, he who suggests it should be the first to do it -- and political parties should be given legal personalities to make their responsibilities clear before subsidizing them. I think that something like a "political party law" is necessary to make the rights and responsibilities of political parties clear and at the same time to protect them from public authorities. Now I will repeat what I have been saying for years. However good are the reforms of the system, they will be rendered useless unless the voters and politicians who utilize them are awakened to what they can and should do. Politicians are said to reflect the voters who choose them. Politicians worthy of the voters will be elected for the districts where voters cast their votes only on the basis of the legislators' own activities. In parallel with efforts to let people know the role played by politics, nationwide campaigns to clean up elections and the political world should be carried out, just like the traffic safety campaigns conducted from elementary schools to regional communities. However heavy are the penalties that are applied, traffic accidents will continue to increase if traffic safety campaigns and education are stopped. I earnestly propose that national campaigns be launched to clean up the activities concerning elections. "Lessening Public Intervention" Rather Than "Deregulation" Japan's autonomy system is called "sanwari jichi" [literally, 30-percent autonomy, referring to the situation of local governments losing independence and power]. It is said that you do not have to be a governor to know that the central government intrudes too much. Authorities for granting permits and licenses and the source of funding are concentrated at the central-government level. Therefore, it is hard for local governments to proceed with administrations which match the localities. The idea that projects and funds for projects directly connected to people's daily lives are to be decentralized to the local autonomous level is very welcome. In this case, it has not been clearly visualized, for words proceed ahead of concrete plans concerning what level of local autonomy is being considered for decentralization. In "A Plan To Reform Japan," a concrete concept was made public under which the country would be divided into 300 "cities" -- in other words, into living administration areas. Although it is not discussed, it is thought that prefectures will remain as they are today, but it is not clear which will receive the decentralized authority and funds -- "cities" or prefectures. It is not clear either what will become of chartered cities [cities with a population of over 500,000 designated by the Local Government Act to have a status similar to that of prefectural governments] that are bigger than the new "cities." Relations between governors and newly established "cities" pose a big problem. If governors are to be entrusted with decentralized authority, "cities" which are really in charge of local autonomy will be deprived of the authority to grant permits and licenses and the source of funding to new local governors, although they will be freed from the supervision of the central government. I think it is rather important to drastically transfer the authority of prefectures to cities, towns, and villages. National government officials cite adjustments among prefectures and unified standards applicable nationwide as reasons for opposing decentralization. Similarly, opposition may be raised by prefectural governors because adjustments are necessary among "cities" and for administrations covering areas larger than "cities." Meanwhile, a province-state system is proposed in view of the need for adjustments among prefectures and administrations for areas bigger than prefectures. I am all for decentralization, but for the benefit of the inhabitants I think it necessary to review and adjust relations between cities, towns, and villages, and between prefectures, provinces, and states. Everybody says that the natural course to follow is to "transfer sources of revenue to local governments, in proportion to the amount of responsibilities to be transferred to localities from the central government." But the matter is not so simple. Imagine that certain tax sources are transferred to prefectures or cities, towns, and villages. They may be good as sources of revenue in such rich metropolises and prefectures as Tokyo, Osaka, and other rich cities, towns, and villages, but this might not be true in the case of Shimane Prefecture, where the authorities to be transferred would not bring in adequate sources of revenue. To solve the problem, functions must be sought to adjust sources of revenue in localities. At present, such roles are handled by the Ministries of Home Affairs and Finance. Decentralization contributes to strengthening the authority of the Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs in relations between the central and local governments and in boosting the powers of finance bureaus of prefectural governments in relations between prefectural governments and the administrations of cities, towns, and villages. Contrary to the fact that central government agencies have exerted influence over local autonomy through subsidies with strings attached, now, for example, the status of such ministries as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, construction, transportation, and health and welfare, and so on, will be downgraded while the power of the Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs, which will handle sources of funds in the form of outright grants without strings attached, will be increased. Images and words seem to be exceeding the importance and desirability of decentralization. It is hoped that concrete proposals will be made. In my opinion, the realistic thing to do first is to transfer as much authority of the central government as possible to prefectures, and as much prefectural authority as possible to cities, towns, and villages. Young children are taken care of by their parents. They are taught at schools. But they may be interfered with at times and regulated by guidance and rules. When they are grown up, nobody will help them, although they will be free to do as they wish. The selfishness of wanting to be free to do what one wishes and at the same time to be helped will not be allowed. During its poverty-stricken postwar period, Japan persisted in its priority production efforts to catch up with and surpass the United States. Both enterprises and individuals grew up under the government's protection, assistance, and regulation. Because it has become the world's top economic power, Japan wants to "act like and be treated" as an adult, and that is what deregulation is, in my opinion. There are plenty of annoyingly persistent and good-for-nothing systems, as well as complicated procedures to receive permits and licenses. It is natural to wish for efficient systems after getting rid of the aforementioned bad systems or deregulating them. I support wholeheartedly the revision or abolition of systems unsuited to the times, because these are the fundamentals of administrative reform. The fundamental principles for carrying out reforms are free choice and personal responsibility. One cannot hope for both a relaxing of regulations and at the same time continued protection and subsidies. The catchphrase "deregulation" may receive a favorable popular response, but we have to clarify the principle of self-responsibility. Otherwise, we will end up with a whitewashing and say that we are generally in favor of deregulation but that we oppose its details. The most important thing is an ability to adjust conflicting interests and to demonstrate leadership in decision-making and its execution. I doubt whether the eight-group coalition can do this. In my opinion, the correct expression is "relaxing state intervention" rather than "deregulation." State intervention in a market economy means such things as getting taxes cut by special measures, receiving subsidies, getting interest rates reduced, having competition controlled, and asking the government to revise the system. Realistically speaking, it is not so easy to abolish all state intervention and to allow everything to be ruled by the market mechanism. On the contrary, there are regulations and intervention which are required to meet the demands of times. These are such things as welfare in a society whose members are aging, meaning pensions and medical care and so on; environmental problems; controls over private rights to land, meaning housing problems; city planning, and so on. Whether these are needed or not is a political decision, but the consensus of opinion is that a number of outdated regulations and instances of intervention continue. When everything is left to the tender mercies of the market mechanism and free competition, the strong will survive while the weak are sacrificed, and colossal monopolies will appear. It is a problem to discern the "truly weak" from the "self-styled weak." The United States has difficulty as a multiracial country, and one of the reasons behind its social unrest is said to be the lack of state intervention in the form of pensions and insurance which apply comprehensively to the whole people. It is well known that the Clinton administration has launched a review of the social security system. It is natural that assistance and regulations will be introduced. Japan, however, cannot compare to the United States in terms of strict government monitoring and regulations against giant monopolies. Finally, to recognize public intervention, it is better to do it in a way that the nation chooses and is thereby held responsible for the choice. Compared to granting subsidies, providing favorable treatment in taxation and interest rates is easier to make self-responsibility apparent. Money borrowed even at low interest rates must be paid back, while grants do not. Therefore, high-rate subsidies tend to create excessive investments. There is nothing more costly than attaining something for nothing. Instead of widening the beneficiary range for medical insurance, it is better to consider making private medical insurance replete through favorable treatment in taxation. I would rather place emphasis on indirect intervention through market economics than through direct intervention. Do Not Make Trade Surplus a Scape Goat Japan's postwar diplomacy has consistently made note of its peculiar situation that it is a defeated nation, and has demanded exceptional treatment from international rule on the grounds that its economy has not yet been rehabilitated. Thus, Japan has succeeded in its maneuver to become the world's second largest economic power. Now her movements and actions tend to exert influence upon international society. Accordingly, Japan is meeting a time when it has to make its mission and roles in international society clear and fulfill its contribution in accordance with the benefits gained from international society. That is the condition for Japan to enjoy peace and guarantee prosperity to its people. In the economic field, it has already achieved plenty of records, but the problem is contribution in noneconomic fields. It was the reason why I, during the LDP presidential election campaign, stated: "Steer away from economic power without ideals." The collapse of the Soviet Union and disappearance of the U.S.- USSR Cold War structure brought about the downfall of peace through power tension. At present, a new world order centered around the United Nations is being sought. While I was foreign minister, Japan took a new step forward by participating in UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and UN Peacekeeping Forces (PKF). Under that decision, a number of Japanese shed sweat and even lost precious lives in foreign lands. Because of these efforts, Japan's international status in all diplomatic fields, including economics, has improved greatly. It has become easier to proceed with diplomatic negotiations. Dispatches of Self-Defense Forces on PKO and PKF missions are not conducted by the will of the Japanese Government only, but with the request of the United Nations and the consent of the country concerned. Therefore it does not violate Article Nine of the Constitution at all. The legislation to make the dispatch possible was drafted under such concepts and enacted through the Diet's consent. In addition to PKO and PKF, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali proposes the creation of the UN Alert Forces for the purpose of maintaining order by preventing and terminating conflicts through intervention. There remain many problems for Japan to discuss with the United States such as transferring the command of its troops to the United Nations to secure its influence in maintaining world order. Sooner or later, Japan will be asked to participate in accordance with Article 42 of the UN Charter. I think Japan should naturally take part in them, rather than insisting on its peculiar situation. But as for its handling, it annoys me that the eight groups that comprise the coalition government are split in their opinion, despite the fact that the matter is related to Japan's survival. Prime Minister Hosokawa continues to make negative responses, and if he means it, the coalition should be dissolved in view of a parliamentary cabinet system. In "A Plan to Reform Japan," an amendment to Article Nine of the Constitution and another plan under new legislation have been proposed from the legislative point of view, to open the way to participate in the UN Alert Forces. From both a realistic point of view and from the Constitution's interpretation, I do not deem a constitutional amendment necessary. The problem is that Mr. Ozawa, chief secretary of the coalition's nucleus government party, and Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is supported by the coalition parties, have different opinions. Japan, as it is, can hardly break away from "an economic power without ideals" to become "a country that will work hard with the world." As it stands now, the economic problems of the world cannot be discussed without Japan, which has become an economic power. Because of its economic power, Japan is considered as a possible permanent member to the United Nations Security Council, an international political organization. Japan could devote itself to its policy of economic growth with light armament, because it was protected under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the U.S.-USSR Cold War. As a result, a lightly-armed Japan with offensive economic power made its appearance. As a consequence, Japan's trade surplus increased year after year and as for now, the trade surplus problem has become one of the biggest issues between Japan and the United States. The phenomenon, like the sole winner of a mahjong game, brought Japan a series of difficult negotiations in maintaining the free trade system. It is my opinion that the free trade system is fundamental to Japanese prosperity and that all out efforts must be made to protect the system to serve the national interest. To show that Japan is a country that competes on equal terms, it has to respond as much as possible to the demands for liberalizing and opening its markets. To transfer the huge trade surplus earned by private enterprises to public assistance programs, such as funds for foreign economic cooperation, people must understanding democracy because they bear the burden. That may be a difficult problem, but the government must persuade the people to carry it out. And this can be effectively used as a means to achieve new diplomatic objectives centering around developing nations. Surplus reflux is an important point in protecting the free trade system. However, setting up import quotas of a controlled trade nature and imposing compulsory export quotas to reduce surplus will lead to denial of free trade itself. It is necessary to see Japan's future in a broader perspective. One of the important points in Japan's diplomacy is Japan-U.S. relations. The United States is an indispensable country for Japan. With the most friendly and most important nation, it is necessary to negotiate through the most powerful negotiating means. Since the biggest issue pending between the two nations is the trade problem, Japan's negotiations with the United States will focus on reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus. In relation to the degree of Japanese cooperation in such international contributions centering around the United Nations as PKO, PKF, and so on and its participation in such international schemes as providing assistance to Russia and so on, it is shuddering to imagine what the Japanese position would be if it did not have a trade surplus in view of its present light-armament status. There are two directions to consider for the future. One is to boost negotiating power in noneconomic fields and another is to maintain negotiating power in economic fields. If unequal treatment of foreign enterprises and foreigners exists at home in the economic field, then they should be treated equally. Further, the Japanese systems themselves should be changed one by one to systems that can pass in the international community. At the same time, research and development of new technology should be expedited and the tax system should be revised so that the desire to work is not hurt and productivity is improved. Efforts to promote superiority at all times in international competition must not be neglected. Blame must not be laid on trade surplus, because surplus earned through fair competition is the means of survival for lightly armed Japan. Measures Against Recession Transcend Political Reform The biggest concern of the people for now is not transition to the single-member election district system nor is it providing public subsidies to political parties. Rather, it is the emergence as quickly as possible, from what they call the biggest and longest postwar recession. I have continued to warn that the abrupt extermination of the bubble economy inevitably accompanies as many aftereffects. And that is exactly what happened. Two years ago when those aftereffects began to show, I made a series of proposals: Interest rates must be lowered in the spring of 1992 and stocks must be bought with public funds in the summer of 1992. While my proposal with regard to stocks was partially implemented, lowering interest rates was forestalled, thus making every ensuing rate reduction less effective. Government policy decisions tend to get delayed because consultations must take place with those, most often bureaucrats, who have a good grasp of statistics. To make matters worse, there is the Diet, a time-consuming institution. In the twinkling of an eye, three or four months are wasted. Budgets for things like emergency measures should be quickly dealt with, as long as their objectives are not mistaken. Perfectionism is not required. Such efforts can be done in the deliberation process. Specifically effective medicines do no good if taken after the illness conditions have already deteriorated. Another reminder is that the order of priority should not be mistakenly handled out of concern for saving face. Political reform can be summarized as bringing about a single member election district with proportional representation system, national treasury subsidies [to political parties], and controls over enterprise contributions. They are not so imperative that they have to be settled within two or three months. The most imperative and important problem is how to cope with the current recession. I am dubious about whether the government really understands the problem's importance. In relation to stock price policies, the government should have publicly announced its intention to buy back NTT [Nippon Telephone and Telegraph] stock at half-price, 2.55 million yen, at which price the government had originally sold it, when the price dropped to 600,000 or 700,000 yen. That would have become the bottom price [for the stock]. In theory, it worked out for those who continued to possess the stocks until the government announcement, but what about those who had already sold them at a loss. The same thing holds for the land tax system which was enforced to prevent speculators from earning big money from sky-rocketing land prices. But when the land prices continue to drop and land transactions drastically decrease, antibubble measures continue to remain in effect. The way things are, business conditions will never be expected to improve. Some people would make the immediate rebuttal: "But what will you do when land prices go up again?" Raising interest rates and controls over loans can be done in a breath. If it were found that antirecession budgets were formulated in excess, they could be immediately controlled. It takes several months to formulate budgets, but their execution can be suspended in a day. The government cannot function smoothly when it is split by those who assert priority in fairness and those who advocate placing priority in recession fighting measures. No leadership can be displayed in recovering the economy unless political groups sharing the same views form a ruling party and a government. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is urged to refrain from permanently crying "hi-jimin [non-LDP]," for the benefit of the nation as a whole. We will not spare cooperation from outside the cabinet, if it really serves the national interest. I am afraid that trade union confederation leaders are deviating from their professed line. They attempt to take the initiative in reorganizing political circles, but I do not think lower-echelon union members would listen to what their top people had to say. I do not think union members could be subjugated to the orders from above, orders like recommending Komeito [Clean Government Party] in the A District without regard to who is on the ticket, a Shinseito candidate in the B District, a Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] candidate in the C District, a SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] candidate in the D District, and so on. That sort of thinking contributed to a reduction in the SDPJ's strength by half, which was to our advantage. Strong opposition to such ideas is reported within unions. It is all right for them to demand tax cuts but I would rather propose union fee reductions before making such demands. Prefectural employees told me that they pay 60,000 to 80,000 yen in union fees annually. Since they are banned from going on strike, a two-thirds cut in union fees would provide them with the same benefit as a tax reduction in the amount of 40,000 to 50,000 yen. The supreme leaders above the clouds are unaware that a great number of union members did not want to become members in the first place and that they want out. If the leaders are planning to use them in elections as if they were moving chessmen at will, more union members will desert the organizations. The current union leaders are excessively committed to political intervention. The cry of "hi-jimin" alone does not bring about recovery in business conditions and increases in basic wage rates. It is better to ask the opinions of intelligent union members. Putting the Cart Before the Horse? With market opening progressing, Japanese enterprises with the same line of business are now engaged in life-or-death battles. Enterprises are now becoming labor-management communities. The current difficulties can hardly be overcome unless labor and management cooperate more closely. When competing firms are bent on expanding sales, how can union leaders expect union members of competing companies to make concerted efforts to back the union-designated candidate. It may end up putting the cart before the horse. I would advise Rengo [Confederation of Labor Unions] to refrain from engaging in excessive election campaigns. Union members say they are against Rengo's using their high union fees to meddle in elections. Finally, the fluke the Hosokawa cabinet brought about was not the expulsion of the LDP from the government, but letting the SDPJ eat the forbidden fruit and emasculating it. This applies at least to those holding cabinet portfolios and seniors on the portfolio waiting list who are well-behaved because they thirst after positions and greed. It may well be anticipated that all such things as PKF, atomic power plant construction, the Self-Defense Force's purchase of AWACS' [Advanced Warning Airborne Control System], and partial liberalization of the rice market will go well. I do not care whether the Hosokawa cabinet's political reform bill comes through before the year-end or not, if most of the pending difficult problems are solved, for which I would not spare my cooperation from outside the cabinet. I want to make this prediction: Emergence from depression and prevention of huge unemployment by industrial restructuring will never succeed through "schoolgirlish fancy slogans like "hi-jimin," senility emerging from thirst after power and greed, and flattery to win popularity alone." Mr. Ozawa is an unparalleled person in thinking of Japan's future and in courage, power of execution, and skills in bringing about alliances. For him to achieve greater success, I wish for him to make efforts to respect principles and rules and to be tolerant, but not to take the course of excessive expansionism like Mr. Kakuei Tanaka once did, and not to exude the impression of a secretive and arbitrary person. A man's strong and weak points coexist and they are like both sides. It has been said that life is like walking with a heavy burden upon one's back, one should not be hasty and excessive. I dare wish him to be more prudent and pray for more great activities of a good fellow.
