They intend to run jointly in the self-governmental elections and then in the parliamentary elections; they also want to back the same candidate for president. There is more to the confederation than the forms of cooperation among these parties so far; however, it is less than their leaders declared immediately after the last elections. At that time, they were speaking about the necessity of uniting quickly. What There Has Been: Partings and Comebacks Before the parliamentary elections in 1991, for the PC, which was quite a significant party, the ZChN was a minor little party full of phobias. Jaroslaw Kaczynski was trying to build up the image of his party as a proreform, center grouping, as a modern Christian democracy. The PC considered the ZChN to be extremely rightist, a traditional grouping that, conscious of its own weakness, wanted to enter the parliament by gaining the support of the church and by concealing itself behind the slogan of WAK (Electoral Catholic Action). After the elections, this ceased to bother Kaczynski--it turned out that the ZChN would have a considerable club in the parliament. Both parties survived several months in a joint coalition supporting the Olszewski government; they defended it with determination. Then they unanimously turned against the "recommunist government of Pawlaks and Wachowskis" (this is what the Pawlak Cabinet was called by the participants of the PC congress, which was being held at the time). At that time: The RdR is formed within the PC and leaves the grouping (the RdR is the third participant of the confederation that is being formed today). Relations between both parties are not very good, largely because of the circumstances under which the RdR was formed--as a result of a split within the PC. Apart from that, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Jan Olszewski were already not really fond of each other at that time. The Suchocka government is formed. At night, during negotiations on the establishment of this cabinet, the center-rightist "five" splits. The PC leaves the conference room, the other groupings remain (the ZChN; Peasant Accord; the Party of Christian Democrats, PChD; and even the closest ally of the PC at the time, the Peasant-Christian Party, the SLCh). This is a defeat for Kaczynski's prestige. The ZChN, in coalition with the Democratic Union [UD] and the liberals, goes through a stage of "civilizing." The ministers of the party of Wieslaw Chrzanowski cooperate quite well with the ministers of UD and the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]. UD, the KLD, and the ZChN become so accustomed to one another that, after the downfall of the government, there are politicians who mention the possibility of forming a joint coalition in the September 1993 parliamentary elections. In the meantime, the PC also goes through a period of transformation, but in an entirely different direction. It does not decide to become a "constructive" opposition to the Suchocka cabinet. In the parliament, the PC is alone; being jointly in the opposition does not cause Olszewski and Kaczynski to join forces. Olszewski on his side and Kaczynski on his gather smaller, very radical rightist groupings around them. From the fall of 1992 to the spring of 1993, a number of cooperation declarations are signed, and coalitions for Poland are established. These are the times of the "June Left," of rightist politicians' touring Poland. The PC expresses sharp criticism of the Suchocka government and the ZChN. Politicians of the ZChN retaliate and make ironic remarks concerning Kaczynski's party. The Suchocka government, not long before its downfall, is left by the PL--the fourth grouping making up the confederation today (it proved disloyal to the ZChN, with which it was an ally at the time). Within the Suchocka government is Aleksander Hall's PK. After the elections in September 1993, it is left by Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski and his supporters; they form the Conservative Coalition [KK] (the last party of the "five" that make up the confederation today). Before the 1993 elections, differences between the PC and the ZChN are so great that no one, aside from a few politicians, even mentions the possibility of a joint election campaign. The roles change. Now the ZChN is a serious, proreform, civilized grouping, whereas the PC is a small, "leader-oriented" party of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, driven by internal conflicts. The ZChN runs in the elections as the "Fatherland" coalition, along with the "rightist" component of the Suchocka cabinet: Hall's PK, the PChD, and the SLCh; the PC runs alone, just like the PL and the RdR. In the ensuing postelection shock, politicians of the rightist groupings began to admit their mistakes and to announce unification soon. What There Is: A Confederation The confederation means not only less than unification but even less than a federation. The five groupings will not have a common leader. The constituent parties will maintain their organizational identities. However, a council will be established that will be an authority superior to the authorities of the individual parties. What stands in the way to unification of the five parties, aside from their past? The parties do not want to give up their identities. Each of them (this applies particularly to the ZChN, however) believes that, as an independent party and by maintaining its own structure, it may mean more than as a party unified with other groupings). Rightist politicians say that the greatest drawback of their part of the political scene is not the large number of parties but the existence, in almost each of them, of internal divisions. Right now, they can be seen most easily in the ZChN, but they also exist in the PL. The party that is most uniform today is the PC. Characteristic of the rightist part of the political scene are great ambitions of the leaders of the groupings; in addition, those leaders often do not really like each other. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which Kaczynski, Chrzanowski, Szeremietiew, and Janowski are supposed to decide which one person will be the leader of the joint grouping. Among those five groupings, there are real programmatic differences. It would be difficult to reconcile the definitely negative attitude toward trade unions, presented by Michal Ujazdowski's KK (in the previous Sejm, Ujazdowski was one of the initiators of the bill on limiting the role of trade unions) with the stand of the PL (which has its origins in the Individual Farmers' Solidarity) as well as the sentimental approach to Solidarity that is taken by Kaczynski, Szeremietiew, and Chrzanowski. It would also be difficult to reconcile the PL's conviction about the need for broad state intervention in the economy, with the liberal approach of the KK. Apart from that, the parties also differ, among other things, in their attitude toward integration with Europe: the pro-European approach of the PC and the KK is confronted with the approach of the ZChN, which may be called "Euro-skeptical." If unification talks were actually held, the parties of the "five," especially the PC and the ZChN, would certainly quarrel if they were to verify the real strength of both parties in regions. This would be closely connected to the distribution of influence in the authorities and on the election lists of the common party. An issue that would have to be resolved if unification were to actually take place would also be the definition of the attitude toward the one-person rightist force that is represented by Jan Olszewski. Even though the former prime minister is now the honorary president of the RdR (not Szeremietiew's RdR), he is not really taking part in the political life of the right wing. His political activities boil down to meetings with his supporters in church halls, cultural centers, etc. He is advocating the model of concentrating the rightist groupings with Solidarity. At his most recent meeting on 9 May in the lower church of St. Andrew Bobola, he received the greatest applause when he spoke about Walesa and said good things about Solidarity. What Will There Be? Rightist politicians are afraid of establishing too quickly something that might break apart with a thump, which would finally compromise the right wing. Apart from that, unification carried out too quickly and forcefully might dissatisfy some of the parties' members. In reply to the accusation that the confederation is a form that is supposed to replace real unification, the rightist politicians say that they are implementing the plan that was agreed upon early this year: first a confederation, then a federation. Activists of the ZChN and the PC no longer say today that the final purpose of the process of "unification" is real unification. "It may be one party, but it does not have to be"; we hear both in the PC--that is, in a party that seemed to be all for unification, and in the ZChN, a party that most opposed the idea.
