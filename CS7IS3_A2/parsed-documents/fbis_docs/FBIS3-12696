Most of these events were important, however, and they affect our history. Assuredly, as days pass, we will adequately appreciate their significance and fully understand their lessons. In view of the great upheavals witnessed during the last decade, one can say that the post-war era has come to an end and that a new era is on the horizon. In our view, the agreement signed in Washington will be the most important event defining the outlines of the future. What was considered a figment of imagination yesterday--or at best a possibility--is gradually turning into a reality today in front of our eyes. Perhaps the plots and conspiracies will come to an end soon, plots that lasted a whole century and that were concocted against a whole people and--behind them--the whole Arab nation. However, we must not surrender to optimism more than we should, because clouds are still hiding the horizons of the future and because the road is still full of obstacles. We are satisfied that both parties in the Arab-Israeli negotiations are seriously and truly determined to take the peace process to its conclusion. As far as we are concerned, we have worked for peace for more than 20 years, by calling for it and working to achieve it. This allowed us to talk about the matter all sides with the required frankness. We told the Israelis that they had to deal with the facts because the first Gaza-Jericho agreement is only a stage. Peace will not become real and lasting unless it is comprehensive and encompasses all the occupied Arab land. As to the Palestinians, we brought to their attention the fundamental change their behavior must undergo because they are no longer merely fighters seeking to liberate their land, but responsible leaders answerable to their people and to the world. Yes, it is true that their struggle and their many sacrifices brought them affection and support from all parts of the world. This deserves to be praised, especially since their adversary enjoyed the unconditional support of the majority of the great powers. Now they must make use of this affection and support without hesitation and reap the benefits. The Arab-Israeli negotiations are still continuing and are going through difficult times, in which it is difficult to disentangle the intricacies. Nevertheless, it will reach its aim. The whole world wishes for this and works toward it. [passage omitted] We arrive now at the issues of our relations with our foreign partners and allies. Primary among these problems, naturally, is that of the ties that we are trying to ensure between us and the EEC. The proposals made to us in December 1993 were not to our liking. They did not please us. For this reason, we presented to our partners a document containing our reaction to these proposals, and recalling, in particular, the decision made by the ministerial meeting of the 12 states aimed at concluding a new agreement with Morocco based on four main foundations: political dialogue; economic, technical, and cultural partnership in the sectors of common interest; the gradual establishing of a free trade zone; and financial cooperation. We insisted, in particular, on the need for Moroccan products to enter the EEC market, particularly our agricultural products. As for the European program, it is, regrettably, characterized by caution and ambiguity. It is contenting itself with maintaining the usual monetary machine. Without clear commitment, it makes promises that there will be a discussion in the future about financial matters. Pending the early implementation of a new agreement--soon, hopefully--Morocco believes that beginning now it has become necessary to reexamine the current agreement so that it may be in accord with the effects of the Uruguay round and the requirements of the European Union market. Morocco also urges its partners to be more understanding and more open and to treat Morocco the way it is treating them. My dear people: Neither the challenges of the issues we have just raised nor their priority could make us forget the essential issue that comes at the top of our concerns--namely, the issue of our territorial unity. We are, as far as our Sahara is concerned, still committed to organizing a confirmatory, self-determination referendum under UN control that will lead to the final joining together of our southern provinces with the motherland. Despite the dilatory ambiguities and tricks of our opponents, we are certain that the international community will know how to impose its commitments and implement the various decisions that have been agreed upon to this effect. We are naturally pleased--while talking about our territorial unity--to raise the thorny issue of Ceuta and Mellila and neighboring islands that are still under Spanish authority. We have been keen so far, in faithfulness to our longstanding traditions, to avoid confrontations that would lead us nowhere and that might only lead to worsening of relations between Spain and Morocco. We have always tried to solve our problems in peaceful ways based on consultation and negotiation--always driven by the firm conviction that the course of time will not affect our rights and that there will be no concessions concerning this part of our land. In an attempt to bring our positions and those of our neighbor closer, we have proposed to our Spanish friends to establish jointly a think tank, which will be in charge of examining a solution that would secure the rights of one side and preserve the interests of the other. It has become impossible to delay the solution indefinitely. Therefore, we hope that our proposal will be well received so that a solution is found for an abnormal situation. [passage omitted]
