Kayumov, director of the Economic Research Institute of the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry of Economics: "Can the Ailment Be Alleviated?"] [11 Dec p 2] [Text] The economy of Tajikistan is today experiencing a profound and protracted crisis, which is a consequence of a number of objective and subjective processes that have developed in the republic in recent years. The severance of economic relations and the winding down of turnover between the Commonwealth of Independent States and the former socialist countries have had a particularly devastating impact. The crisis in which the republic's economy has found itself in connection also with the civil war, political instability, and natural disasters has proven far deeper and of greater proportions than it appeared earlier. In addition, the economy of Tajikistan inherited from the former Union a low efficiency of production with its hypertrophied structure, which in far from all instances had wide-ranging production relations with other countries. The most striking evidence of this has been the intensifying slump in production. In the past three years the republic's economy has in terms of many general economic indicators been thrown back almost 30 years. Whereas in 1991 generated national income in comparable prices declined 8.4 percent compared with 1990, in 1992 it had declined 31 percent. Industrial output in 1990-1992 declined 24.3 percent, and in six months of the present year, 30.5 percent. The agricultural product in the period 1990-1992 declined 47 percent and corresponds to the 1976 level. From which it may be concluded that Tajikistan's economic situation will continue to deteriorate since the factors contributing to the extrication of the economy from the state of crisis have not yet begun to operate. Mutually non-concerted actions, particularly of former republics of the Union which are large and better-off in terms of mineral and raw material resources, on questions of pricing, inconsistency in the implementation of economic reforms, and flagrant mistakes in the methods of its [as published] implementation under the conditions of the common ruble zone have led to chaos and paralysis of the economic organism of many states of the Commonwealth. The foundations of the credit and monetary system have been thoroughly undermined. The liberalization of prices without a restructuring of the necessary accompanying levers of their regulation has not been an effective stimulus of an increase in production, or the increase in pay, a factor of highly productive labor. The loss of the state's regulating function and the granting of the enterprises broad rights in respect to formation of the labor-remuneration fund have led to the use of profit for the needs of consumption to the detriment of accumulation. Social tension in society is intensifying. The price rises have been on a considerably larger scale than anticipated. As a result the quality of life and the living standard of almost all strata of the populace, its socially unprotected part particularly, are deteriorating sharply. A polarization of society--the impoverishment of the bulk of it and the enrichment of a small part of it--is taking place. The shadow economy is assuming greater proportions. Many branches of the economy, primarily its agrarian sector, are lacking the necessary fuel and energy resources. The shortage of food resources and Tajikistan's dependence on supplies thereof from outside are creating a real danger for the normal physical development of the populace. The main task at present is restoration of the national economy and a halt to the continued recession. The republic's potential does not permit the rapid restoration of what has been demolished. We need to determine the priority facilities and begin the restoration with the priorities. Priority measures are needed simultaneously to avert a further decline in production in all sectors of the economy. These measures should be devised on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the republic's economy in recent years. The decline in industrial production in the republic, which began in 1990, was initially of a structural nature. It was connected, in the main, with the reduction in production in the fuel sector and construction materials industry. As of 1992 this slump has become general. The greatest decline in production has occurred in the base and processing sectors. The decline in production in 1991 constituted 3.6 percent compared with 1990, and in 1992, 24.3 percent. In three years the industrial product in comparable prices declined 26.7 percent and corresponds to the 1980 level. There was a deterioration in the level and dynamics of the industrial efficiency indicators: productivity, capital-output ratio, and materials consumption. A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the fuel sector. In the period 1990-1992 production of oil declined by 83,000 tonnes (57.6 percent), gas, by 39 million cubic meters (35.1 percent), and coal, by 259,000 tonnes (54.5 percent). In terms of the production of oil and gas the republic has been thrown back to the level of 1940. Although the generation of electric power is being held at the same level, in 1992 it declined by 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours (7.2 percent). Under the conditions of the ever-growing shortage of fuel and energy resources and the uncontrolled increase in their price, this state of the sector is having a ruinous effect on the republic's economy. The machine-building sector is in the same position also. Half as many transformers were manufactured in 1992 as in 1965, and their production constituted 18.5 percent of the 1990 level. Construction materials industry is in a state of profound crisis. On account of the shortage of reinforcing steel, the increase in the price of energy, and the increased cost of the shipment of the finished product, many enterprises of the sector are in a grim financial condition. Some 620,000 fewer tonnes of cement (58.1), 92.7 million fewer standard tiles of asbestos-cement sheet (76.3 percent), 802,000 fewer cubic meters of precast ferroconcrete structures and products (75.1 percent), and 179 million fewer standard building bricks (60.1 percent) were manufactured in 1992 compared with 1990. Some 2.1 times less cement and 1.5 times fewer ferroconcrete structures and products were produced in 1992 than in 1960, and the production of asbestos-cement sheet was at the 1960 level. This situation is preventing the accomplishment of the task of restoration of the economy and demands special consideration and the adoption of specific measures for stabilization of the sector itself. An extremely inauspicious situation is shaping up on the consumer market. The volume of retail commodity turnover and payable services, which has increased many times over in current prices, does not reflect the actual picture of the level of satisfaction of consumer requirements. According to official data, the rate of the production of consumer goods in 1992 declined 28 percent compared with 1991, which was several points more than for the republic's industry on average. The manufacture of household refrigerators declined here by 105,600 (63.3 percent), cotton cloth, by 64 million square meters (52.5 percent), silk cloth, by 10 million square meters (13.2 percent), carpets and carpeting, by 2.5 million square meters (22.9 percent), socks and hose, by 20.5 million pairs (34.3 percent), knitwear, by 7.8 million items (49.7 percent), footwear, by 5.6 million pairs (51.4 percent), meat and meat products, 41,900 tonnes (84.8 percent), sausage products, by 12,000 tonnes (77.9 percent), whole milk products, by 66,000 tonnes (34 percent), butter, by 2,700 tonnes (45 percent), and confectionery, by 41,500 tonnes (77.9 percent) in 1990-1992. A decline in the production of consumer goods in physical terms occurred in other groups also. [18 Dec p 2] [Text] In terms of the production of household refrigerators the republic has been thrown back 26 years, of cloth, 12-17 years, footwear and knitwear, 20-25 years, carpets and carpeting, 13 years, and socks and hose, six years. The production of cultural and welfare facilities and household commodities has declined noticeably. There has been a sharp deterioration in the situation in trade. Retail commodity turnover in comparable prices in 1992 constituted only 27.8 percent of the 1991 level, although in current prices it grew by a factor of 3.2. Because of the increase in prices the overpayment by the public constituted more than R16 billion, which made the position of the republic's working people far worse. The increase in consumer prices outpaced personal monetary income by a factor of 2.5. There is not only the relative but also the absolute impoverishment of the bulk of the population of the republic. The systematic reduction in the supplies to retail trade of the basic foodstuffs is a cause of particular concern. The supply of meat and meat products declined 65 percent, of dairy products, 48 percent, sugar and confectionery, 92 percent, cotton cloth, 44 percent, silk cloth, 56 percent, knitwear, 40 percent, footwear, 35 percent, and so forth in 1992 compared with 1991. The consumption of meat and meat products declined from 26 kg in 1990 to 20 kg in 1992, and of milk and dairy products, from 161 kg to 72 kg. The increase in prices is forcing people to spend a large part of their family budget primarily on the purchase of food. The structure of the population's diet has shifted toward carbohydrate consumption models. Proportional spending on nourishment is rising systematically and at the present time constitutes 65 percent. Consumption at the level of the physiological minimum enables a person to exist merely as a biological organism, but not to restore his fitness for work. A diet at this caloric level leads for quite a long period of time to mental and physical degradation. The lack of protein and fats is reflected in people's health and the quality of the work force, a reduction in life expectancy, a change in its mentality and behavior, and the destruction of the nation's gene pool. Unless there is a change in the situation, a further increase in morbidity, reduced immunity, and a decline in the ability to work may be expected in the not-too-distant future in certain underdeveloped regions. The agrarian sector of the republic's economy has found itself in an extremely difficult situation. The armed conflicts, the complex social and political situation, the severance of firmly established economic relations between countries of the Commonwealth, the extremely unfavorable weather conditions, natural disasters of unprecedented scale, the incredible price rises, the difficulties in the purchase of equipment, fuel and lubricants, mineral fertilizers, herbicides, and toxic chemicals associated with this, and the appreciable gap between the level of prices of industrial and agricultural products have been reflected in the situation in the sector. No sector has suffered as much as agriculture. A further decline in agricultural production is occurring against the background of the shortfall in the sowing of a number of crops and the reduction in the numbers of livestock and the decline in its productiveness. In 1992 the total gross product of the sector in comparable prices constituted 53 percent of the 1990 level. In 1991 the decline in production constituted only 4 percent, in 1992, 43 percent. In terms of the production of cereals the sector has been thrown back to the level of 1980, of potatoes, 1981, vegetables, 1986, edible pumpkins, 1978, grapes, somewhat before 1970 even, meat, 1963, milk, 1960, and eggs, 1975. Some 68,000 tonnes fewer of cereals, 45,000 tonnes fewer of potatoes, 78,000 tonnes fewer of fruits and berries, 108,000 tonnes fewer of grapes, 340,000 tonnes less of seed cotton, 60,000 fewer tonnes of meat, 388,000 fewer tonnes of milk, and 346 million fewer eggs were gathered in in 1992 compared with 1990. A particularly serious situation has come about in the animal husbandry sector. The sector's resources declined appreciably mainly owing to the decline in the production and the deterioration of the indicators of productiveness of the public herd. Albeit small, a growth, nonetheless, in the numbers and production of animal husbandry products was observed on the private subsidiary plots. But this growth is not making up for the decline in public animal husbandry. The most negative result of the development of public animal husbandry was the sharp decline in the herd. The numbers of cattle in the republic as a whole had declined by 157,400 head (30 percent), including 35,500 head of cows (25 percent), of hogs, by 81,700 head (66 percent), sheep and goats, 472,500 head (26 percent), and poultry, by 4,129,200 head (56 percent), as of 1 August 1993 compared with 1 August 1991. This situation in animal husbandry is exerting a negative influence on the long-term possibilities of the development of the sector and reducing the republic's meat resources appreciably. The restoration of the numbers of animals, of cattle particularly, will take decades. There has been a simultaneous decline in the productiveness of livestock and poultry. The average milk yield per cow has declined by 612 kg (42 percent), and the yield of a laying hen, by 35 eggs (35 percent). [30 Dec p 3] [Text] The shortage of feed, formula feed particularly, has had a noticeable effect on the state of affairs in hog raising and poultry breeding. The large-scale animal husbandry complexes and poultry factories, which are almost wholly dependent on supplies of formula feed, have found themselves in a difficult situation with the introduction of free feed prices. The scale of the decline in production in the processing sectors of the republic's agro-industrial complex has grown sharply also. In 1992 enterprises of the sector manufactured products 25.2 percent below the 1991 level. Against the background of the general decline in production in all sectors of the economy there has been a marked reduction in investment activity. The incredible growth of prices has led to a devaluation of the savings and working assets of the enterprises and organizations. As a result the scale of construction has declined sharply. Investments from all sources of financing were in 1992 one-third below the 1990 level. The efficiency of the invested capital declined somewhat. The introduction of fixed capital in the first six months of 1993 constituted only 20 percent of total capital investments. For this reason the amount of incomplete construction grew several times over compared with 1990 and constituted R40 billion. The above-norm increase in incomplete construction constituted approximately R12 billion. According to the most modest estimates, more than R3 billion of funds in the increase in incomplete construction were spent on pay. The greatest decline in investment activity is being observed in the sectors that determine the direction of structural policy. This testifies that the crisis has assumed not only an economic but also a technological nature, and there has been a marked acceleration in the aging and physical deterioration of fixed capital in many sectors of the economy, primarily in the fuel industry and the machine-building, iron and steel, and chemical and timber complexes. Depreciation allowances are not providing even for simple reproduction, let alone expanded reproduction. The decline in production in industry, agriculture, and construction and the shortage of fuel and spares and other resources and also the significant increase in fares have led to a sharp deterioration in the operation of transport. The shipment of freight by general use transport declined by almost 30,000 tonnes (43.8 percent) compared with 1990. The republic's financial condition has taken complex shape also. Its budget system was formed under the impact of the general economic and political crisis in society. The republic's financial resources have essentially lost their link with real material production and its efficiency indicators, as a result of which financing has assumed a deficit nature even under the conditions of the application of austerity measures. Expenditure on wages, food, and other priority spending is being funded, in the main. Nonetheless, the budget deficit is not declining but, on the contrary, growing. The decline in production combined with the intensive growth of wholesale prices and the reduction in export receipts has led to a sharp reduction on the revenue side of the budget. It is perfectly obvious that a resolution of the problem of a recovery of state finances will take a long time, in the course of which the prerequisites for this recovery have to be created. In this connection, evidently, the government will be forced to wind down the financing of the construction of production facilities that do not promise rapid income or do not satisfy the republic's most urgent requirements, end financial assistance from the budget to financially autonomous enterprises, and establish strict legal and tax control over the activity of commercial structures. The current situation is reason to anticipate with sufficient certainty that the economic decline will continue. Even if measures pertaining to financial and economic stabilization are stepped up, their consequences will be manifested at the end of next year or beyond even. The time has come today for a critical evaluation of the entire path that has been trodden, for appreciable adjustments to be made to the strategy and tactics of the economic reforms that are being implemented, and for a number of priority measures to halt the continued decline in production to be realized. The following, in our opinion, pertain to the latter: First, tasks of the surmounting of the crisis situation in agriculture, of which support for the harvesting and spring-field operations is the most important, are of the most significance at this time. It is necessary to establish the strictest accounting of the propellant and fuel and lubricants entering the republic and to channel them first and foremost into the needs of agriculture. Similar measures need to be implemented also in animal husbandry, where, owing to missed opportunities in the procurement of fodder, a real threat of a further sharp reduction in the numbers of livestock could be created. It is important also that agricultural enterprises be supplied with spares for the repair of tractors, other agricultural machinery, and motor vehicles, receive some new-equipment replenishment, and have the necessary quantity of mineral fertilizers and toxic chemicals. Government support for the agricultural enterprises and the allocation of soft loans are needed for the solution of these questions. It is essential also to work out the question of the reprofiling of a number of shops and bays of the republic's machine-building enterprises for the production of spares, parts, and components of agricultural equipment and transport facilities. It is essential, before it is too late, to introduce everywhere the family contract and to make it the main form of production responsibility linking compensation with the end result of work. World and, yes, our own experience shows that only thus can the food problem be resolved. Second. A rapid growth in offenses in the economic sphere causing the economy of Tajikistan considerable harm has been charted in recent years on account of the absence of strict control and the not entirely justified liberalization of foreign economic activity. A tremendous quantity of raw material and food resources, of which the republic is today itself in need, is being exported without hindrance, and there is little that is coming in in exchange. This practice is leading to an increase in prices and a decline in personal living standards. We are confronted squarely in this connection with the question of Tajikistan's economic security. It would seem that for stabilization in the sphere of the economy it is essential to devise an official program for fighting crime, in which tough measures against the increasing crime-conducing processes in the economy should be realized. It might be considered necessary to this end to create an independent state control committee, adopt a package of laws on the fight against corruption and on the status of the public servant, and to determine measures of severe punishment for aiding and abetting the perpetration of economic crimes. It is essential to create under the auspices of the Committee for National Security a department for the fight for the republic's economic security. A law banning officials from engaging in commercial activity is needed. It is also time to wind down all small enterprises, cooperatives, and other commercial formations at state-owned enterprises. Third. It is essential to devise an effective mechanism of the stimulation of production, introduce a sparing tax system, and to grant the enterprises medium-term and long-term loans. It would be a mistake to think that high taxes might reduce the budget deficit, on the contrary, they would suppress incentives to production and could even, having reached a particular level, lead to an absolute reduction in budget revenue and to a slowing of the rate of turnover of capital. This applies to value-added tax also. Throughout the world this tax performs the role of stimulus contributing to a reduction in prices, with us, however, the other way about--to an increase. It should be differentiated by commodity group depending on social significance. It is essential to stabilize the budget not via an increase in taxes but by way of a reduction in government spending and by means of the pursuit of a preferential tax policy. Fourth. A process of the aging of the fixed capital of sectors of the national economy is intensifying at the present time. The retirement factor in fuel industry, for example, has today reached 55 percent, in the construction materials industry, 40 percent, the processing sectors, 27 percent, the machine-building complex, 25 percent, and so forth. Unless serious measures are adopted today even, the fixed capital of many sectors will have become decrepit within five or six years. It is necessary, therefore, for maintenance of the technical level of production to revitalize enterprises' investment activity. The government will, evidently, have to reduce the funding of state capital investments to the minimum necessary for maintaining the viability of the systems and the construction of priority facilities. It is necessary to this end to shift the center of gravity from budget financing to the financially autonomous funds of the enterprises and switch from the funding of capital construction free of charge to bank loans. It is necessary to devise a mechanism of attraction of the resources of the banks themselves and individuals. Fifth. It may be said with confidence today that flagrant miscalculations were made in the tactics and strategy of implementation of the economic reforms. We began the reform from the top echelons of management of the economy. The time has come to shift the burden of the economic transformations to the sphere of real production and the subjects of market relations--the enterprises--and to afford them broader rights and freedom of action so that they themselves, following the example of the Baltic republics, might establish direct relations with enterprises of the far and near abroad. Sixth. There should be a strong bridge between the past, the present, and the future. This bridge is lacking currently. The directive-plan system having been demolished, nothing has been proposed in exchange. The reform should be implemented with a high degree of state regulation and the strictest control of the sphere of production, circulation, and foreign economic activity. The outstanding role of Roosevelt as a statesman was that he was able to turn an uncontrolled market economy into a controlled economy. There is no spontaneous economy anywhere. It is essential, therefore, before more follies are committed, to restore the system of state regulation of national economic, intersectoral, and intra-sectoral proportions. But this regulation should be exercised mainly on the basis of economic methods of management. The economy of Tajikistan will not be extricated from the most severe and protracted economic crisis quickly. Gradual, consistent, and thoughtful work is needed.
