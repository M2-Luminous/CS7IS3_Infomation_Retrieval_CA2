The semi-annual drill, which is called non-combatant evacuation operation (neo), will include the checking of manpower, paperwork and the operation to evacuate non-combatants in the event of war on the Korean peninsula, a CFC spokesman said. "The drill is just part of the routine semi-annual program having nothing to do with the current situation in which tension has escalated due to the standoff involving Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program," the spokesman claimed. At present, some 36,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
