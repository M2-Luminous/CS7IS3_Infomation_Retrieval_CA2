Leaders of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) and four other sectors related to information, electronics and electrical machinery made the request during a breakfast meeting with Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister. Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the EIAJ, while making a severe assessment of business conditions surrounding his industry, said the government should place top priority on stimulating the economy. Takashi Kitaoka, chairman of the Japan Electronic Industry Development Association, sought an increased role by the government in upgrading the information infrastructure in Japan, particularly promotion of information networking. The computer industry suffered a sharp setback in hardware production for the second consecutive year, Kitaoka said. Kumagai said his ministry is maximizing efforts for an early recovery of Japanese business activity, for example, by formulating a program to create new business. But structural problems facing Japan's business sectors need to be solved first, Kumagai said, noting such problems are partly responsible for high material, personnel and production costs in Japan. Tomoo Takahara, chairman of the Japan Information Service Industry Association, said the ailing software industry is pushing ahead with efficient relocation of white-collar workers and revamping of overall business operations.
