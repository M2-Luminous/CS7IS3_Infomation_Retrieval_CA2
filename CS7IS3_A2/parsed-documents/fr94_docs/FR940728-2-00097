Maps identifying these lands, restrictions, and exempted motorized vehicle routes are available at the Las Vegas District Office. Authority for this interim closure and use restrictions is found in 43 CFR 8364.1 and 8342. Violation of these rules are punishable by a fine not to exceed $100,000 ($200,000 if the violator is an organization), imprisonment not to exceed 12 months, or both, as provided for under the Federal Land Policy Management Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;579) as amended by 18 U.S.C. 3571(b)(5). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this interim closure and use restrictions is to provide increased protection for desert tortoise populations and their habitat until final approval and implementation of the comprehensive Stateline Resource Management Plan. The desert tortoise is listed as a threatened species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and is afforded increased protection under terms of the Act. On May 15, 1991 the Bureau of Land Management became a signatory to the Clark County Short-Term Desert Tortoise Habitat Conservation Plan. On August 12, 1991 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the plan. Under this plan, the Bureau of Land Management agreed to take appropriate management actions, within certain areas established for conservation of desert tortoises and their habitat, through procedures outlined in the plan. Recommendations were made to the Bureau of Land Management by the Clark County Habitat Conservation Plan Implementation and Monitoring Committee that certain areas within Eldorado Valley and Nelson Hills should be closed to motorized vehicular traffic except for existing roads and trails or, designated roads and trails. This action would afford increased protection of desert tortoises and their habitat. This closure will provide the basis for effective enforcement of these protective measures. This closure is adjacent to and compliments a previous Interim Closure of Public Lands in Eldorado Valley issued by Federal Register Notice on Monday, December 6, 1993 (Vol. 58, No. 232). EFFECTIVE DATE: This order is effective on the date of publication in this Federal Register , and will remain in effect until the Stateline Resource Management Plan is completed and implemented and this order is rescinded by the Las Vegas District Manager. This order is effective on the Eldorado Lands Act lands, until such time as the Eldorado Lands Act lands are transferred to private ownership.
