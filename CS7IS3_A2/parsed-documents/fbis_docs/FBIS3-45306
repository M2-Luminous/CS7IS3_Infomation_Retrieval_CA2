China agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to investigate suspected factories under certain conditions and to adjustments for natural growth in some principal textile quotas proposed by the Americans, while the U.S. side agreed not to impose the quota reductions from 25 to 35 percent and not to send a fact-finding mission. An official of the China Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said: Since the third Sino-U.S. textile agreement expired on 31 December 1993, the two sides began talks in September last year on renewal of the bilateral agreement. But the two sides failed to reach agreement in the previous three rounds of talks, so a fourth round was held in the last three days. Under the principle of consultation on the basis of equality and mutual understanding and accommodation, the two sides made concerted efforts and finally reached a new agreement. He pointed out: To reach agreement the two sides have made concessions. China made concessions as follows: 1) China agreed to allow U.S. Embassy personnel in Beijing to accompany Chinese officials on inspection tours of textile factories on the mainland suspected of engaging in illegal transshipment of textiles, given approval of the Chinese side and the factories concerned; 2) China agreed to major adjustments of the annual natural growth in some principal categories of the textile quota proposed by the U.S. side; and 3) if it is amply proven that individual Chinese enterprises have engaged in illegal transshipment and have done so once and again, China agreed to accept some quota reduction but no more than three times the amount of textiles conclusively proven to have been illegally transshipped. While the Americans agreed: 1) Not to imposed the quota reductions from 25 to 35 percent demanded earlier; and 2) not to apply the anti-corruption random clauses [fan wu bi di sui yi xing tiao kuan 0646 5294 1705 4104 7151 1942 1840 2742 2949], which allow the U.S. authorities to send special fact-finding missions to China to investigate enterprises suspected of violating the agreement. The official added: Apart from the foregoing, the two sides also made corresponding concessions on a number of important issues. The concrete contents of the agreement and of the concessions will not be published until later. He continued: The key problem of the current negotiation concerned the investigation of and cracking down on illegal transshipments. Illegal transshipment refers to the practice of some illegal businessmen, who transshipped textiles to the United States by taking advantage of the balance quota of third countries to avoid quota controls exercised by importing and exporting countries. Such illegal transshipments only helped those "intermediaries" and illegal businessmen to make a windfall but damaged the interests of both countries. He further pointed out: The illegal transshipment jeopardized the normal order of textile trade between the two countries and also led to chaos in the market. Therefore measures must be taken to ban and crack down on the illegal activities. As exporters in China, importers in the United States, and middlemen in third countries were involved in the illegal transshipment, which made the situation very complicated, the two countries must join force to effectively stamp out the illegal activities. The two countries have common positions, interests, and objectives on this matter. Regarding China's measures against illegal transshipment, the official said: The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation has formulated many laws and regulations and begun to investigate relevant illegal activities in light of the information collected by itself and supplied by the Americans. In the last two years, China's relevant departments have taken action against 17 enterprises and a foreign office in China. China will reduce the quota of enterprises found guilty, revoke their right of export, ban them from serving as middlemen, and even withdraw their licenses. In the meantime, China will take legal action against those people engaged in the illegal activities. In the future, China will try to enforce relevant laws in a more effective way and intensify cooperation with the United States including exchange of information and joint investigations.
