The controversial minister, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, made the comments in a speech at the Royal Institute of International Affairs here. "Many of the provisions of the Treaty are today outdated, others are inadequate, while many of the critical present and future problems have not been taken into account," he said. The ``unacceptably high level of unemployment threatens to de-stabilise our society and democratic institutions.... We are facing one of the biggest economic crises of the last decade. ``Our inability to anticipate these developments, to study the new facts and trends of the international economy, leave their marks on our society and institutions,'' he said, describing the treaty as ``intellectually bad.'' The Maastricht Treaty, signed in December 1992, provided the framework for the single European market which came into force in January 1993, and the European Union in November last year. In the past Pangalos has caused diplomatic incidents by, notably, accusing Germany of being like "a giant with bestial force and a child's brain" over its policy in former Yugoslavia. Last month Pangalos said his time as European Affairs minister during Greek EU presidency had been "four months of nightmare.... There are only two months left, I will get through it."
