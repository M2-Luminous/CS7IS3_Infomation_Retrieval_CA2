Marzouki, who is an independent candidate in the presidential elections and former chairman of the Tunisian League for the Defense of Human Rights, was held for two hours at a police station. Marzouki wanted to explain to reporters the reasons for his presidential candidacy. His candidacy needs sponsorship by 30 mayors or deputies. With one single exception, all Tunisian mayors and deputies belong to the Democratic Constitutional Assembly, the party in power. This is why Marzouki wrote to President Ben Ali, who is an official presidential candidate himself, to ask him to intervene to help him overcome the legal obstacle that is hindering his candidacy.
