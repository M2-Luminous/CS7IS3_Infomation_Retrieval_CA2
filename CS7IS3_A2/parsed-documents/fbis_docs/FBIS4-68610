Fefelkin, chief of the Financial Service of the October Railroad, by A. Shchuchkin, GUDOK correspondent: "The October Railroad: Changes Are Coming"; St. Petersburg, date not given] [Text] In March, the MPS [Ministry of Railways] Collegium heard the report of the director of the October Railroad "On Measures To Stabilize the Economic Situation on the Road." This subject was more than topical for the entire network. A. Fefelkin, chief of the road's Financial Service, answers our correspondent's questions. [Shchuchkin] Anatoliy Nikolayevich, just why was the management of the October Railroad heard at the collegium? In relation to what? [Fefelkin] We tried to predict in advance the development of the situation in the road's economy. Foreseeing the sharp slump, and not expecting any orders from above, we had already begun, by the start of the year, to take certain steps to avoid the blind alley or at least to ease the situation. As far as I can tell, the ministry tried to obtain, using the experience of the October Road, the initial material for an objective analysis of the situation, the results of which could be used on the entire network. We decided to change the number of divisions on the road, to cut back the administrative staff and to reduce the expenditures to maintain it. Now, instead of ten divisions, we will have eight. The Moscow and Rzhev divisions are merging, as well as the Leningrad-Finland and the Leningrad-Moscow. This is an interesting fact in this situation. In previous years any cut in the staff on the divisions was made with a terrible squawk. If we asked to cut 200-300 people, the management of the divisions found dozens of reasons for our not doing this. Now, when the decision on the merge is finally made, the divisions are ready not only to cut 200 or 300 people, but double or triple that number, if only we don't combine the divisions. That is, at the local level, we see a reluctance to change the existing structure. For example, the management of the Rzhev Division, on finding out that it was being combined with the Moscow Division, presented the road administration with a document specifying a whole set of measures, allegedly making it possible to avoid combining. These measures included cutting the collective by 917 people, which is 10 percent of its number, combining a number of stations, closing some of them and converting some subdivisions to single-shift work. All this indicates that we do have reserves, not only on this division, but also on others. [Shchuchkin] Mechanically combining divisions, without structural reorganization of the management and horizontal communications system, though, can hardly solve all your problems in any major way? [Fefelkin] Of course. All this should not be undertaken for the sake of a simple merger. That is just why we are planning to improve the entire management structure, not only on the level of the divisions, but also by changing the structure of the road administration. [Shchuchkin] What will this look like? [Fefelkin] Technical cost-accounting boards of directors will be set up on the divisions. For example, on the Rzhev -- a board of directors for cost-accounting conversions, on the Moscow division -- a board of directors for technical service of track installations, communications and power supply. For the time being, the innovations will be implemented as an experiment, and if the results are favorable, these boards of directors will be able to take their place on the road as partners with equal rights. Experience in setting up these boards of directors abroad have fully justified themselves. In particular, our neighbors in Finland set up these boards of directors a long time ago and they have proven themselves. This experiment is incorporated in our concept of reorganizing the road management, which means replacing the vertical administrative relations with horizontal ones. This means creating associations of track, railcar and locomotive services. After these associations have been set up, the remaining division structures, which are the property of the NOD [Ministry of Railways Railroad Division Chiefs], should become cost-accounting boards of directors for transport and work with all the depots, stations and other independent subdivisions on contractual, equal-rights principles, in this case having no administrative command, but working on equal terms with everyone. The road administration is now also drawing up a group of documents on its structural reorganization. Some of the departments and services are merging and some will be cut back or reorganized and given different or additional functions. [Shchuchkin] In addition to creating radically reorganized structures, what other armament are you taking on? [Fefelkin] In my opinion, we too hastily and unjustifiably rejected reliable methods such as planning and establishing quotas. The consequence of this was an increase in the overexpenditure of operating funds, a weakening of the role of operations workers in high-quality utilization of rolling stock and a reduction in the material responsibility of many workers. This will do tremendous damage to the entire road economy. We must therefore return to the former measures -- planning and setting quotas for all our needs. We have partially begun to utilize them. Today not a single division receives financing in the necessary amount, because of a lack of funds. Wages are planned strictly according to the quota system and financing is implemented on each division only for this quota. The divisions, of course, require more funds than the sums put down for wages, but there is nowhere to get them. This means that we must live according to our means. In February we had 48 billion rubles [R] in monetary receipts, but the wages, allowing for deductions, were R62 billion. There was nothing with which we could cover the difference. It turned out that all the monetary receipts were being spent on wages. There was simply nothing left for reproduction. The only thing that would alleviate our situation was mutual offsetting. [Shchuchkin] From what funds do you cover expenditures to maintain divisions that are operating at a loss? [Fefelkin] There have always been a few unprofitable divisions on the road: the Bologoye, Rzhev, Pskov divisions. After Karelia was given equal status with the regions of the Far North, the Petrozavodsk Division (one of the largest on the road) also began to be subsidized. Today it lives not only through its own allocations, but also those of the Murmansk and Volkhovstroy divisions. The expenditures for wages here, allowing for deductions, constitute R11 billion. The division is not in a position to earn these funds on its own. [Shchuchkin] What is the road doing to increase monetary receipts and reduce its debts? [Fefelkin] Here is an example. The other day we signed a contract with the management of the Cherepovets Metallurgy Combine. According to it, the Kostomuksa GOK [Mining-Enriching Combine] will supply the road with pellets, counting toward clearing off the combine's debt, and the Cherepovets Combine will supply metal for the road. We turn over this metal to the plants that do not have the funds to buy it, and there they use it to make the brake shoes which are in such short supply for us, and also spare parts for rolling stock. In addition, there is a possibility of selling metal on the foreign market and obtaining "real" money for it, which we need. If our trade in metal and the barter based on it is successful in the next few months, we will draw the Kovdor and Olenegorsk GOK, which produce iron ore concentrate, into cooperation on similar conditions. There are already preliminary agreements on this. The road intends to develop this sort of commercial activity for all types of goods produced by our debtors, be they pellets, iron ore or apatite concentrates. In order not only to survive, but also to keep the road economy in good operating condition, today we must simply become sensible businessmen. [Shchuchkin] The road has its own bank -- the Baltic. What is its role in the stabilization process? [Fefelkin] The bank has essentially accelerated the passage of payments, which, strictly speaking, we were trying to do, when we created it. Today the intra-bank transfers of the Lenuzel enterprises take place in an hour. Unfortunately, the development of branches of the Baltic Bank on the road is still going slowly. Their opening on the Bologoye, Petrozavodsk and Volkhovstroy divisions is planned for the near future. Then it will be possible to accelerate the passage of payments not only at Lenuzel, but also along the entire road. For the time being, we have decided to open a branch of the bank directly in the administration, in order to make it a unique standard, or if you want, school, where interested road specialists could learn to raise their level. In addition, this branch will also be used as a savings bank for the railroad workers, in order to draw their funds into the development of the road. This will benefit everyone. [Shchuchkin] How do you intend to solve the problem of the unprofitability of passenger transport? [Fefelkin] We have arranged with the St. Petersburg Municipal Council that, instead of paying taxes into the local budget, the road, by agreement with the authorities, will direct these funds into covering the losses from passenger transport and purchasing new electric trains at Torzhok. In 1994, We plan to obtain R40 billion by reducing the NDS [VAT] deductions for the local budget. Part of these funds will go to cover the losses, and we will buy 10 Torzhok-produced electric trains for R16 billion. The total, as you can see, is quite sizable. We are counting on spending a small part of it on repairing our terminals. [Shchuchkin] What contribution are commercial structures making to the road's financial support? [Fefelkin] A considerable one. After all, we were not at first prepared to receive the tremendous flow of in-kind carriage charges which rained down on us one-and-a-half years ago. If it had not been for the commercial structures, we could hardly have been able to dispose of everything that was piled on us: after all, nothing like that had ever happened on the road before. Their activity was a great help to us. True, not everything developed and worked out fully. Some of them began to die out, but some are working with a good return. These are the funds that we are using for construction. For example, the Yugstroy Construction Organization was created, and is building a sanitarium for the road in Sochi. Through the profits from commercial structures, we completed the construction of an electric centralization post at the Kushelevka Station. In the near future we plan to rebuild the Olenegorsk Station. I am therefore convinced that the activity of the commercial structures is of appreciable help. [Shchuchkin] Many people on the road today are talking about the major cuts in staff. Is there not a danger that many able-bodied people will find themselves thrown overboard and will fill the ranks of the unemployed? [Fefelkin] This danger, in my opinion, is exaggerated. I don't think that the reduction in the contingent will hurt the interests of a large number of workers. The pensioners will leave first of all. When they retire on pension, they are paid a lump sum of six average monthly wages. Note, not salaries, but wages. Their situation will therefore not be serious or, moreover, hopeless. As for the rest of the age categories, I can say one thing here -- there will be no thoughtless cutbacks on the road. We are trying to do things so as to make this process as painless as possible.
