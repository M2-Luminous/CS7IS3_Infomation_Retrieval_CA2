He added in an interview with AL-HAYAH that OPEC could restore Iraq's prewar quota, which was distributed among other countries, without a price collapse. The Omani minister, whose country usually undertakes the role of coordinator between OPEC producers and other producers, criticized countries in the petroleum exporting organization for blaming the current petroleum price declines on nonmember countries, describing this as unfair, especially given the tendency of OPEC's production to rise, and the production of nonmember countries to decline. Al-Shanfari, who this week accepted the OPEC secretary-general's invitation to intervene with countries outside the organization to support petroleum prices, showed no eagerness to reduce the production of his country, or that of other producers outside the organization. He emphasized that OPEC itself needed "cohesion" and that OPEC itself was capable of fixing prices. The Omani minister confirmed the increase in his country's production this year, to record levels: 800,000 barrels. The text of the interview follows: ['Abd-al-Ghani] This month, in which Oman's national day falls, and in the light of the drop in petroleum prices, it has been noted that the Sultanate's production and reserves have risen. What is the volume of the increase? How can it be reconciled with Oman's pessimistic expectations in the early 1970's? [Al-Shanfari] I am pleased to give you a complete picture of our petroleum production, especially since 1974. It was in that year that the picture of the future of petroleum and gas was very bleak. At that time, Omani and international experts expected that Oman would have petroleum in the years to come--the years we are now living in. At the time, we had a petroleum reserve of about 1.5 billion barrels; our daily production was less than 300,000 barrels. Today, praise God, and with the guidance and support of His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id in the petroleum sector, we have achieved these excellent results. Our production is now 800,000 barrels per day [bpd], of which 80,000 bpd are for local consumption. We export the rest (720,000 bpd). Oman's petroleum reserves have more than tripled, nearing 5 billion barrels. We hope soon to add half a billion more barrels to the reserve, and I may say that the outlook is now bright. We are still at the beginning of the road, and I believe that we have great petroleum possibilities. ['Abd-al-Ghani] More than one OPEC official has said that the petroleum market is now experiencing a new price war, and that the non-OPEC member countries of the region--among them Oman--are responsible for this deterioration. Do you agree with this assessment? Or is it your view that the failure of OPEC states themselves to adhere to the quotas is behind the rise in supply, and by extension the price collapse? [Al-Shanfari] There is much to be said about this, but I do not want to get into blaming anyone in particular. The fact is that the global economy is in an unstable state. When development is slow in this economy, it is difficult to expect the consumption of large quantities of petroleum. Consumption grows slowly in the Western world--i.e., the industrialized countries--at a rate of less than 1 percent. Comparing that with the countries of Asia, we find that there is a large increase in consumption, and a greater absorptive capacity; average petroleum consumption rises 10 percent per year, reaching 14 percent in the case of China. Thus there are many factors involved in the collapse of petroleum prices, which taken all together do not encourage the growth of demand for petroleum. It is also true that some countries boosted their production capacity, such as the North Sea countries, Norway and Britain, but honestly, I cannot lay blame on the countries outside OPEC, because the majority are countries with small production (with the exception of Russia and the North Sea countries) that do not affect the global petroleum markets. Going back to the production of producing countries outside OPEC will fortify this view; we find that their petroleum production is decreasing. In 1989, their production was 43 million bpd, and this year it dropped to about 40 million bpd. In 1988, the OPEC countries' production was 21.8 million bpd, and it rose this year to about 26.9 million bpd. So--there is a reduction in the petroleum production of the non-OPEC states, and an increase in the petroleum production of the organization's member states. Thus it would be wrong and unfair for us to blame the drop in prices on the non-OPEC states. Here in Oman, as a coordinating state between the OPEC member producers and non-OPEC producers, we do not want to lay blame on specific parties, and we hope that our brothers in OPEC will not lay blame on the non-OPEC countries. I can give an example in this context that some members in the exporting organization directly boosted their production higher than it had been before the last Gulf war by nearly 40 or 50 percent. Some countries that had a daily production of 1.5 million barrels before the crisis have increased it to nearly two million bpd or more. Another thing. All indications are that many non-OPEC producers are decreasing production. China, for example, will this year become an importing country, and India, too, will bcome an petroleum importer within months or a year at the most. Among some OPEC member states there is a lack of agreement or consensus, but if there were to be cooperation and some good will among us, then the price situation would improve. Time is on OPEC's side; this is what I think and understand from my experience with petroleum-producing countries inside and outside the organization. I also say that we must not lay blame on one another. Let us coordinate with one another, because our dispute is not in the best interests of producing countries. I want there to be cooperation and mutual understanding among all producers. ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are calls to hold a meeting of OPEC states and nonmember countries to reach an agreement to support prices based on the OPEC member states' request for a 5 percent or more drop in production, as has happened before. Would you agree, at this time, when we are seeing a retreat in petroleum prices and revenues, to another drop in your production, or will you price as you did before to convince Russia and other producers to lower their production? [Al-Shanfari] We have no problem going along with these calls, on condition prices are raised. But we believe that lowering production without prices being raised would be hard for a country like Russia, which is facing economic hardship, or China, whose exports do not exceed 100,000 bpd. That leaves Oman, Mexico, or Egypt. Is it possible to ask Egypt, which has enormous economic challenges, or us in Oman, whose petroleum revenues are insufficient to achieve the government's ambitions, especially as we want to follow in the footsteps of our brothers in the Gulf, who produce large quantities of petroleum. We in Oman need petroleum revenues for the basic necessities of development. How can our brothers, who produce millions of barrels, ask Oman to reduce its production by 20,000 or 30,000 barrels? Even so, we have no objection, and are constantly declaring our readiness to cooperate. But how can we ask a country like Egypt, in its circumstances, with a population growth of nearly a million people every year? This is why we hope the members of OPEC will do their utmost to cooperate among themselves. If that happens, they might be able to solve the current petroleum price problem. Everyone knows that Norway is not prepared to lower its production. While they might cooperate with us, it is only verbally. They are always attending the coordination meetings that OPEC members and nonmembers hold, just to listen to our points of view. Britain is the same, except that it does not consent to attend our meetings, because they have their own circumsatcnes and policy. I reiterate, in spite of that, our willingness to cooperate, as non-OPEC producers, but it is up to OPEC to define or fix prices, so there must be greater cohesion within the organization. Our belief is that even if we did lower our production, it would not be much of a help to the current price situation. All the power lies within the organization. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Would you agree with the view that the chance of Iraq returning to the petroleum market is one of the major reasons for the current drop in global petroleum prices? [Al-Shanfari] Everyone knows that Iraq is a petroleum-producing country, and Iraq's quota of OPEC production before the war is known. Iraq's return to the "petroleum producers' and exporters' club" is something to be taken into consideration. We in the Sultanate of Oman hope that Iraq will go back to producing its petroleum. The Iraqi people have suffered enough. Iraq's quota is known to all, just as Kuwait's was. Kuwait came back and resumed producing its quota, even increased it. The Emirates' quota was known, and its current production is known. Iraq should resume producing, and Iraq's resumption of production will not mean chaos or disorder in the global petroleum market. I believe the OPEC countries will allow Iraq to resume its quota. As to when Iraq will return and what effect that will have, these matters are hard to predict fully right now, though our hope is that sanctions will be lifted from Iraq and it will be able to resume exporting petroleum. ['Abd-al-Ghani] But what will happen to the market and prices in the event OPEC is preventing from granting Iraq its old quota as soon as the international sanctions are lifted? [Al-Shanfari] The question of the price collapse might happen, I believe, if OPEC does not consent to give Iraq its former quota. Prices would plunge, possibly reaching $10 per barrel. This would hurt producers. If Iraq is given the quota that was taken from it, or distributed among some other countries, I don't think we'll see a collapse of petroleum prices. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Recently there has been a noticeable slowdown in the giant joint ventures Oman had contracted for, for instance, the construction of an petroleum pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, or the gas pipeline to India, as well as the liquid gas project--whose estimated total price tag is nearly $18 or $19 billion. [Al-Shanfari] Discussing these projects brings us to the Sultanate's efforts to diversify its revenue sources at the local level, into the areas of agriculture, industry, fisheries, and minerals. We have also begun to diversify these sources abroad; we have begun to seek out economic projects abroad. We have actually signed agrements with Russia and Kazakhstan to build a Black Sea pipeline through Russia. The project is now ready for implementation. An economic study is now being prepared, along with the route of the pipeline. We hope that the study will be adequate, and we will receive it soon. Naturally we have entered the stage of obtaining of the petroleum exploration concession in Kazakhstan, and we hope that work will get under way soon in developing this concession. We have signed an agreement with the Indian Government to supply the Indian subcontinent with natural gas from Oman. As the world's second most populous country, after China, India likewise has a rising demand for energy, and the same holds true for the other rapidly developing countries of Asia, such as Vietnam, Taiwan, and others. The agreement includes the building of a pipeline, and a study is now being prepared. We hope it will be completed for us to consider by March/April 1994. The study will definitively establish the route of the pipeline and its actual cost. We are negotiating with the Indian Government over the pricing of the gas, and are working on having the project implemented at the earliest possible opportunity. We have the strong support of His Majesty the Sultan in building this pipeline, which will be the first of its kind in the world--it will be built at a depth of 3,000 meters under the sea. Economically, it will be a first-class pipeline. It will allow the planning of other pipelines between the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula. We in Oman welcome the participation and cooperation of our brothers in the region, should they have the intention. We could work on petroleum pipelines, because as we have begun with gas we can take on the building of other pipelines for petroleum. According to what I have understood from Petroleum Ministry experts, the main obstacle to this project is technical, in terms of the means of putting a pipeline 3,000 feet down, but even this obstacle can be overcome. When the studies are completed, there will be an international tender for the construction of the pipeline. There is another project, the liquified gas complex we are also interested in, which may cost as much as to $9 billion. People may wonder how these huge, expensive projects are funded. So far we have knocked on the doors of international financiers, because we are still in the study stage, but what I would like to make clear is that building these projects will not affect the development process at home. No portion of our current global investments will be withdrawn; these projects will be funded through international institutions. I do not believe Oman will have any difficulty in handling this funding, because these projects are vital and profitable, and the Sultanate's economic reputation abroad is excellent, because of our political stability. Contacts have been made in this regard. We in the Petroleum Ministry, as well as our brothers in the Omani Finance Ministry, have received proposals from international banks and investors, all of whom want to take part in these projects. ['Abd-al-Ghani] After your recent visits to China and India, you announced Omani investments in those two countries' petroleum industries. What is the nature and scale of the investments? Will they be in the field of exploration and extraction, or in petroleum refining? [Al-Shanfari] On my visit to India, we noticed vast possibilities in all aspects of work and investment in China. We are now discussing projects such as obtaining Chinese petroleum concession regions, building petroleum refineries, and participating in pipeline construction. We are still at the negotiation and discussion stage, so right now it is difficult to say what will be agreed upon. I think we willl be able to get certain project agreements within about four months. Turning to foreign investments, we have a project to build two petroleum refineries in India, and we have also taken a share in an petroleum refinery in Thailand with Caltex, Inc. We are thus trying to diversify our income sources, especially since most of these projects will produce revenues in 10 or 15 years, and at that point will constitute another support for the Omani economy, which will prevent our continued dependence solely on petroleum revenues. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you think that India's recent agreement with Iran for a natural gas pipeline from Iran to India will affect the Indian government's commitment to their agreement with you? [Al-Shanfari] So far, our agreement is in force, and we are moving ahead with it. The Indian Government feels that we are serious about implementing it, and I do not think the Indians will change their minds. I met with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, who asserted his support for the project. Just last week there were talks with the Indians on the course of the work. We are now at the stage of implementing what we agreed upon. We are not speaking of an imaginary project. We hope that two years from now the Indian subcontnent will have natural gas from the Arabian peninsula. ['Abd-al-Ghani] Has the Sultanate's petrochemical project, which will depend on more natural gas energy and discoveries in the Sultanate, reached the stage of signing an agreement, or is it still at the preliminary study stage? [Al-Shanfari] The extent of the natural gas present under the Sultanate has begun to become clear. At present we have reached gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic feet. We have an ambitious exploration program, and I think there are great possibilities. I believe continued exploration for gas will make the picture even clearer. We are able--according to our own experts' estimates--to double our present gas reserves. We use natural gas in Oman to provide energy for electric stations. Another large electrical station will soon be added, in Manah, in the interior of Oman. As to the petrochemical complex and other projects, we are continue to study them, especially as our available gas reserves are sufficient for the Sultanate's local consumption for more than 30 years, in addition to covering the liquid gas project's needs and those of the natural gas pipeline to India. We believe that within a few months we will add new quantities of gas. This gas is associated with petroleum (petroleum liquids) that will be added to our petroleum reserves.
