Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, confirmed that the elections had taken place in all 450 constituencies. Forty-nine deputies were elected in the first round, of whom 11 are engineers, 13 education workers, three lawyers and economists. With regard to party affiliation, the deputies have been divided in the following manner: 12 are members of the Communist Party of Ukraine; four are Rukh members; two each from the Ukrainian Republican Party, Peasants Party of Ukraine, [SelPU] Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] and the Socialist Party of Ukraine; one from the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party -- party leader Stepan Khmara, and 24 have no party affiliation. In the words of Ivan Yemets, the overwhelming majority of parties are maintaining their positions in the second round. In the first instance this concerns the communists, socialists and the national-democrats. Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that the "second round would give Ukraine a new parliament." Replying to a question about how many deputies would be required in order for the new parliament to start working, Ivan Yemets said: "There are some discrepancies with the current legislation in relation to this question, therefore it will be ascertained later how many deputies, 226 or 301, will be required". Speaking about the poll in Crimea, Ivan Yemets said that the Central Electoral Commission had nothing whatsoever to do with this process. It was a matter purely for the president of Crimea. It was reported that the majority of district electoral commissions had scheduled the second round of elections for 10 April. On this matter, Ivan Yemets called on representatives of the press to make every effort to explain to the population the necessity of electing a new parliament.
