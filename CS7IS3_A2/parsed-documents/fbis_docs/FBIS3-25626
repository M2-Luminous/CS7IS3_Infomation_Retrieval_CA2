Four days after the second round in the country's first multi-party elections, voters are still waiting to see which party is to form the new government. President Gnassingbe Eyadema has ruled Togo since 1967. In a statement to journalists Commission President Garba Sipohon acknowledged that all the votes had been counted after Sunday's poll. "The results will be sent to the Supreme Court for evaluation," he said. But Sipohon disclosed the outcome in only 19 of the 24 contested districts, which when added to the winners of the first round give opposition parties a one-seat lead over the former sole ruling pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally (RPT). Sipohon said the opposition had won 38 seats compared to 37 for the RPT. Transitional Premier Joseph Koffigoh who stood as an independent also won a spot in the 81-seat assembly. Both the opposition and the RPT have claimed victory in the poll. Sipohon said announcement of the counts in five districts had been held back because of the "circumstances" in which voting had taken place. Violence marred the poll Sunday when polling stations in two districts were forced to close and the count was later disturbed in three others. The court has 72 hours to issue an official declaration on the results, with challenges having to be presented within the subsequent five days. The court will then have a further 10 days to rule on the challenges. The opposition parties, made up of Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) and the Togolese Union for Democracy (UTD), have already claimed victory in the five disputed districts -- which would give them an overall majority in the parliament. But on Tuesday the RPT accused the opposition of "fraud," alleging it had been responsible for the violence. In a statement late Wednesday it claimed victory saying the Supreme Court would "confirm its success." "The moment has come to form the country's government," the RPT added, declaring itself "ready to play its due part" and collaborate in a "large national unity government." The commission is made up of four pro-presidential sympathisers and four opposition supporters. The four opposition commission members complained Wednesday that their colleagues and "outside personalities at a high-level in the state" had pressured them into not publishing the full results. They said they had threatened to resign if the results were not published in their totality. Under the terms of the Constitution Eyadema must name a prime minister from the ranks of the new majority parties.
