Their meeting was followed by a meeting between the delegations of the two states. Afterwards, Andrey Kozyrev and Josef Zieleniec gave a joint news conference. Correspondent David Stahlavsky, who was there, reports: [Stahlavsky] Journalists' questions concerned two main areas--the Russian effort aimed at settling the Bosnian conflict and the position of the Czech Republic in the policy of Russia, as a superpower. Kozyrev confirmed that no direct clash of interests exists between our states and that, when some differences do occur, they are generated by the complexity of the problems that have to be solved jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need to quickly draft documents for the visit of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus to Russia, agreed by presidents Havel and Yeltsin last summer. Minister Zieleniec said he sees no big differences of views existing with regard to our country's efforts aimed at being incorportated into West European integrational structures. Kozyrev declined to comment directly on Russia's continuing to regard the Czech Republic as a sphere of its vital interests. The only interest he admitted was that Russian artists should be influential in our country and that Czech artists should be influential in Russia because both countries are interested in each other. Responding to a Czech Radio question, Kozyrev said that the purpose of the talks is not that the Czech Republic should back the Russian attitude to Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, although the views held by Moscow and Prague are very close. The purpose of the talks is to jointly find an answer to this very complex situation. Russia has influence there because it is familiar with this region. It is evident that Czech foreign policy also has influence in this region. They should pool their efforts aimed at solving the conflict. Kozyrev said he did not want to even think, let alone comment, on the new political situation that would evolve after a bombing of Serbian positions in Bosnia. As is known, Russia regards the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serbian artillery from the vicinity of Sarajevo as illegal and strongly disagrees with it.
