During the last dozen years, the tax systems have undergone continuous reform and development and their record of successes has attracted much attention. They meet the requirements of the development of a SEZ market economy and have done much to boost the rapid growth of SEZ economies. By providing national tax development with valuable experiences, they have fulfilled their role as a laboratory. To further boost the development of the socialist market economy in the SEZ's, we must continue to deepen the reform of their existing tax systems. I. Development Of Market Economy in SEZ Requires Deepening Of Tax Reform SEZ market economies have the basic attributes of other market economies, of which I think the three most important ones are: 1) Competitiveness. Competition lies at the heart of the market mechanism, which essentially involves the use of the price lever to adapt to changes in supply-demand relations in accordance with the demand of the law of value in order to put pressure on and motivate the principal players in the economy. Survival of the fittest steers resources to those sectors of the economy where they can be utilized most efficiently; 2) Unity. A market economy implies a unified market where all capital goods can circulate freely, putting the competitive mechanism to work on a national scale and achieving the optimal allocation of resources; 3) Openness. This means more than dismantling the regional barriers and bringing about interregional openness within a country. Even more important, it requires a nation, proceeding from national interests, to admit foreign funds and open up its domestic market, on the one hand, and promote the entry of its products into overseas markets, on the other, thus taking part in competition on the international market and bettering the efficiency of resource allocation. The development of the SEZ market economy is premised on a unified and open market that encourages competition. This requires the SEZ to design a tax system, possibly a uniform one, in accordance with established international practices and create a tax environment that treats everybody equally in order to spur competition and enhance efficiency. Furthermore, since the development of a SEZ market economy entails improving economic regulation and control, we should make the most of taxation in a SEZ as a regulator and controller of the market economy while minimizing its distorting effects on the market mechanism. In China, SEZ market economies have their uniqueness as well as the basic attributes of other market economies. Their uniqueness is that they draw upon the success stories of market economies around the world and carry out bold experiments to better serve as a model for the rest of China as it develops a socialist market economy. Surveying existing SEZ tax systems, we can readily discover many problems. There is an urgent need for reform deepening in several areas, notably the following. First, the existence of "two systems, internal and external" and "one tax, several systems" constitutes a major barrier to fair competition. In the early days of reform and openness, when SEZ's were first set up, we adopted two different tax systems, one for domestic enterprises, and one for foreign enterprises. Take the income tax payable by a SEZ enterprise, for instance. Although they all pay income taxes at the uniform rate of 15 percent, there are actually different rules for calculating taxes. In effect, the "one tax, multiple systems" rule still obtains, depending on the economic nature of the enterprise in question. The existence of "two systems, internal and external" and "one tax, multiple systems" makes the tax system of a SEZ more complicated and harder to understand than it should be. The taxpayer has trouble figuring it out. Foreign businessmen, in particular, find the system unfamiliar. Moreover, when the distribution of the tax burden is highly inequitable, it strongly militates against the full utilization of the market mechanism in the SEZ and the promotion of fair competition on a level playing field. Second, the existing SEZ circulation tax system is sharply at cross-purposes with the requirements of economic construction and development in the SEZ's. Both the combined industrial and commercial tax and the "three taxes," namely product tax, value-added tax [VAT], and sales tax, run counter to the drive to develop an export-oriented economy and a better market economy in SEZ's. To begin with, the raison d'etre of a SEZ is primarily to develop an export-oriented economy. Yet the current circulation taxes clearly fall short as a regulator of imports and exports. The combined industrial and commercial tax and the product tax neither accurately and thoroughly channel drawbacks back to exporters nor tax imports fully; as such they have not stimulated export growth as strongly as they should. They have also failed to play a strong part in regulating imports. Second, as a window for China's four modernizations, the SEZ is supposed to play a special role by importing foreign funds and technology and entering into economic cooperation with units in the interior. The current circulation tax system, however, hinders lateral economic cooperation and specialized production as a result of double taxation. Furthermore, under the existing circulation tax system in SEZ's, the tax is built into the price of a commodity. In a socialist market economy, commodity prices are mainly determined by the market. When the tax is a built-in component of a price, taxation becomes much less effective in regulating production and consumption. Sometimes the flawed tax system may even have adverse effects on market allocation. Also, when a tax is built into a price, there is often the false impression that enterprises are bearing the burden of the circulation taxes. In addition, enterprises are driven to pursue reduction in or exemptions from circulation tax, which works against enterprises carrying out production and other operations in accordance with the law of market competition. Finally there is the urban preservation and construction tax, actually a surtax on the "three taxes"-- product, VAT, and sales -- imposed to raise funds for urban preservation and construction. But not only is this tax inherently unscientific, it also dilutes the regulatory effects of the "three taxes," which does not bode well for development of a market economy in a SEZ. Third, tax breaks in SEZ's have not been totally successful in putting into effect the industrial policies of the central government or the SEZ concerned or making full use of taxation as a regulator. Among the array of preferential tax breaks, a socialist market economy relies primarily on income tax breaks to realize its industrial policy. In China's SEZ's today, however, income tax breaks, particularly those offered to foreign enterprises, have not been as successful as expected in implementing the industrial policy and adjusting the industrial structure or product mix. For example, the SEZ offers preferential tax breaks to all foreign companies which invest in production industries, including industry, agriculture, transportation, and communications. This is the centerpiece of preferential tax treatment for foreign-owned enterprises, yet it does little to help steer foreign investment dollars into the right areas. This is particularly true at a time when an SEZ is trying to upgrade its industrial structure. To do that, a SEZ needs to develop new industries utilizing new and high technology and creating a critical mass of such industries as the engine of industrial development. Yet preferential tax breaks for high-tech industries remain very limited at the moment; not enough to meet the requirements of optimizing the industrial structure of the zone. Fourth, tax construction and tax reform still fail to keep pace with the actual developments in an SEZ economy. The SEZ economy has been developing by leaps and bounds and new economic phenomena have been occurring continuously, such as land sales and appreciation in land value, the boom in real estate transactions, and the creation and maturation of a stock market. Besides tinkering with the system here and there, however, the SEZ has not deepened its tax system in line with the new set of realities. How do you properly tax the capital gains derived from the resale of land and other real estate transactions, and the trading of securities, for instance? That question has yet to be answered, which has prevented tax collection from regulating SEZ economic development effectively. As for the experiment in tax reform, we should go in for useful experiments in light of what is actually happening in the SEZ economy. For instance, as the economy grows, inheritances and gifts have been on the rise steadily and it is common for SEZ's to levy an inheritance tax or gift tax. Or take the issue of social insurance. Social insurance is a relatively simple thing in SEZ's, which should facilitate the experiment of levying a social insurance tax. Thus far, however, the Shenzhen SEZ has not departed from the nationwide tax system by embarking on bold experimentation in this area. The gratifying thing is that the Shenzhen SEZ has gone one step ahead of others in solving these problems, achieving enormous successes and gaining useful experiences. Not only has it set uniform rates for calculating income taxes payable by SEZ enterprises and preferential tax breaks, but it has also basically standardized the circulation tax system and totally unified the local tax system. In so doing, it has greatly speeded up the development of a market economy, setting an important example for other SEZ's. At the same time, we should see that there are still problems in the Shenzhen SEZ's existing tax system, notably the following. Neither the circulation tax system at the import end nor the personal income tax system have been made uniform, the circulation tax system still seems to fall short on the whole, the corporate income tax system needs to be optimized, and more needs to be done to deepen tax construction and tax reform in light of the reality in the zone. More reform is needed in all those areas. II. Deepen Tax Reform in SEZ's, Spur Development of Market Economy A. To deepen tax reform in SEZ's, we must straighten out two sets of relationships. In view of the fact that the tax system of a SEZ is an important part of the nation's tax system and that there are considerable objective differences between the tax systems of the various SEZ's at the moment, I believe deepening tax reform in SEZ's requires us to straighten out the relations between SEZ tax systems and the national tax system as well as relations among the tax systems of all the SEZ's. 1. How to straighten out relations between SEZ tax systems and the national tax system? The tax systems of the SEZs should be relatively independent of the national tax system, a conclusion arrived at after considering a host of factors including the reality in SEZ's and the inherent requirements of tax construction. As far as the reality in the SEZ's is concerned, SEZ's make up the most unique economic belt in the whole nation with an objectively existent special economic foundation. As part of the superstructure, the tax system must be compatible with such an economic foundation. For this reason, the tax system of a SEZ must be independent of the national tax system. A SEZ calls for a special tax system, justified by the model of development for the economy of a SEZ, by the demands of developing an export-oriented economy, and by the intrinsic needs of the operating mechanism of the SEZ economy. Turning to the internal requirements of tax construction, the uniqueness of taxation determines that there be an essentially unified national tax system. The need for a uniform tax code and the centralization of taxing authority is even greater when we are trying to develop a socialist market economy. In tax construction in China, the central government will assume decision-making responsibilities at the highest level. So even if the SEZ's adopt a special tax policy different from those of other places, consideration must be given to striking a regional balance. It must be pointed out that today the open policy has created in China a situation in which technology and funds are diffused from one level to the next, starting with the SEZ's through opened coastal cities, economic and technical development zones, and economic open zones to the vast hinterland. In tax construction, therefore, one must make choices that are based on comprehensive considerations and in line with the idea of joint development across the nation. Accordingly, even though SEZ's take the lead in establishing a new tax system suited to their own objectives, they must see that their tax systems are consistent with the unified national tax system so that the tax systems of different regions are organically in harmony with one another within the framework of national legislation and that the basic uniformity of the national tax system is ensured. Furthermore, tax construction must abide by specific laws. Since the core of tax legislation in China is made by the central government, the SEZ's as class one local lawmaking bodies must obtain authorization from the highest lawmaking body of the land before they can make laws on taxation. Thus the independence of SEZ tax systems can only be relative; the fact that a SEZ has an independent tax system does not put it beyond the restraint of the nation's lawmaking system. In short, straightening out the relations between the SEZ tax systems and the national tax system should be guided by the notion of relative independence for the former. Overall, a SEZ tax system should organically dovetail with the national system. Take the exercise of tax collection jurisdiction, for instance. A SEZ tax system should exercise jurisdiction over place of origins, on the one hand, and jurisdiction over residents, on the other, based on the need to preserve national interests. Also, a SEZ tax system should be flexible in choosing from among an array of taxes, taking special care to fulfill its role as a tax reform laboratory. In the new era, the idea behind economic lawmaking is to try out local lawmaking in some places first before a law is adopted nationwide. In accordance with that idea, the supreme lawmaking body of the central government may authorize local lawmaking bodies in the various SEZ's to make laws on taxation so that local lawmaking bodies in the SEZ's can do a better job in tax lawmaking to provide a full legal guarantee for deepening tax reform in SEZ's. 2. How to reconcile the tax systems of different SEZ's? Judging from the tax systems in the various SEZ's, that of the Shenzhen SEZ is more advanced while its counterparts elsewhere are more backward. This raises the issue: How to straighten out relations among the various tax systems? China's five SEZ's are components of an organic whole. While differing in the extent of development, a quantitative difference, they share qualitative similarities. For example, their economies are the same in nature and they all follow the same economic model. This determines that their tax systems be basically the same. Having said that, since the five special economic zones do have different development focuses, they should formulate their own appropriate tax systems based on their own characteristics and the development of their lead industries. For this reason, the SEZ's should be allowed to adopt disparate tax breaks freely to reflect their individual priorities. The Xiamen SEZ, for instance, may adopt some tax policies befitting a free port. Surveying the situation on the tax front in the various SEZ's objectively, we see that the Shenzhen SEZ has been most successful in tax construction, so the others should generally try to emulate it in tax reform. Specifically, the other SEZ's should seek to duplicate the Shenzhen tax system by achieving the following before proceeding to deepen tax reform by moving in tandem with Shenzhen: 1) Unify income tax breaks for enterprises and the standards for calculating taxes; 2) unify the SEZ circulation tax system; and 3) unify the SEZ local tax system. B. Deepening tax reform in Shenzhen SEZ: Detailed Thinking To deepen tax reform in the Shenzhen SEZ, we should zero in on the major problems in the existing tax system, at the same time considering how the tax system of Hong Kong would fit into it after Hong Kong is returned to the motherland. It would be advisable to deepen reform in the following areas: 1. Reform the circulation tax system in the SEZ in light of the actual needs of economic development in the zone. The first step in deepening the reform of the circulation tax system is to unify the circulation tax system at the import end and totally abolish the combined industrial and commercial tax. Secondly, adjust the existing "product, value-added, and sales" taxes by broadening the scope of the VAT to replace the product tax and in part the sales tax (in the area of commodity circulation) as well. With the VAT as the principal circulation tax, we will be better able to avoid double taxation and utilize circulation taxes as the regulator of exports and imports. At the same time, we should cut the VAT rates and establish a uniform system of three tax rates: standard rate, higher rate, and lower rate. Once that is accomplished, we should impose a separate consumption tax, the principal targets being certain consumer goods and consumption behavior. As for the sales tax, it should essentially be aimed at the tertiary sector (excluding commodity circulation). As the tertiary sector grows, we should extend the reach of the sales tax to include a number of up-and-coming trades. Sales tax rates too should be adjusted as appropriate by raising the rates for a number of highly profitable trades to make the tax a better regulator. Finally, create the conditions for replacing price inclusive taxes with extra-price taxes. When that comes to pass, circulation taxes can play a supplementary role in regulating production with consumption in a market economy while avoiding the negative effects of price-inclusive taxes. 2. Regularize the SEZ income tax system and adjust corporate income tax breaks. In the Shenzhen SEZ the deepening of the reform of the income tax system must begin by regularizing the tax system in accordance with established international practices. First of all, the SEZ must basically unify its personal income tax system. In the wake of rapid economic development in the SEZ, the gaps between Chinese citizens and foreign personnel in income and consumption have been narrowing by the day. Therefore, it should consider applying the personal income tax law to both Chinese and foreigners by lowering the exemptions enjoyed by the former appropriately. That would create a basically uniform personal income tax system in which the personal income tax and personal income regulating tax are merged into one. Secondly, be it the personal income tax system or corporate income tax system, a stringent body of tax laws should be developed to reduce and close loopholes. Also, China should formally promulgate the "Anti-Tax Avoidance Law" without delay to provide a legal basis for the SEZ's campaign against tax cheats. Another aspect of income tax reform in the Shenzhen SEZ as the zone makes the transition from infancy to its formative stage is to replace its present practice of offering tax breaks uniformly "across the board" with new industry-specific tax breaks. The core of the new policy should be to adjust income tax breaks for enterprises in the zone. By industry-specific tax breaks, we mean using the industrial policies of the nation and the zone to determine the tax breaks to be offered to investors. In light of the demands of national economic development on the industrial structure in the future, the Shenzhen SEZ should concentrate on developing industries using new and high-tech to upgrade its industrial structure. Accordingly, the corporate income tax system should also shift to high-tech enterprises as the principal beneficiaries of tax breaks. Other recipients of corporate income tax breaks should include enterprises which invest in the infrastructure, which make large-scale investments, or which export their output to earn foreign exchange. The result is a system of industry-specific corporate income tax breaks dominated by tax breaks for high-tech industries and supplemented by other tax breaks. It needs to be emphasized here that industry-specific tax breaks are applicable to all enterprises regardless of their economic nature. Of course, other special tax breaks may be made available to foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises, but only if they are justified by the characteristics of a particular investment and meet the criterion of attracting foreign investment. Also, the latter kind of tax breaks must remain a supplementary part of the system of tax breaks overall. For instance, corporate income tax breaks may be offered to a foreign investor who reinvests his after-tax profits. Only by doing so can the zone both achieve the goal of attracting foreign capital and effectively use taxation to steer foreign investment into particular industries. 3. Intensify local tax construction and deepen tax reform experimentation in the zone. As far as the Shenzhen SEZ is concerned, intensifying local tax construction mainly involves levying a number of new taxes in light of the economic reality in the zone and its objective requirements. A real-estate VAT, for instance, may be slapped on the enormous appreciation in land value realized from the sale and resale of land and other real estate transactions. A capital gains tax may be levied on the capital gain realized by an enterprise or individual by selling capital goods (stocks, real estate). An inheritance or gift tax may be imposed on the inheritances and gifts of enterprises or individuals. In addition, a social insurance tax may be imposed depending on the economic development needs of the SEZ. That way not only can we make better use of taxation to regulate the SEZ economy, but we also can experiment with certain types of tax in the zone to provide experience for nationwide tax reform. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the current urban protection and construction tax is not generating enough funds, it should be abolished and replaced by an independent new urban protection and construction tax. Other ways also exist to raise urban development funds, such as adjusting as appropriate the scope and rates of the stamp tax, property tax, vehicle and boat use tax, and land use tax. (It would be advisable for the Shenzhen SEZ to abolish land use fees in favor of a standardized land use tax.)
