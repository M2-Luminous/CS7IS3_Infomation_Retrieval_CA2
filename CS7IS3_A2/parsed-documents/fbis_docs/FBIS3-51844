After negotiations between the carriers and the government delegations failed, the climate of "peaceful actions" deteriorated into a riot atmosphere without police intervening to restore order. Gustavo Aguiluz, spokesman for the powerful National Transportation Commission, reported that a dozen taxi drivers were detained by the Managua police and that one of them was even beaten in the confusing situation. Parrales Vallejos Cooperative buses blocked the Portozuelo freeway in Managua's northeastern area. On several streets, bonfires blocked traffic and bottlenecked buses and taxis. Tonight, the strikers closed off city exits to Leon and Chinandega and partially closed off the routes to the country's east. It has been reported from Esteli that bottlenecks impeded free traffic toward the Honduran border. The strike worsened when the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers and the National Transportation Commission decided to keep pressing their demands as long as the goverment fails to negotiate a reduction of prices on oil byproducts and other socioeconomic benefits. The government has not yet clearly stated its position regarding the carriers' demands. Meanwhile, the strike is spreading and people who use public transportation vehicles must walk to get to work.
