In the last seven months, there has been speculation that unscrupulous groups are providing illegal drugs to some men and women in Phnom Penh, but it has been very difficult to get good evidence about this activity. This is a major problem which the royal government and appropriate ministries should pay close attention to and have a strategy for dealing with. Even though the source of information about the use of drugs is vague, these unscrupulous groups cannot avoid the fine net cast by the authorities. It is clear that the Criminal Police of the Ministry of the Interior have been making arrests continuously since the beginning of March including members of a Vietnamese gang which has been involved in illegal drug dealing in the Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward right in front of the Bung Trabek School in Chamkar Mon District; we reported this on 7 March. This is the very first fruit of the Cambodian police in their suppression of people involved in the illicit use of drugs which in the past we have only heard about in stories on foreign videos. It is still not known how many people make a living through the illicit distribution of drugs or where these people are. It is a difficult problem which must be carefully investigated. Therefore this event can serve to frighten parents and guardians into taking care to educate their children to keep them from falling into this kind of disaster. If the use of drugs really does increase and spread through the country it will topple Cambodia into another new disaster which, it can now be seen, is the deadliest "virus" for the society comparable to AIDS. A real problem is that in Cambodia Drug Eradication Committees have probably not yet been organized. Regarding the question what result would come from the use of drugs, Dr. Ti Chhun Eng, an official in the Ministry of Health, said that the danger in the use of drugs is that it could lead the great difficulties. Once someone gets involved with drugs, that person will continue to use them. When that person cannot obtain drugs, he/she cannot do anything because it causes a severe condition similar to drunkenness or opium intoxication. When a person is hooked on drugs it is not easy to get him/her off of drugs. According to some, the use of drugs makes the person brave and happy and easily controlled by another person. The use of drugs by young women makes them sexually aroused. This is really a tough problem. They get used to being happy and brave...they live together. This is the way it is with drug addicts; they cannot stop (like people who are alcoholics or smokers) whenever drugs are available. Dr. Ti Chhun Eng stated that we cannot say that drugs can make a person brave. The first step is only to get people to try drugs. Once people are addicted he/she can be ordered to do something. If the drug addict cannot do what he/she is ordered to do, they will not give him/her any drugs. So drug addicts must carry out their orders successfully in order to earn their drugs.
