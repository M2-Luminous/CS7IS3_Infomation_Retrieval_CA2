China's top securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, has called on listed companies to standardise their operations and suggested a six-month "coaching period" to guide companies both before and after they list. A senior official of a Shanghai brokerage said the six-month coaching periods before and after listing would probably be included in the supplementary provisions to the Securities Law. Although details of the guidance procedure had yet to be officially announced, he said Beijing's securities authorities were aiming to improve the quality of companies through the proposed system. The brokerage official speculated that mainland stockbroking houses would be designated as "coaches" because they were more familiar with the companies, compared to securities authorities. In addition he said companies would be more willing to accept guidance from brokerages rather than securities authorities because the former were comparatively more independent and the latter more official. "It is highly possible that some stockbroking houses will become coaches for listing candidates," he said, pointing to the big brokerages with good performance records. The official expected there would be requirements on what was a qualified coach and on the procedures and goals for coaching. He speculated that the chances for foreign brokerages to be given the opportunity to coach would be low because they were not as familiar with the situation on the mainland. The aim was that company management should be instructed in relevant legal knowledge and the appropriate manner to disclose information as well as the importance of adhering to listing plans in prospectuses. Under the existing securities regulations, it is clear that big changes in a company's business is not allowed in the first year of listing. But the brokerage official said most companies did not follow what they pledged in prospectuses. "Most companies follow what we tell them before their listings, but once they get the money, our words fall on deaf ears. What they care about is nothing more than how to spend the money," he said. The official said the proposed plan would help raise the discipline of issuers and their legal knowledge, which would effectively raise the overall quality of listed companies on China's stock exchanges. This was because the responsibility would fall on the coach, not just the companies, if the companies did not follow their listing plans. However, Bankers Trust Asia Research Vice-president Lily Wu said that the coaching period was redundant. She said the companies knew that, according to the rules in the Standard Opinion on share issues and trading, they could not make big changes in businesses in their first months after listing. "We know companies do not follow the rules and waste their money. They just pump their money into property...," she said. However, Ms Wu said the coaching period would contribute to the chance of the government exerting too much interference in the stock markets.
