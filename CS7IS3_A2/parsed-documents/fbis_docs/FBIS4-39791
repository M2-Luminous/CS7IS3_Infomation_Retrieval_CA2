Anatoliy Kolos, Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign economic relations, said the Ukrainian-Vietnamese trade turnover in 1993 was $39 million, including $23 million in exports and $7 million in imports. Ukraine's exports to Vietnam include hydroturbines, bulldozers, transport lifting equipment, and others. Import priorities are rice and rubber. According to Anatoliy Kolos, 29 joint Ukrainian-Vietnamese ventures have been set up in the years of independence, eight of which are manufacturers. Mai Van Zakh [name as received], Vietnam's deputy minister of commerce, said that thanks to reforms introduced in Vietnam in 1986, the country's exports have been boosted by 20 percent each year. One of Vietnam's priorities in foreign relations, the deputy minister said, is renewal of ties with CIS states, particularly, with Ukraine. Mai Van Zakh told UNIAN that the slow development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations was caused by Ukraine's lack of legislative regulations on payments. Deputy Minister Anatoliy Kolos said in an interview that Ukraine is mainly interested in Vietnamese rubber imports for which Ukraine could supply relevant processing equipment. In order to resolve the other bilateral issues, Ukraine and Vietnam set up an intergovernmental commission led by Vietnam's deputy minister of commerce and Ukraine's deputy minister of foreign economic relations, Anatoliy Kolos. The commission will look at the possibility of setting up a Ukrainian-Vietnamese bank. Summing up the meeting, Anatoliy Kolos pointed out favorable trends in the development of Ukrainian-Vietnamese relations, saying that despite all economic obstacles, Ukraine's exports to Vietnam have grown 10-fold in the first quarter of this year, while imports have increased two-fold, compared with the respective period last year.
