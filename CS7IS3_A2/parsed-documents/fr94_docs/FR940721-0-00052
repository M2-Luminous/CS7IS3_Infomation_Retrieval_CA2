FR940721-0-00052 FR940721-0-00014 Other issues related to the definition of ``Carline.'' NHTSA received a number of comments concerning whether engine types, body styles, and/or drive systems should be considered in making carline determinations. The agency notes that these factors, unlike country of assembly, are related to degree of commonality in construction. As discussed above, AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be the same as those used for CAFE. That organization stated that there should be no further segregation of carlines by engine type, and that light trucks should not be divided by type of driveline. According to AAMA, these separations would not provide more meaningful information to the consumer. That commenter stated that items such as 4-wheel drive and engine types are customer options and should not be used to differentiate carlines. AAMA noted that differences in engine sourcing will be reflected on the label under country of origin of the engine. AAMA stated that it supports the agency's proposal not to subdivide the carline definition for sedans and station wagons or fuel economy model types. It argued that adding more characteristics to define carline would increase the compliance costs to the vehicle manufacturer, would not add any value to the label, and would confuse the customer. It stated that the proposed definition should be revised by deleting a sentence stating that 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive versions of light trucks are treated as separate carlines, and by replacing a reference to ``utility vehicles'' with the term ``special purpose vehicles.'' Toyota argued that manufacturers should have the option of separating carlines by engines and by drive systems. That manufacturer stated that such separations would further the Act's purpose of providing the consumer information on equipment content, by giving consumers more precise content information for the particular model being considered for purchase. Toyota stated that because this would create an additional burden, it should be at the option of the manufacturer. Honda stated that it supports differentiating carlines by engine type, because such separation would improve the accuracy of the information on the label. That company stated that sourcing of parts may be different for different engine types. Honda indicated that it strongly supports retaining station wagons within the carline of the same name, consistent with EPA's inclusion of station wagons within the carline of the same name for purposes of computing the carline's domestic content for CAFE. BMW stated that with respect to differentiating carline by engine type and drive type, it believes the relevant portion of the carline definition is for the purpose of providing relief to manufacturers rather than imposing a requirement on them. It stated that it believes that using the definition verbatim from the legislation and allowing manufacturers discretion to decide which models to include in the carline calculations, in conjunction with clarification from the manufacturer of the models that were used in the calculations, would result in the best and most accurate information to potential consumers. Nissan stated that it believes carlines should not be separated by engine types, body styles or drive systems. According to that manufacturer, it would take a major change in the foreign content of those parts to result in a significant change in carline content percentages. Nissan stated that additional calculation and the resulting record keeping requirements by engine types, body styles, and drive systems would impose a significant administrative burden on manufacturers, and would not result in an appreciable increase in the accuracy of the content information on the label. After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that engine types and drive systems should not be considered in making carline determinations. These features are typically customer options for particular make/models, similar to options related to level of decor. The agency believes that these features are too insignificant to be considered in making carline determinations, i.e., if vehicles are essentially the same except for the fact that one has a larger engine or 4-wheel drive, there is sufficient commonality of construction that the vehicles should be in the same carline. NHTSA does not believe that a manufacturer option should be provided in this area, because it could confuse consumers if ``carline'' has a different meaning for different vehicles. Moreover, the agency believes that separation by engine type and drive system would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the content percentages provided on the label. The agency also generally agrees with AAMA that, to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be the same as those used for CAFE. NHTSA notes that station wagons are included in the same carline as similar sedans, as in CAFE. This follows from section 210's language that carline is not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roof line, except for light duty trucks. Consistent with CAFE, special purpose vehicles, vans and pickup trucks are considered to be in different carlines. b. Final assembly/final assembly point. Section 210 provides that costs incurred at the final assembly point and beyond, including the costs of assembly and labor, are not included in the calculation of parts content. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that manufacturers may conduct some pre-assembly operations, e.g., production of equipment, at the same location as final assembly. The agency tentatively concluded that such operations should be treated the same as the operations of an allied supplier. The agency proposed to specify a particular phase in the assembly process, for both the body and chassis, that would mark the beginning of final assembly. This was reflected in specific proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and ``final assembly point.'' AAMA stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate to which passenger motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach is contrary to the generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That organization agreed, however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be considered part of final assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and content calculations.
