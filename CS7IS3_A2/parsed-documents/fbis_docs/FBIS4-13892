[Jawad] At a meeting convened in Geneva last month, the price-monitoring ministerial committee of OPEC decided to maintain the existing production ceiling of 24.52 million barrels per day [BPD] until the end of the year. The agreement, which Iraq did not sign, led to a deterioration in oil prices on world markets, given that the ceiling far outstrips demand for OPEC oil. That applies particularly to the second quarter of this year, when demand is expected to fall behind the ceiling by 1 to 2 million BPD. ['Abd-al-Majid] Why did Saudi Arabia balk at cutting its output quota? [Jawad] Saudi Arabia has benefited the most from the cuttoff of Iraqi oil from world markets. In the wake of the sanctions, Saudi Arabia's production jumped from 5.38 million PBD -- the share set for it by the July, 1990 agreement -- to over 8 million BPD early this year. Although this substantial increase in Saudi Arabia's output was accompanied by a real drop in prices, notably in late 1993 and early 1994, the Saudis pressed ahead with these high production levels, without reference to the interests of other OPEC members. The argument advanced by Saudi Arabia was that in the event OPEC cut production to boost prices, non-OPEC producers would increase theirs and thus neutralize the intended effect of the OPEC action. Incidentally, Iraq has called on all producers, both within and outside of OPEC, to pursue production policies that should raise their income by balancing output and prices in the international market. Many producers from outside OPEC have shown a willingness to cooperate in restoring balance to the market. However, for this to happen such major producers like Saudi Arabia must act responsibly. ['Abd-al-Majid] With the current downtrend in oil prices on the world market, how will Iraq act if the oil embargo is lifted? [Jawad] The downward trend in oil prices is projected to persist for the next five months, when they will rally again. We think that lifting the oil embargo on Iraq will contribute to a boost in prices, since then OPEC will call an extraordinary session and adjust its overall production. Iraq's return to the oil market will remove a negative factor that has been having an impact on the oil prices. Iraq will also play an influential and responsible role in formulating OPEC's production policies so as to advance the interests of all interested parties and stabilize prices. ['Abd-al-Majid] When will the Iraqi contract with the French companies become effective? [Jawad] Iraq seeks to expand and diversify its relations with many foreign companies, including French companies. The latest talks with the French side and their results are aimed at having good relations with oil companies based on the exchange of interests between all parties. As for relations with the French companies, Iraq hopes that these companies will take the necessary steps and prepare for the lifting of the oil embargo as soon as possible. ['Abd-al-Majid] Will Jordan's share of crude oil be increased, or will it continue at the same rates? [Jawad] As you know, Iraq has warm fraternal relations with Jordan. The present rates of oil supplies to Jordan depend on the quantities required by Jordan and allowed by the United Nations. The question of maintaining or increasing the present rates depends on coordination between the two sides and the relevant UN resolutions. ['Abd-al-Majid] How true is the report about constructing an Iraqi oil pipeline to the Port of al-'Aqabah? [Jawad] Iraq seeks to increase and diversify its oil exporting terminals. The idea of an Iraqi oil pipeline to al-'Aqabah is aimed at increasing the flexibility of Iraqi oil exportation. Several feasibility studies should first be made, taking into consideration political developments and the required guarantees for the flow of Iraqi oil from the Port of al-'Aqabah. ['Abd-al-Majid] Which are the U.S. companies that negotiated with Iraq on investing new oil fields? [Jawad] Several U.S. companies negotiated with Iraq on investing new oil fields, as did companies from other countries. These negotiations aim to realize the joint interests of all parties, also they are in their initial stages, so we cannot predict their outcome. ['Abd-al-Majid] Twenty-two Congress members asked the U.S. President to send equipment to extract oil from the northern region of Iraq. What is your comment? [Jawad] The attempts to divide Iraq's unity are pitiful and are destined to failure. What some agent quarters and Zionism are trying to do is to split the national unity. These attempts do not aim to realize the interests of the Iraqi people in the northern region. Iraq does not need assistance from suspicious quarters under the pretext of assisting its sons. Iraq is rich with oil, and can provide all its areas with their oil needs. ['Abd-al-Majid] What was the most prominent achievement in the oil sector despite the circumstances of siege and oil embargo? [Jawad] There have been several achievements in the area of oil during the siege, but reconstructing the oil sector after the wholesale destruction it suffered was the most prominent achievement. In order to know the importance of this achievement, we recall that the oil sector suffered brutal attacks against all its facilities, and that 180 main sites were attacked by missiles and air raids. Two thousand five hundred air raids were launched against these sites, and 150,000 bombs were fired at them. This reduced the refining capacity to only 3 percent, and the total costs of damage reached $6 billion, according to UN estimates. Since the first day of the cease-fire, the people in the oil sector exerted exceptional efforts and used innovative means to rebuild the destroyed facilities, thus the refineries once again became operational. As for the field of oil extraction, the oil facilities were badly damaged and nonoperational. During the rebuilding stage, oil experts managed to rebuild these facilities and restored them to a better status than prior to the aggression. Moreover, the pumping stations, pipelines, and oil tanks were rebuilt. Many big and important accomplishments could be added to the marvelous rebuilding work. These accomplishments were realized through personal efforts--accomplishments that had in the past been confined to Western expertise. New potentials were added in the oil refining sector with a dependence on potentials and expertise that in the past were not sufficiently invested. The productive efficiency of our oil facilities is now better than it was before the aggression. Cadres were introduced to other fields of work other than the oil sector, including the industrial and agricultural sectors as well as the sugar plant, al-Najaf tire factory, and other industrial plants. We also actively participated in completing the leader's river, al-'Izz River, Taj al-Ma'arik [Crown of Battles] River, and Umm al-Ma'arik [Mother of Battles] River. Work is continuing on a project to irrigate al-Jazirah, and the sanitation projects in al-Ramadi and al-Fallujah. We also made contributions to rebuilding bridges such as al-Qurnah tubular bridge, the bridge at al-Majidiyah, the suspension bridge, and leader Saddam's double-deck bridge. Moreover, our cadres were able to find many alternatives to industrial parts that used to be imported from outside. ['Abd-al-Majid] Is there any inclination to export gas to Arab countries, including Jordan, in particular, after the discovery of gas reserves in the Western desert? [Jawad] Iraq sought to develop all its hydrocarbon resources. Some time ago, Iraq adopted a policy to stop wasting gas. The gas projects in the North and South clearly show Iraq's concern about the amounts of gas produced. Of course, plans to utilize gas does not only mean using it locally, but also to export it to other nearby or faraway countries. Priority will go to nearby countries, especially Arab countries, which will receive special attention in terms of exporting gas to them. Foremost of these countries is Jordan, which will receive its share of exported gas as soon as gas projects are completed and once outlets and means to export it outside are available. The unfair embargo on Iraq is currently a big obstacle to Iraq in terms of developing its gas resources and allowing it to export its surplus to nearby countries, including Jordan. Of course, the fact that there are new gas reserves in the Western desert will contribute to Iraq's ability to export to a nearby country like Jordan. ['Abd-al-Majid] A Turkish official who recently visited Baghdad expects Iraq to start exporting oil this year. What do you say about that? [Jawad] We are ready to export oil at any time. ['Abd-al-Majid] When to be exact? [Jawad] We expect this to take place in 1994. Oil will be pumped through the Turkish pipeline next month. Cleaning work on this pipeline is currently underway and will require pumping a certain amount of oil. This, in practice, means that we will resume the export of oil. This issue is of great importance to the Turkish side. The halt in exporting Iraqi oil has caused unemployment and security problems. The Turks are the ones who insist that we quickly finalize this issue. ['Abd-al-Majid] Have you thought of special security measures to protect the aforementioned pipeline from acts of sabotage in areas controlled by the Kurds? [Jawad] Protection is available and the Turks are capable of securing that. It is illogical that they would take a step like this without coordinating their stands with the Kurds.
