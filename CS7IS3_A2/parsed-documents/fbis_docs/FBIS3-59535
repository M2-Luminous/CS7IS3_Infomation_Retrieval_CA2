"The upcoming reduction in tariffs that goes into effect on 1 January 1994 is the biggest since 1987," says Charles de Cognets, head of central marketing and communication for Transpac. Overall, the telecommunications operator is announcing a reduction that is equivalent to seven percent in constant [French] francs [Fr]. But that's not the only news from Transpac. The menu of services offered is also in for major changes. And client-tailored contracts are gaining ground over services to the general public -- a change that reflects Transpac's eagerness to shed the X.25 label still clinging to its offerings with a view to becoming the leading supplier of European data-sharing networks. Tariffs Reduced Good news for Transpac customers: Bills will go down next year. According to the firm, tariffs will decline 4.84 percent. The figure is an average that takes into account discounts on service charges, rate per kilobyte, and cost per minute for use of virtual circuits. Monthly service charges at speeds from 4,800 bits per second [bps] to 256 kilobits per second [kbps] are all revised downward from 1993. High transfer rates of 384 to 1,920 kilobits per second [Kbps] will make their debut in the tariff charts. This palette of options and high-speed data transfer rates is modeled on the one employed by the Transfix service. By the way, the overall rate reduction cannot fail to have a direct effect on the rates Transfix charges. But Transpac is going a step further than its elder sibling, lowering rates for 9,600-bps leased lines at a time when Transfix's tariff for the same grade of service is unchanged. The discount is all the more impressive when one considers that 9,600-bps service, along with 19.2 Kbps, accounts for most of the direct accesses to Transpac. On the other hand, users who must access Transpac indirectly will get less benefit from the declining service charges. The cost per minute on-line via RTC [public switched telephone network] is unchanged. Telex access costs are going up slightly, though the rate for Numeris (channel B) is falling. Another descending indicator is unit price per kilobyte, which is dropping from 5.7 to 5.4 centimes. Per-minute on-line rates are also going down. This reduction is being implemented by simplifying the rate structure from six categories to three. Setting the 2,400-bps CVC (Switched Virtual Circuit) service rate equal to that charged for low-capacity links (300 and 1,200 bps) is not going to increase the profitability of the former. At the next higher level, the cost of CVC service at 19.2 kbps is being aligned with the reduced rate for 4,800 and 9,600-bps service. Finally, the cost of the highest-speed service (48 Kbps) is unchanged. The realignment is most advantageous for CVFs (Dedicated Virtual Circuits), with an 11 percent rate reduction. Users of interactive applications will benefit from this change, though it is offset by an augmentation in the price of CVPs (permanent virtual circuits) between two direct access points. Transpac is also introducing new services, including synchronous direct access at 14.4 kbps. In a bid for greater market share, it is adding LVUs (single virtual lines) to its catalogue of offerings. These are 9,600 bps to 1,920 Kbps virtual circuits linking two sites, with billing based on volume calculated in either of two methods. Channel D Under the first method, unit rate declines as total volume rises. As monthly consumption increases from Fr1,000 to Fr24,000, the rate per kilobyte decreases in six steps from 20 to 65 percent. Moreover, if the two linked sites are in the same interchange zone, price per kilobyte is cut another 50 percent. Better still, the off-peak hours discount is also applied to the volume of data transferred over LVUs. Under the second, increasingly large monthly consumption ceilings are attached to each LVU based on the data transfer rate. There is no added charge for traffic above these ceilings. According to Charles de Cognets, "LVUs give our clients the security of stable, predictable outlays." All this has to be seen as a response to the aggressive rate structure of Transfix, which today is Transpac's only real competitor. In practical terms, LVU is designed for high-volume applications such as provision of [wide area network or WAN] connectivity between separate data processing sites or local area networks [LANs]. Another advantage: LVU starts with a 9,600-bps transfer rate that amply meets the needs for this type of application but also offers a range of speeds as high as two megabits per second [Mbps]. In addition, the former LVR (rapid virtual link) service, which catered only to the demand for medium and high flow rates -- without much success, it must be conceded -- is being removed from the services catalogue. Regarding WAN link-ups, we will conclude by noting that henceforth an IP [Internet Protocol] hook-up on Ethernet will be incorporated into the rate. The SNA [Systems Network Architecture] option will follow later. In a similar vein, Transpac plans to discontinue its 300-bps asynchronous service as of 31 December 1994. The firm also plans gradually to increase cost of service at the next higher rung. Thus connections at 1,200 and 2,400 bps will cost more starting next year. In this way the operator hopes to encourage low-volume users to migrate toward Numeris's "Channel D" service. One might legitimately ask whether this decision does not signal an unaknowledged intent to move away from all analog media and focus exclusively on digital. Reinforcing this perception, Transpac is lowering the monthly connection charge for Channel D from Fr400 to Fr380. At the same time, the price per kilobyte is inching down from 6 to 5.4 centimes, and cost of the adapter unit is being reduced from Fr250 to Fr200. "The 2,400-bps ports will be the last to turn toward Numeris, because their volume of usage is so low," explains Charles de Cognets. "Actually it is 4,800-bps ports, the most commonly used, that probably account for most migration to Channel D. But turnover for the latter will still be less than that for direct connections." The product has yet to seduce more than a relatively small number of clients. According to Transpac, 600 "Channel D" links are in operation today, and all the switching units are VN3-level. Looking ahead to 1994, the enormous contract signed with La Francaise de Jeux for 13,800 connections probably will account for 60 percent of installed capacity. However, the operator claims another big account is to join the ranks of Channel D users between now and late 1994. When first launched, it will be recalled, the service was oriented toward PMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] with between 10 and 500 employees, 70 percent of them Numeris users. But it seems that this type of consumer has not yet acquired the Channel D habit. Split-Speed Failure to understand the existing market partly explains this inertia. Let us recall that as of 1993 the profitable usage threshold is between 10 and 15 megabytes of traffic per month. But what most inhibits Channel D's growth is the profusion of alternative solutions -- private networks based on leased lines or VSAT [variable aperture satellite terminals]. More and more medium-sized enterprises, armed with their data traffic charts and overhead analyses, are calling on Transpac to provide service tailored to their own specifications, leaving public rates and comparison charts to the ordinary consumer. This "enterprise network" service, as Transpac calls it, is based on a specially tailored contract, in which billing depends partly on actual connection costs and utilization charges are invoiced as a pre-agreed lump sum. This practice encourages existing customers to remain loyal to the company, at least pending the advent of serious competition. Assured of a stable domestic market for at least the next few years, Transpac is happily prospecting for new clients in the European market. "We find it easy to make contacts abroad, because we enjoy the technological cachet associated with France Telecom group," notes Charles de Cognets. This export-oriented strategy shows Transpac's ambition to become the biggest European data transmission operator. There are however, a few obstacles to be overcome, namely Infonet (international consortium of X.25 operators) and Info AG (a subsidiary of Germany's telecommunications operator). As for the first obstacle, Transpac and Infonet will need to divide up the market in order not to step on each other's toes in Europe. With regard to the second, everything depends on Deutsche Telekom's acquiring an ownership share in France Telecom (president Marcel Roulet is hoping for 10 percent). Whatever happens on the international scene, a page has been turned. And Transpac has already traded in its French X.25 mantle for a multiservice, European livery.
