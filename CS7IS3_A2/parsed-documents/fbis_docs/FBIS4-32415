FBIS4-32415 "dreeu122__a94035" FBIS-EEU-94-122-A Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 ANNEX The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Albanians Reportedly Boycotting Census Albanians Reportedly Boycotting Census AU2306181794 Tirana ATA in English 1035 GMT 23 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2306181794 Tirana ATA English BFN [Text] Tirana, June 23 (ATA) -- Also on the second day of the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], Albanians did not accept to take part in the census because the minimum indispensable conditions for a normal and unbiased development of this process have not been met. Internal sources report that in the great centres inhabited by Albanians, the latter have not taken part in the census, except for the Macedonians. The chairman of the representatives of the Geneva Council, Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said at a press conference in Skopje that lack of nationality, the main concern of the Albanians of that republic, should not prevent them from taking part in the census, because this is an act which will not verify the Macedonian nationality. According to Mr. Ahrens, persons who have not been granted the nationality but have the old identity card before 1993 may take part in the census. In the meantime, none of the senior Macedonian authorities made any public statement to confirm this. The Party for Democratic for Prosperity [PDP] branches in towns with Albanian population in western Macedonia continue to receive various complaints on obstacles encountered by the Albanians to be included in the census process within schedule. The deputy chairwoman of the PDP centred in Tetove, Nexhibe Palloshi, and the chairman of this party's branch in Skopje, Adem Hyseni, told ATA that in Tetove, Skopje, and its suburbs, over 50 percent of the Albanians have so far been unable to receive the nationality document. In the course of finding compromising facts on the manipulation of the census and denigration of the Albanians, they said that among the persons of Albanian origin who have made the request for nationality since 1993, more than 2,000 have their documents "lost" in the labyrinths of the Macedonian administration. The interior minister of Macedonia, Lubomir Frckovski, stated earlier that the nationality status for 98 percent of the population is guaranteed, but the chairman of the PDP, Arben Xhaferi, in reply to his statement, says that perhaps, Frckovski had said this bearing in mind only the Macedonian population of this republic. Although the number of the Albanian officers in the Macedonia Army is extremely small, only 63 out of 3,700, who are Macedonians, many of them have not yet been able to receive the nationality document, while they are the defenders of the territorial integrity of this republic. The same is also happening with many youths of Albanian nationality who carry out military service in the Macedonian Army. The second day of census in Tetove, Gostivar, Skopje, Struge, Kumanove, Kercove, and Diber closed without the participation in the census of the Albanians who demand reexamination of the law, which they consider disfavouring and of deliberate aims for political manipulation.
