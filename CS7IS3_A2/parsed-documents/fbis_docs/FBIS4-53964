"I've heard that the talks are proceeding gradually...and our basic stance on numerical targets remains unchanged," Fujii told a regular news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. "We (Japan) can't accept anything that is clearly a numerical target," he added. Japanese and U.S. officials are holding informal meetings in Washington since last week in a bid to reopen the "framework" talks which have been at a stalemate since February, when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. Bill Clinton [as received] failed to agree on "objective criteria." Fujii declined to make any predictions or disclose details, saying "negotiations are still under way." While acknowledging news reports that an agreement to reopen the frameworks talks is expected later in the day, Fujii said, "I want to watch for a little while." But he noted that the informal talks are focused on the three priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. On the insurance field, which is overseen by his ministry, Fujii suggested that Japan is not offering any new commitments. "We want to reach an agreement within our voluntary measures," he said, referring to the March market-opening package, including further deregulatory steps and simpler licensing procedures.
