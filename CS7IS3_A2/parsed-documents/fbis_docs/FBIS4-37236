He said that he briefed Musa on the outcome of his talks with the Yemeni parties in Cairo, adding that they discussed the future prospects in Yemen. Ibrahimi said that his talks with the two Yemeni parties last night confirmed that a cease-fire is an urgent matter. He expressed his deep regret that no cease-fire was achieved in Yemen despite the fact that the two sides have accepted and recognized its importance. The UN envoy said that the two Yemeni sides recognize the importance of the existence of a mechanism to supervise and consolidate a cease-fire in Yemen. He noted that no agreement has been reached yet on the formation of such a mechanism to undertake such a duty. He expressed the hope that all the parties will continue their contacts with the brothers in Yemen to urge them to quickly agree on the establishment of this mechanism to enable it to carry out its role. He reiterated that a cease-fire is the basis for achieving any progress in solving the Yemeni crisis. The UN envoy wondered how fighting among brothers can continue like this, stressing that no one approves of the war there. Ibrahimi said that he will leave Cairo tomorrow to submit a report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the two Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said he does not think that such a meeting will be held. He emphasized that Egypt and the United Nations fully agree that a cease-fire must take place and the fighting must stop in Yemen.
