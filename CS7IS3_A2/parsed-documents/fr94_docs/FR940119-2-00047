FR940119-2-00047 FR940119-2-00031 [OPP&hyph;180918; FRL 4754&hyph;2] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide Imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 20,000 acres of peppers to control melon thrips Thrips palmi . The Applicant proposes the use of a new chemical; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180918,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Andrea Beard, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: Floor 6, Crystal Station #1, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703&hyph;308&hyph;8791). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of imidacloprid on peppers to control melon thrips. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. The Applicant states that the melon thrip has developed into a devastating pest in peppers since its discovery in Florida in December 1990. The Applicant states that this pest has spread throughout Florida's lower east coast in less than two years, and is expected to spread throughout the entire state within a few years. The feeding activities of melon thrips cause damage to peppers by stunting growth, crinkling and deformation of leaves, shortening of internodes, and deformation and scarring of fruit. The health of the foliage affects the plant's photosynthetic ability, ultimately affecting yield. Deformation and scarring of the fruit can render the fruit unmarketable. The Applicant states that melon thrips populations must be kept at manageable levels throughout the entire pepper season, and claims that registered alternatives are not providing adequate control. The Applicant states that, if not adequately controlled, this pest could cause yield losses of up to 100 percent, depending upon level of infestation. In a survey of pepper growers in Palm Beach County, yield losses from this pest for the 1992-93 season were 40 to 100 percent, and translated to a dollar value of over $5 million. The Applicant states that if comparable losses were to occur over the entire pepper-growing range, losses could reach over $18 million state-wide. The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.5 lb. active ingredient (a.i.), or 32 fluid oz. of product, per acre with one application allowed, on up to 20,000 acres of peppers. This amounts to a possible total of 10,000 lbs. of a.i., or 5,000 gal. of product. This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on peppers. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
