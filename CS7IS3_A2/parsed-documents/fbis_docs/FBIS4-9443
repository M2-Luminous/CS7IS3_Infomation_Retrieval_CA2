We are absolutely clean in this respect," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov today told Mr. Ian Kenyon, Executive Secretary of the Steering Committee for the setting up of an organization seeking a ban on chemical weapons, who is now visiting Bulgaria. BTA learned this from a Foreign Ministry spokesman. Mr. Daskalov reportedly briefed the guest on an April 11 cabinet decisions providing for the introduction at parliament of a bill on the ratification of the chemical weapons convention. The convention was signed by the foreign ministers of 126 countries, Bulgaria including, at a 1992 Paris meeting, to introduce a ban on the development, production, piling and use of chemical weapons and provide for their destruction. Foreign Minister Daskalov stressed that the forthcoming ratification of this convention is consistent with Bulgaria's interests. Joining the European structures, which is this country's major aspiration, entails accession to all international accords pertaining to the arms control and particularly the control on mass annihilations arms, Mr. Daskalov also said. The talks stressed that Bulgaria has an advanced chemical industry and is therefore a potential producer of chemical weapons, this Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. For this reason, and under the clauses of the effective international agreements, this country is liable to international control. The committee will undertake the training of Bulgarian experts in this sphere. Asked whether the talks touched upon the possible use of chemical weapons by any of the sides involved in the Yugoconflict, this spokesman answered in the negative. However, Mr. Daskalov reportedly expressed Bulgaria's stance, that "being situated in a highly neuralgic area, it is interested in finding a complex solution to the problem pertaining to the ban and destruction of mass annihilation arms".
