During the meeting, in touching on the deadlocked government-level negotiations on the issue of Japan's purchase of U.S.-made auto parts, he asked Kume to come up with a "mid- to long-term purchase expansion" plan. At the same time, he urged that in an effort to increase sales of U.S.-made autos in Japan, Japan should open its automobile dealers' sales network to U.S.-made autos. In response, JAMA Chairman Kume firmly rejected Under Secretary Garten's call for expanding the purchase of U.S-made auto parts in the mid- to long-term by saying: "This call means asking us to set numerical targets for future purchases. Therefore, we cannot make any promise." In this way, Kume clearly indicated a stand of firmly rejecting any requests that lead to the setting of numerical targets. With regard to Garten's call for opening auto dealers' sales network to U.S.-made autos, Kume said: "That is not something in which we, auto manufacturers, should interfere." Under Secretary Garten also met with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation President Yuichi Nakamura and asked him to increase Japan's purchase of U.S.-made auto parts. In reply, President Nakamura, in referring to the Japanese auto industry's goal of increasing the total amount of its purchases of U.S.-made auto parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994, said: "Because of a drastic change in the economic environment, it is difficult to attain our goal ($1.6 billion). Given such a situation, it is impossible to set a numerical target for fiscal year 1995 and after that."
