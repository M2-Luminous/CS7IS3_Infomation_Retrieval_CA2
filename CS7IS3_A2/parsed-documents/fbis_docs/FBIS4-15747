In a statement to CNA, Zhirinovskiy, who arrived here Sunday amid controversy over his anti-French statements, said the 20-year Turkish occupation "is a violation of international law". "The Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus has never been Turkish and Turkey, although a member of the council of Europe, is an aggressive country", he told CNA. The Russian politician, who stressed to CNA that he speaks for the majority of the people of Russia, said "your island must be independent, either an independent state of Cyprus or part of Greece but not a part of Turkey". Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 and despite numerous U.N. resolutions calling for respect for the island's independence, and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, it continues to have 35,000 troops occupying the island's northern third. Referring to Sunday's bombing by NATO forces of Serbian positions, Zhirinovskiy said he opposed war and violence and called on the Council of Europe to take a stand on the matter and indicate its support for aggression or non-aggression. "I will not only protest but I will warn the Council that one day we are going to take responsive measures against those countries which bombed on Sunday", he told CNA. Replying to another question, the Russian politician said he opposed the dispatch of Turkish troops to former Yugoslavia as peacekeepers because, as he explained, "the population there opposes the presence of Turkish troops". Zhirinovskiy dismissed suggestions that the dispatch of Turkish troops was decided to balance the presence of Russian peace-keepers. Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's liberal democratic party, made the statements to CNA on arrival at the Palais de l'Europe, where later this afternoon the parliamentary assembly starts.
