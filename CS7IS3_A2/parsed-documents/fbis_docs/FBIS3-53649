Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq met with Ross this evening and discussed the possibility of an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Golan Heights, including the possibility of a withdrawal in stages and the leasing of land. In the meantime, it has been learned that President al-Asad hinted to the U.S. President that he would not insist on mutual demilitarization. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen updates us: The Americans know how to do things dramatically. The U.S. peace team arrived last night from Geneva and went straight to the prime minister's residence. The briefings continued this morning, first at the Foreign Ministry, and then again at the prime minister's bureau. Dennis Ross is reporting to Israel about a different al- Asad, one who promises personal assistance in gathering information on the MIA's and Ron Arad, and who says openly: I do not believe the Israelis, but I also understand when they do not believe me. Four main points surfaced in Ross' report: Al-Asad is ready to enter into serious negotiations even before a Rabin declaration on a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. It has always been said that al-Asad is in no hurry, but he now believes that time is not in his favor and wants peace. Al-Asad is ready for full peace and normalization, but he will not say so publicly until Rabin says he will withdraw. Security issues were deliberately not discussed in Geneva, they are being left for the negotiations in Washington. Jerusalem says that Rabin is under pressure, since the American are expecting quick answers. The immediate solution is to keep low, something Shim'on Peres supports, but Yosi Beilin does not. [Begin recording] [Peres] I still think that the details and the significance must be verified in negotiations. [Beilin] I think that we are now in a different situation than we were in yesterday or the day before. It is some sort of new era in relations between Syria and us. There is no doubt that based on the U.S. reports, there is now a Syrian commitment on a level that did not exist in the past to make peace with Israel. [end recording] Whichever way we look at it, the Golan Heights are on the negotiating table. [passage omitted] Is the government serious about holding a referendum on the Golan Heights? Minister Hayim Ramon announced that the cabinet will vote against the National Religious Party's Knesset motion on Wednesday to make it mandatory to hold a referendum on the area's future. Despite Deputy Minister Mordekhay Gur's remarks about a referendum, ministers believe that the prime minister will prefer early elections prior to an accord with Syria. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 17 January reports: "Cabinet ministers made it clear that Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur read out the announcement on a referendum from the Knesset podium using the exact words decided on at the prime minister's bureau this morning. The ministers told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that the announcement on a referendum was presented to the Knesset after consultations were held at the prime minister's bureau and the final wording had been approved by the prime minister. Minister Yosi Sarid earlier said that the Knesset announcement on a referendum did not have cabinet approval."] Our party affairs correspondent Yaron Deqel reports on the political map prior to a possible agreement with Syria: Yitzhaq Rabin did not come to the Knesset tonight to talk about the Golan Heights. Cabinet ministers say that the government can only lose by holding a referendum. Even if the government wins the referendum, the cabinet will continue to be based on the same tiny majority in the Knesset. [passage omitted] How will the political parties respond to an agreement which includes a withdrawal? The right wing will definitely be opposed, but the Likud was taken by surprise when three of its Knesset members abstained in the vote recognizing the PLO. The position of United Torah Jewry, which voted for the Camp David accords and against the PLO agreement, is unknown. Most of the SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] faction is opposed to withdrawal, but as usual it will decide at the last minute.
