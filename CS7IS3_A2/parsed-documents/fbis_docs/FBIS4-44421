These changes affect China's population control in two respects, one is their influence on the reproductive subjects, the other their influence on the family planning management system. How does a market economy affect population control through its influence on the reproductive subjects? Establishing a market economic system involves reforming various current economic systems ranging from systems of property right, enterprise and commerce to those of wages, social welfare and protection and education; all of these are being transformed from "planned systems" to "market-oriented systems." In the process of changing to a market system, the family also needs to adapt to demands of the changing market, i.e. the family is becoming a production as well as a consumption unit; like the enterprises, the family unit should also be independent, responsible for its own profits and losses, and be able to rationally deploy resources to gain the maximum benefits. In allocating various resources (including manpower), the family will focus on input and production, capital as well as analysis and comparison of returns on capital. Children represent the family's future manpower resource, so they naturally will be included in the family's economic calculations. The family needs to anticipate the children's needs in the changing market economy, including their numbers and qualities. In the early stages of the market economy, the manpower requirement for economic development emphasized mainly quantity, with relatively low requirement for quality; these circumstances led families to place a relatively high premium on children in quantitative terms, creating a conflict between people's desire for reproduction and the country's need for population control, and as well increasing the difficulties of population control. In the economically more backward areas, this was particularly the case, and there the stronger the demand for manpower in quantitative terms, the more excess births occurred, which in turn led to even more stringent population control measures. This is to say that after a market economic system becomes established, man no longer considers reproduction as serving the sole objective of perpetuating the family line, but sees reproduction mostly as another form of economic behavior to be considered as part of the family's economic decision-making process; in that sense, the reproductive subjects play the role as "economic subjects." When "economic subjects" make a decision on reproduction, they will consider carefully the child's value and the cost of raising the child versus his/her projected benefits; in the early stages of economic development, particularly when a planned economy is being transformed into a market economy, this view is detrimental to population control. A market economy makes the reproductive subjects think more carefully about the family economy and see child-bearing from the standpoint of the family's economic future; in the early period of transformation from one economic system to another, this tendency can lead to strong demands for more children, increasing the difficulties toward reaching the population control goal. This is how the market economy affects population control through its influence on the reproductive subjects. Another and even more important aspect is how a market economy affects population control through its influence on the family planning management system. To begin with, establishing a market economic system means that governmental functions need to undergo basic changes. In a planned economy, government roles and functions controlled the economy by unifying all aspects of planning and taking a command role in the national economy, but under market economic conditions, such government roles and functions will gradually diminish and disappear; government will mainly rely on information from the market to indirectly control and coordinate the market, and government's tactics will also change from exercise of administrative command to reliance on economic measures, laws and regulations. The family planning management system built on the foundation of a planned economy naturally involved government exercising its role under planned economic conditions; under market economic conditions, however, the family planning management system will change, and the control and coordination functions of management will be exercised through various economic measures, laws and regulations. Family planning as a basic policy of China will not change, but its management system and approaches will change to accommodate to demands of the market economy. Moreover, establishing a market economic system implies changing the organizational system. In a planned economy, the organizational system consisted of separate sub-systems operating under an overall system of administrative authorities, i.e. centralized management going from the Center to the province-city-prefecture level, then to the counties and villages. The organization system under market economic conditions consists of sub-systems of companies, groups and other organizations in between these two categories, such as trading centers, accounting firms, etc. including systems of finance, taxation and statistics. Changes in these sub-systems will lead to corresponding changes in the family planning organizational system; that is to say family planning can be one of the organizational systems in a market economy; and the former centrally managed family planning system will either diminish in effectiveness or, after transformation, become more effective along with other organizational systems. Under conditions of market economy, we should consider carefully the question of coordinating family planning work with the work of other organizational systems. In addition, the establishment of market economy requires a series of laws, regulations and policies, and this will mean revising and changing the current laws and regulations based on a planned economy, and drafting new ones which will accommodate and support the market economy. Family planning polices and regulations are not yet perfected; under conditions of market economy, we also need to address the question how best to coordinate and adjust family planning policies and regulations with those dealing with other aspects of the economy. Finally, establishing a market economy requires people changing their thinking and accepting basic principles and demands of the market of open and fair competition, and freedom and equality; economic activities will no longer be subject to government's command control but will obey the market. This will mean breaking up the pattern of lower-level authorities obeying the higher-level, which in terms obeys the center; and "red-tag documents" will diminish in importance. In terms of future population control, how family planning can be coordinated and adjusted with the above changes is a serious challenge, and should be an important agenda item for study. That the market economy poses a serious and multifaceted challenge to population control is therefore obvious. [passage omitted]
