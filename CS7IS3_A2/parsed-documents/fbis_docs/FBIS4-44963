This visit expressed the absolute support of these patriarchs for the Iraqi people in their confrontation of the unfair blockade that has been imposed on them. ALIF BA' met a number of their graces representing the Eastern Catholic Churches who spoke to ALIF BA' about their visit's mission and results. Patriarch Stifanus II Ghattas of the Coptic Church and St. Mark's missionary in Cairo, affirmed at the beginning of his talk his church's absolute support of and standing by the faithful Iraqi people and leadership. He said: "The visit of a delegation of Eastern Catholic patriarchs at this time has as a goal reinforcing brotherly relations and strengthening cooperation with and support to the Iraqi people. The visit further affirms the support of the Eastern Catholic Churches to the struggling Iraqi people in their persistent confrontation of the circumstances of the tyrannical economic blockade, which was imposed on Iraq through the use of force and arrogance by the unfair powers that control the world. All religions, blessed heavenly doctrines, international laws, and religious institutions condemn this blockade." He further expressed his deep confidence in the capability of the Iraqi people to overcome this crisis saying: "We join the patient Iraqi people and the world liberals in raising our voices to demand the lifting of the vicious blockade so that Iraqis could meet their human needs." His Grace Archbishop Bulus Emil Sa'adah, the deputy general patriarch of the Maronite Church in Lebanon, expressed his happiness at visiting Iraq and affirmed that this visit was one of support and love for the brotherly Iraqi people who have faith in the one God. Archbishop Sa'adah said: "In Isaiah, Chapter 52 tells us about this humanitarian approach when it states: `How great are the steps taken by those who herald peace, righteousness, and salvation.'" He said: "The people of Iraq will overcome all suffering thanks to the President-leader Saddam Husayn's leadership and also thanks to the people's unity and solidarity as well as their rallying around their faithful leadership." He also mentioned the brotherly Lebanese people who suffered from civil war, yet, who, thanks to their national solidarity and unity, could contain and stop the war and attain peace and security. Archbishop Sa'adah further said: "We pray to the One and Only God to have mercy upon the martyrs and place them into heaven as they have sacrificed with their scented blood and pure souls for the nation's pride and the people's dignity." He further affirmed that: "The tyrannical course of injustice was very short-lived because this invasion of Iraq was doomed to fail and these vicious imperialistic plots to go with the wind; Iraqis would manage to reconstruct what the malicious aggressors have destroyed with self-help and with a speed that would call for admiration and impart happiness to the soul." His Grace Yuhanna Butrus 18 Kasparyan from the Armenian Catholic Church in Lebanon saluted the Iraqi leadership, most importantly President Saddam Husayn, for the good care given to all sects and religions that enabled them to practice their rites and rituals freely and securely. He described the continued imposition of the blockade on the Iraqi people, men and women, of all ethnic groups, religions and sects, as an outrageous violation of human rights and a vicious aggression on heavenly legislation and God's commandments, both of which call for respecting and revering humans and working seriously for their comfort and happiness. His Grace Patriarch Mishal al-Sabbah from the Jerusalem Latin Church in Jordan prayed to the Almighty God to lift the injustice and tyranny that the Iraqi people suffer because of the continued imposition of the worst blockade in human history, which has been imposed on 20 million people including the elderly and the children, the sick, and the healthy. He called upon all philanthropic organizations as well as on those peace-loving personalities who support people's freedom and their right to a secure and dignified life, to do their utmost in order to put pressure on the governments of the great nations, the United Nations and the Security Council, in order to immediately and completely lift all kinds of sanctions, so that the Iraqi people could be provided with all their basic needs. His Grace George al-Murr, the Amman Archbishop for the Royal Roman Catholic Church, described the crime that the forces of the evil thirty-nation alliance committed against al-'Amiriyah shelter as the most atrocious incident that he had ever witnessed. In this incident, people were killed because of a deliberate crime; innocent souls were delivered up to God in order to complain about the injustice of humans to each other so that this would represent a loud cry of outrage and protest against the barbarism and aggression as well as against aggression and violence. As for the Assyrian Church in Lebanon, His Grace Mikha'il al-Jamil, the deputy patriarch general, in response to the wicked people's barbarism and aggression, described the rehabilitation achievements, specially in the areas of construction and development, as a real victory for the values of justice, goodness and peace. He said: God Above has blessed the Iraqi efforts, be it those of the Iraqi people or that of its leadership; God has granted these struggling and patient people the will and capability to reconstruct all that the aggressor destroyed in the most atrocious aggression against civilization and development; we are very glad to have seen these achievements. He further expressed his confidence in the capability of the great Iraqi people to overcome all calamities and difficulties because they have an enlightened leadership that has deep faith and a strong relentless will. The Iraqis also had access to an accumulation of inherited culture dating back to more than 6,000 years. His Holiness Father Sannun Andrawus, member of the delegation's secretariat, director of the Voice of Love radio station, and the public relations official, said: "Since the end of war and the silencing of canons, the cultural and intellectual struggle started because the Arab world currently faces a media struggle. It is, therefore, that the responsibility of the media delegation, which comprises 20 persons representing 10 press agencies and radio and television stations, is to portray the sad situation caused by the continued unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. Heavenly religions as well as the laws and customs of civilization could not understand the rationale of this state of affairs and human history has not known the like of it. By portraying this picture, the media delegation hopes that the international conscience could feel--however slightly--this great people's suffering."
