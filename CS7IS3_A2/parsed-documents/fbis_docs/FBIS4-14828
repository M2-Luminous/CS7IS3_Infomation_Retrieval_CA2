Stop, people! Brothers! Fathers! Men and sons! Give your land peace! Give your mothers, sisters, and daughters peace! Give your peoples a chance to be constructive! The mountain people have always been respected for their wisdom, honesty, dignity, and tolerance. You have lived side by side and together found a way out of the most difficult of situations while respecting one another. Have the mountain people really lost these qualities today? We appeal to the women of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. Mothers! We ask you to hold your sons back from the awful brink of going on with interethnic war. There have been enough wars and devastation! There have been enough tears and suffering! Your land can no longer bear so much pain. It will curse everyone who sheds people's blood. We appeal to you, veterans! Esteemed wise veterans! You traveled the terrible roads of the Great Patriotic War under fire. You drained the cup of grief. You have learned the wisdom of life. So stand up straight and bar the way to a war that may destroy the land of your forebears and annihilate your sons! We appeal to the clergy, to all believers. God gave all people the same right to life. And no one has a right to violate the main commandment in the Koran and the Bible -- do not kill! Help cool hot heads and calm people's hearts. It is time to start the work of mutual reconciliation and forgiveness, remembering that it is not they who are to blame for this tragedy but the totalitarian Stalinist regime and politicians of various stamps. It is intolerable for ancient peoples to still be political hostages. You cannot live in the past. There has been enough destruction. You must revive and construct your homeland. And everyone needs peace to do that. Peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia! We believe in your wisdom and common sense. We support you in the cause of reconciliation and construction. [Signed] Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council deputies [Dated] Moscow, 17 March 1994 No. 86-1 SF
