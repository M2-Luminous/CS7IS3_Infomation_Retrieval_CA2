FR940817-0-00074 FR940817-0-00018 From the regulatory perspective, the statutory goal of providing an adequate milk supply for each market is furthered by coordinating milk prices among the system of orders. Based upon the cost of moving milk, Class I differentials are established so that the price of milk at any plant location does not exceed the cost of transporting milk from supply areas. Proper alignment of milk prices between nearby adjacent markets is necessary so that handlers located in more deficit milk producing areas can attract a supply of milk. The Blend Price Handlers in each order account for milk in Class I, Class II, and Class III uses at the minimum respective class price established under each order. The blend price that applies to producers is calculated by dividing the total pounds of producer milk into the total value of all milk at class prices used by handlers regulated under an order. Accordingly, the blend price is a weighted average price that, because all milk of an order is part of the price calculation, assures that each producer shares in both the benefits of supplying the fluid milk market and the burden of the reserve or surplus milk supplies associated with each order. Thus, the blend price incorporates regional and national measures: it is a measure of supply and demand conditions in each order as well as a measure of national supply and demand conditions that are reflected in the class prices that are based on the M&hyph;W price. Blend prices increase or decrease as class prices increase or decrease in response to changes in national supply and demand conditions. Also, the blend price in each market increases or decreases as the Class III use in each market decreases or increases. Thus, blend prices reflect all of the economic factors that affect the supply of and demand for milk and dairy products that are required to be considered under the pricing criteria of the AMAA. Producers make their production and marketing adjustments on the basis of changes in blend prices and differences in blend prices among orders. It is not uncommon for supply areas of individual orders to expand or contract in response to blend price changes over time. Also, because milk is free to move to handlers regulated under different orders, it is not uncommon for milk to shift from one order to another in response to blend price differences that result from changes in supply and demand conditions under different orders. USDA's Supply-Demand Analysis A supply and demand analysis was conducted by USDA to consider the Class I differential portion of the Class I prices. This analysis was based on the hearing record, exceptions, and comments, and was a proper and sufficient economic review of dairy market performance. By focusing on milk market performance measures, USDA's analysis directly addressed the statutory goal of ensuring adequate milk supplies to meet the needs of each federal milk marketing area. The examination conducted by USDA reviewed the level of Class III utilization for each market area. This market performance measure is appropriate because of the basic underlying accounting definitions and regulations in all federal milk orders. In general, each marketing order defines producer milk receipts as all Grade A milk that is associated with (i.e., used in) the particular order market. The producer receipts may be from dairy farms in or close to the defined ``marketing area'', or it may come from dairy farms that are located hundreds of miles away. The key identifying factor is that the milk is associated with the market as evidenced by its receipt by handlers regulated under that particular order. Specific market definitions also describe milk used for Class I, Class II, and Class III uses based on the end products made from such milk. The standard accounting identity applicable for all federal milk market orders requires that the total amount of milk used in Class I, Class II, and Class III products equals the total amount of producer milk receipts associated with each market order. The class utilization percentages are determined by dividing the amount of milk used in each respective class by the amount of producer receipts for the market. In this manner, the class utilization percentage represents how much milk is being used in each class of product relative to the total volume of milk associated with a specifically defined geographic Federal milk marketing area. Markets generally function by serving Class I demand first, then meeting Class II demands, and finally utilizing the residual volume of producer receipts as Class III. In this manner, the volume of milk utilized in Class III is an indication of the surplus, or reserve, milk level available to meet any supplemental needs of the Class I and Class II market. During certain periods of the year, the level of milk production is low while the demand for Class I and Class II milk is high. In these deficit periods, it may be necessary to use all milk regularly associated with the market to meet the Class I demand. A certain portion of the milk supply in most markets also is needed to meet regular Class II milk demands; consequently, a reserve milk supply of 30 to 35 percent (i.e., Class III percent utilization) is not excessive to ensure that sufficient milk is available in the market at all times to satisfy Class I and II demand. The Court's opinion suggests that the Secretary's reliance on producer milk in his analysis of whether Class I prices meet the statutory price considerations required by Section 608c(18) does not consider milk supplies available outside the marketing area (Opinion, p.20). In fact, producer milk and, more specifically, Class III utilization does incorporate the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area because, regardless of its origin, any milk received by a regulated handler in a marketing area is, by definition, producer milk. Thus, the Class III utilization of producer milk is an important indicator of federal order supply and demand conditions.
