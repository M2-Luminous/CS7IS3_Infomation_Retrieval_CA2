Only two persons who voted for Shumeyko do not belong in this apparat-administrative team. In the meantime, commenting on the results of voting in a conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, Yegor Stroyev, head of the Orel Oblast administration and member of the Federation Council, remarked that "the senators have made a "Solomonic decision." They offered no cause for a standoff between the Federation Council and the president. But today, to make the Federation Council efficient, Shumeyko should propose members of the opposition as his deputies. He, in fact, will have to solve the dilemma: disobedient deputies versus an obedient house or vice versa."
