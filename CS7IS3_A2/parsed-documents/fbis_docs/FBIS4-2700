The cases show that, though initial successes have been achieved, the crackdown on corruption is an urgent as well as a long-term battle, as was said by Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin not long ago. Any relaxation in the fight against graft will nullify all the achievements that have so far been made. More than 60,000 people were reportedly indicted on charges of corruption last year. Fifty-four percent of the cases involved bribery and 24 percent involved embezzlement. And unless corruption is effectively checked, it is liable to spread like a virus through the body politic. The virus is particularly rampant at the moment as the country moves from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, which is at its primary stage. The transition means that there are many administrative loopholes which may be exploited. Corruption, with its promise of easy, big profits, can only result in the downfall of weak-willed ranking officials and public servants and tarnish the image of the government. The fate of Shen Taifu, president of the Beijing Great Wall Machinery and Electronics Group, and Li Xiaoshi, former vice- minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, is a case in point. And now both of them have been dealt with by the law. All government functionaries should learn a salutary lesson and refrain from trying their luck in defiance of Party discipline and State law. History shows that serious corruption can jeopardize the State and even lead it to destruction. But the sad fact that there has been an increse in disclosed corruption cases as the country turns to a socialist market economy cannot be blamed on the policy of reform itself. On the contrary, the reforms aim to eliminate corruption for good in the long run. And in the meantime, the continued fight against corruption will ensure the implementation of the reforms and guarantee the country's opening to the outside world. The battle is also of crucial importance to the setup of socialist market economy. And, as the war against corruption continues, there is an urgent need for strengthened legislation to close the loopholes for potential offenders. Though the majority of government officials and public servants are honest, the few, like Li Xiaoshi, have taken advantage of the power vested in them. And the stable environemnt which is necessary to reform and development can be undermined by corruption. The crackdown on graft is a war we cannot afford to lose. Public support and governmental determination are essential, if this arduous and prolonged war is to be won. The Party and government have shown great determination by taking concrete measures and they have enjoyed public support because people at large intensely resent corrupt officials and civil servants who prey on our society. Long-term plans should be worked out to ensure the operation's continued success. The crackdown is already a major item on this year's Party and State agendas. And the major cases of corruption that have so far been exposed should be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. Only thus can we ensure a clean government, which will lead this country to prosperity.
