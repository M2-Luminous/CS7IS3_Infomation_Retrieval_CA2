Police this week dispatched a confidential communique to the ANC saying that they had been told by an unnamed source that former ANC Youth League [ANCYL] president Peter Mokaba would be assassinated by disaffected members of the league. Police named one of the alleged assassins, saying their information suggested that he and 10 of his friends planned to assassinate Mokaba. "The reason for the planned action, according to the anonymous caller, is that Peter Mokaba `sold out' members of the ANCYL to the police," the police communique says. Information relating to threats against Mokaba's life comes just days after General Constand Viljoen is said to have volunteered information about a plot to assassinate ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa. Rapu Molekane, former deputy general secretary of the ANC PWV [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] region and current candidate in the regional legislature, told SUNDAY NATION that the organisation had received information about the alleged planned assassination of Mokaba. "Mokaba knows about his plan," said Molekane. "As in the past, we are treating the information very seriously". However, Molekane said the ANCYL investigations had not been able to establish whether in fact there was a person such as the one named in the police warning to the ANC. "No one in the youth league knows such a person," he said. According to the police, the alleged assassin is said to be attached to the Boksburg East Branch of the youth league. But SUNDAY NATION's enquiries revealed that the branch did not have anyone that answered to the name contained in the police warning. "Anyone can be an anonymous caller," Molekane said. "We do not know whether this is simply more disinformation from the police to try and cause confusion and panic in the movement," he said. "Although we welcome any information from the police, we cannot trust everything they say." He said Mokaba was not surprised by this information since there had been other assassination plots and attempts on his life since the death of the SACP [South African Communist Party] general secretary Chris Hani. Two weeks prior Hani's murder, police issued a statement alleging that Hani had hired people to rob a bank and subsequently failed to give them their share and as a result, they were planning to kill him. ANC legal chief Matthew Phosa said in Hani's case, the police statement was clearly aimed at creating a smoke-screen for the Rightwing to assassinate Hani. He said this could be deduced from the fact that the gangsters allegedly waiting to kill Hani were nowhere at the scene of Hani's killing. "The latest information smacks of a similar classical scheme to assassinate either Mokaba or any of the ANC leaders in order to derail the election process said Phosa. Others in the ANC believe that the recent information about assassination plots may well be aimed at trying to sow confusion and panic in the ranks of the ANC leadership and that there might well be a plot to kill someone. Confusion and panic would make the task of the assassin much easier, ANC leaders said. They also point out that it is interesting that attempts were being made to revive rumours of Mokaba's alleged role as a police spy. These rumours first emerged in 1990, soon after the unbanning of the ANC. But so far, no irrefutable proof has been brought forward to support the rumours.
