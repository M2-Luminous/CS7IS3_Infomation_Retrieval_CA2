Addressing media and press correspondents on the results of these meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister, said: [Begin recording] First, one of the most important results is that the Jordanian and Israeli sides were able -- through the meetings held in connection with the meeting of the tripartite economic committee -- to reach a detailed agenda on the issue of the Jordanian territory. Within this framework, it has been agreed to form a committee whose task is to come to the region to demarcate the Jordanian borders in accordance with what was agreed in the joint agenda signed last September. Thus, we have reiterated a basic principle; namely, Jordanian borders will turn from cease-fire borders to internationally-recognized borders. This affirms Jordan's territorial integrity, thereby ending any ambitions toward these territories and safeguarding the Jordanian entity. We, of course, agreed on two basic principles: The first principle is that we should return to the [British] mandate agreement on border demarcation; and second, these borders must be demarcated on the ground. The second important dimension reached is related to water. We know that the issue of water is a very sensitive issue for Jordan. It is also directly linked with the rights of Jordanian sovereignty. Israel used to take from the Jordanian waters in the Jordan and al-Yarmuk Rivers; that is, it takes more than its share agreed on in the international and regional agreements organizing this relationship. Therefore, another committee will be formed to fairly redistribute water in harmony with Jordan's rights in this regard. Also, it has been agreed that the Jordan Valley project will be viewed as a full-blown project, according to which there will be discussions for developing its infrastructure. Big projects that will be discussed later will be launched there in the future. That is, we have endorsed the launching of some studies that will pave the way for the launching of big development projects in the Jordan Valley. You may recall, in particular, that the most important project in this regard is the desalination project, or the project of extending a canal linking the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. This project is a Jordanian plan and proposal in the first place, and came in response to Israeli plans to build a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. Regarding the talks held within the context of the tripartite committee, it has been agreed that the U.S. side will prepare a paper on the Jordan Valley, and the projects planned to be carried out there. However, this effort will be confined to the realm of studies at present. This is because the implementation of such projects is unthinkable before an agreement is reached on the issue of borders. With respect to economic issues, particularly in light of the agreement signed between the PLO and the Israeli side on the issue of banking and trade, the Jordanian side explained the impact of this agreement on the Jordanian economy. This is because this agreement somewhat restricts the freedom to export Jordanian commodities to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israeli side agreed that it is possible to expand the prospects for Jordanian exports to the Palestinian territories. Additionally, it has been agreed that Jordan will be informed of any future plans or proposals, let us say, to issue a Palestinian currency so that Jordan may adopt measures that could protect its currency. Jordan will be given sufficient time to take such measures. According to the agenda signed, it transpired that some issues can be discussed at the trilateral level. That is why a Jordanian-Palestinian-Israeli economic committee was called on to meet to discuss some issues at the trilateral level, to discuss them and resolve them appropriately. In a nutshell, these are the most important results reached. In my view, these results are very important for Jordan. This is because they protect and contribute to safeguarding Jordan's identity, demographic makeup, and territorial integrity. [end recording]
