He made a statement to our "Newsreel" program after his return. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You have now visited Paris and Bonn within a week. Does it mean that these two countries are the most important European countries for Hungary right now? [Boross] Well, they are two determining powers, members of an alliance, and are very important for Hungary. I do not think it is a coincidence that I visited these two capitals. Germany represents a decisive force within the EU [European Union], and the fact that it has undertaken to support us in this way means that our application [for full EU membership] will be received favorably. [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Chancellor Kohl referred to the intention to put on the EU agenda the ways in which new members may be admitted; in other words they want to hold negotiations in this respect. How do they see the terms? [Boross] Well, a longer period of preparation and negotiation faces us, because the Hungarian economy must become suitable for admission into the EU. [passage omitted] It must be added that there is extraordinarily great interest toward Hungary. As a matter of fact, I heard praise about the Hungarian economy's ability to absorb capital.
