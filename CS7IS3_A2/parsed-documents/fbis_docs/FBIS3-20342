In addition," Leotard writes, "the government believes that aeronautics programs are a top priority. Despite current financial and budget difficulties, initial judgments by the prime minister on the military programming law will allow us to continue defense modernization." Speaking to the National Assembly's Defense Committee, Jean-Francois Bigay, president of the Eurocopter group, pointed out that "the total cost of the NH-90 program would amount to ECU1.376 billion," more than 9 billion French francs [Fr]. French participation comes to 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion by Eurocopter and Fr3.9 billion by the state). "The unit cost of the NH-90 helicopter will be Fr85 million" for the Land Army version, "and Fr135 million" for the Navy version, Mr. Bigay specified. The four countries participating in the program (France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Italy) have an overall requirement for 726 helicopters, while the non-European export market is estimated at approximately 500 "machines." The program is currently severely threatened by military budget cuts in the four participating countries.
