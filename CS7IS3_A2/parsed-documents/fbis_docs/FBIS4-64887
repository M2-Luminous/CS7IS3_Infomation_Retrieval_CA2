Delcroix does not support economic compensations. If such compensations nevertheless continue to play a role in the future, then their extra cost should not be pushed onto the Army. The minister made these comments during a speech in Hasselt on Saturday [7 May]. "Contracts including compensations turn out 10 to 25 percent more expensive," Delcroix said. Moreover, decisionmaking procedures which take account of defense issues only are quicker. The minister is opting for a system of two tenders, with and without compensations. Compensations should at no time be an obstacle to decisionmaking within the Army. The compensations system, which has existed for decades, has been viewed in an unfavorable light since the Agusta affair. "A parliamentary committee is investigating the system, but apparently the MP's have not sorted things out," the minister said. "Some committee members appear to be doing a big U-turn. From the original position that `compensations are synonymous with corruption' to `compensations must remain possible and an MP must be able to intervene for his region,'" Delcroix continued. The minister said "it was unacceptable that Army contracts should take place only because an economic benefit was attached to them." As defense minister, he did not support compensations. They slow down decisionmaking procedures and defense no longer has the resources to be an instrument for economic development. "That is an area for the regions par excellence. If Economic Affairs or the regions believe their own industry must be promoted, then it must subsidize the price difference. In addition, compensations must be oriented toward the future and not be a short-term emergency measure," the minister said, adding other demands. Compensations should not end with the delivery of the last item ordered, should enable high-tech investments, give access to markets which were otherwise unreachable and be open to verification.
