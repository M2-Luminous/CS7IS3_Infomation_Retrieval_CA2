[quote from playwright Ion Luca Caragiale]. The rulers do not accept that the time has come for them to either retire or reform. They are clinging to power for the sake of being able to do their deals while they enjoy immunity and for the sake of power in itself. The ruling party is at the stage of total failure: Failure at the national level, through a disastrous government; failure in the negotiations with its satellites, which want to partake in the government, but the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] realizes that, if it ever allows this to happen, it will be submitted to huge pressure from abroad; failure in the negotiations with the opposition, because the PDSR does not want to make any concessions and, as usual, it is not playing fairly (How serious can a political partner be, when it reshuffles the government at the Cotroceni Presidential Palace while it is engaged in negotiations with other parties for a new government formula?); and failure in its own strategy, since it cannot even reform itself for the sake of appearances. In this situation, it is hard to avoid a collapse into total parliamentary incoherence. The satellite parties may withdraw their support for the ruling party or a group might split from the PDSR. Anyhow, if any of this were to happen, the legislative branch will enter into a conflict with the current government and government program. It becomes increasingly more clear that we will have early elections, which the PDSR fears so much. In the case of elections, the confrontation will be between several political forces represented in Parliament. The extraparliamentary parties, except for the National Liberal Party [PNL], have been left only with their names. An analysis of the likely political spectrum of the future does not reveal any spectacular developments. The Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR] has taken its leave from a political position of rank. It tried to save itself through a merger with the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR], which was a rather poor move per se, as the PUNR is going downhill. Nothing will probably be left of the PDAR in Parliament, other than the picturesque presence of [PDAR President] Surdu, who will run on other electoral lists. The Greater Romania Party [PRM] can only rely on the readers of ROMANIA MARE, whose number has obviously decreased. This party will find it hard to win enough votes for another parliamentary representation, unless it allies itself with other political groupings. The PUNR is moving toward a fiasco. What damaged it a lot was its bombastic jingoist attitude, unsupported by a coherent program, and, of course, the Caritas affair. The replacement of some of its eccentric leaders might save it, to a certain extent. We do not believe that the popularity of the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] is growing at such a dizzying pace, as it claims. However, it has managed to secure for itself a certain segment of the electorate. It might start growing if the party renounces [PSM President] Ilie Verdet and other leaders from the old guard, and if [PSM Vice President] Adrian Paunescu's temper could be somehow restrained and his skills at organizing an electoral campaign properly exploited. The Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] is relatively stable. Some of its electorate -- although not too large a part of it -- might nevertheless be drawn (by force) toward the ruling party. Anyhow, the PD(FSN) cuts quite a sympathetic figure, thanks to its able and young leaders. The PDSR is right when it fears the elections, since it is burdened by the catastrophic Vacaroiu governance. Theoretically, President Iliescu cannot interfere and support this party. We are sure that he will do so anyway; but, even so, he cannot help much, since he himself is registering a decrease in popularity. The grouping best situated for the elections is the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]. The people want change, even though they do not hope for miracles, and they perceive the CDR as the political force capable of making this change. One should also not forget the personality of Coposu [president of the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party, PNTCD], which is increasingly winning over the electorate. As one can see, the major confrontation will be between the PDSR and the CDR. Of course, the PDSR will employ all its battle arsenal -- promises, threats, unfair electoral campaign, and particularly fraud -- since it is the ruling party that will organize the elections. In this respect, the CDR should take protective measures and not rest on its laurels before it has them. Maybe the ruling party will realize at the last moment the extent of the damage that early elections at this time might cause, given the general misery prevailing in the country. Hopefully, it will engage in serious negotiations for a change that cannot be delayed any more. Otherwise, to the ballot, folks! Unless, of course, we are so hungry that we are going to faint on our way to the voting stations....
