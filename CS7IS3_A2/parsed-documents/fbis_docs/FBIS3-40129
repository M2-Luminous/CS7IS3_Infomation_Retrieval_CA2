Below, I will discuss several views on these topics based on the spirit of the provincial CPC committee's study. I. Dialectically Analyzing the Situation, Using Summarization of Experiences as Basis for Further Strengthening of Confidence About Acceleration of Development Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory about building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism and the spirit of the Fourteenth CPC Committee, during 1993 the people of the entire province emancipated thinking, rallied spirits, and seized opportunities. Enthusiasm for accelerating development runs very high, and reform and opening to the outside world, and modernization have entered a new stage. Throughout the province, the political situation is stable, society is moving ahead, and the economy is running well. In reviewing the year's work, the following matters are of rather profound significance: First is taking a firm grip on the crucial matter of emancipating thinking to change ways of thinking, promoting a transformation of ideas, and spurring work overall. The 8th Plenary Session of the 5th Provincial CPC Committee convened in 1992 highlighted the emancipation of thinking to change ways of thinking. It linked ideological realities with work realities, suggested the need to intensify study to comprehend Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important remarks and the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, maintained the unity of the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth from facts, changed attitudes about resignation to poverty, insulation and conservatism, and traditional planned economy concepts as well as isolated and lopsided ways of thinking. It increased awareness of the need to forge ahead, awareness of the need to innovate, market economy awareness, and dialectical awareness of being responsible for the overall situation. The entire province, from top to bottom, conscientiously implemented the spirit of this conference. Their understanding of the theory of building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism and the basic line of the party deepened; their awareness of the need for wholehearted attention to the economy increased; their horizons broadened and they tried more methods. After the Central Committee prepared a policy for intensifying and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, all levels and all government departments proceeded from realities to gain a profound understanding of the importance of and necessity for Central Committee policies. They fully realized that correct macroeconomic regulation and control is indispensable to the acceleration of development and for positive solution to existing problems. At the same time, they clearly understood and acted on the favorable opportunities that the Central Committee's policies provide an agricultural and resources-rich province such as ours. They diligently studied how to develop in a situation of intensified and improved macroeconomic regulation and control, both overcoming the abuses of the "large common pot" of the traditional planned economy system in which everyone benefitted no matter their contribution. They also guarded against the problems stemming from decentralization in a market economy, thereby enabling the economy of the whole province to maintain a both rapid and good development momentum. Second is resolutely putting into effect the idea that "development is the only assurance, making every effort to seize opportunities to accelerate development." Working from a foundation of further emancipation of thinking, the 9th Plenary Session of the 5th Provincial CPC Committee convened in April. It stressed the need to cherish and seize the favorable opportunity provided by Comrade Xiaoping's important remarks and the spirit of the 14th Party Congress to further clarify battle objectives in an effort to open up new economic growth points and to move Anhui's economy a new step upward. Bearing in mind the goal of rural villages attaining a comfortable well-off standard of living, the session conducted a lengthy discussion to clarify specific criteria for a comfortable well-off standard of living at all levels. Consequently, a comfortable well-off standard of living became even more a real activity of rural cadres and masses. A number of economic growth points having rather strong vitality are in process of taking shape rapidly. A number of infrastructure projects in the communications and transportation fields, as well as energy, and raw and processed materials projects have been completed and have gone into production one after another. The province's overall economic strength has increased markedly. One might say that 1993 has been the year of most rapid growth and best development since the advent of reform and opening up to the outside world. Third is maintenance of the intensification of reform as a means of solving contradictions and problems in moving ahead to win positive results. In the cities, the emphasis is on the key task of transforming the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, continuation of the implementation of the "Regulations," diligent transformation of government functions, more rapid straightening out of equity relationships, and boldly running pilot projects on various forms of operation including state ownership with civilian operation, public ownership with private operation, leasing, mergers and annexations, and bankruptcies from which fairly good results have been obtained. In particular, fairly rapid progress has been made in promoting the joint-stock system. Rural villages have seen the widespread application of the township and town enterprise joint-stock cooperation system. Pilot projects for reform of the land and household registration control system have been actively run to encourage and support the shift into non-agricultural industries of surplus rural manpower. Major efforts have been put into the fostering of rural markets to improve rural socialized services. These measures have played a positive role in promoting restructuring of the rural economy, in increasing peasant income, and in improving the basic position of agriculture. At the same time, definite advances have also been made in associated reforms of the commodity circulation system, social security, housing, and medical care to lay the groundwork for solving deep-seated incongruities in economic life. Fourth is unflagging attention throughout to the building of the party and the building of spiritual civilization, greater efforts beginning to be made in both regards. In organizing party building and the building of spiritual civilization, personnel turnover tasks were completed smoothly at all levels. A large number of young cadres in the prime of their life, who are politically steadfast, and who have done yeoman service are moving up to new leadership positions to infuse new vitality into leadership teams. They will help the revamping of grassroots level organizations and the training of grassroots cadres, and they will improve the fighting capabilities of grassroots level organizations. In the building of ideological work style, the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism has been diligently organized, and further concrete measures have been proposed for improving the ideological work style of leadership teams. Ideas have been formulated to improve party style and to build clean government, and solid work has been done in carrying out a battle against corruption. Since the second meeting of the Central Disciplinary Committee, in particular, acting in accordance with Central Committee demands and realities in our own province, emphasis has been placed on four tasks, namely on county-level and above leadership cadre honesty and self-discipline, the investigation and punishment of large and important cases, the eradication of the several unhealthy tendencies that the masses most dislike, and eliminating the diversion of public funds and the use of public funds to send sons, daughters, and close friends to college. Preliminary results have been achieved in these regards. Thanks to these efforts, the ideological style and the work style of leadership cadres has been changed anew. In the building of spiritual civilization, ideological indoctrination about reform and opening up to the outside world has been intensified, efforts made to focus everyone's attention on accelerating development, the entire province, from top to bottom further forming a powerful cooperative force for wholehearted development of the economy. To stir to the full the enthusiasm of all quarters, all levels have made a great effort to protect the rights and interests of the masses, and to safeguard political tranquility and social stability. They have particularly concentrated their energies on effective measures for solving some glaring problems about which the reaction of the public has been intense, such as excessive peasant burdens, delays in payment of teachers wages, and poor social order in some places. At the same time, we must clearly realize that many difficulties and problems continue in our work at the present time. We must give them a lot of attention and take positive actions to solve them. In particular, we must solve them conscientiously through the intensification of reform. II. Use of Reform as the Main Theme in Accelerating the Building of the Basic Framework for a Socialist Market Economy System To Move the Province's Overall Strength a Step Upward Seizing opportunities, accelerating development, and concentrating energies on improving the building of the economy is our steadfast policy. Today, Anhui is at a crucial period in accelerating development. With hard work, it will succeed; if we are lax, it will fail. We must clench our teeth, press on without letup, and seize opportunities to move ahead. So long as quality is good, markets exist, and a return can be made, we should work at full tilt, doing all possible to seize the initiative. Of course, our advocacy of faster development most certainly does not mean "arbitrary uniformity." The differences in economic development between one region and another have been shaped by history, and the conditions for development are not entirely the same. Places having the conditions for rapid development must accelerate development. Where conditions do not exist for the time being, we must not insist on competing, muich less resort to deception about development. However, a maximum effort must be made to create the conditions for gradual acceleration of development. There positively must be no blaming of objective conditions to cover up work shortcomings and failure to try. At the same time, we must realize that acceleration of development requires new approaches, genuinely shifting to a new course in which restructuring and improving returns are the centerpieces. The coming year is a year of all-out promotion of reforms. Numerous reform measures of great intensity will be inaugurated. These reforms will mean a readjustment of interests in many quarters. Complex situations and problems will be faced. Doing effective work in every regard will not only have a bearing on the smooth promotion of each reform, but on the stability of the entire society as well. CPC committees and governments at all levels must diligently study the Central Committees various reform policies, thoroughly grasp their spirit, keep abreast of favorable conditions in an overall way, make full preparations, and do a solid job of carrying them out in an active and well-founded way. In addition, we must create conditions actively through our own efforts and effective work, work hard in the pattern of new interest relations that reform has brought, seek out greater development opportunities, and accelerate our advance. The overall guiding thought and requirements for work in the coming year are: Taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for the building of a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism as a guide, diligent implementation of the spirit of the 14th Party Congress and of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee; adherence to work in several directions at the same time, further emancipation of thinking, seizing opportunities, accelerating the pace of reforms in building a socialist market economy system, widening opening up to the outside world, maintaining a good momentum of rapid economic development even while ensuring that quality is higher than in 1993 and that returns will be better in 1994, promoting advance of overall provincial strength to a new stage, and raising work in every field to a new level. 1. Focus on the Building of a Modern Enterprise System, Accelerate the Straightening Out of Equity Relationships, and Concentrate Efforts on Invigorating State-Owned Enterprises. Acceleration of the straightening out of enterprise equity relationships, exploration of diversified ways of operating assets, and genuinely enlivening enterprises to enable steady increase in the value of assets, simultaneously doing more to build a corps of entrepreneurs, and nurturing and creating a large number of entrepreneurs that fit in with the modern enterprise system are the keys to current intensification of state-owned enterprise reform and the building of a modern enterprise system. The building of a modern enterprise system must proceed from realities. It must be tailored to different kinds of enterprises and operating conditions, different ways and means adopted. For large and medium state-owned enterprises, the main task is a transformation from the former "plant system" to a "corporation system." This is the main direction and task in enterprise reform. In addition to transforming enterprises of a monopoly character in accordance with the individual proprietorship system, competitive enterprises must be transformed according to the regular corporation system. Every effort must be made to transform most state-owned enterprises among basic industries, raw and processed materials industries, processing industries, and tertiary industries into limited liability corporations in which many shareholders hold shares. When conditions are ripe, they may also be transformed into joint-stock limited corporations. Demarcation lines between industries and systems must be demolished, equity relationships being used as the hub for organizing diverse forms of corporation system enterprise blocs as economic development inherently requires. Small state-owned enterprises must be boldly decontrolled. Some may institute contract operation and lease operation; others may be reorganized as stock-share cooperation operations, or they may be sold to collectives or individuals. Especially hard-hit enterprises that have serious losses and whose assets are insufficient to defray liabilities must be actively annexed or merged, auctioned off, or allowed to go bankrupt. For the past several years, many places in the province have been running pilot projects in these regards from which heartening results have been obtained. Incomplete statistics show that more than one-third of the nearly 300 money-losing enterprises in the province that have been annexed or merged have begun to turn their losses into profits. Every jurisdiction must diligently summarize and learn lessons from these experiences, and apply them to their own situations. They must further explore effective ways to straighten out equity relationships. No matter the form or method, so long as it meets the "three facilitates" standards, it may be courageously adopted and actively practiced. At the county level in particular, where most enterprises are medium or small, there must be greater deregulation in an effort to make major advances. Basic work must be done to straighten out enterprise equity relationships. A priority task is reappraising the stocks and assets of enterprises, defining equity rights, clarifying credits and liabilities, appraising assets, and verifying the amount of assets held by enterprise juridical entities. Simultaneous with accelerated straightening out of equity relationships and the promotion of diverse forms of operating assets must be diligent attention to the implementation of "Regulations on Changing the Operating Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership of the Whole People," and "State-Owned Assets Supervision and Control Regulations." This has as its purpose the improvement of enterprise administration and management, guiding enterprises to condition their internal operating system, accelerating enterprises' technological transformation, and raising overall enterprise caliber. Establishment and perfection of a modern enterprise system is not only a fundamental transformation of the microeconomic economic base, but also has a bearing on complete and profound changes in the macroeconomic system and the political system. It requires comprehensive associated reform of the economic control system, the market system, the legal system, and the social security system. We must make people think more about the needs of the overall situation, correctly handle readjustment of equity relationships, and ensure implementation of all reform measures. In 1994, reform of Anhui Province's government organs will also get underway. Plans call for completion of reforms over a 12-year period. Prior to the formal inauguration of the implementation plans, all levels should pay close attention to necessary preparations, taking real strides in further transformation of government functions. They must continue to use all means to place personnel in other jobs or assign them elsewhere to create the conditions necessary for smooth implementation of organization reform. After plans are formally inaugurated, all jurisdictions must carefully organize for active and soundly based action. Social security system reform is lagging at the present time. It has become a prominent factor limiting progress in enterprise reform. We must act within the spirit of the "Decisions," gradually setting up a province-wide centralized social security management organization, starting with the cities, to hasten formation of a social security system that covers all staff members and workers, that provides basic protection, and that augments insurance. This will provide support for enterprise reform and the free movement of manpower. 2. Focus on Attainment of the Goal of a Comfortable Well-Off Standard of Living, Accelerating Restructuring of the Rural Economy, and Concentrating on Increasing Peasant Income. Development of China's rural economy today has begun to enter a new stage in which restructuring and improved returns are the main features. The overall approach in the province's rural work during 1994 is to pursue the goal of a comfortable well-off standard of living while stabilizing the party's basic rural policies, adhering to a market orientation, deepening rural economic system reform, hastening the development of market agriculture, establishing a scientific and effective macroeconomic regulation and control system, lightening the peasants' burdens, genuinely protecting the peasants' interests, and vigorously supporting the development of agriculture. It is especially necessary to take a systems engineering point of view, paying close attention to accelerating structural readjustments, hastening the development of township and town enterprises, speeding up the development of "one premium and two highs" agriculture [i.e., premium products, high yields, and high returns], and quickening the shift of rural manpower into non-agricultural jobs. We must increase peasant per capita income and improve the labor productivity rate and the land output rate as important criteria for judging the effectiveness of rural economic work. We must move the province's rural economy toward the market, spur specialization in agricultural production, and hasten progress townships and villages development of market towns for further emancipation and development of rural productivity. More than 80 percent of the province's population lives in rural villages. Rapid economic growth depends on opening up rural markets, but rural markets can be opened up only if peasant income increases. Therefore, everything from top to bottom requires increasing peasant income to create more favorable conditions, steadily increasing and applying investment in agriculture, increasing building of agricultural infrastructure, and ensuring that agricultural production and peasant income increase fairly rapidly at the same time. The initiation and promotion of a market economy provides new opportunities for rural development. It particularly provides a good opportunity for our large agricultural province to move toward the market. We must seize this opportunity, take the market as our orientation, actively readjust the structure, and devote major efforts to improving overall returns from agriculture. We must select in a planned way places where conditions are good and potential is high for the founding of a number of demonstration zones and demonstration tracts that are characterized by high yield, premium returns, and high returns agriculture. We must invest science and technology, money, and materials in them for the thorough development of varieties and quality. Practice in many places shows that establishment of analogous turnkey processing enterprises to give impetus to steady readjustment of the agricultural structure and to promote steady rise in peasant income is an effective way to develop the rural economy. Every jurisdiction must actively develop dominant industries and hot-selling products having a local flavor as markets require and resources permit, using processing industries and business concerns as a turnkey, using the turnkeys to spur the development of bases, and using bases in conjunction with peasant households for the formation of specialized wholesale markets. This can bring about the integration of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the serialization of production, supply, and marketing. It can link together the small-scale production of myriad households with large markets in China and abroad to promote a pattern of regionalization, a specialization of production, an integration of operations, and a socialization of services to hasten progress in the modernization of agriculture. Township and town enterprises are important mainstays for hastening the development of Anhui Province's economy. They offer tremendous potential and hope for rural villages realization of the goal of a comfortably well-off standard of living. Although township and town enterprises in the province have developed fairly rapidly during the past two years, development has been very spotty. To a very large extent, development has been pulled by the rise of "blank spots." We have no reason at all to be complacent. Instead, we must clearly realize the shortcomings that exist, and unflaggingly concentrate and reconcentrate our attention on this problem. While emphasizing the market and returns, we must accelerate whatever can be accelerated, and turn our hands to whatever has to be done, doing all possible to maintain the fine momentum of rapid development of recent years. We must make sure that the development of township and town enterprises proceeds in tandem with the development of agriculture. We must actively start up newly emerging industries as well, fully use and make the most of our advantages in agricultural resources, vigorously develop agricultural and sideline products processing industries, and increase the farm products commercialization rate and added value rate, thereby gradually shaping a new rural industrial pattern based on developmental agriculture in which township and town enterprises play a leading role. The province must provide guidance tailored to individual circumstances. Places in which development is relatively slow should continue to work toward a rapid take-off. They should particularly make the elimination of "blank villages" a main task to be completed within a certain period. Places already having a foundation and requisite conditions should concentrate on improving quality, raising levels, and expanding scale. They should concentrate on readjusting the structure and improving returns. They should concentrate on developing away from extensive development toward intensive development. In paying attention to the study of both foreign and domestic markets, they should concentrate on changing from looking outward rather than looking inward. One point that must be noted, in particular, is that with changes in the operating mechanisms of state-owned enterprises, the existing flexible mechanisms in township and town enterprises no longer hold the upper hand. Everyone will start from a single line, in addition to which township and town enterprises will generally not have as good technology, human talent, and equipment as state-owned enterprises. Future development will face greater difficulties. Therefore, township and town enterprises should have a greater sense of crisis and a feeling of pressure. They will have to be constantly creative in their equity system and operating methods, guard against and overcome degeneration of their operating mechanisms, intensify internal control, vigorously promote technological transformation and technical progress, seek to increase economic returns, and increase their market competitiveness. They must move ahead further with the stock-share cooperative system. They must use a clarification of equity relationships as a foundation for stimulating the flow and organization of the elements of production across community lines to form a more rational enterprise pattern. They must improve planning, bring about a greater concentration of township and town enterprises, make full use of and transform existing small cities and towns, and build new small cities and towns. This is a successful road that is in keeping with circumstances in the province. We must steadily summarize experiences and accelerate the pace of development. The ability of large numbers of rural surplus manpower to transfer elsewhere without a hitch is a strategic task that affects attainment of the goal of a comparatively well-off standard of living in rural villages. Every jurisdiction must conscientiously study this matter. They must take effective actions, and provide positive guidance to spur the rational and orderly shift of manpower. They must strive to widen channels for such shifts, vigorously develop developmental agriculture and township and town enterprises, energetically develop rural tertiary industries, organize and guide the outward movement of labor in a planned way, and encourage and support peasants in entering cities and towns to work and do business. The separation of city and countryside must be eliminated, and the household registration, labor employment and land control systems reformed to provide support and services for the shift of rural manpower. Rural work consists of a multitude of things. Concentration on agriculture, improvement of agriculture, and protection of agriculture mean placing the work emphasis on "villages." Villages are the most basic units and the most lively cells. They are connected upward to everything, and they are a convergence point downward for myriad households. They shoulder the task of directly organizing the broad masses of people in attainment of a comfortable well-off standard of living. Only when close attention is paid to village level organization can the party's various rural programs and policies truly move into villages and households where they are put into practice and have an effect. Party organizations at all levels, particularly county and city CPC committees, must always make acceleration of village-level economic development and better building of village organization a major focus of rural work. They must continue to expend much energy, restructuring, and improve grassroots level organization, educate and train the broad masses of grassroots cadres, and conscientiously build party branches into the nucleus of village organization so that they become leaders in directing the peasant's arduous innovation and becoming wealthy together. Work is agricultural and in rural villages is facing numerous new contradictions and new problems today. Every jurisdiction must do more investigation and study to solve them in a timely and well-founded way. Attention must be paid to the livelihood of the rural masses, particular attention given to solving difficulties in mountain regions and impoverished areas to help the people there get out of poverty and become wealthy more rapidly. 3. Focusing on Optimizing Resource Allocations, Hastening Development of Production Elements Markets, and Concentrating on Making Fullest Use of the Role of the Market Mechanism. The basic role in market allocation of resources must be premised on market prices. Today, prices of most commodities have been decontrolled. The focus of continued intensification of reform is on further acceleration of the building of specialized markets and wholesale markets throughout the province. While relying on the local fostering of a number of regional commodity markets, the two-track pricing of means of production has been abolished to bring into being more production elements markets, and accelerate progress in markets setting prices of the elements of production. Given conditions in the province, during 1994, marked breakthroughs should be made in the building of manpower and human talent markets, science and technology and information markets, financial markets, real estate markets, enterprise equity exchange markets, and rural land use rights exchange markets. Close attention must be paid to the development of various kind of market middleman organizations, full use made of their service, contacting, notarial, and supervisory roles to promote the healthy development of market building. Market competition is merciless, and a bipolarization of enterprises is also unavoidable. It is too much to expect that each and every one of the numerous state-owned enterprises will be a winner and make a profit year after year. Survival of the fittest must be genuinely applied to enterprises, the fittest run well so that they develop more rapidly, and the least fit eliminated to stimulate a new organization of the elements of production. All jurisdictions must orient toward the market, principal support going to the industries and products that reflect the level of local economic development and that express the distinctiveness of local economic development. Policies, investment, and resources should favor them, and they should be given priority for development to improve their competitiveness in domestic and international markets, to widen avenues for their development, and to obtain more marked economic returns, thereby stimulating other industries and enterprises. Attention must be given to market returns from name brand products, development of the province's existing name-brand products accelerated, and new name-brand and premium products produced steadily. In addition, other enterprises should be encouraged to forge links with enterprises manufacturing name-brand products, and to register name-brand products, to try to widen market share, and to seize the high ground in markets. At the same time, continued efforts should be made to foster economic growth points, and an all-out effort made to develop diverse forms of ownership to increase the percentage of the non state-owned economy. In some special areas where the level of productivity is fairly low, in particular, it is even more necessary to boldly emancipate thinking, free ourselves from restraints, and accelerate development of the individual and privately owned economy, and the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to enable them to work with and augment state-owned and collectively-owned enterprises for mutual advance and common development. 4. Focus on the Formation of a Pattern of Opening in All Directions To Accelerate the Pace of Opening to the Outside World, Concentrating on Increasing the External Orientation of the Economy. In a market economy, enterprises are both main market entities and main entities for opening up to the outside world. Large and medium enterprises that enjoy a relative economic, technical, and human talent advantage should be selected to lead the push into international markets, full use made of their energizing and model roles. However, the number of enterprises that have the strength to enter international markets directly are few and far between. Most large and medium enterprises will have to enter international markets indirectly through the importation of foreign capital, the digestion and assimilation of advanced technical equipment, and through grafting and cooperation. Close attention must be given to study and solution of some problems existing in three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to help them improve their operations, to increase returns, to improve their administration according to law, and to protect their legal rights and interests. In addition, the degree of openness must be steadily increased, areas opened to the outside world widened, efforts made to attract foreign capital at a higher level and over a wider range, three new kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises developed energetically, and old enterprises grafted and transformed on a large scale. Reform of the external economic system must be intensified, foreign trade expanding and permeating every trade and industry for rapid formation of a large economic relations and trade system that combines trade, industry, and agriculture; foreign and domestic trade; trade inside and outside the province, and the domestic and the foreign. In addition, corresponding banking and finance, information, scientific and technical human talent, insurance, and securities systems must be developed and put on a sound footing to serve the development of foreign economic relations and foreign trade. An all-out effort must be made to open up international markets, to expand foreign trade bases, to build strong product sales agencies, and production and processing, storage, transportation, and service networks. This will advance the multi-level, multi-component, multi-function, internationally oriented development of foreign economic relations and trade. Enterprises that produce for foreign trade, and foreign economic relations and foreign trade government units must use to the full and use flexibly applicable state policies, make their own operating decisions, accept responsibility for their own profits and losses, improve management, lower exchange conversion costs, and increase economic returns. They must further improve the investment climate to improve service quality and operating efficiency, and increase external publicity to increase Anhui's name international recognition. 5. Focus on Promoting the Extension Into the Economy of Science and Technology To Speed Up Development and Use of Science and Technology, Concentrating on Improving the Science and Technology Content of Products. A policy of "stabilizing one end while opening up an expanse," must be implemented to shape systems for the development of science and technology, for research and development, and promotion. Scientific research organs must orient toward the marketplace and institute businesslike management to enliven their mechanisms. Developmental and applied scientific research organs must actively build scientific and technical enterprises devoted primarily to high and new technology products. Except for a small number of permanent scientific researchers receiving support from the state, most personnel in public welfare scientific research organs must work on matters related to economic and social development. They must shift over to scientific and technical development and improve their self-development capabilities. The orientation of science and technology toward the marketplace must be accelerated to spur the commercialization of the fruits of scientific and technical research. Enterprises must be willing to put up large amounts of money to buy the fruits of scientific and technical research to hasten the technological transformation and the technical progress of enterprises. Scientific research units must use channels of all kinds to introduce and sell the products of their own scientific and technical research. They should look for developmental projects by making technology transfers for money, by calling for bids, and through auctioning to accelerate their conversion into real productivity. Use of the current favorable opportunity for transforming the joint-stock system, using science and technology to acquire shares is a fine way to advance the integration of science and technology with the economy. It should be tried out boldly. We must make the most of the province's strengths in science and technology and human talent, and use preferential policies as an orientation for building, as soon as possible, technical and information market networks that link the province, prefectures, municipalities, and counties vertically, and that link large institutions of higher education, scientific research organs, and enterprises laterally. We must develop intermediary organizations, augment the number of scientific and technical brokers in order to do a good job of building bridges for the transfer of the fruits of technological research. The province's civilian-run scientific research institutions have developed fairly rapidly in recent years. They have made an important contribution to inculcating science and technology into the economy, thereby exhibiting exuberant vitality. We must provide them further support, diligently assist them in solving difficulties, and promote their steady development and growth. We must pay close attention to the development of high and new technology and associated industries, striving to break substantial new ground by the end of the present century in industrializing various technical fields including electronics, information, and biological engineering. Every jurisdiction must devote more energy to the support of projects having a high scientific and technical content, but that do not yet exist on a large scale. In the economic development zones, in particular, every effort must be made to set up more high and new technology enterprises. We must both develop and import at the same time, practice the principle of "internalizing" imports, continue to widen international academic exchanges, widen the scientific and technical cooperation realm, and import both domestic and foreign advanced scientific and technical achievements and technical equipment. Although the development of high technology poses certain risks, returns may also be quite high. We must hasten the establishment and perfection of diverse scientific and technical input systems, set up various funds including a fund to reduce risks in scientific and technical development that is primarily government funded to provide backstopping for the industrialization of new and high technology. Human talent is the carrier of science and technology, and the training of human talent depends on education. Education must orient toward the main battleground of building the economy and toward the future. The training of human talent of a fairly high scientific and cultural level and that understands sophisticated work skills is the prime task. Acting in the spirit of the Central Committee's educational reform and development program, the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government have made a decision about educational reform and development problems in the province, the implementation of which they will organize conscientiously. During the first half of 1994, the provincial CPC committee and provincial government will also render decisions about ordinary educational reform and development problems. All jurisdictions should pay close attention. They should strive for substantial advances in making the nine-year compulsory education system universal and in the elimination of illiteracy among youths for early attainment of the "two basics" goal. The "Teachers' Law" must be conscientiously implemented to ensure teacher benefits according to law. III. Intensifying Indoctrination, Mastery of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Theory for Building a Distinctively Chinese Brand of Socialism To Raise the Level of Leadership For Taking Account of the Situation as a Whole Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory for building a distinctive Chinese brand of socialism carries on, enriches, and develops Mao Zedong Thought. It is contemporary Chinese Marxism, and it is our guide for action. Use of this scientific theory to arm the whole party provides the underpinnings for enhancement and improvement of Party leadership, for strengthening the party, for moving ahead with reform and opening up to the outside world, and for modernization. The degree to which this theory is understood and applied determines the overall caliber of party organizations at all levels and the level of leadership. We must relate this theory to reform and development realities, and diligently study it. We must strive to understand fully and put into effect its basic Marxist standpoint, point of view, and methods to improve awareness and resoluteness in implementing the party's basic line. Right now, Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping should be diligently studied in particular. Leading cadres at the county level and above should take the lead in study, strive to understand the spiritual substance, do a conscientious job of unifying thinking about Comrade Xiaoping's theory and the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, and about the "Decisions" of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, steadily raise the level of leadership needed to deal with the overall situation in a unified way and to better discharge the important historical task of leading the building of a socialist market economy system. 1. Study and Mastery of Comrade Xiaoping's Theory, Persevering Further in the Ideological Line of Emancipating Thinking and Seeking Truth in Facts. The emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth in facts are the quintessence of Comrade Xiaoping's theory for building a distinctively Chinese brand of socialism. They are an ideological line that our party has upheld for a long time, and they are an important prerequisite for our doing a good job. The emancipation of thinking is a process of steady development. Old problems are solved only to have new problems steadily appear. Therefore, the emancipation of thinking is not something that can be done once and for all. One must make new efforts as situations develop and as reform intensifies. The emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth in facts are parts of a piece. Upholding the oneness of the emancipation of thinking and the seeking of truth in facts is to enhance dialectical awareness, and to hold fast to practice, which is the first basic principle of Marxism so that thinking conforms to reality, and subjectivity and objectivity accord with each other. In leadership work, one very important point is the need to use the standard of the "three facilitates" to determine choices in actual work, to decide whether to move ahead or pull back, and to judge the advantages and disadvantages, gains and losses from all programs, policies, plans, and methods. Leading cadres at all levels must be adept at proceeding from their own realities under guidance of Central Committee overall policies and plans. They must concentrate more on finding the areas in which policies and plans can be linked to realities, boldly practice, and perform their work creatively. The broad masses of people are the main entity in practice. They possess extreme creativeness and unbounded wisdom. In recent years, we have effectively moved ahead with work in every regard by adhering to the mass line, by respecting the creative spirit of the masses, and by creating fresh experiences through the timely summarization of the practice of the masses. This is an extremely valuable experience. Leading cadres at all levels must maintain high political enthusiasm and continue to uphold and carry forward this fine work style. They must more consciously steep themselves in the fervent practice of the masses, learn from the masses, and learn lessons from practice. Nowadays large numbers of good role models and "points of light" are coming to the fore everywhere. We must make sure to uncover and summarize their experiences, and spread them at once. 2. Study and Master Comrade Xiaoping's Theory, Further Maintaining the Policy of Working in Multiple Directions at the Same Time and Working With Might and Main. We must diligently increase propaganda and cultural work, and ideological and political work to install the Party's basic theories and basic line in everyone. We must attain the optimum combination of the traditional moral excellence of the Chinese people and the spirit of the times, shape an ideology that holds a commanding position, and better channel the attention of the broad masses toward reform and opening to the outside world, and the building of the economy. We must raise high the banners of patriotism, socialism, and collectivism, vigorously propagandize the pioneering of causes through arduous effort and the fine tradition of selfless devotion. We must propagandize the advanced role models of helping people attain happiness, of readiness to take up the cudgels for a just cause, and of aiding the distressed and succoring those in peril. We must particularly improve the education of youth. We must actively advocate a life style of having a correct view of life and a healthy civilization. We must do more to build social morality and professional ethics, stand up bravely for ideals, stress convictions and ethics, take a clear-cut stand against money worship, extreme individualism, and a decadent life style, stand up for what is right, and root out evil influences. Today, problems with mayhem in the cultural marketplace remain fairly glaring. Resolute actions must be taken for further rectification. In a certain sense, a socialist market economy is a legal system economy. We must improve legislation, particularly economic legislation, and judicial and administrative enforcement work in accordance with "the Decisions" goals for building a legal system. We must thoroughly educate all the people in the law, improve the legal awareness and the concept of the law of the entire society, and bring into play the role of legal supervision, organizational supervision, mass supervision, and public opinion supervision. Nowadays, social order problems are rather glaring in some places. This must be given serious attention. Leading cadres at all levels are comrades in charge, first of all, who must further improve the leadership of social order work. They must truly regard the maintenance of order in their own locale as a serious political obligations. They must unflaggingly crack down hard on all criminal activities, and resolutely force down the trend toward rise in all kinds of cases, particularly large and important cases. They must correctly deal with various internal contradictions among the people, make sure that they do careful work, understand how matters can develop from small beginnings, take preventive measure, and strive to nip in the bud the various factors that damage political stability and public order. Better building of clean government and opposing decadence are necessary conditions and important underpinings for the building of a socialist market economy system. Thanks to the work done by the Central Committee and the provincial CPC committee, the struggle against decadence is proceeding smoothly throughout the province. It is developing healthily. Nevertheless, work in these regards is spotty, and the task is still a fairly daunting one when viewed in light of Central Committee requirements and the desires of the broad masses of rank and file cadres. Therefore, we must maintain a clear view and continue to work toward assuring periodic results. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly cadres at the county level and above, must both serve as models, taking the lead in honesty and self-discipline, and dare to take charge, strictly meeting requirements. They must play an important part in the work of law and discipline enforcement units in enforcing the law and enforcing discipline in the improvement of Party style and the building of clean government, providing vigorous support for their work. Economic system reform is a profound revolution having a bearing on many areas in the economic foundation and superstructure. We must handle well the correlation among reform, development, and stability, handle well the interest relationships of all quarters, improve people's conception of the overall good, make full use of mass organizations such as labor unions, the Young Communist League, and the Women's Association, as well as the enthusiasm of all democratic factions. We must arouse all positive elements that can be aroused, and we must convert negative factors into positive factors. We must improve the ideological education of rank and file cadres, guide everyone in how to deal correctly with readjustments of interest relationships that reform occasions, further shape a strong cooperative force that works heart and soul on construction, ensure that all our work is done in a stable and unified environment. and move ahead exuberantly from the broadest and deepest mass foundation. 3. Study and Mastery of Comrade Xiaoping's Theory for Further Party Building Requires the Building of Leadership Teams First. Greater building of leadership teams at all levels is the key to good performance in party building. Overall, teams at all levels throughout the province are in good shape. They have been able to stand the test at some key times, and they have done real deeds in their work. Nevertheless, they are unsuited in many ways to the requirements of reform and opening up to the outside world, and the development of a socialist market economy. They must be steadily perfected and improved. The caliber of team members must be further improved to increase the ability to run the socialist market economy. This is an important part of the current better building of teams and raising of the leadership level. Work style must be genuinely changed, formalism must be overcome, and investigation and study must be a regular work requirement that is put on the daily agenda of important things to do. We must enter the front line of reform and construction to do a solid job of studying some major problems in reform and development, making no decisions without investigation, postponing decisions when investigation is incomplete, and making decisions anew after thorough investigation. We must select good people in accordance with cadre's "four transformation" plans and the principle of their possession of both ability and political integrity. We must constantly place cadres of good political caliber in leadership teams at all levels -- cadres who are versed in economic work, and who dare to blaze trails, particularly middle-age and young cadres. We must pay special attention to the nurture and promotion of party and government hands who can act in terms of the situation as a whole and who can open the way to new endeavors. Every time leadership teams finish their terms in office, the problem of insufficient reserve cadres becomes more glaring. We must take immediate action to improve work in this regard. The party's grassroots organization is the party's stronghold in the basic level organization of society. It is the foundation for all party work and all combat strength. CPC committees at all levels must genuinely give prominent place to the building of the grassroots organization as part of party building. They must firmly decide to change the weak and apathetic state of some grassroots organizations. They must genuinely build grassroots organizations into strongholds for unifying and leading the masses to realize the party's combat goals. Better building of the party in township and town enterprises, in three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in civilian-operated scientific and technical enterprises has become an important and urgent task in the building of grassroots organization. Investigation and study must be diligently conducted, attention given to the summarization of experiences, and concrete direction given. This conference has one more topic, namely to consider the work report of the provincial advisory committee. In the spirit of the 14th Party Congress and the recommendations of the provincial advisory committee, following this meeting, the provincial advisory committee will no longer exist. Since its founding, the provincial advisory committee has helped the provincial CPC committee do a large bit of highly effective work. It has made outstanding accomplishments in advancing the provinces reform and opening up to the outside world, and its modernization, as well as in safeguarding and developing a tranquil and unified political situation. The old comrades on the provincial advisory committee earnestly practice what they preach, and they have served as models in bringing about a changeover from the old to the new in the cadre corps. One might say that there has not been a single work achievement of any kind that is not a crystallization of the painstaking labor, the wisdom, and the sweat of the old comrades. In the past, today, and in the future, the old comrades have been, are, and will be valuable wealth. The lofty spirit of the old comrades in devoting their lives to the revolution, their fine tradition of honesty in the performance of official duties, their noble morale character of making contributions without arrogance, and their rich and beneficial precious experiences forever deserves our emulation and continuation. CPC committees at all levels must better look after the political and daily life of old comrades. They must continue to listen with an open mind to their valuable views. Although the provincial advisory committee will no longer exist after this meeting, it is hoped that the old comrades will continue to care about and support our work, and constantly make new contributions in advancing our province's reform and development.
