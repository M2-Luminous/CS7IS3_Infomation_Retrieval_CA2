FR941011-0-00016 FR941011-0-00004 One commenter suggested that the Service extend the October 1, 1993 filing deadline to a date 60 days after the effective date of this final rule. Absent a clear indication from Congress, the Service does not have the authority to go beyond the plain language of the statute and extend the October 1, 1993 deadline. In sum, section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA requires that in order to preserve a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date, the employer must file an employment-based petition with the Service before October 1, 1993 or within 60 days after the Department of Labor approves the labor certification, whichever is later. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only a very limited number of petitioners and aliens who filed requests for labor certifications prior to October 1, 1991, but have not filed petitions under section 203(b) of the Act. Executive Order 12866 This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A). Executive Order 12612 The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Executive Order 12606 The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has assessed this rule in light of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.
