Zvili adds that Israel has a framework agreement signed with King Husayn, and when it is publicized, people will find the security arrangements achieved for the border crossings surprising. Nisim Zvili spoke before Hashomer Hatza'ir [youth movement affiliated with MAPAM, the United Workers Party, a Meretz component] council at Ma'ale Habesor in the western Negev yesterday. Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hashomer Hatza'ir leaders decided to convene their council near the Gaza Strip border in order to emphasize the main topic of their discussion: a call on the Palestinian youth to establish a peace camp and to struggle against the extremists.
