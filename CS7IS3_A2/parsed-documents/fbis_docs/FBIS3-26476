China's 900 million farmers will face a "severe overall shortage" of fertilizers and other means of production this spring, said State Councillor Chen Junsheng at a national conference on the supply of means of agricultural production. The main suppliers of the country's means of production, the domestic trade departments, have bought much less than for last year and have less in stock, Chen said. The number of the country's fertilizer plants has shrunk, and high-quality fertilizer is more urgently needed, he said, noting that imported fertilizers have not come as expected. Chen said that domestic trade bodies must resort to all possible means to provide enough for the farmers for the spring ploughing. He said that good market order should be maintained. Any profiteer who infringes upon the interests of farmers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Fake and shoddy goods must be barred from the market, so that high quality means of production can be ensured for farmers, he said. He also encouraged the domestic trade departments to reduce circulation costs and offer reasonable prices that farmers can afford.
