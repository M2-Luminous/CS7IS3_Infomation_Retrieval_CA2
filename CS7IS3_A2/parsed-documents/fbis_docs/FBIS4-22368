In addition to commission members and experts, the working group included representatives of the procuracy, tax inspectorate, and jurists' union. The working group recorded a number of violations in the area of personnel policy, fulfillment of the 1993 social-political program, budget appropriations, and the use of centralized credits made available last year. In the process of discussion it was noted in particular that the tasks and measures envisaged by the 1993 social-economic program have not been fully accomplished. The amount of credit emission for this sector's enterprises has not been used properly, and the terms of repayment and interest rates have been violated. Having noted the need to further study the problem, the commission found it advisable to postpone the conclusions until a later date.
