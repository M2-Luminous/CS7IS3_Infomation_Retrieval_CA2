KRASNAYA ZVEZDA says that as a result of the successful visit Russia is now entering a new phase in relations with the West, and not as a loser. "But let us not give in to illusions. The new stage in relations with the West will not be simple. Our policy is now facing a double danger of lingering confrontational prejudices on the one hand and a belief in exclusively good-natured intentions of our partners on the other". Russia's federal budget approved by the State Duma on first reading is another subject highlighted by many newspapers. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as saying "even prejudiced observers cannot fault the government in this case. We expect the deficit of the federal budget to reach 68.8 trillion roubles, not to exceed 9.5 percent of the gross domestic product. The expenditures are increased by 10.1 trillion roubles to amount to a total of 103.3 trillion roubles. Revenues will grow on a more modest scale, by 3.7 trillion roubles, to amount to a total of 124 trillion roubles." The minister added that "culture and health services will get an additional 968.4 billion roubles, and the allocations to support the mass media, particularly radio and television, will increase by 434 billion roubles." State Duma Economic committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev disagrees. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA quotes him as saying at a press conference that "the government has not made any substantial modifications in the budget. The policy behind the budget is to share out the resources between the fuel-and-energy and the agricultural sectors. It completely ignores the priorities set forth in the president's message on the state of the nation, which call for support of the science-intense industries and conversion of the defence industries to civilian production". PRAVDA is sceptical about the draft federal budget: "Can one really rely on the articles of the budget, while the slump in production slides to 50 percent and while inflation gallops ahead of any forecasts of its mythical decline? How are factories and plants expected to pay taxes if they are not working?" KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA cites informed sources as saying that "on the desk of the president of the Russian Federation there lies a decree, already signed by Boris Yeltsin, dismissing Sergey Shakhray as the minister of nationalities, while retaining him as vice- premier in the Government of the Russian Federation". The newspaper believes that "Shakhray's resignation is due to the struggle between the regional elites of the north and the south. Being a minister, Shakhray succeeded in obtaining the endorsement of several agreements on the development of the northern territories, as a result of which the south was deprived of some state orders and budget infusions". Shakhray himself explains in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI why the government adopted a resolution to change the mechanism of state support and supplies of goods and foods to northern areas of the country. He says in particular that "the disruption of economic ties in the far northern areas and territories equal to them, sharp cuts in mining for raw materials, including oil, and the growth of transportation rates have placed under threat the delivery of vitally important goods to the population of the region". Shakhray also says that "many needs of the northerners are fully met only through supplies from other parts of the country. In the eighties, these supplies were financed through the crediting system, which is no longer possible at present". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes an article by State Duma international affairs committee Chairman Vladimir Lukin, who says that "lately our foreign policy has been getting rid -- fully in words and to a certain degree in deeds -- from its pro-Western orientation. But there still remain many problems which have yet to be resolved on the path of overcoming this infantile syndrome". SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA continues to comment of the "case" of Army General Valentin Varennikov who rejected the recent amnesty and is now working toward the institution of criminal proceedings against those who are to blame for the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The newspaper publishes an interview with Valentin Varennikov's defence lawyer Dmitriy Steinberg, who thinks that a new trial would not be long. "True. Everything will depend on whether the people whose testimony the court wants to hear, including (former Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev, will choose to turn up for questioning," the newspaper comments.
