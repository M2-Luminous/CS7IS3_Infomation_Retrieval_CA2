He said: [Begin recording] ['Abdullah] It is obvious that there is a weakness in the Palestinian preparedness. Preparations for this day were not made in a correct manner, and this has led to the delay. [Correspondent] This request for the delay was the subject of criticism by the Israelis and probably by some international sides. This is attributed to the inability of the Palestinians to assume the responsibilities for which they have been calling for a long time. ['Abdullah] In my view, the criticism is clear. There is bitter criticism in the Palestinian camp. The Palestinian camp and people were waiting for the moment of withdrawal of the Israelis from the occupied territories, but it seems that the leadership in Tunis has not prepared itself properly for this moment, though it was expected that the Palestinians would assume authority quickly.
