FBIS4-54762 "dreeu087__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-087-A Daily Report 5 May 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Cabinet Approaches Court on UN Corridor Issue Cabinet Approaches Court on UN Corridor Issue AU0505125994 Sofia BTA in English 1240 GMT 5 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0505125994 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- The government today asked the Constitutional Court to rule on its powers to sanction the transit and temporary stay in Bulgaria of equipment of foreign states, government spokesman Raycho Raykov told journalists. The issue of foreign troops transit is regulated by the Constitution which empowers the National Assembly to take the respective decisions. However, the Constitution makes no provisions about the transit of foreign military aircraft and vessels. This is regulated by the Civil Aviation Act and the Sea Space Act authorizing the Council of Ministers. However, the government's decision to allow a UN convoy of equipment for peacekeepers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] this April provoked heated debates in parliament and the MP's came out with a declaration saying that only they could issue such permissions. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule on this issue within three months, the government spokesman said. The government has assigned experts of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defence Ministry and of the Transport Ministry as well as of the Legal Department of the Council of Ministers to draft within two weeks temporary regulations for issuing such permissions until the passing of a final legislative decision on this issue. There are eight notes requesting transit permissions, the government spokesman said.
