According to the FRY President's Office, the telegram says that the FRY upholds the European Union's proposal on resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the agreement on a cease- fire and the demilitarization of Sarajevo signed by the Bosnian Serb and Muslim sides. The FRY president stresses that this gives Yugoslavia all the more reason to be concerned over NATO's perplexing decision to search for a solution through ultimatums and military might, and adds that such decisions could invoke the continuation of the war, while peace can only be achieved through negotiations on an equal footing. NATO's decision is an unauthorized assumption of the UN Security Council's political competences by this military alliance. President Lilic also says that the FRY is firmly convinced that the United Nations alone is authorized to reach such political decisions, especially concerning the use of force. The FRY president also appeals to the UN secretary general to take all necessary measures in order that the UN Security Council may regain its usurped political rights in resolving the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received], which would ensure a successful outcome of the Geneva peace process.
