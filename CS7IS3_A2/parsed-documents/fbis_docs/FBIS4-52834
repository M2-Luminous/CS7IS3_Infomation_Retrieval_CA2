Isao Nakauchi, chairman of Daiei, other businessmen, and scholars, who attended the meeting as members of the panel, criticized government ministries and agencies for balking at relaxing bureaucratic regulations. The panel held the meeting for the first time since the Hata cabinet was inaugurated. Speaking to members of the panel, Prime Minister Hata stated, "It is the mission of my cabinet to relax the bureaucratic regulations effectively." After the prime minister left the meeting room, bureau chiefs from ministries and agencies concerned briefed members of the panel on their respective plans for deregulation in the fields of opening of outlets by large-scale department stores, the sales of second-hand goods, and the establishment of gas stations. In their briefing, all bureau chiefs indicated the difficulty in promoting deregulation. In response, one member after another of the panel voiced discontent with the briefing, saying: "We want to hear from you about how your ministries and agencies plan to vigorously relax the regulations. We believe that it is time for ministries and agencies concerned to pool their wisdom and announce plans for fruitful deregulation." The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters will include deregulatory steps in a package of external economic measures that the government will map out at the end of June. The headquarters will use the discussion at the panel only as reference material. The business community is voicing discontent with the government, saying, "If the work of relaxing the bureaucratic regulations is left in the hands of bureaucrats, bold measures for their relaxation cannot be expected."
