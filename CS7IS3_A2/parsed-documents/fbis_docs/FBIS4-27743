FBIS4-27743 "dreas108_m_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Thailand More on Car Bomb Attempt at Israeli Embassy More on Car Bomb Attempt at Israeli Embassy Fourth Iranian Held in Bomb Probe BK0606031794 Bangkok THE NATION in English 6 Jun 94 p A4 BK0606031794 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Police yesterday arrested another Iranian in connection with the abortive truck-bomb conspiracy discovered in Bangkok in March. The new suspect was arrested upon arriving Hat Yai Airport. Police refused to identify the suspect and would not allow the press to cover the arrest. Meanwhile Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit Kanchanakit said the other Iranian, who was charged on Friday in connection with the conspiracy had sneaked back into Thailand because he was involved with a Thai woman. But informed sources said police had not ruled the possibility that Hossein Shahriari Far, 26, returned to Thailand for a second sabotage attempt. Chaisit said the suspect was "too complacent and thought that Thai authorities had given up their attempts to catch him". Far was arrested on Friday night at the Inthra Hotel in Songkhla's Hat Yai district. The sources also said they believed those involved in the plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai woman. Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning. They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up their inquiries in seven days. The sources added that police had reliable evidence indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy. The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those distributed at a Palestinian training camp. Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid in Hat Yai are being held for questioning. Far is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok District Court on June 9.
