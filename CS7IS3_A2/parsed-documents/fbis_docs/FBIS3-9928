He initially answered questions from reporters who asked him about the appointment of a new government minister after accepting current Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso 's resignation this week. De Leon said he has not yet decided who will be the new government minister. [Begin recording] [De Leon] I do not know yet. [Reporter] When will the announcement be made? [De Leon] When I have the name. I have not decided yet. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [De Leon] Yes, of course he will assume his post at that time, but I still do not know. [Reporter] Any candidates? [De Leon] No, not yet. [Reporter] What will be the basis for selection? [De Leon] The president will make the decision based on the requirements, qualifications, personal qualities, and so forth. [Reporter] Will he be another civilian? [De Leon] We still do not know. [Reporter] What are your comments on the article published by THE MIAMI HERALD and the current situation of nongovernability? [De Leon] I would like to refer to a commentary written by one of your colleagues, which was published today, in the sense that sometimes a foreign reporter visits our country for a few minutes and then believes he is an expert in our national affairs. Carlos Rafael Soto said this, not me. This is what he said in his column today. I believe we can handle our internal affairs better, more knowledgeably. The article stated I depend on the Army and that the Army is pressuring me. Maybe we should inform the person who wrote the article about the changes we made on 18 February, so he can see differently. I am not concerned about the article, because I feel it is not consonant with reality. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] at the international level? [De Leon] None at all. [Reporter] What would be the impact of an increase in the price of diesel? [De Leon] I am pleased to say a few days ago I was criticized when I said I would not increase the price of gasoline and that instead it was possible the price of the two types of gasoline would drop. Based on the economic theory of free supply and demand and free market, I then said we had to wait. Today, 10 or 12 days later, what I said is right. I did not lie. I said the price of gasoline would drop. It is significant that gas stations that did not increase the price of gasoline by 10 cents possibly doubled their sales, according to statistics. The economic theory did work. Concerning diesel, what happened was logical; nevertheless, as I said, this compensates for the lower prices in the two types of gasoline. Prices have dropped considerably, 30 or 40 cents. I did not lie; on the contrary, I told the truth. Liberalizing the price of fuel can benefit consumers at a given time, once the market reaches its natural levels. [Reporter] Certain private hospitals have offered their assistance due to the public hospitals strike. Will you accept that proposal? Could the military hospital also help? [De Leon] Any type of assistance is welcome, especially when the people's human rights are being violated, in this case, the human right to health, which the Constitution guarantees. Those who earn a salary to give medical attention--sometimes deficiently due to lack of funds, medicines, and proper conditions--are giving an even more deficient service today. We do not know if this can be called a service when there is an illegal strike, a totally illegal strike; hence, in addition to the disciplinary actions, the administrative, and legal actions we are conducting, naturally any assistance is welcome. If doctors and paramedics in private hospitals are willing to reduce the harm being done to the Guatemalan people, I welcome their assistance. I respect them, because they are honoring their Hippocratic oath, showing their humanitarian spirit; they deserve praise and recognition. Nevertheless, we must act. I met with members of the Association of Hospital Directors yesterday and will continue to meet with them in an attempt to find medium- and long-term solutions. One of those solutions is having family foundations [patronatos familiares] take care of the direction and administration of hospitals in the future. There are already very good examples of how this can work. We will expedite the procedures for approximately 100 or 120 foundations that have already requested their registration and recognition of their legal status. In the future, this will result in the decentralization of administrative functions, and this type of problem will be solved via social participation and supervision. For this to happen we must first take care of certain administrative aspects. In the meantime, we will try to resolve certain financial problems, but the administrative aspect and handling of hospitals is a different problem. [Reporter] [Words indistinct] [De Leon] I have not thought of that yet, but as I said, any assistance is welcome. If this is possible, if the military hospital and the doctors of the military hospital can help, we would use those services. [end recording]
