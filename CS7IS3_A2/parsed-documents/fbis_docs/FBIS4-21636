This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states' demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons. In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and, therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests. On the Arab position toward France following its recent agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel, al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable consolidation of French-Israeli ties recently and following the Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time when we are discussing the peace process and despite the fact that Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons and is occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that the matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance.
