This was reported by Nur Nihmatulin, the deputy chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Nuclear Power. Russia can compensate by supplying fuel for the nine reactors operating at Ukrainian nuclear power stations, in an amount ample to maintain the work of the stations throughout 36 to 42 months. The compensation can also be made in the form of writing off or writing down Ukraine's debt for the power sources imported from Russia. Earlier, the Russian side flatly rejected the possibility of writing off this debt as compensation for the dismantling of the warheads. Ukraine's debt for the oil and gas supplied by Russia now amounts to no less than 800 billion rubles and about 120 billion rubles for the fuel for nuclear power stations. Undoubtedly, the recent ratification of START I by the Ukrainian Supreme Council has received an unequivocally positive response throughout the world and contributed to relaxing Russia's stand.
