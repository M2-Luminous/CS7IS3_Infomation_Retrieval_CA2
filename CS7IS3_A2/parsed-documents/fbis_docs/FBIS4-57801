Thanks to this group, seminars on matters of strategic interest are organized every few months with the cooperation of centers of civilian studies. The last seminar took place this week, and its theme was the use of intelligence services in a democratic society. The Center for Strategic Studies [CEE] of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat, which is under the Presidency of the Republic, is also seeking new horizons. The CEE, which is associated with the Nucleus for Interdisciplinary Analysis of Policies and Strategies [Naipe] of Sao Paulo University, organized the First National Meeting of Strategic Studies. It will take place at the former National Intelligence Service [SNI] school in Brasilia from 25 to 27 May. Admiral Mario Cesar Flores will preside over the opening ceremony. Among the lecturers are former chiefs of the military regime, such as General Carlos Meira Mattos, and intellectuals who opposed the military regime, such as Aspaisa Camargo, Rene Dyfuss, and Luciano Martins, in addition to diplomats and ministers. It will be a pluralist meeting of some of the people who have stood out in the last few years for their devotion to the study of Brazilian matters. In commenting on the meeting, the organizers say: "In the last few years, it has been noticed that there are shortcomings in the exchange of ideas and in the interdisciplinary debates about methodological progress in strategic studies in Brazil. The CEE and Naipe therefore decided to unite and promote a meeting of people who are interested in studying strategic matters." The effort to reorganize the intelligence, counterintelligence, and strategic analysis of the government is not simply a result of the dismantling of the National Security Council and the former SNI, which were promoted during the Collor administration and officially held responsible for embezzlement and other crimes committed by the former "service." It is also a result of the call for openness imposed by the consolidation of the democratic process. Democracy and the organs that gather information and design strategies are not opposed to each other. All democracies have their services, which report to special congressional committees and to the president of the Republic. Their task includes the preservation of the territory and the economic, scientific, and military interests of the nation from declared or potential enemies, and also from friends. During the Cold War, Western intelligence services got tired of spying on each other. Once the Cold War was over, they set new goals. In July 1880 [as published], then CIA Director William Webster said: "We want to be informed about new trends, national and regional resources and limitations, financial transactions, and technological progress. This makes us search, either officially or clandestinely, for the economic information that our politicians need to make prudent decisions and to make competition as fair as possible. We need to know what our competitors do in order to face them or reject them." CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield added: "In the future, our efforts will concentrate on three areas: economic capacity and economic restrictions, commercial and financial strategies, and technology." Today, Brazil, which is a midlevel power, has nothing in the area of intelligence, counterintelligence, and strategy, among other reasons because almost no one is thinking on a long-term basis. Three months are long term for most politicians, while 15 years are short term for a Japanese enterprise. The only exceptions are the Armed Forces and the Foreign Ministry. This is why these two institutions are trying to use university resources, which concentrate much of the knowledge that they need. The meeting in Brasilia is part of that effort.
