This is not for the first time that the Islamic Republic of Iran has spoken of its inclination for talks with the officials of the UAE [United Arab Emirates], its neighbor in the south of the Persian Gulf region. As the history of the case shows, since the postponement of talks between Tehran and the UAE concerning the dispute over Abu Musa island, which were scheduled to be pursued last September simultaneous with the Tehran visit of the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, Iran has welcomed any move that may remove the ambiguities existing in this regard. Therefore, in the opinion of political observers, the Iranian foreign minister's invitation to the UAE officials to travel to Tehran and resumption of bilateral talks on the disputed matters in fact is rated as the reiteration of Tehran's postures vis-a-vis regional issues. The move is also viewed as Iran's firm determination to preserve stability and to bolster security in the region. It is, however, indisputable that from the viewpoint of Tehran, the rift over the disputed islands is resolvable through direct contacts, and that acceptable results can be obtained through holding bilateral talks. Despite this, it appears that the subject of dispute between Iran and the UAE at certain junctures has been affected by the infusion [as heard] and doubt caused by Western political circles, thus being led to a direction repugnant to the recognized international principles and reciprocal good neighborliness among regional states. This trend has not only failed to help resolve the matter in the past, but with the assertion of controversial subject the slowing of the pace of talks between these two countries and finally their severance. At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on the fact that tension in the region is not in the interest of anyone, has constantly sought that regional states, by duly discerning the existing realities and conditions at greater depth, consider ways for resolving their issues on a regional basis. In such case the neighboring states are expected to amicably settle any dispute that may exist between Iran and the UAE. In this regard, Iran thinks the renewed visits by the officials of the two countries and the resumption of bilateral talks as the most logical solution for both sides. In particular, it appears at present that in view of the general understanding which governs Iran's cooperation with the Persian Gulf littoral states, attainment of a peaceful solution to the dispute with the UAE is not something problematic and remote from expectations.
