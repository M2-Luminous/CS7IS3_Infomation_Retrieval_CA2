Messaoudi and Zineb O.; place and date not given: "Favor Political Solution Over All-Out Security"; first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] [Text] Despite the dramatic situation being experienced by our country, Mahfoud Nahnah, president of Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] remains optimistic regarding a possible return to civil peace and constitutional legality, provided that "armed action is isolated from politics." In this interview granted to us, Nahnah tells us that his party has not yet stated whether it will participate in the CNT [National Transitional Council] and that it would have preferred to see the formation of the Sifi government preceded by consultation with the parties. [EL WATAN] Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, is your political group going to participate in the National Transitional Council? [Nahnah] Our movement held a lengthy meeting on that subject last Thursday, and several opinions were expressed. Some were opposed to the movement's participation in the CNT, while others, on the other hand, were in favor of it. Personally, I think that if the CNT is going to be like the old National Advisory Council, which has no prerogatives or power to solve the problems of a legislative nature that are facing the country or to debate the position of the government and state, I do not see why anyone should go to great lengths to set up such a body. If, on the other hand, the CNT is there to overcome the crisis of legitimacy and amend government bills so as to facilitate a rapid return to elections through more substantial dialogue with all the parties that might find themselves within that structure for dialogue, I am completely in favor of it. The main objective of that dialogue must be the higher interest of the country, with no one-upmanship or Byzantine discussions. If that is the CNT's objective, our movement will participate in it either inside or outside that body in defense of the Constitution against all attempts--illegitimate in any case--to amend it and in defense of the citizens. [EL WATAN] Your definition of the CNT is practically the same as that contained in the platform of the national conference; participation by Hamas seems to be a sure thing. [Nahnah] As you know, our movement applies the principle of shura [consultation] literally. Everyone gives his opinion, and my point of view does not count for any more than that of others. [EL WATAN] Has the question been settled within your party? [Nahnah] The question has not been settled. We are holding a meeting today (Editor's note: yesterday) at the office of the president of the republic. If we see that there is a sincere willingness to work in accordance with the principles we have set forth, we will be part of the CNT. [EL WATAN] Won't it bother you to be the only one among the country's most important parties to be in the CNT? [Nahnah] Our movement does not want to be in the shadow of any party whatever. We are free to take the stand we consider appropriate without being influenced by one or more parties. We may be right or wrong, but the main thing is that we should work for the good of the country and for its interests. [EL WATAN] Yesterday--Tuesday--you had a meeting with some political parties (Editor's note: the MDA [Movement for Democracy in Algeria], the FLN [National Liberation Front], and al-Nahdah). Was there any connection between that and the CNT? [Nahnah] Our meeting with a certain number of parties yesterday was concerned with something else. We were concerned to find ways to restore the citizens' confidence and rehabilitate party activity in the eyes of public opinion. The second topic discussed during that meeting was the action to be taken to drive the specter of despair away from the citizens. In the reality of Algeria, the policy of aggravating the crisis and that of deterioration have long prevailed. That situation needs to be remedied quickly. Our movement is one of those asking the current government to provide more transparence and open the doors of the economy to domestic and then to international initiatives. Domestic and international investors are still reluctant because they have no confidence in the laws. By way of example, domestic importers have been caught unawares by the devaluation of the dinar when their goods arrive in port. Are they supposed to pay the old rate or the new one? I consider that a form of violence. Our movement's basic concern is to neutralize all the reasons or paths leading to violence. [EL WATAN] What do you expect to result from that meeting? [Nahnah] We are still at the stage of drawing up a platform that we plan to submit to the office of the President as a contribution on our part in proposing solutions to the crisis. [EL WATAN] You are one of the parties and associations that have called for a march this coming 8 May. What are your words of command? [Nahnah] The march on 8 May will be like the other marches that have taken place in our country. Political groups have expressed their stand on dialogue. We have another approach--one leaning more toward intensified political dialogue--because we feel that the current political deadlock cannot be permanently resolved by an antiterrorist law and the policy of all-out security. We want the demonstration on 8 May to work toward the country's development and unity. It must not serve narrow partisan interests. If people try to divert the march to other objectives, they will have to assume the responsibility. [EL WATAN] You support dialogue with no one excluded, but the armed groups in the GIA [Armed Islamic Group] reject any negotiation with the government. In your opinion, what is the proper reaction to that obstinacy? [Nahnah] For our part, we feel that anyone who rejects dialogue must present an alternative. That alternative must not take the form of a Mahchoucha (Editor's note: sawed-off shotgun) or that of an armored vehicle, and it must not be inspired by any imported ideology. The tragedy that we are experiencing must be resolved by and among Algerians. Algeria belongs to Algerians of all kinds and all political convictions. Extremism must not have a place in a country that is rich in history and in natural and human potentialities. [EL WATAN] Don't you think that the wise men among men of religion have failed to do their part to prevent young people in particular from being prey to extremism? [Nahnah] Extremism is the phenomenon of this century. It does not exist only among Islamists. You will find it among Christians, Jews, Buddhists, and so on. Extremism has historical causes and objective, psychological, economic, and social causes. The various regimes in the Arab countries were unable or unwilling to get control of this problem before it appeared. The intellectuals and men of knowledge also failed to take steps to tackle the phenomenon in a rigorous scientific manner. And in Algeria, the state did not train high-level cadres in the theological area soon enough. That is why the doors were thrown open to all comers. The single-party system, with all the defects it engendered--corruption, for example--also enabled extremism to take root. [EL WATAN] What do you think of the Berber cultural demands? [Nahnah] Our movement feels that if any issue concerning the country is not taken into consideration and debated, it will sooner or later have a snowball effect with harmful consequences. There is no objection to a debate on Berber culture; the main thing is to be able to express oneself and try to persuade others. All the same, it is amazing to see that in a country like Switzerland, where four different languages are spoken, society is stable, united, and above all prosperous. [EL WATAN] What is your opinion of Mokdad Sifi's government? [Nahnah] It is like all the governments that preceded it. The winning numbers are drawn by the government out of the same hat. We had hoped that this government would not be cooked up in a pressure cooker but formed as the result of consultation with the parties. Because in our opinion, this government concerns the political parties and the citizens generally. The current government will meet the same fate as the other governments. But what I fear is the fact that these governments may be just a means of playing for time. [EL WATAN] Did you meet with certain officials of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] during your tour of Europe and the Middle East? [Nahnah] We have never met with Rabah Kebir, as some of the media have reported, or with officials of the FIS either inside or outside the country, except for certain of that party's founding members with whom we spoke long before all this. But our hope is that Djeddi and Boukhamkham will strive to contact their elected brothers who are members of the Majlis al-Shura [consultative council] and the political class with no one being excluded. The armed groups will remain, however, and I won't conceal from you the fact that we think a solution the crisis is very close. [EL WATAN] Do you think that only Islamist extremists are behind the terrorism? [Nahnah] The former FIS provides "cover" for a very wide spectrum. Many people who do not wish the country well are hiding in it. It is true that certain methods of assassination, and the confessions of the perpetrators of those assassinations, as well as everything we learned in connection with the assassination of Shaykh Bouslimani by Djaafar El-Afghani's or Sayeh Attia's groups, are the work of Islamist extremists pending proof to the contrary. [sentence as published] Also hiding behind that "cover," however, are all those who like to fish in troubled waters: organized crime, thieves, gangsters, harkis [Algerians who fought for France during the revolution], and the sons of members of France's Arab units. So Algerians must learn to tell the difference between those people and the others. And the political class must be able to distinguish between those groups so that politics will emerge with democratic freedoms and respect for the Constitution. Without those two parameters, the violence will continue. Moreover, it must be pointed out that there is violence in every country: Spain, Italy, the United States, and so on. We feel that the phenomenon of violence requires a rapid return to legality so that every individual who wants to destroy the country and sow destruction can be immediately isolated.
