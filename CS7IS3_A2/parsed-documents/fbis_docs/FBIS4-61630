He said that the northern regions were today the hardest hit by the socioeconomic crisis, and because of the short Polar summer, delivery of cargoes to hundreds of districts takes over a year. Delivery of essential freight was previously financed through the credit system, but owing to high Central Bank interest rates, northern enterprises have been unable to repay these credits. The government is currently working on extending the effectiveness of an advantageous system of granting credits, and is setting up a federal fund to back delivery of goods to the north. This year over seven billion rubles are to be allocated from the state budget into the new fund. Supplies to the north will be interrupted unless state resources are transferred to the fund in good time, Sergey Shakhray pointed out.
