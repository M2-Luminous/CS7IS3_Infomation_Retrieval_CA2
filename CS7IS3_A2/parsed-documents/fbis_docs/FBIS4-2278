Li Peng emphatically pointed out that China has always treasured Sino-French relations. Balladur said that his current China visit is aimed at promoting the development of French-Chinese relations. The talks proceeded in a sincere and friendly [cheng zhi you hao 6134 2304 0645 1170] atmosphere. Li Peng warmly welcomed the visit to China by Balladur and his party. He said: "China and France reached an understanding on the restoration of their traditional friendly cooperation through their joint efforts. The governments of the two countries issued a joint communique on 12 January, thereby enabling Sino-French relations to return to the track of normal development." Li Peng pointed out: Both China and France are great nations. They are permanent members of the UN Security Council. Although tremendous changes have taken place in the international situation in recent years, the importance of their cooperation has not been reduced but rather has increased. They have many points in common in safeguarding world peace and promoting economic development. Economically, there is a very strong possibility for China and France to complement each other, and the potential for development [in this area] is very great. He emphatically pointed out: "China is willing to develop long-term, stable, and friendly cooperation with France according to the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences; of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit. Prime Minister Balladur and the current French Government have made positive efforts to restore and improve bilateral relations. We would like to express our appreciation for this. We should have an eye on the 21st century and treat and handle Sino-French relations strategically to make them enjoy further healthy development." Touching on bilateral economic relations and trade, Li Peng said: There are practical and good prospects for China and France to carry out trade and economic cooperation. This is because, first, China's economy has entered a track of sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang di fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4104 4099 1455] at present. This provides tremendous possibilities for China to expand economic relations and trade with every other country of the world, including France. Second, transportation, energy, and telecommunications and other infrastructural industries are the sectors receiving priority for development in China's economy, whereas these fields are French enterprises' strong points. China welcomes French enterprises to participate in competition on an equal basis in China. Third, the Chinese Government adopts a positive attitude on developing mutually beneficial trade and economic cooperation with France. Quite a number of French enterprises have conducted cooperation with China for a long time. They remained dedicated to mutually beneficial cooperation even when Sino-French relations hit a snag. Li Peng expressed his hope that French enterprises would enhance their competitiveness in the Chinese market so as to be conducive to further developing and expanding Sino-French trade and economic cooperation. Prime Minister Balladur spoke highly of the importance of French-Chinese relations. He noted he believed that the potential for cooperation between the two countries is very great. He said: Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade Longuet will soon lead French entrepreneurs in visiting China to promote trade and economic cooperation between France and China. The French side also welcomes the visit to France to be made soon by Minister of Power Industry Shi Dazhen. The two premiers also discussed the possibilities of cooperation in important projects and the prospects for the grain trade. They agreed that both sides will maintain the momentum of mutual visits by high-level officials, strengthen political consultations, and confirm the understanding on holding regular meetings and consultations between the two countries' foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers which was reached this January when Vice Premier Qian Qichen made an official visit to France. Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into the GATT," Balladur said that France supports China in resuming its status as a signatory state to the GATT and thus becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization. Li Peng expressed his thanks for France's support. Li Peng also briefed his guests on U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's recent China visit, and he explained China's principled stand on the human rights issue. Balladur briefed his host on France's stand on the human rights issue, saying that France has no intention of interfering in other nations' internal affairs and that it is willing to discuss the issue with other countries on the basis of equality. At the request of his guests, Li Peng briefed them on China's independent, peaceful foreign policy and its relations with neighboring countries. The two premiers also exchanged in-depth views on wide-ranging international and regional issues of common concern, and they noted that the stands of both sides have a lot in common. Both sides unanimously expressed their belief that China and France are influential nations in international affairs and that maintaining good relations between them accords with their fundamental interests and is conducive to world peace and stability. Among those present at the talks were Qian Qichen, State Council vice premier and concurrently foreign minister; Shi Dazhen, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and minister of power industry; French Foreign Minister Juppe; and French Minister of Industry, Post, Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade Longuet. Prior to the talks, Li Peng presided over a welcoming ceremony for Balladur. In the evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Balladur and their party. This afternoon, Zhou Jue, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee, held working talks with Gilles de Robien and Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, vice presidents of the French National Assembly, in the Great Hall of the People. Balladur arrived in Beijing this morning at the invitation of Li Peng to begin a four-day official visit to China.
