FR940727-0-00019 FR940727-0-00007 7 CFR Parts 993 and 999 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;993&hyph;2FR] Dried Prunes Produced in California and Dried Prunes Imported Into the United States; Final Rule Establishing a Separate Tolerance for Prunes Affected by Brown Rot AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes a separate brown rot tolerance for dried prunes produced in California and for dried prunes imported into the United States. This rule specifies a separate tolerance of 3 percent for brown rot affected prunes, within the combined tolerance allowance of 5 percent. The separate tolerance should benefit producers, handlers, and consumers, and foster continued growth of the market for dried prunes. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Prune Marketing Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the order. As provided under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, a corresponding change is being made in the prune import regulation. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Valerie L. Emmer, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P. O. Box 96458, Room 2523&hyph;S., Washington, D. C. 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 205&hyph;2829, or FAX (202) 720&hyph;5698; or Richard P. Van Diest, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721, telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901, OR FAX (202) 487&hyph;5906; or SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 993 [7 CFR Part 993], both as amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``order'', regulating the handling of dried prunes produced in California. The marketing agreement and order are authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. This final rule, which also amends the prune import regulation (section 999.200), is also issued pursuant to section 8e of the Act. Section 8e provides that whenever certain specified commodities, including prunes, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements as those in effect for the domestically produced commodity. Marketing order No. 993, as amended [7 CFR Part 993] prescribes grade and size requirements for dried prunes produced in California. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this final rule on small entities.
