FBIS3-28595 "dreas026__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Japan New Defense Policy Revision Panel Members Noted OW0302083594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0302083594 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] On 1 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa informally decided on members of an advisory panel to be set up for revising "the National Defense Program Outline." As an advisory council directly under the prime minister, the panel will consist of nine members, including former administrative officials, business leaders, and experienced scholars. Asahi Breweries Corp. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi is expected to chair the panel. The decision on panel members will be officially made following the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget; and then, the panel will be inaugurated as early as late February with its administrative office at the Cabinet Security Affairs Office. Regarding Japan's defense strategy in this post-Cold War era, the panel is expected to work out a report which will become the framework for the new "Outline" before guidelines for the fiscal 1995 estimate budget requests are decided in August. In responding to a strong request from business circles, Hosokawa finally agreed to appointing Higuchi as chairman. Moreover, what is noteworthy in this informal list is Makoto Sakuma, former Joint Staff Council chairman and current adviser to the Defense Agency [DA]. The DA recommended Sakuma and he will be the first former Self-Defense Force [SDF] senior official to participate in the panel. It was decided in September 1993, shortly after the coalition government came into power, that the panel on revising defense policy should be set up. The DA, which first proposed the need for such a panel, has worked out a list of candidates and the prime minister has informally agreed to this list. However, Hosokawa will call DA Director General Kazuo Aichi and DA Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama to his official residence for final coordination. Thus, depending on the results of the coordination, the decision on the list may remain in a state of fluidity. What is noteworthy is the fact that experts specializing in defense issues, except former DA and SDF officials, have been deliberately excluded from the list. It is said that panel members are selected on the basis that they are "intellectuals capable of discussing wide-ranged defense issues from an international viewpoint," (as stated by a DA source). However, judging from the selection list, panel discussions will certainly become DA-oriented. In addition to Higuchi and Sakuma, others who have been informally selected as panel members are: (names listed in the order of the kana syllabary) Yoshio Okawara, former ambassador to the United States and current Keidanren [the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] adviser; Toyoo Gyoten, former deputy vice minister for financial affairs and current Tokyo Bank governor; Hiroshi Saito, Keidanren vice chairman and chairman of Nippon Steel Ltd.; Seiki Nishihiro, former DA administrative vice minister; Shinji Fukukawa, vice chairman of Kobe Steel Corp. and former administrative vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry; Ken Moroi, vice president of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations and chairman of Chichibu Cement Corp.; and Akio Watanabe, professor of Aoyama Gakuin University and formerly professor of Tokyo University.
