The delegation had been due in Baghdad on June 11, but the trip was postponed at the last minute for unspecified reasons. Velayati told AFP that the delay had been mutually agreed by upon the two countries. But a senior Iranian official told AFP the visit had been postponed "at the request of Iraqi authorities." The minister said he still expected to visit Baghdad in July, in the first visit to Iraq by a top Iranian official since the 1991 Gulf war. The visit is aimed at continuing discussions to normalise ties five years after the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Talks resumed last October after they were broken in the wake of the Gulf war. Tehran and Baghdad are sharply divided over a number of issues, mainly the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from both countries.
