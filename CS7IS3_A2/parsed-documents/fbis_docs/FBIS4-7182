The cabinet formation came after the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned Hata's eleventh hour bid to lure it back into the fold of the coalition following a fray over a new parliamentary bloc. Newly appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai announced the new cabinet lineup at a news conference. Kumagai dismissed suggestions that the new cabinet is dominated by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], led by Hata, a core party in the coalition, while acknowledging that the new government faces difficulties due to the withdrawal of the SDP. The SDP's withdrawal makes the coalition a minority force in both chambers of the Diet. The party had six cabinet posts in the eight-month-long administration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The strength of Shinseito shot up to nine portfolios from five in the previous cabinet, while Komeito [Clean Government Party] gained two more cabinet posts to six. The Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) increased its cabinet strength to two from one. The pullout raises the specter of an early general election if the SDP throws its weight behind a possible LDP move to table a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration. Hata, who was elected as premier by the Diet on Monday, was ceremonially appointed prime minister by Emperor Akihito earlier Thursday. He replaced Hosokawa, whose seven-party majority alliance last August ousted the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from 38 years of unbroken rule. "We took pains in deciding upon the makeup of the new cabinet, because the SDP pulled out of the coalition," Kumagai of Shinseito said. "We followed the principle of appropriating cabinet posts to the most suitable personnel and I believe excellent people from each party have been nominated to the important cabinet posts," he said. Koji Kakizawa of the Liberal Party, an LDP splinter party, became foreign minister, succeeding Hata. Kakizawa told a new conference that of the urgent problems to be tackled, "Japan wants to improve Japan-U.S. economic relations, while playing a responsible part in cooperation with the United Nations to have North Korea clear up suspicions over its nuclear arms development." Shinseito held key posts in the cabinet. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii retained his post. Mutsuki Kato assumed the post of agriculture, fishery and forestry minister, replacing Shinseito's Eijiro Hata, who was shifted to the post of minister of international trade and industry, succeeding Kumagai. Hajime Ishii assumed the office of home affairs minister, while Shigeto Nagano assumed the office of justice minister, replacing Akira Mikazuki, a nonpolitician. Both are Shinseito members. From Komeito, chairman Koshiro Ishida retained his portfolio as chief of the Management and Coordination Agency and Nobuyuki Futami assumed the transport portfolio, while Katsuyuki Hikasa took the office of posts and telecommunications minister. Koji Morimoto was appointed to the post of construction minister. Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), also kept his portfolio. Atsushi Kanda of the DSP was named the chief of the Defense Agency. Kunio Hatoyama, an independent and LDP defector, assumed the post of labor minister. Yoshio Terasawa, a House of Councillors member of Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and former vice president of Nomura Securities Co, was named to lead the Economic Planning Agency. The post was the only one the JNP could keep in the cabinet. The new cabinet will be formally inaugurated following the attestation ceremony at the Imperial Agency in the presence of Emperor Akihiro. In a meeting between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama earlier in the day, Hata pleaded with Murayama to rescind a decision to pull out of the coalition, coalition officials said. "I apologize for the latest development," Hata was quoted as telling Murayama. "It would be tragic if our joint efforts to create a new era with the formation of the eight-month coalition bogged down." Murayama, emerging from the meeting with Hata, told reporters his party stuck to its decision to get out of the alliance. The determination "has remained unchanged," he said. The SDP walked out from the ruling coalition Tuesday after being enraged by the abrupt establishment of a unified parliamentary bloc by conservative groups, but excluding the SDP. The parliamentary strength of the coalition, now without the backing of the SDP, dropped to 182 members in the powerful 511-seat lower house -- far short of the 256 seats needed for a majority. The LDP, the primary opposition group, has 206 members, while the SDP has 74 and new party Sakigake, a party that belonged to Hosokawa's coalition but has now chosen to support the Hata administration from outside the cabinet, has 15 members.
