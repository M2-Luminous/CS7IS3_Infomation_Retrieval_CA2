FR940606-1-00044 FR940606-1-00008 2. Excluded Operations The EPA is not proposing standards for four non-coating related operations_chemical milling, metal finishing, electrodeposition, and composite processing_and for four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding primers, sealants, and specialty coatings. Organic HAP emissions were reported from all four of the non-coating related processes. Emissions from these four operations account for less than 1 percent of the total organic HAP emissions from aerospace facilities. Most of the organic HAP emissions from these operations are due to emissions from the use of cleaning solvents, which are being proposed for regulation under the proposed rule. The EPA has determined that requiring control of the remaining organic HAP emissions is not feasible because no demonstrated control measures could be identified. Therefore, the EPA is proposing no further control for organic HAP emissions from these four operations other than what would be achieved by the proposed standards for cleaning solvents. The four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding primers, sealants, and specialty coatings_are similar in many ways to primers and topcoats, for which organic HAP emission standards are being proposed. These four coating-related operations account for relatively small amounts of organic HAP emissions, and the coatings tend to be very specialized. Subcategorization can be significant, especially for specialty coatings, resulting in lower potential emission reductions. Many of the coatings in these four operations (e.g., sealants and adhesives) are already being applied using high transfer techniques, including hand application. This results in little opportunity for emission reduction through improved transfer efficiency. For spray applied sealants, there is also little opportunity to use higher transfer efficiency equipment because the viscosity of these sealants requires the use of high pressure, conventional spray guns. In terms of potential emission reduction from lower organic HAP content coatings, virtually no organic HAP content data were available to categorize these coatings. The time necessary to gather the data would have significantly delayed this proposed rule. For all of these reasons, standards are not being proposed for these operations. Wastewater and storage tanks emit relatively small amounts of HAP and, according to the section 114 questionnaire responses, no aerospace facilities used any means to control these emissions. The EPA then considered the option of requiring applicable controls used in other industries on these types of sources. These control measures were evaluated and found to be too costly when compared to the emission reductions that would be achieved (approximately $126,000 per ton of HAP emissions reduction for storage tanks). Other requirements in the standards may result in a direct reduction of emissions from wastewater and storage tanks. For example, the depainting standards may eliminate the majority of the estimated 152 million gallons of HAP-containing chemical stripper usage if the majority of sources use media blasting methods. This stripper is typically treated in wastewater treatment systems after use. Also, the hand-wipe cleaning standards will virtually eliminate the storage tanks for organic HAP-containing solvents since the use of these solvents will be significantly reduced. For these reasons, the EPA is not proposing to regulate HAP emissions from wastewater and storage tanks in the proposed rule. E. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Rule Section 112 of the Act defines a major source as any stationary source that emits 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tpy) or more of any one HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of total HAP. The Act states that new major sources must achieve the maximum achievable control technology (MACT), which is the level of emission control already achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source. The Act further states that emission standards promulgated for existing sources may be less stringent than standards for new sources; however, standards for existing sources must not be less stringent than the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources. For all operations being covered by the proposed rule, the EPA has determined that, taking into account cost, nonair quality health and environmental impacts, and energy impacts, MACT is equal to the MACT floors for both existing and new sources. In addition, MACT for new sources was found to be equal to MACT for existing sources. The EPA has determined that no further emission reductions can be achieved for new sources through the use of demonstrated technology than the level of reduction represented by MACT for existing sources.
