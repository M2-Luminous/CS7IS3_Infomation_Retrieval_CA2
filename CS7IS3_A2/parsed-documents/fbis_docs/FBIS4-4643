The Chinese delegates will reportedly brief Pyongyang on the recent summit between South Korean and Chinese Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Jiang Zemin and explain Beijing's position in approving a United Nations Security Council statement calling on the Stalinist country to meet with the United States and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They are to highlight Kim Yong-sam's assurances that South Korea has neither the intention nor ability to absorb the North and will support Pyongyang vis-a-vis the United States and Japan when the nuclear problem is resolved, as well as emphasizing the need for inter-Korean dialogue. Beijing promised efforts, albeit limited, to lure Pyongyang to the negotiating table during Kim's visit to China last week. The Chinese delegation to Pyongyang is likely to be led by a senior official who will congratulate Kim Il-song on his 82nd birthday, the Seoul official said. The visiting delegates are expected to advocate peaceful resolution of the nuclear problem in meetings with high-level North Korean officials, he said. The Chinese will pay a courtesy call on President Kim Il-song and explain South Korean President Kim's thoughts on North Korea set forth in his summit with Jiang, the official said. North Korea and the United States will resume contact in one way or another, the official said, probably later in the month after Kim's birthday.
