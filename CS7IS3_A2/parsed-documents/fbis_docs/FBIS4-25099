FBIS4-25099 "drchi108_v_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Submarine Spotted Near Penghu During Exercise Submarine Spotted Near Penghu During Exercise Incident Will Not Lead to `Tense Situation' OW0506125194 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network in Mandarin 2300 GMT 4 Jun 94 OW0506125194 Taipei China Broadcasting Corporation News Network Mandarin BFN [From the "Hookup" program] [Text] It was revealed that based on an initial study by our military, the unidentified submarine our Navy monitored is believed to be a Chinese Communist (R-Class) submarine. However, informed sources said unless a submarine is forced to expose its identity or surface above water, no country would admit ownership. Because our military did not force it to expose itself, its identity cannot be confirmed as yet. It was also learned that yesterday a National Defense Ministry [NDM] official pointed out that an incident like this would not lead to a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait. Defense Minister Sun Chen also said that because the Chinese Communists have a large number of submarines and these submarines could not simply stay in their bases, their activities along our coast can be expected. Lieutenant General (Chou Ching-hung), chief of staff of the Navy, yesterday also told reporters at the Legislative Yuan that there have been frequent submarine activities in the Taiwan Strait. (Lin Yu-fang), director of Tamkang University Institute for Strategic Studies, said that the Navy's success in pinning down an intelligence-gathering submarine proves that the Navy's antisubmarine system is capable of coping with the Chinese Communists' submarine activities and that our purchase of submarines from other countries to strengthen our naval power remains crucial to security in the Taiwan Strait. Our reporter Liu Yu-mei has this report: [Begin recording] [Liu] The NDM has confirmed that in the course of the Han Kuang military exercise, which involved both air and naval forces, a Chinese Communist submarine approached in an attempt to gather military intelligence. Our Navy sent S-2T and S70C antisubmarine helicopters and warships to pursue and block its way for as long as two days. Finally, they opened an exit to let the Chinese Communist submarine go. (Li Yu-fang), director of the Tamkang University Institute for Strategic Studies, said: Although the Control Yuan a few days ago approved the censure of NDM officials involved in the purchase of S- 2T's, the submarine incident indicated that our antisubmarine system can indeed monitor Chinese Communist submarines and that it demonstrated our military's capability to deal with any crisis. [(Li Yu-fang)] Our response and action during this incident are truly praiseworthy. First, from a purely military point of view, we were capable of pinning down the Chinese Communist submarine. In addition, we were able to react quickly and lay siege to it. What we want is not war but military stability in the Taiwan Strait. If we were to pin it down indefinitely, the Chinese Communists would most likely send other submarines or even aircraft to rescue it. In that case, clashes would be difficult to avoid. Thus, we let the Chinese Communists learn a lesson and then resolved the crisis to avoid a clash. [Liu] Regarding the two sides' military strength, the Chinese Communists have publicly claimed that it has more than 90 submarines. However, the number of those that could be used in combat was generally believed to be around 40. However, this number is still far greater than what we have today. Purchasing submarines from other countries will remain crucial to security in the Taiwan Strait. [(Li Yu-fang)] I believe this incident is important in (words indistinct) military clashes in the Taiwan Strait. It would not be easy for the Chinese Communists to launch an all-out war against Taiwan as soon as war starts. The most important thing for them is to seal off the Taiwan Strait. [words indistinct] (Lin Cheng-i), a researcher at the Academia Sinica, hoped that we would publish information regarding Chinese Communist activities in the Taiwan Strait.
