Doctor of Juridical Sciences Aleksandr Yakovlev, with whom our correspondent met, has been assigned to this position. [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, what do you see as the substance of your activity? [Yakovlev] The functions of the plenipotentiary of the president in the Federal Assembly are based directly on those norms of the constitution that stipulate the rights and duties of the president with respect to parliament. The president has the right of legislative initiative. Moreover, my task is to present this initiative to the legislative organ and, if necessary, to clarify, to convince, and to take counterproposals into account. My task is to see to it that the legislative and executive authority work in a coordinated way. They are separated not for rivalry, but for interaction. I am convinced: There are no such contradictions that cannot be settled via the parliamentary route within the framework of the constitution. By the way, the function of feedback--from parliament to the president--is not just my responsibility, but my moral and political duty. I will be happy, if I am able to reconcile disputes before they develop. After all, disputes frequently are not the result of somebody's malicious will, but of informational inadequacy. Disagreements are also possible on a conceptual basis, but they are not terrible if they are opposed by an agreement to resort to the constitutional method of resolving a dispute, and with mutual respect by the sides. I think of myself as a servant of the constitution, and I intend to serve it only, and not political ambitions. [Kondratyeva] Aleksandr Maksimovich, does a similar position exist in the political practice of the West, in particular in the United States? For example, is there an official in the Clinton administration for organizing mutual relations with Congress? Or is this our national character molded by the confrontation we all remember between the president and the Supreme Soviet? [Yakovlev] A significant part of the activity of the American President consists of consultations and searches for mutually acceptable decisions in contact both with senators and also with members of the House of Representatives. [Kondratyeva] That is, you want to say that in the administration of the President of the United States a whole service is engaged in the "building of bridges" with Congress? [Yakovlev] Exactly this kind of a service is being established now in B. Yeltsin's administration: a working apparatus of the plenipotentiary of the president of the Russian Federation in the Federal Assembly. I am right now engaged in the formation of this apparatus, which will be joined by highly qualified lawyers who have parliamentary work experience. [Kondratyeva] If your service had been established a lot sooner, at the beginning of the epoch of the confrontation of the president and the Supreme Soviet--and we recall the dramatism of the mutual relations of the two branches of authority that heated up starting from December 1992--would it have been possible to prevent the tragic events of last autumn? [Yakovlev] The separation of powers is not a whim, but a condition for the existence of a free government. But this idea should have been put into practice by people who are accustomed to the idea that the unity of authority is a predominant principle. Therefore, a situation arose not of separation, but of dualism of powers: Both centers tried to concentrate power in their own hands; therefore, rivalry between them proved to be inevitable. It is precisely in this that I see the tragedy of the past. It remains to be hoped that now, when the principle of the separation of powers is logically embodied in the structure of authority, the condition has developed for the creation of a rule-of-law civilized state. But again only the condition! If just one of the branches of authority begins to be guided not by the constitution, but by political consideration, expect trouble. At present, one frequently hears, they say, we did not elect the right ones to parliament. We elected those who were available! Indeed, we encountered phantom parties behind which no one stands. But this is the result of the crudity of our political history. The Labor Party of England was created over centuries. The Democratic and Republican Parties in the United States also have a couple of hundred years behind them. Elections are the great political eliminators of ignorance. We have already lived through one political campaign, now elections to local organs of authority are going on, and within two years we will have a still more serious test--elections of both parliament and the president. This is the best school for the political maturation of the people and the formation of leaders and parties of a democratic persuasion. The word "citizen" [grazhdanin] came from the word "city dweller" [gorozhanin], which means "a free person." Strictly speaking, until 1861, a majority of Russians were not citizens. And they again stopped being citizens after 1917. It is only in recent times that the process of reanimation of a civic society started. What does it mean to be a citizen and a free person? To possess political freedom? Not only. A beggar does not need political freedom--in his hands it is a dangerous weapon. What is also needed is economic freedom associated with the development of the institution of private property. Without economic prosperity and democracy, it is not worth a farthing. [Kondratyeva] What percentage of the population should become citizens in order for society to be socially and economically stable? [Yakovlev] At least 30 percent. Then this third will entice those who are wavering. You know, some schooners have a lead keel underneath, which gives a maneuvering schooner stability. That which history has called the "third estate" gives a firm basis to a civic society. [Kondratyeva] In your opinion, how much time is needed for Russia to receive such a rigging? I think that an important increase in the third estate will begin within three to five years. This is my intuitive feeling of the style and pace of our development. A lot depends on our faith in the future and in the possibility of living as they do in the prosperous democratic states.
