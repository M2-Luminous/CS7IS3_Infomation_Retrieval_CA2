White House press secretary Didi Meyers, who received the report just before a press conference held on 25 April, said, "We will have to watch the situation in Japan closely as it unfolds," at the same time exhibiting an expression of bewilderment over the unanticipated turmoil inside the Japanese Government. THE WASHINGTON POST on page 1 ran the headline, "Japan's Government Coalition Collapses," and reported that a stalemate in Japanese policy would continue for months. The U.S. Government on 22 April issued an unusual "welcoming statement" to Prime Minister Hata without waiting for him to receive his nomination as prime minister in the Diet. Mike McCurry, the U.S. State Department press secretary, praised the prime minister as "the man who bears the responsibility for wrestling with issues involved in the U.S.-Japan relationship." This is because Prime Minister Hata who has intimate knowledge of negotiations with the United States and has accumulated cabinet experience both as finance minister and foreign minister is seen as suited to effecting the opening of Japan's markets and reducing the trade surplus. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, at a meeting with Foreign Minister Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April "consistently conducted himself in a gentlemanly fashion we haven't seen before" (the head of MITI). This was because Kantor, recognizing Foreign Minister Hata as the next prime minister, had an aim of obtaining a pledge regarding Japanese concessions in order to reopen the stalled trade talks. But, belying the gentle manner, the demands Representative Kantor set forth were harsh. He presented three conditions for reopening comprehensive talks: creating yardsticks, expanded the introduction of foreign goods and services, and a review of the midrange macroeconomic plan aimed at reducing the trade surplus. It was requested in discussions between Kantor and Hata and with President Gore about the same time that there be close cooperation between the United States and Japan on the nuclear issue involving the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (North Korea). The fact that, on returning to Japan, Prime Minister Hata at the Shinseito's policy conference of the coalition parties persisted in strongly emphasizing enactment of tax reform and the fulfilling of international obligations regarding the issue of North Korea was due to the shackles put on the deputy prime minister of Japan by the United States at Marrakech. However, given the strong fears dogging the minority government with the defection of the SDPJ from the coalition government, it will not do for the scenario depicted by Prime Minister Hata and expected by the United States to collapse forthwith. The Hata government has decided to issue a decision by the end of June regarding the overlay of a capital investment plan for public works with a permanent tax reduction through tax reform. Taking such a stand, he would like to have comprehensive discussions reopen and bring about a final agreement for them by the July Naples summit (the G-7 meeting of the heads of the advanced industrial nations). However, should the SDPJ, which defected from the coalition, still oppose a hike in the consumption tax to overcome reduced tax revenue, tax reform will be brought to a standstill. Without the prospect of realizing a permanent tax reduction, comprehensive discussions with the United States cannot be reopened. Furthermore, should Japan be unable to set forth a policy for effectively reducing its trade surplus at the summit where "growth and employment" will be key themes, there is fear that Japan will be subject to concerted denunciation. The United States and Europe have both accepted deregulation that incorporates a general plan for international economic reform as an international commitment. But, if the Hata government's centripetal force is weakened and bureaucratic resistance is not controlled, bold deregulation will be difficult. Noboru Hatakeyama, former MITI negotiator and until last year in the forefront of U.S.-Japan negotiations, counseled that "it will not be acceptable to say that if the government does not come up with concrete indicators it is because the bureaucracy wouldn't budge." Tsuyoshi Kondo, director of Itochu Corporation's Politics and Economics Institute, pleaded with the new government "to offer slogans easily understood both domestically and abroad and to maintain the ability to gather information outside bureaucratic channels." U.S.-Japan trade negotiations currently are in the unusual position of being hands off to the bureaucrats. Should this continue, it must be allowed that US-Japan relations as a whole will slip into a precarious position. However, I don't see the prospects for Prime Minister Hata overcoming a weak political base at home and somehow being able to find a way to extricate himself from tempestuous international relations.
