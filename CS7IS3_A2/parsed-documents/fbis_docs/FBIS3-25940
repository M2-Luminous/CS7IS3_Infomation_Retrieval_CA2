Six criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were escorted to the execution ground and executed by shooting. They were Qin Youli, a jobless person of the municipality, for rape and hooliganism; Sun Qinglai, a person released from reeducation through labor, for arson; Han Taiping, a peasant from Henan Province, for theft and escape; Zhang Wenzheng and Gao Yunsheng, jobless persons of the municipality, for murder with intent; and Nie Yongqing, a peasant from Yanqing County of the municipality, for intentional violence. Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, Li Jingbin, Lu Xuejun, He Yibin, Zhang Guangli, Zhang Yong, Liang Cuifa, Song Qingguo, and Ji Tiejun who were guilty of robbery, intentional injury, habitual theft, intentional murder, and swindling were sentenced to death and deprived of their political rights for life at the first trial, and their confederates were also sternly punished. Most of the criminal elements who were punished by the municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January had been punished by public security and judicial organs before for breaking laws, but they refused to repent and continued their group or individual criminal activities. They humiliated and raped young girls in public; committed arson to burn many people and property; colluded with each other to rob with weapons, injured people, and swindled money; fled to Beijing from other localities to commit robbery and theft of public and private money and property; committed murder for failing to win love; killed and injured people without reason; robbed and killed a taxi driver; and killed personnel on duty while robbing a savings bank. They are the most evil criminal elements. Their crimes were extremely vicious, caused great danger to society, and incurred the greatest popular indignation. Qin Youli, who was executed on 25 January, resorted to violence on numerous occasions in raping two hired women workers in his home during March and April 1993. He also raped, humiliated, and acted indecently toward women workers in public at a working room in the restaurant he ran. Three people were victimized. Zhang Wenzheng, a jobless person of the municipality who had been sentenced before, harboring hatred towards his girlfriend Liu who left him, premeditated retaliation through violence. Using a sharp knife and other weapons on 13 January 1993, he forced Liu who was on her way home from work, to go with him to a certain plant in Shijingshan District. He killed Liu by stabbing her several times on her neck and chest. Yang Yinlong, Jin Huang, Wang Guoen, Liu Qingrui, and Li Jingbin, who were sentenced to death at the first trial by the municipal intermediate people's court on 25 January, formed a criminal ring with two other jobless persons of the municipality. From October 1991 to May 1992, they used repeating firelocks and knives to rob houses or waylay people in the Jiuxianqiao, Jiangtaixiang, Yonganli, and Tuanjiehu areas of Chaoyang District. Many people were victimized. They stole over 40,000 yuan renminbi, $1,500, a Bluebird car, and large amounts of materials, such as cameras, videos, watches, and gold ornaments, worth over 280,000 yuan. Ji Shuhan, president of the municipal intermediate people's court, said: The municipal intermediate people's court will fully apply laws as a weapon to sternly punish criminals who have seriously endangered the national capital's public security by their crimes of murder, robbery, rape, and habitual theft. In particular, it will resolutely and strictly crack down on the criminals who have committed vicious crimes, the criminals who refuse to mend their ways despite repeated admonition, and the serious criminals who have fled to Beijing from other localities to commit crimes; and will never be soft-hearted toward them so as to safeguard the social stability of the national capital and create a good social environment to accelerate reform, opening up, and the modernization.
