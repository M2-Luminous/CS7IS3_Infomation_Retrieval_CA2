Significant progress has been achieved in the consolidation of public funds. Yet, this progress has mainly resulted from an increase in taxes and rates, which is quite problematic, considering that the burden is already extremely high by international standards. A strict expenditure regime is absolutely necessary to reduce the public share in the national product and the tax and rate burden. The growth rate of public expenditure should come to remain below the normal rate of increase of the GNP. The Bundesbank expects the 1995 expenditure ratio to be some 45 percent of the GNP, compared with 42.5 percent in 1989, and 40.5 percent in 1990, the year of the tax reform. The framework conditions for economic growth require that the tax and rate burden be gradually reduced again in the future. Taxation of companies will be of particular importance in this process, the Bundesbank report says. In the view of the Bundesbank, the 1994 deficits of local authorities will be roughly the same as in 1993 (some 135 billion German marks [DM]). Although the economic trough is expected to be overcome soon, the tax yield will remain modest at an expected increase of 5 percent. Without the increase in petroleum tax, which will finance the railroad reform, the growth in tax revenues would be just under 4 percent. This forecast is based on the assumption that in 1994 the German GNP will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms, and by 4 percent in nominal terms. The 1994 deficit of the local authorities will also include the expected DM6 billion deficit of the newly established federal railroad structure, but it does not include the Trust Agency deficit, which will reach DM44 billion. The local authorities' net credit requirement for 1994, including that of the Trust Agency, will be some DM175 billion, which is 5.5 percent of the GNP. The 1995 tax revenue estimation is based on the assumption that the German GNP will grow by 4.5 percent in real, and 2.5 percent in nominal terms. Compared with a previous estimate of May 1993, which had expected 6-percent and 3-percent growth rates, the 1995 tax estimate has had to be lowered by DM21 billion. The Bundesbank says: "Since the new projection mainly adjusts costs downwards, and not so much expectations of real growth, this does not have such a big impact on the state's fiscal situation as might be suspected at a first glance at the new tax estimation." As the Trust Agency in its present form will cease to exist at the end of 1994, the enormous Trust Agency deficits will no longer be included. "In this comprehensive view, the coming year might see a considerable step towards consolidation," with all its consequences, including those of slowing down the growth of money supply. The national pension insurance is expected to achieve a DM4-billion deficit in 1994, which would be only half the 1993 figure. For funding, the pension insurance can fall back on its fluctuation reserves, which will have reduced to DM31 billion by the end of 1994. A west-east transfer of some DM13 billion is expected within the pension insurance in 1994. The financial situation of the Federal Employment Office is slowly beginning to improve, although there is still a high deficit. In 1994 the Federal Employment Office will face a gap of some DM18 billion, which will have to be filled by government funds. In terms of the federal budget, this means that the burden will ease by DM6.5 billion compared with last year. West-east transfer in this field is DM15 billion.
