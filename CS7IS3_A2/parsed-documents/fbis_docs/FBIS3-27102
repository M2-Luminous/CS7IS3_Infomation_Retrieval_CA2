A market system is an organic and interrelated whole composed of various markets; it requires not only a commodity market, but also various kinds of production-factor market needed for reproduction as well as various kinds of visible and invisible product market to provide the services needed in the daily life of citizens. These include commodity markets, financial markets, labor markets, technology markets, information markets, real estate markets, and cultural markets. A commodity market may be further divided into consumption markets and means of production markets. In a developed commodity market and a market economy in which the exchange of commodities and production factors is conducted through the market, exchange is carried out according to the market economy's internal connections and through the law of market, the law of supply and demand, and the law of competition, and is not restricted by administrative rules and regulations. Various markets in the system may be divided into different types based on different factors. According to economic factors, they may be divided into consumption product markets and production-factor markets; according to the type of product, they may be divided into material products markets and nonmaterial markets; according to the scope of the market, they may be divided into regional markets, national markets, and international markets; according to the sale time lag, they may be divided into spot markets and futures markets; and according to the role and function of the product in the course of production, they may be divided into finished-product markets and capital markets. A market system embodies colossal subordinate market systems. There are three of them. They are: A market structure system, a main market system, and a market regulatory and control system. An omnidirectional, unified, and open market system is the premise for achieving effective allocation of resources; it is also a result of a gradual development of an imperfect market system. For a large part of the microeconomy in market operations, the role of the market system is to serve as a link in establishing a point of contact for the various principal parts of the economy; it also serves as a stage on which the vitality of the principal parts of the microeconomy are brought into play and displayed; and it creates the major conditions for rationalizing the behavior of the principal parts of the microeconomy. Seen on a macroeconomic level, the role of the market system is manifested in its service as a foundation on which to build and perfect a macroeconomic regulation and control system; in the creation of important conditions for realizing the goals of macroeconomic regulation and control; and in giving play to the effectiveness of macroeconomic regulation and control. In the course of building a market economic system, the state must not only remold and foster the principal parts of the microeconomy and give them corresponding responsibility, rights, and benefits in the functioning of the market system, it should also nurture a sound and open market system in a planned manner. The functioning of a socialist market economy calls for the creation of an omnidirectional market system. Only with a sound market system is it possible for the market to fully bring into play its effective regulatory role in the economic operation of the entire society. As a rule, an omnidirectional market system can be described and explained by the time lag arising from a change of hands between market objects and exchanged objects in the market. Therefore, the omnidirectional market system testifies to and explains the soundness of the market in socio-economical development from different angles; it intrinsically constitutes the completeness and perfection of the market. Therefore, in the course of building a socialist market economic system, it is necessary to vigorously nurture and help form an omnidirectional market system.
