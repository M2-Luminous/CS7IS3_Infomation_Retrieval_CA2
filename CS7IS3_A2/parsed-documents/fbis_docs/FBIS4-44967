In this regard, he called upon government organizations, especially companies, in addition to citizens and [foreign] residents, to respond to the need to conserve the utilization of electrical apparatuses. Al-Zamil, in a meeting with journalists the day before yesterday after he signed a contract with the Middle East Engineering and Development Corporation dealing with expanding the Tabuk power plant, said that the total amount of electricity consumed in Saudi Arabia last year was 15,000 megawatts, whereas the total amount produced was 18,000 megawatts, with 2,500 megawatts being produced by desalinization plants on the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The minister emphasized that the abundance in the electricity produced does not mean that there is an abundance of electricity available for all areas of the country. He indicated that electricity production and utilization differ from area to area and that "this is why there remains an urgent need to conserve consumption, especially in the areas where the demand is particularly heavy." Wasteful Consumption He said: "There is at least a 20 percent waste in consumption." In this regard, he said that the ministry will cooperate with the General Electricity Organization to implement an integrated program for the conservation of power consumption, in accordance with measures that are in effect in various nations of the world. Al-Zamil expects that, during the next three months, a contract will be signed for constructing the ninth power plant, between Riyadh and al-Qasim, which will serve the central area of the country in addition to the capital city of Riyadh. He said that the bids submitted by the companies are being studied right now. Sources expect the General Electric Corporation to play a role in the construction of the new plant. The lowest bid for the construction of the plant was 3 billion riyals [SR] ($800 million). In addition to this, he announced plans for the expansion of power plants in the following cities in the northern area: al-Jawf, 'Ar'ar, Rafha, and al-Qurayyat. In this regard, he said that one of the options being considered in this sector was the possibility of setting up a unified power company in this area. The Saudi minister of industry and electricity, together with Engineer Mahmud Tibah, the head of the General Electricity Organization, signed a contract for the expansion of the Tabuk power plant with Mr. 'Abdallah al-'Utayshan [name as transliterated], chairman of the board of the Middle East Engineering and Development Company, Ltd. (MEEDCO). The value of the contract, which is to be implemented within 24 months, is SR230 million. Expansion Details Al-Zamil mentioned that the contract includes the construction of two power units having a total capacity of 120 megawatts. The contract also includes provision of all the other requirements pertaining to technical support, spare parts, and maintenance. Also included is the mechanical [engineering] work pertaining to the fuel system, fire fighting, the compressed air system, and the necessary mechanical hoisting apparatuses. Likewise, the contract includes the electrical [engineering] work pertaining to the main transformers and generators, the civil [engineering] work pertaining to expansion and laying out of roads, a water purification system, cable lines, and also the training of Saudi technical engineers and an insurance engineer for the project. He said that the contract was one of the important things being done in the northern area (Tabuk), in view of the steady increase in the work being undertaken as a result of the industrial and agricultural development and population increase taking place in the area. MEEDCO, which won the contract, was founded in 1978 with a capital of SR10 million. The chairman of the board, 'Abdallah al-'Utayshan, contributed 51 percent of this amount, and 49 percent was furnished by the South Korean firm Hyundai. The company began its activity in the field of construction by implementing the Ministry of Defense's housing project in the Tabuk area. Then the company switched over to the field of electricity. At the present time it is implementing contracts for the expansion of three substations that are part of the Riyadh electrical system, in addition to a contract involving the Bani Malik Station in the area of Jizan.
