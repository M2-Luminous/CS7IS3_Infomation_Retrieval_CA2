They lend support to what the government wants to do with the Swedish economy, she claimed. Wibble was referring among other things to a reduction in the level of unemployment benefits, changes to labor law, and her past statements about the need for lower wages for young people. She was also thinking about the proposal that is on the government's desk awaiting discussion on Thursday [9 June] whose thrust is to prevent the unemployed from moving backward and forward between unemployment benefit and labor market stimulus measures for an unlimited period. According to Wibble, the level of unemployment benefit in Sweden is higher than in any other industrialized country, if all measures designed to help the unemployed are brought into the equation. She takes the view that this is something that the OECD has missed in its study and this means that Sweden on the contrary ends up around the average in this respect. Strengthened by the support from the OECD report Wibble wants to go further -- for example, by tightening up the requirements at employment centers relating to what are to be considered suitable jobs for those seeking work. For example, distances of several dozen kilometers should not necessarily be seen as an obstacle to accepting a job, she said. The finance minister also noted that the Social Democratic proposal for a coordinated financial stimulus from the countries of Europe does not have the support of the OECD. Nevertheless she is optimistic about Sweden's chances of escaping much of the structural unemployment that has hit the majority of countries in Europe: "Long-term unemployment is still relatively low in Sweden. We are lagging behind the others and can learn from their mistakes. The measures the government is taking are aimed precisely at increasing flexibility, so that more people can find jobs," Wibble said. However, Wibble is not entirely uncritical of the OECD report. It ought to have been clearer on the subject of the priorities given to various measures and stated more clearly which countries they were intended for, she said. The finance minister does not think that the proposed tax cuts contained in the report are suitable for Sweden. In Sweden budget consolidation goes before everything else.
