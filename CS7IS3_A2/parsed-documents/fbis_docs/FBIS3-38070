They have held meetings with Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, and representatives of the State Department and the FBI. The arrest of the CIA agent Aldridge Ames, accused of spying for Russia, "has had no effect" on the visit, Mikhail Mityukov, the head of the delegation and first deputy chairman of the State Duma, told ITAR-TASS. In his words, at meetings with the FBI heads, they discussed the fight against organized crime, first and foremost against the Italian mafia and Asian criminal groups. We are primarily interested in how organized crime is combated in the United States, and how the law enforcement bodies act and cooperate, he continued. "The primary problem," according to M. Mityukov, is drawing up an American-Russian agreement on arranging laws which would open new paths toward cooperation in fighting organized crime. Meanwhile, he added, the Russian and American experts "are establishing contacts to coordinate" their efforts. Serious attention during the tour of the Russian delegation has been devoted to issues of intellectual property. "The fight against intellectual piracy is very topical", the Russian parliamentarian said. Both Russian and American businessmen are affected by it." [passage omitted]
