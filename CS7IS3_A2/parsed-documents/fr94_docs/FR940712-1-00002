FR940712-1-00002 FR940712-1-00001 FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 5 CFR Part 3201 12 CFR Part 336 RIN: 3064&hyph;AA08 Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC or Corporation). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), proposes to issue regulations for the employees of the Corporation which would supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Executive Branch-wide Standards) issued by OGE. The proposed rule is a necessary supplement to the Executive Branch-wide Standards and has been designed to address the specialized functions and operations of the Corporation. The proposed rule would establish: prohibitions on borrowing and extensions of credit; prohibitions on the ownership of certain financial interests; prohibitions on the purchase of property controlled by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); limitations on official dealings with former employers and clients; disqualification requirements relating to employment of family members outside the Corporation; and limitations on outside employment activities. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Robert E. Feldman, Acting Executive Secretary, FDIC, 550 17th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20429. Comments may be hand-delivered to room 400, 1776 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20429 on business days between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. [FAX number: (202) 898&hyph;3838]. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Katherine A. Corigliano, Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics), (202) 898&hyph;7272; Richard M. Handy, Ethics Program Manager, (202) 898&hyph;7271; or Paul A. Jeddeloh, Senior Program Attorney, (202) 898&hyph;7161, all at the FDIC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct For Employees of the Executive Branch. See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace period extension at 59 FR 4779&hyph;4780. The Executive Branch-wide Standards, now codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and effective February 3, 1993, establish uniform standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees. With the concurrence of the OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103&hyph;204) authorize the Corporation to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations necessary to implement its ethics programs. The Corporation and OGE have determined that the following supplemental regulations contained in the proposed rule are necessary to successfully continue the Corporation's ethics program in light of the Corporation's unique programs and operations. The proposed supplemental rule addresses issues relevant to the Corporation's specialized roles as the insurer, conservator, receiver, liquidator, organizer of bridge banks, and regulator or back-up enforcement agency for FDIC-insured depository institutions. Upon finalization of the supplemental regulation, the Corporation will, as proposed, delete those portions of 12 CFR part 336 that are superseded by the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulations. II. Analysis of Regulation The following regulations are proposed to appear in new part 3201 of 5 CFR chapter XXII. Section 3201.101␣General (a) Purpose. Proposed §3201.101(a) explains that the regulations would apply to all Corporation employees and would supplement the Executive Branch-wide Standards. Because they are covered under rules applicable to the Department of the Treasury, two members of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, would be covered only by those provisions of the supplemental regulation specifically made applicable to them in connection with their activities as members of the Corporation's Board of Directors. (b) Corporation ethics officials. Proposed §3201.101(b) explains that the Designated Agency Ethics Official would be the Executive Secretary and that the Alternate Agency Ethics Official would be the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) of the FDIC. This provision would delegate authority to the Executive Secretary and the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) to act in such capacities as contemplated under 5 CFR part 2638. The provision would continue the designations currently found at 12 CFR part 336, as updated to accommodate organizational changes. (c) Agency designees. Proposed §3201.101(c) specifies those employees who would hold the authority to act as agency designees under the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulation. It also explains that only the Ethics Counselor or Alternate Ethics Counselor would be able to delegate authority to act as agency designees and that such delegation would have to be in writing and could not be re-delegated. (d) Definitions. Proposed §3201.101(d) would include as an affiliate those companies which control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, an FDIC-insured depository institution. The definition for affiliate was taken from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is intended to be broadly interpreted and include any holding companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies of an FDIC-insured depository institution. The term appropriate director would include the heads of offices and divisions in the Washington office, the highest ranking officials in each division in the regional offices, and the Ethics Counselor. The term covered employee would include all employees of the Corporation required to file confidential or public financial disclosure reports under 5 CFR part 2634 or 5 CFR part 3202.
