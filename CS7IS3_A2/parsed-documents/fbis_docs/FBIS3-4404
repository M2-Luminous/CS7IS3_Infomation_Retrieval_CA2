Present at today's rally were leading comrades of the provincial party committee, people's congress, government, and committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, including He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Liu Yunzhao, Zhang Dejiang, Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi, Zhou Zaikang, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, Quan Zhezhu, Wei Minxue, Sang Fengwen, and Liu Xilin; principal responsible persons of city and autonomous prefectural party and government leading bodies; all the members of the leading bodies of the various departments of provincial organs; principal responsible persons of the central units and departments stationed in Jilin; and some section-level cadres of provincial organs. Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the rally. Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and governor of Jilin, first appraised the performance of official duties by party and government leading bodies and leading cadres under the administration of the province. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he also read a decision on commending leading bodies and leading cadres who achieved outstanding performance of official duties in 1993. He said: To comprehensively implement the party's cadre line, improve leading bodies at all levels, and encourage a vast number of cadres to raise spirits, work in a down-to-earth manner, and make contributions to building a developed border province near the sea, the organization department of the provincial party committee began overall, thorough, and meticulous appraisals of the 1993 work in late November 1993. Including work of the party and government leading bodies of the eight cities and one autonomous prefecture in the province, the leading bodies of the 88 provincial departments and bureaus and the offices stationed outside the province, and 469 leading cadres, appraisals were conducted in line with the opinions of the official duty performance of the leading bodies and members of the cities, the autonomous prefecture, and departments of provincial organs, which were discussed and approved by the standing committee of the provincial party committee last year. Judging from the appraisals, the overwhelming majority of the party and government leading bodies for cities, autonomous prefectures of the province, and departments of provincial organs were able to emancipate the mind, vigorously make progress, seek truth from facts, and work in a creative manner in line with the requirements put forward at the 14th party congress and the sixth provincial party congress; and fulfilled their annual work tasks and targets fairly successfully, thus making positive contributions to Jilin's development of the economy and other various undertakings. The provincial party committee and government decided to commend and award party and government leading bodies and leading cadres who distinguished themselves in the performance of their official duties in building the province's two civilizations. First, the 17 leading bodies with outstanding performance of official duties, including the Changchun city party committee and government, were commended through a circular order, and each member of the leading bodies was awarded with 1,000 yuan. Second, (Ma Junqing) and 44 other leading cadres with outstanding performance of official duties were commended through a circular notice, and each was awarded with a one-grade wage increase. Third, the leading bodies of the 10 central departments and units stationed in Jilin, including the provincial power industrial bureau, were commended through a circular order, and each member of the leading bodies was awarded 1,000 yuan. (Yu Fu) and 10 other leading cadres were commended through a circular notice. Through a circular notice, the rally also commended 25 of the 59 units and 45 of the 298 leading cadres whose performance of official duty was fairly prominent in 1993. After the awards were given, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, gave a speech. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he first extended warm congratulations on the commended leading bodies and comrades and also expressed heartfelt thanks to all the cadres in the province who made contributions to Jilin's reform, opening up, and modernization drive in the past year. He Zhukang said: To meet the needs in the modernization drive and in establishing the socialist market economy system, the provincial party committee has endeavored to improve leading bodies and the contingent of cadres in a very important place by actively probing into the reform of the cadre system over the past few years. It reformed the system of selecting and promoting cadres and adopted the method of [words indistinct] to openly select and appoint leading cadres. After this, it reformed the system of appraising cadres. Last year, it began to appraise the performance of official duties by leading bodies and leading cadres under the administration of the province. This work has yielded fairly good results although it is just in its initial stages. Practice has proven that the system of appraisals of leading bodies and leading cadres conforms to the direction of the reform of the cadre system. It will play an important role not only in improving leading bodies and the contingent of cadres but also in upgrading the overall quality of cadres and promoting Jilin's work provincewide. We should continue to adhere to and extensively apply this system. He Zhukang pointed out: Judging from the inherent impetus of the system of appraisal of official duty performance, this system is applicable not only to leading cadres at all levels but also to ordinary cadres. Therefore, party committees at all levels should gradually improve the appraisals of the cadres under their respective administration. Organization and personnel departments should conscientiously summarize experiences and strive to improve this system in the process of practice so that it will comply with the system to appraise state public servants and lay a good foundation for establishing a scientific cadre appraisal system. In his speech, He Zhukang, expounded upon the specific common characteristics of the leading bodies and leading cadres commended for outstanding performance of official duties based on the results of the appraisals. He pointed out: These prominent characteristics can be summarized as the spirit of reform and opening up, the spirit of pioneering the way forward, the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the spirit of honesty and self-restraint, and the spirit of selfless devotion. These five kinds of spirit exemplify the spirit of wholehearted service to the people, which is the basic reason behind the outstanding performance of these leading bodies and leading cadres. We should greatly advocate such a spirit of commending these leading bodies and comrades in our future work, on all fronts of the province and make Jilin's modernization drive more successful. The provincial party committee and government urge all party and government leading bodies and leading cadres in the province to earnestly learn from the advanced units and individuals commended at this rally, further lift spirits to work hard, promote unity, rally forces, and, in line with the requirements of the central authorities, make sure that opportunities are seized to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, maintain stability, comprehensively fulfill the various tasks for promoting the economy to a new height as put forward by the provincial party committee and government, and promote in a down-to- earth manner the grand cause of building a developed border province near the sea.
