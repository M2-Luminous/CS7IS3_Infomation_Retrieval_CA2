Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him arrived in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders. Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana and Africa. The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted interviews to various news media from South Africa and other countries. Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation. Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated, was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government. Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados, where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May. At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop polluting the environment and called for the equitable distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap between poor and wealthy states. After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also met with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical stopover en route to South Africa. His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official by Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting. The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third Ibero-American Summit. On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban Revolution also conducted various official activities with the authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who, last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace, headquarters of the state government.
