He was received by the brother commander of the camp, officers, and troops. They welcomed the brother leader president and expressed their happiness over the visit, which embodies the leader's eagerness to observe the situation of the sons of the valiant Armed Forces and take care of them. They also expressed their high readiness to perform the national duty of defending unity and protecting constitutional legitimacy, as well as protecting the homeland's achievements and gains. During his visit, the brother leader president got acquainted with the qualification and training operations in the camp. He spoke to the troops, paying tribute to the high morale of the personnel of our valiant Armed Forces, which have embodied -- by championing the people's will of unity and protecting constitutional legitimacy -- the true belonging to the homeland and the deep faith in God, the homeland, the revolution, and the unity. He added: Our Armed Forces have proven throughout all stages that they are the invulnerable shield of the homeland, the property of the people, and a tool to protect their achievements, security, and stability. The heroes in our Armed Forces have championed the Yemeni revolutions of 26 September and 14 October. Today, they are valiantly championing unity and are protecting it from all the challenges imposed by the gang of rebellion and secession that drove the homeland to war to implement its criminal secessionist scheme for a handful of filthy money and for the sake of its narrow selfish interests. The brother leader president noted that the Yemeni homeland is passing through an important, decisive turning point to formulate a new era in light of the fortification of its unity and embodying the national aspirations to build a new Yemen on the basis of justice, democracy, comprehensive developments, respect for human rights, and a state of law and order and modern institutions. The brother leader and supreme commander also asserted that the sons of our people and their Armed Forces have never refrained from making precious sacrifices to protect and safeguard unity. Unity is a great objective for which the free men of the sons of our people have struggled until it was achieved in a historic, bright action. Today, they will not show reluctance to pursue struggle and make sacrifices in order to face the criminal, secessionist gang that is trying to harm unity and set the clock back to the situation that prevailed prior to 22 May 1990. He noted that the epochs of separation have gone and will never return and that Yemen's strength and prosperity lie in unity, noting that without unity, there is no future for Yemen, because it is the source of pride, stability, and progress. The brother president praised our Yemeni people's broad-based support for their brothers and sons in the Armed Forces in the battle to protect unity and democracy and defend constitutional legitimacy. He said this excellent national cohesion between our people and Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, in various parts of the Yemeni homeland embodies the sincerity of national affiliation and feelings of national responsibility. He appealed for further national cohesion among the masses, particularly among the political forces and prominent figures on the national arena, to confront the secessionist scheme, which was hatched by the secessionist gang led by traitor and agent al-Bid and his clique, who sold themselves cheaply and wanted to push the homeland into the furnace of destruction in order to achieve their selfish goals. The brother president noted the cease-fire violation by the gang of apostasy and secession. He said the Armed Forces have announced that they will abide by the resolution as of 2400 yesterday in implementation of the UN Security Council resolution. That gang, he said, continued its aggressions and provocations against our Armed Forces and launched air raids against the positions of our Armed Forces on all axes at the time when our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, were abiding in full by the cease-fire resolution. He explained that the rebellious secessionist gang does not respect any agreements or conventions; violates all agreements and treaties with its criminal conduct and conspiratorial mentality; and does not fear God or care about the homeland. The leader president urged the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers to display further discipline and to deal well with the citizens and to offer them all cooperation and care, and to treat well their brothers who were deceived by the secessionist gang when they join or surrender to the forces of unity and legitimacy. He said: Those are your brothers and comrades in arms. He noted the wrong indoctrination and deceptive propaganda the secessionist gang is trying to promote among the deceived ones against their brothers and comrades in arms in the Armed Forces and against all citizens in general. He called again on the remaining deceived brothers to quickly join the ranks of unity and legitimacy and to take advantage of the general amnesty law. He said they will be received and treated very well and will get all of their rights just like their colleagues in the Yemeni Armed Forces.
