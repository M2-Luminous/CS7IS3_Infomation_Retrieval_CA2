IZVESTIYA writes that the Ministry of Labour summed up some results of the year 1993, describing as accomplishments "the stabilisation of the living standards of Russian citizens, as well as the non- coming of massive unemployment." "Incomes have grown, but the number of the poor has increased," the newspaper writes, pointing to the fact that last year the incomes of the population went up by nine per cent. "Most probably, this is true only of the part of the population whose income exceed those of the poorest people by 27 times. A major part of the Russian population (77 per cent) had an income lower than the double subsistence wage, which stood at 50,000 roubles in December. One third of them got even less than the subsistence level ... The situation on the labour market resembles a lull before a storm. Officially, unemployment continues to be insignificant and does not exceed one per cent of the workforce. However, the so-called hidden unemployment is growing. According to various estimates, between four and seven million people have a shorter working day or are having unpaid vacations." "The government is granting easy-term credits to the agrarian sector. The inflation rate will grow in the forthcoming months," TRUD writes, calling attention to the latest government resolutions. "During the current year, 14.1 trillion roubles of direct subsidies will be paid out of the budget. The creation of a federal food reserve will require another 14.5 trillion roubles. Add some other privileges to it, and the total will reach 34.7 trillion. The experience of the past several years shows that, in the long run, about half of easy-term credits are turning into cash money and finding their way to the currency market. There is no doubt about the effect: First of all, the prices of durables will grow, because people buy them in the expectation of further inflation." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI began today the publication of a series of articles about the logic and the character of the formation of the executive local authorities. The first article has been contributed by Nikolay Medvedev, head of the department for relations with regions at the administration of the president. According to Medvedev, the new constitutions says that "state power in the country has two levels: the level of the federal state power and the level of power of subjects of the federation." He recalls that the division of authority accepted in Russia -- the presidential and legislative power -- inevitably involved some confrontation, because at that time the new constitution did not exist, and "the old principles connected with the work of the old system in the person of Soviets were in effect ... As a result of it, two systems of state power were functioning in the country, whose confrontation was unavoidable. Now, the adoption of the new constitution created a new legal situation. Dual power in one country was eliminated." In his opinion, the main task on the current stage is to reform the second stage of state power, namely "the second link, i.e. state power of subjects of the federation." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Ukraine's decision on nuclear weapons. According to the newspaper, "Ukraine has made one more step towards the world community on the path of nuclear disarmament." Aside from it, the parliament showed by this step that "the reputation of Leonid Kravchuk as the only peace-maker in the ruling elite and the all-out supporter of Ukraine's nuclear-free status was seriously tarnished." Commenting on the results of President Yeltsin's visit to georgia, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA points out that leaders of all parliamentary groups of the State Duma sent a letter to him, expressing their "concern over the signing of the Russian-Georgian Treaty of Friendship." "The existence in the draft treaty of the provisions involving the signing in the future of agreements on 'assistance in the purchasing of armaments, military hardware and technologies' may, in our opinion, destabilise the situation," the letter said. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article dealing with Russian-American cooperation in space exploration. Thus, according to its information, an expedition of an American astronaut on board the Soyuz spacecraft is planned for 1995. About ten flights of American spacecraft of the shuttle type to the Russian Mir orbital station are scheduled for the period between 1995 and 1997. Then the two countries will begin the construction of an orbital station with an entirely new design (now it is tentatively called Alfa).
