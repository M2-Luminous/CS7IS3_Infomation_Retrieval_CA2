During a joint meeting of the Chechen government, parliament and security council, the residence right was also denied to some Chechen opposition leaders engaged in illegal activity. The Chechen Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the list of people accused of anti-Chechen activity and collaboration with the Russian imperial forces included Doka Zavgayev, the last Chechen-Ingush Communist Party leader who lives in Moscow, and Yaragi Mamadayev, the head of the Government of People's Trust he has established on his own. The joint session adopted a resolution which says that the leaders of the opposition, in conjunction with the Russian leadership, had drafted plans for the elimination of independent Chechnya. It also says that these plans included the introduction of a state of emergency in a part of Ingushetia's Sunzhen and Malgobek regions bordering on Chechnya, and the attempted assassination of President Dudayev. The Chechen Foreign Ministry also alleges that on the eve of the opposition congress, which was to be held last Saturday in Chechnya's Nadterechnyy Region, Russian troops were concentrated near the Chechen borders, and 26 helicopters were put in a state of combat readiness in North Ossetia. "The aggressive plans were a failure because the congress was not held in the absence of the quorum," said a representative of the Chechen president's staff.
