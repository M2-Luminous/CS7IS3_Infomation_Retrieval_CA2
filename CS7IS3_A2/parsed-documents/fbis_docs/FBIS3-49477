Pastusiak, who is heading the permanent delegation of the Polish Sejm to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, in an interview with a PAP journalist, assessed the American proposal "relatively positive," although, in his opinion, it does not fully meet Poland's aspirations to NATO membership. Pastusiak said that the "partnership" will be a "litmus test" of intentions of the countries aspiring to membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As part of this "partnership" each of the countries will present its proposals for NATO membership. In this way the status of cooperation of various states with NATO will be diversified and it will be revealed which of them are really interested in such cooperation, he emphasized. According to Pastusiak, persistent "knocking on NATO's door" may cause irritation in the West, and in Poland it may lead to society's disappointment with the West and NATO.
