In a reply published by THE NEW YORK TIMES today, Saturday, Tariq 'Aziz explained that the first mistake that Christopher committed was his characterization of the states calling for lifting the siege imposed on Iraq as just some states. The deputy prime minister said that the states calling for a change in the policy on Iraq, particularly the immediate lifting of the economic blockade, include numerous UN Security Council member states, Arab states, and Iraq's neighbors, especially Jordan and Turkey, which are suffering from the blockade imposed on Iraq. He added that the official statements of the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency conflict with Christopher's remarks that Iraq has not complied with its commitments toward the UN Security Council. Tariq 'Aziz explained that the UN Security Council failed to issue its president's traditional statement because the U.S. representative objected to recognizing the progress that has been made by Iraq. Meanwhile, he noted, other UN Security Council member states, including three permanent members, insisted on the need to recognize this progress. He indicated that Mr. Christopher's assessments do not represent the viewpoints of the majority of the UN Security Council member states. Tariq 'Aziz called on the U.S. secretary of state to check the U.S. State Department's records to learn of the U.S. intervention to prevent Kurdish leaders from signing an agreement with the Iraqi Government in the summer of 1991. He explained that the Iraqi Government agreed with six Kurdish parties, including those led by Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, on a comprehensive agreement for autonomy in the Kurdish region. However, Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state under James Baker and Warren Christopher, prevented Talabani from signing the agreement on the pretext that such an agreement would bolster the government of President Saddam Husayn. Tariq 'Aziz added that the U.S. State Department's records testify to those facts. In addition, all partners to this event are still alive. In his reply to Christopher's article, Tariq 'Aziz said that the comprehensive blockade imposed on Iraq since 1990 has left Iraq with no choice but to depend on itself, especially with respect to food production. Therefore, all national resources have been mobilized to implement development projects in the marshlands area in southern Iraq. He explained that specialized U.S., British, Netherlands, and Russian companies studied such projects as early as 1950 to reclaim 1.5 million hectares. In a separate development, the deputy prime minister stressed that a clear progress has been made in the recent UN Security Council review of the embargo imposed on Iraq. In statements to the director of the Detroit expatriates television aired today, Saturday, Tariq 'Aziz said that there is currently a clear majority at the UN Security Council adopting a fair position. He explained that the U.S. position at the UN Security Council uses allegations that do not conform with reality. He said this is a position that does not enjoy absolute British support, but a limited support for reasons that have nothing to do with UN Security Council resolutions. Tariq 'Aziz expressed confidence that the majority of the international community now calls for lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq. He said that majority of the UN Security Council member states, which reflect the majority of the world public opinion, have moved toward lifting the blockade. He explained that the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait worked vigorously before the recent UN Security Council review to prevent the council from recognizing the facts. Despite the funds that they have spent and despite their false allegations, 'Aziz added, the majority of the UN Security Council member states have adopted positive trend. Relying on facts that he sensed during his recent visit to the United Nations, the deputy prime minister expressed optimism. He said that after the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and their leadership and after facts have become known to world public opinion, the call for lifting the blockade is now stronger than ever before. On the situation in northern Iraq, Tariq 'Aziz told the expatriates television that it is an anomalous situation imposed by foreign powers on our Kurdish people and in which armed groups took part. He said that those groups are behaving irresponsibly and without any consideration for the interests of our Kurdish people or for the general national interests. He explained that the fighting raging between the Barzani and Talabani groups has resulted in hundreds of deaths and in disrupting life and public services. Meanwhile, he said, foreign U.S. and Iranian interventions are taking place, in addition to the Turkish air raids on villages in the area. The deputy prime minister stressed that the northern part of the homeland must return to the homeland, and that the authority, law, and security must return to the region which flourished under autonomy and under the national Iraqi leadership.
