He also heard Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan Shopping Center's reports on 1993 work and 1994 work arrangements, urged these two enterprises to make development in accordance with the systems of modern commercial enterprises and large groups and to bring into full play their role as the political core of the party. [passage omitted] Chen Xitong affirmed the work achievements of these two enterprises, set forth three tasks, and also asked to fulfill the tasks in 1994. First, put development in line with the modern commercial enterprise system. According to the guidelines of the central authorities, we should set up a modern enterprise system with commercial characteristics and particularly create experiences in developing holding companies. Our shareholding enterprises should have Chinese characteristics, proceed from reality, free themselves from both modern and traditional restrictions, have the leadership of the party, have their stocks controlled by the state, and ensure to abide by the state laws, principles, and policies. We should know that there must be two possibilities in carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis since the system is impossibly perfect. So, we should strive to gain advantages and avoid disadvantages. Second, develop toward the orientation of large groups. Each of Wangfujing Department Store and Xidan Shopping Center creates more than 1 billion yuan of marketing volume. However, they are still small groups. They should strive to be large groups. For instance, they should specifically define the amounts of property, the number of overseas enterprises, and the number of branches. They should have the daring to be socialist enterprise owners. Instead of staying at and moving around the original place, we should go out of the municipality and the national border to make development. We must neither accomplish in one mover nor develop slowly. We should make bigger strides and make bigger development. Third, bring into full play the role as the party's political core. Shareholding enterprises are not different from the original enterprises. How can they bring into play the functions of the party? The department store has some experiences in this regard. So, we should further develop these experiences and strive to form systems. The party committees should supervise and guarantee the socialist orientation of enterprises. This function must neither be weakened nor shaken, but should be strengthened. If this function is shaken, we will not be able to develop the socialist market economy. The enterprise party committees and branches should strive to make explorations and create experiences in the course of deepening reform. After the forum, Chen Xitong zestfully inspected the newly reconstructed goods yard of the department store; also cordially talked with the salesclerks; and asked them about the marketing, contract, payment, and living situation. Also joining the investigation and study activities were Ouyang Wenan and Duan Bingren, standing committee members of the municipal party committee; Meng Xuenong, vice mayor of the municipality; and responsible persons of the municipal departments concerned.
