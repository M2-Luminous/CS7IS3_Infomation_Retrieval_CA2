Accompanied by provincial party Secretary Liu Fangren, Governor Chen Shineng, provincial people's congress standing committee Chairman Wang Chaowen, and others, Qiao Shi drove for thousands of li and went down to industrial and mining enterprises, schools, nationality villages, and peasants households in Qiannan and Qiandongnan Prefectures, and held extensive contracts with the masses of people and cadres to find out about their production, lives, education, and their efforts to shake off poverty. Qiao Shi was very pleased after having learned that the economies of these nationality areas had developed, their people's living standards had improved, social stability prevailed, and people of all nationalities lived in harmony. In Yaonshan township in the Yao Nationality, Libo County, walking along a country path, Comrade Qiao Shi visited the home of He Laopo who was a peasant and inquired if his family had enough grain to eat and if they had difficulties in production and their livelihood. In a nationality primary school in Yaoshan Township, township head He Zhiyong informed him: In the last few years, although Yaoshan is poor, it has never relaxed its efforts in education. Comrade Qiao Shi was relieved to hear that and said to the provincial, prefectural, and county leaders who were around him: Well done. It is important to pay close attention to education. So long as the cultural quality of the peasants is raised, there will be hope of putting an end to the rural areas' poverty and backwardness. At Miaoliang Village in the Shandu Shui Nationality Autonomous County, after visiting a room for the village party branch and also for militiamen and youths to carry out their activities, Qiao Shi said with elation: This is good form. If all rural grass-roots units function well, we can accomplish our work. He hoped the Shui Nationality would unite with all other nationalities across the country and better carry out national construction. At the Duyun Dongfang Machine Tool Plant and the Kali Polyester Fiber Spinning and Weaving Machine Company, Comrade Qiao Shi warmly shook the hands of the workers, which were stained with greasy dirt, and spoke with them, inquiring in detail about their enterprises' production, operation, and product sales. He encouraged enterprises to make great efforts to improve product quality, open up more markets, and develop themselves by relying on their own strength. On the afternoon of 11 June, accompanied by the provincial and Qiandongnan autonomous prefectural leaders, Chairman Qiao Shi arrived at Langde Village of the Miao nationality in Leishan County. With compatriots of the Miao nationality clustering around, he climbed up along a small winding path and after drinking wine offered by the hospitable compatriots of the Miao nationality, he arrived at the village cultural center, where he watched with great interest traditional Miao nationality programs including dances performed by villagers accompanied by reed pine wind and other instruments. When the chairman danced a unity dance with the villagers to the drum beats, the gaiety reached a climax. At the end, the chairman wrote an inscription with a brush, which read: Strengthen national unity and develop the economies of the nationality areas. During his visit to our province, Comrade Qiao Shi also visited the former residence of the martyr Deng Enmin, deputy of the party's first congress, and the nationality museum of Qiandongnan Autonomous County. He also listened respectively to the work reports of the provincial party committee, the provincial people's congress, and the provincial government and made an important speech. He pointed out: Now is the best time for our country's construction and development. The domestic and international situations are conducive to our country's economic construction. He encouraged everybody to have a profound understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important instructions, seize the opportunity, and further develop Guizhou's economic construction. When discussing Guizhou's economic work, Qiao Shi said: Guizhou, which is not situated near the sea, rivers, or boundary lines, has vast mountain areas which are poverty stricken and beset with many difficulties. For Guizhou to solve its difficulties, it is true that the province needs support from the central authorities and help from all sides concerned, but in the final analysis, it should rely on its own strength. Importantly, it must be noticed that Guizhou has huge potential and many strong points, which should be brought into play by relying on the masses of the people to invigorate the province's economy. He fully affirmed the practice of the provincial party committee and government to always put agriculture and rural work in the first place of economic work. He said: Guizhou has had great success in developing agriculture. It should take a broader view of things and implement the idea of agriculture in a broader sense down to work in all fields generation after generation. Guizhou has good prospects for agricultural development. While doing a good job of grain, it should develop animal husbandry, cultivation, and commercial crops, such as fruits and tea, by suiting measures to local conditions. It should develop township and town enterprises by basing itself on local raw and semifinished materials, in particular, processing industries. He pointed out: Guizhou has extremely abundant natural resources, in particular, energy and nonferrous metal resources. Guizhou's strong points, dubbed the coal sea of the area south of the lower reaches of the Zhang Jiang, should be brought into good play. Its rich water resources should also be exploited and utilized at an accelerated pace, with equal stress on the development of thermal and hydropower stations. Guizhou has a considerable foundation for aluminum production and, moreover, it has electric power. So aluminum production has bright prospects. In road construction, Guizhou should strive to build more main highways to link with the high-grade highways of the surrounding provinces and autonomous regions. Forces of all sides concerned should be mobilized to expedite construction in other fields of endeavor. Every possible means should be tried to speed up the construction of projects where conditions are ripe. Qiao Shi stressed: For Guizhou to speed up the pace of its development, it should bring the enthusiasm of its 34 million people of all nationalities into full play and strengthen lateral ties and cooperation with its fraternal provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions while striving for support and help from the central authorities and relevant departments. It should speed up the pace of reform and opening up to the outside world, do a good job of building the investment environment, and absorb more foreign capital and technology. To put it briefly, we hope that Guizhou will further emancipate its mind, acquire a broader view of things, take a broader path, open up more avenues of development, and strive for faster economic development. When talking about the work of the people's congress, Qiao Shi stressed: We should strengthen the building of socialist democracy and legal system and establish a law system commensurate with the socialist market economy in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He said: The task of the people's congress is very important. The work of the people's congresses at all levels, including legislation, publicity on the legal system, and supervision of law enforcement, should be strengthened. To establish a law system for the socialist economy, we should mobilize forces from all sides concerned to get involved. This is also a process of extensively developing democracy. Strengthening the work of the people's congresses at the grass-roots level is of great significance to the building of the basic-level party organizations, of political power, and of the legal system. Comrade Qiao Shi believes that under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government, the people of all nationalities in Guizhou will surely be able to build Guizhou better by upholding the party's basic line, deepening reform, and opening wider to the outside world.
