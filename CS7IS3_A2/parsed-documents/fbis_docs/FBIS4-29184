Among the participants were Seiroku Kajiyam, former party general secretary, and Koko Sato, former chairman of the party policy affairs research council. As a result, they reached a consensus that the party should insist on submitting a motion of no-confidence in the cabinet following the passage of the draft budget for fiscal 1994. They confirmed the plan to support the party executives under President Yosuke Kono, who plan to submit the no- confidence motion. After the meeting, Sato and other leaders met with President Kono to convey their views. Participants in the meeting stated one after another their views against the Hata cabinet. For example, one participant said: "The Hata cabinet is a minority administration endorsed by the fewest Dietmen ever. Therefore, the cabinet deserves a no-confidence motion."
