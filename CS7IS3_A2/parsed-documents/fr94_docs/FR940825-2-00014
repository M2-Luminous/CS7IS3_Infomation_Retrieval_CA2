FR940825-2-00014 FR940825-2-00008 Moreover, Sandvik states that the Department previously determined in the LTFV investigation of SSHP that the service charge for cutting hollow bar to length should properly be treated as a circumstance of sale adjustment. Sandvik stresses that the Department, during its verification in the LTFV investigation, found that hollow bar sold in Sweden was in fact cut to length, while hollow bar sold in the United States was not. Sandvik claims that nothing has changed since the LTFV investigation to warrant a change in the treatment of the expense. Based upon Department practice and in particular, the Department's previous treatment of the service charge in the SSHP case, Sandvik concludes that the Department should make a circumstance of sale adjustment under 19 CFR 353.56 to account for the additional selling expense that Sandvik incurs when it sells hollow bar in the home market. Finally, Sandvik contends that, contrary to the Department's claim in this administrative review that the company ``did not provide *␣*␣* the necessary information to make the adjustment,'' Sandvik asserts that the record demonstrates otherwise. Specifically, Sandvik cites to its November 7, 1991, submission which sets forth the cutting charge as a percentage of total Swedish hollow bar sales. Department's Position The Department grants a circumstance of sale adjustment where the claimed expense is directly related to sales of the subject merchandise or sales used to represent foreign market value, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a). In this case, Sandvik calculated a per unit servicing charge based upon the company's total servicing expense as a percentage of total sales of hollow bar in Sweden. As indicated in its January 19, 1990, response, the amount charged for cutting hollow bar to length for customers varies according to the grade and volume of hollow bar which is purchased. Thus, the service charge varies by sale, and should have been reported on a transaction-specific basis as specifically requested in the Department's deficiency questionnaire. We have, therefore, denied Sandvik a circumstance of sale adjustment in this case. With respect to treatment of the servicing charge as an indirect selling expense under 19 CFR 353.56(b), Sandvik calculated the total servicing expense using the largest fixed percentage of the invoice price rather than an application of either the grade or volume of the sales, which would have reduced the amount of the servicing charge. Therefore, we have denied Sandvik's servicing charge as an indirect selling expense for these sales because the methodology used to calculate the charge overstates the total expense by failing to account for the effect of different grades and volumes on the total amount. Final Results of Review The final results of our reviews are as follows: ␣ 1Manufacturer/exporter 1Time period 1Margin (percent) Sandvik 05/22/87&hyph;11/30/88 3.65 Sandvik 12/01/88&hyph;11/30/89 1.33 The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Furthermore, the following cash deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of this notice of final results of administrative reviews for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company listed above will continue to be the rate established in the final results of the third administrative review (57 FR 21389, May 20, 1992); (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacture of the merchandise; (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 20.47 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation by the Department (52 FR 37810, October 9, 1987; as amended 52 FR 45985, December 3, 1987), in accordance with the decisions of the CIT in Floral Trade Council v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;83. This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with sections 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 353.22 of the Department's regulations. Dated: August 17, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;20846 Filed 8&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
