The European Commission will also order an inquiry into the amounts already paid to the French manufacturer in December. A warning shot from Brussels? Tomorrow, on the initiative of [European Competition Commissioner] Karel Van Miert, the European Commission is expected to block the payment of a Fr2.5-billion grant earmarked by the French Government for 1994. This is a serious hindrance to the recapitalization of the state-owned group -- an overall Fr8.6 billion bill agreed to last November. In addition to the state, capital subscribers include France Telecom (Fr1.6 billion) and NEC [Nippon Electronics Company] (Fr0.4 billion). In the meantime, an inquiry into the Fr6.1 billion already received by Bull last December will be opened by Brussels. The procedure will also entail looking at the Fr2.5-billion advance made in February 1993 by Pierre Beregovoy's government. The French state has now been warned. It must comply with Brussels' demands within a month. Although the government is eager to rescue the computer manufacturer, it may have to contend with opposition from the European Commission. The latter considers it has already shown flexibility. "We could have blocked the grants allocated in December, but we did not wish to put pressure on the French Government," it says. Today, the Commission is no longer in an accommodating mood. It says it has been waiting over a year for the business plan required for its investigation. During this period, Karel Van Miert met six times with French Industry minister Gerard Longuet. However, the documents submitted by Bull and the French state "are mere outlines and do not show details," it is said in Brussels. "We provided the Commission with the elements needed to demonstrate our determination to reorganize the company. Furthermore, the aid we received in December only amounted to Fr5.5 billion," Bull says. "How can we let everyone know about Bull's five-year strategy?" adds a senior public servant. As for the Industry Ministry, it considers it has given Brussels clear enough indications as to the changes implemented in the computer manufacturer. "A new man from the private sector at the helm of the group, recapitalization as the only financial intervention, and projected privatization: This should be enough." In any case, the figures released by trade unions yesterday as to Bull's standing are not likely to reassure Brussels. According to the unions, there was a sharp drop in the group's operating result in 1993 (a Fr3.2-billion loss as compared to a Fr642-million loss the previous year). Sales have allegedly fallen down 7 percent to Fr28 billion. These estimates are "totally erroneous" according to Bull management. Still, Bull and Brussels are now locked in a thoroughly inauspicious wrestling match.
