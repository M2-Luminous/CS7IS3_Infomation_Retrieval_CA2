Prime Minister Rabin met privately with Pope John Paul II. The two men held a relatively short 45-minute meeting. Rabin condemned the Hebron massacre and asked the pope to use his religious and moral authority to call on all parties to resume the negotiations. The pope, for his part, said that he hoped for peace in the Middle East before the year 2000. The pope briefed Rabin on his plans to visit Lebanon. As for the possibility of coming to Israel, the pope said that he looked forward to visiting Jerusalem, but did not mention any dates. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the pope with an ancient vase, approximately 3,000 years old, and said that he hoped the pope would be able to preserve the vase for another 3,000 years. Several minutes ago, we asked Prime Minister Rabin several questions pertaining to the political process. The prime minister replied that since he had just completed his visit to Washington, it was still too early to speculate on the chances for progress in the negotiations. As for the evacuation of the Jewish residents of Hebron, Rabin said: Although we will not reopen the Oslo and Cairo agreements we will definitely take more steps to guarantee the security of the Palestinians in the territories. The prime minister described the design of the Jewish settlement in Hebron as stupid.
