[Zhu Senlin] In 1979 the central authorities decided to adopt "special policies and flexible measures toward Guangdong" (setting up special economic zones on a trial basis and implementing a new economic management structure), calling on Guangdong to carry out reform and opening up ahead of others. In 1988 the central authorities again designated Guangdong as China's comprehensive test region for reform and opening up and called on it to boldly explore reform and opening up. Over the past 15 years, Guangdong has unswervingly implemented the central principles and policies, brought into full play its advantages in being close to Hong Kong and Macao and having many of its nationals abroad, energetically pushed forward various market-oriented reforms, and made great efforts to open wider to the outside world, thus enabling the province's national economy to enter the best historical period since the founding of the People's Republic. With an average annual growth rate of 13.8 percent GDP, it doubled and quadrupled the 1980 figures in 1987 and 1992 respectively. In the course of development, the industrial structure has also been optimized, with the composition of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries readjusted from 30:46:24 to 20:46:34. Guangdong's comprehensive economic power has substantially increased and the people's living standards have markedly improved. Guangdong Has Considerably Increased Its Economic Power Since the early 1990's, encouraged by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his trip to southern China and by the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, we have seized the opportune moment to formulate a (draft) development program for the next 20 years and, with the establishment of a socialist market economy in mind, advanced reform, opened wider to the outside world, and quickened the pace toward the goal of basically achieving modernization in 20 years. In the three years between 1991 and 1993, we scored substantial achievements. 1. Rapid GDP growth. During those three years, Guangdong's annual GDP grew at 17.3, 22, and 21 percent respectively, surpassing the 12.9 percent annual growth rate laid down in the (draft) development program for the next 20 years. The 1993 GDP was 314 billion yuan and the per capita GDP was 4,830 yuan. It is estimated that Guangdong will octuple the 1980 GDP figure in 1997 and thus attain the 7,200 yuan per capita GDP quota set for the year 2000 ahead of time. 2. New developments in the export-oriented economy. During those three years, Guangdong's foreign trade volume grew by 29.6, 34.7, and 11.8 percent respectively and its proportion of the nation's export volume rose from one-fifth to one-quarter. There was an even bigger increase in the actual use of foreign capital with over 40,000 registered foreign-invested enterprises and over 30,000 enterprises engaging in the three forms of import processing and compensation trade. The export-oriented economy has become an important pillar of the Guangdong economy. 3. Major steps taken in infrastructural construction. To gradually shake off the backward situation in infrastructural construction which has restricted Guangdong's development, we concentrated our forces on the development of communications, energy, telecommunications, and other infrastructure. The last three years has seen the largest investment scale and the fastest rate of construction since the founding of the People's Republic. In 1993 alone, Guangdong increased its generator capacity by 3.88 million kw, accounting for 27 percent of the nation's newly increased volume, and built or rebuilt 1,349 km of first- and second-class highways. The continued improvement of the infrastructure has created good conditions for Guangdong's future development. 4. Marked improvement in the people's living standards. The rapid economic growth has brought increased material benefits to the people. In 1993 the wage level of workers and staff members rose further and, on the basis of a 24.8 percent increase in the 1992 payroll, grew by another 32.8 percent; the peasant per capita net income was 1,675 yuan, an increase of 367 yuan over the previous year, which had seen an increase of 165 yuan over 1991. After allowing for price rises, the income of urban residents and peasants rose by 10.1 and 6.1 percent respectively. The balance of savings deposits by urban and rural residents has grown by about 40 billion yuan annually over the past three years. New Developments in Introduction of Foreign Capital [WEN WEI PO] What is the current situation regarding the introduction of foreign capital to Guangdong? What does Guangdong plan to do in the future? [Zhu] Since the early 1990's, Guangdong has seen an unprecedentedly good momentum in the use of foreign capital. The amount of foreign capital actually used has risen by a large margin annually. According to statistics, it was $2.583 billion in 1991, an increase of 27.7 percent over the previous year; $4.861 billion in 1992, up 88.2 percent; and $9.652 billion in 1993, up 98.6 percent. In those three years, we actually used $17.096 billion, more than the sum total for the whole of the 1980's. This has effectively made up for the shortfall in Guangdong's construction funds and played an important role in the development of Guangdong's national economy. Since the early 1990's, Guangdong's use of foreign capital has shown the following new features: First, the flow of foreign capital has become more rational and the investment pattern has further optimized. Foreign investment has spread to the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, involving all trades and professions. There are energy, communications, telecommunications, and other infrastructural projects, as well as crop farming, aquaculture, intensive processing of farm and sideline products, and other agricultural development projects; technological transformation of old enterprises, new and high technology, and capital-intensive projects; and information, technological development, engineering design, property agency, real estate, advertisement, decoration, insurance, and other tertiary industrial projects. The flow of foreign capital to communications, energy, and other infrastructure, as well as tertiary industry, has markedly increased in recent years. Second, the investment scale has expanded and the number of large foreign enterprises and consortia investing in Guangdong has increased. For example, foreign investment accounts for 40 percent of the total investment in Plant C of Shajiao Power Plant, which comes to $1.965 billion; it accounts for 474 million yuan of the 1.6 billion yuan in total investment for the eastern section of the Shenzhen-Shantou Expressway; and it accounts for 40 percent, or 2.32 billion yuan, of the total investment in the eastern lane of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai Expressway, which comes to 5.8 billion yuan. The U.S. consortium, A.G. Corporation, has invested $250 million in the Huizhou-Heyuan Expressway; foreign investment accounts for 45 percent of the total investment in the Zhuhai Power Plant, which comes to $1.18 billion. These investments have all been made in recent years. Third, the sources of foreign capital are varied. The foreign businesses investing in Guangdong are not restricted to Hong Kong, Macao, and a handful of countries but cover nearly 50 countries and regions in the whole world. A pattern of pluralistic sources of investment is gradually taking shape. Fourth, the work of using foreign capital in mountain areas or underdeveloped areas has developed rapidly. These areas are rich in natural resources. With the constant improvement of the investment environment, plus the relatively low prices of labor and land, these areas have now become new hot spots for foreign investments. According to statistics, the six cities situated in mountain areas, Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing, Heyuan, Meizhou, and Shanwei, actually used a total of $380 million in foreign capital in 1992, an increase of 150 percent over the previous year. The use of foreign capital reached a new high in 1993, reaching $801 million, an increase of 110 percent over the previous year. Now that Guangdong is forging ahead toward the grand objective of basically achieving modernization in 20 years, it needs to import large amounts of construction funds and technology. It has decided to take the following measures: 1. In light of the economic development level in the different areas of Guangdong, we will match the work of using foreign capital to the conditions in the special economic zones, the open cities, the coastal open economic zones, and the mountain regions, bring their advantages into play, and advance comprehensively. As regards the method of using foreign capital, we shall use both tangible funds, such as capital and equipment, and intangible funds, such as patents, trademarks, techniques, and technologies; the channels of using foreign capital can be varied, such as direct investment, loans by international financial organs and foreign governments, and securities investments. The localities and enterprises using foreign capital should use capital not only from Hong Kong and Macao but also from other countries and regions. In particular, they should use as much capital and technology as possible from large enterprises and consortia in other countries. 2. Boost and accelerate adjustment of the industrial structure with the introduction of foreign capital. On the basis of doing a good job in evaluating assets and registering property rights, some state-owned enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises can sell some of their interests to foreign businesses. In accordance with the state's industrial preferential policy, we will offer corresponding preferential treatment to foreign investments which conform to the state's industrial policy. Under the present circumstances, we particularly encourage foreign businesses to directly invest in high and new technology industries, energy projects, ports and wharves, highways, airports, and local railway construction projects, as well as petrochemical, automobile, electronics, metallurgical, construction materials, and other pillar industries. Moreover, we shall also systematically absorb foreign investment in banking, commerce, communications, tourism, and other tertiary industies. We will strive to set up more branches of foreign-funded banks and Sino-foreign joint venture banks in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Foreign businesses are welcome to invest in and operate real estate and to gradually move from the coastal to the interior mountain areas. In tourism, we will absorb foreign capital for the development of tourism resources and the construction of tourist and holiday resorts. Therefore, there are very broad prospects for foreign businessmen to invest in Guangdong. Improve the Environment To Attract Foreign Businesses 3. Create a more favorable soft and hard environment for foreign investment. We should step up the construction of power, ports, wharves, expressways, modern telecommunications and information networks, and other infrastructure and strive to improve the work efficiency and service quality of customs, border inspection, commodity inspection, and transport departments, raise the benefit of imported projects, and maintain a good debt repayment capability. At present, particular attention should be paid to the following two aspects: First, keep on improving policies. While comprehensively pushing ahead with various reforms to establish a socialist market economy, in light of the new developments and problems that have cropped up in the course of reform and in coordination with the actual situation in our province, we should promptly formulate support policies and establish a perfect set of rules and regulations involving foreign investors so that foreign businesses can have rules to go by when investing in Guangdong and their legitimate rights and interests can be protected. Second, energetically develop a foreign investment service system in society as a whole. Further efforts should be made to establish and improve, within foreign economic relations and trade departments at all levels in Guangdong, the foreign investment service establishments which practice enterprise-style management, focus on services, charge rationally, and win the trust of foreign businesses through high-quality service. Foreign investment service establishments set up in the departments in charge of major industries will coordinate with the service establishments set up in foreign economic relations and trade departments. With the coordination of the associations of foreign-invested enterprises in the province and cities, these establishments will form a service network crisscrossing the province and providing policy and legal consultancy as well as other services. We will set up more enterprises serving foreign-invested enterprises like the Shenzhen Capital Goods Service Center. 4. Constantly improve the planning and initiative in the work of inviting investments. The Guangdong Provincial Investment Invitation Bureau has been set up. Its principal task is to synthesize and coordinate the province's work of inviting investment, act as a go-between for foreign businesses investing in Guangdong, and provide foreign businesses with efficient services, such as organizing trade talks, arranging for investment spots, and examining and approving projects. Smooth Progress in Various Reforms [WEN WEI PO] What is the main direction of your attack in the year of storming heavily-fortified positions in reform? What are the measures? [Zhu] This is a crucial year for comprehensively deepening the reform. It can also be called a "year of storming heavily fortified positions in reform." In line with the state plan to "make breakthroughs in some key areas and press ahead with the whole project," we will conscientiously do a good job of reform in seven aspects: Fiscal and tax, banking, foreign trade, enterprise, social security, urban housing, and government institutions. Viewed from the practice during the first five months of this year, the reforms in our province have made smooth progress and have been well coordinated. This has boosted Guangdong's national economy. In the first four months of this year, Guangdong's total industrial output value was 125.34 billion yuan, an increase of 22.5 percent over the same period of last year; export volume was $11.467 billion, up 115.4 percent; the foreign capital actually used was $2.187 billion, up 37.6 percent; the balance of bank savings deposits was 273.584 billion yuan, an increase of 25.202 billion yuan over the figure at the end of last year; financial revenue was 8.445 billion yuan, up 46 percent, which includes a 49.5-percent increase in industrial and commercial tax income; and the rising trend of prices has been curbed. These show that the central measures for pressing ahead with the various reforms to establish a socialist market economy are correct. In deepening various reforms, we should make great headway in three aspects: 1. Speed up the change of enterprise operational mechanism and establish a modern enterprise system to lay a good foundation for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Do a good job of the various basic tasks for the establishment of a modern enterprise system, focusing on continued implementation of the "PRC Law on Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People" and the State Council's "Regulations on the Change of Operational Mechanism in Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People" and earnestly put into effect enterprise decisionmaking powers in operation and management. We should comprehensively implement the "General Rule on Enterprise Finance" and the "Criteria for Enterprise Accounting" and establish an enterprise financial and accounting system in keeping with international practices. Guangdong has selected 250 enterprises of different types to experiment with the establishment of a modern enterprise system and then to gradually popularize the experience we have gained. Starting with clarification of property rights, we will launch in 1,200 enterprises the work of reappraising the stocks and assets, defining property rights, assessing assets, authorizing capital, and registering property rights and strive to explore the method of diversifying the composition of state-owned enterprise property rights. Meanwhile, we should establish and perfect a system for managing state-owned assets and an effective system of operations to ensure the preservation and increase of the value of state assets. In keeping with the provisions of the "Corporate Law," we will systematically implement a corporate system among existing enterprises in light of different conditions and reorganize them into joint-stock companies, limited liability companies, and sole corporations; all new enterprises should practice the corporate system. The process of implementing the modern enterprise system should be closely combined with improvements in enterprise quality and the promotion of enterprise development. Use Considerable Force To Reform the Fiscal and Tax Structure 2. Do a good job in reforming the fiscal and tax structure to ensure that enterprises can compete on an equal basis and that the government macroeconomic regulation and control capability can be increased. We started reforming the tax-sharing system and the financial management system in 1994. That is to say, in line with the division of authority between the central and local governments, we have rationally defined the scope of financial expenses at different levels and, in line with the principle of combining authority which controls enterprises and undertakings with financial power, uniformly divided the tax categories into central tax, local tax, and tax shared by central and local governments and established the central tax collection and local tax collection systems. Meanwhile, we have also conducted reform of the tax system. Its main contents include: Establishing a unified personal income tax; unifying the income tax of domestically funded enterprises as of 1994 and, as the next step, unifying the income tax of domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises; reforming the circulating tax, which consists of the value-add tax, consumption tax, and sales tax and is uniformly applicable to both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, and abolishing the industrial and commercial consolidated tax imposed on foreign-funded enterprises; and imposing the land value-added tax (not implemented for the time being), securities transaction tax, and estate and gift taxes. Due to the strong force of the current fiscal and tax reform, which involves a wide-ranging area, some enterprises were unable to adapt themselves at the beginning and some foreign businesses had misgivings. Through publicity and explanations by the relevant government departments, large numbers of enterprises, cadres, and people have a fairly comprehensive understanding of the new fiscal and tax structure, thus ensuring the smooth implementation of the new structure. Some aspects of the fiscal and tax reform have yet to be improved and coordinated in practice and detailed rules and regulations have yet to be worked out on certain issues. In short, in conducting this reform we should not only expand the financial sources but also arouse the enthusiasm of all quarters. 3. Steadily push forward banking reform to promote the benign cycle of economic construction. We should vigorously organize implementation of the state's banking reform program and, in light of the state-defined credit scale, ensure the correct flow of capital and increase its use efficiency so that economic construction can run smoothly. It is necessary to bring into fuller play the advantages of existing local banking institutions in flexible operations, such as the Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation and the Guangdong Development Bank, and develop overseas business while stepping up management. We must speed up the development of Guangdong as a financial center and establish a unified and standardized financial market across the province. Further efforts should be made to improve the Shenzhen Securities Exchange and the Guangzhou Nanfang Securities Trading Center and increase the number of listed securities. We should strive to list more companies in the securities markets outside the border and energetically raise fund for the construction of infrastructure in Guangdong. To ensure the smooth progress of various reforms, we should also speed up implementation of a new, unified social security system, establish and improve a system for the socialized supervision and service of social security, continue the comprehensive implementation of the "Provisional Regulations of Guangdong Province on Social Endowment Insurance" and, where conditions permit, experiment with an endowment insurance system in the rural areas which relies mainly on individual reserves and accumulation with a community assistance subsidiary.
