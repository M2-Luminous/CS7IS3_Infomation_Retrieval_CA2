Acting in accordance with Greek Cypriot tactics, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and his representatives continue to maintain the approach they adopted to place us in a difficult position. In his report to the UN Security Council, Butrus-Ghali claimed that President Rauf Denktas objected on 21 March to the issues that were included in the package of CBM's after it was punctured some time ago. Butrus-Ghali's report said that Denktas objected to the proposals on the access road to Maras [Varosha], Nicosia International Airport's air traffic rights, simultaneous and equal advantages for Turkish and Greek Cypriots, and collection of custom taxes by UN officials. Obviously, the report created the conditions Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis needs to maintain his tactics. It will be recalled that he has already said he "will agree to the document if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." The fact that Butrus-Ghali quoted Glavkos Kliridhis as saying that he would accept the UN document if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side, that is, the document he conveyed to the two sides through his representatives on 21 March, is an indication that he wishes to give the Greek Cypriot side's tactics a chance. Obviously, those who have punctured the package of CBM's to satisfy the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, regardless of the fact that that package was supported by experts, have now put the ball in the Turkish Cypriot side's court. This approach will neither be the first nor the last.... An effort is being made to change whatever dissatisfies the Greek Cypriot side and have the Turkish Cypriots agree to new elements. Accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of obstructing the implementation of the CBM's, when changes are made on matters related to Maras and the Nicosia International Airport in accordance with the Greek Cypriot side's wishes, can only be described as an unrealistic approach that is aimed at allowing the Greek Cypriot side to maintain its two-faced policy. UN officials have succeeded in persuading the two sides in Cyprus to agree in principle to hold talks on the package of CBM's. However, they then moved to puncture that package and force the Turkish Cypriots to agree to the changes they made in accordance with Greek Cypriot demands. Meanwhile, considering the fact that the Greek Cypriot side stands to gain from the changes and additions, which will definitely undermine the spirit of the CBM's, the Greek Cypriot Administration has disclosed that it "will agree to the document if it is accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side." Obviously, this is a tactic aimed at accusing the Turkish Cypriot side of maintaining an irreconcilable approach. Apparently, the point we have reached has confirmed that suggestions made by certain individuals among the Turkish Cypriot people to the effect that "the game must be played wisely" have been useless. The outcome has been as expected. We have been blamed for the deadlock again. Obviously, the objective was to place the Turkish Cypriot side in a difficult position.... Regardless of whatever we do, we shall continue to be blamed as long as we refuse to approach the Greek Cypriot side's position. Meanwhile, the UN officials will continue to create advantages for the Greek Cypriot side. The United States must be careful not to be misled by these tactics.
