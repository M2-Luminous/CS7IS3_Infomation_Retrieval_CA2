She said the victims, among some 200 people injured by the Saturday blast that also killed 68, would be transported to Ancona, Italy, where officials have offered 10 hospital beds. The remainder would be transported to American hospitals in Germany. On Sunday, 50 wounded people and 74 family members were evacuated from the Bosnian capital. Among the wounded were 24 people injured in the market blast and a similar attack on a food line on Friday. The rest of the injured had been on a waiting list for evacuation. Begkoyian said only mothers of the victims were allowed to accompany them as their fathers must fulfill their military obligation. She said 96 of those wounded by the market attack are being treated at the city's Kosevo hospital and 31 others are at the French hospital. She said those slightly injured by the blast have been sent home and many have been amputated. Begkoyian said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is also seeking to evacuate 160 additional patients from Sarajevo, most of them suffering from kidney problems. In Germany, a spokeswoman at the the Ramstein US airbase near Kaiserslautern said the victims were expected to arrive around 6:00 p.m. (1700 GMT). According to a spokesman at the Frankfurt airbase handling humanitarian aid to Bosnia, among those due to arrive would be between 12 and 20 stretcher cases. Sunday evening three planeloads of Sarajevo wounded and their relatives arrived at Ramstein. They comprised 35 stretcher cases, 15 walking wounded and 79 relatives, the spokeswoman said. The wounded were taken to the US hospital at Landstuhl near Ramstein.
