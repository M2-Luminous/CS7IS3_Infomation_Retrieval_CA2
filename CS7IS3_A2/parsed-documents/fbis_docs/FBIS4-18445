Kilinc, who paid a visit to the U.S. State Department as well as holding talks with Sen. Claiborne Pell (Democrat-Rhode Island), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (Democrat-Indiana), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Clinton administration was very interested in the Kurdish issue and that they were trying to understand what's exactly going on in southeastern Turkey. Kilinc talked to the Turkish Journalists during the 35th annual convention of the International Studies Association in Washington Hilton. Accompanying Kilinc were some members of the Kurdish community in the United States and representatives of the American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN). Kilinc said he asked the Americans to facilitate the process to find a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey. "Without solving the Kurdish problem, Turkey can solve none of its other problems," Kilinc said. When asked if the U.S. officials put forward any concrete proposals, Kilinc said that they did not make any comments on the situation and their main interest at this point was to gather information. "Turkey Applied Political Solution in Cyprus" When reminded that the U.S. State Department has already spelled out a "political solution" to end the conflict in the Southeast, Kilinc said that such a political solution is not alien to Turkey since it was already put to practice in Cyprus. "What Turkey defends in Cyprus should also be put into practice in Turkey," Kilinc said. When the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] asked Kilinc if a "bi-zonal federation" is what he was referring to by the term "Cyprus model," Kilinc confirmed it but said that a federation need not be just between Turks and Kurds. "What's important is the recognition of Kurdish identity and its preservation by legal sanctions and measures. Yet we should not insist on any given rigid format. It could be federation or maybe not. What's important is to bring this issue onto our agenda and discuss it. They have federations elsewhere in the West and it works. I like the American federal system, for example. I think it's wonderful. So is the German federation." When a Turkish Journalist reminded Kilinc that the American and German federations were not based on ethnic divisions and that such an ethnic-based federation might lead Turkey to disaster, Kilinc said that Turkey could adopt a different geographic principle and end up "let's say, with seven or eight federations." "A rigid two-part system is not necessary," Kilinc said and reemphasized the need for discussing everything openly. Explaining Refah Victory TDN asked Kilinc to explain the recent election victory of the fundamentalist Refah Party (RP) in the Southeast where Kurdish national sentiment is assumed to be dominant. Kilinc said that DEP was forced to pull out from the elections due to the bombing of DEP offices and murder and harassment of DEP deputies and sympathizers. "Refah won because in the last Refah General Convention (RP leader) Erbakan declared that when in power they would recognize the linguistic and cultural autonomy of the Kurdish people. The message was not lost on the Kurdish electorate. When DEP candidates couldn't run, all their votes shifted to the RP. If we were in the elections, Refah could not win even a single province in the Southeast." Kilinc added that he did not approve of the Refah Party and what it stands for. "Refah won only 14 percent of the votes in Diyarbakir. In other southeastern cities about 50 percent did not vote. This goes to show that Refah's support is not that overwhelming and that DEP could have won the elections in the Southeast if it participated," Kilinc added. "If we entered the elections and won, the government would have somebody to talk to on the Kurdish issue. Now they have no counterpart." "If I Criticize the PKK, I Can't Go Back to Adiyaman" When asked why he did not condemn PKK's terrorist acts, Kilinc said that to speak out openly against the PKK would jeopardize his function as a "catalyst." "The PKK is an objective phenomenon. It's outside my determination. It is outside anybody else's wishes. It;s simply out there. Therefore we have to consider the existing conditions and act accordingly. If I criticize the PKK today, I can't go back to Adiyaman. And what would that accomplish, really? I'm a catalyst. We have to be rational on this issue." Kilinc will return to Turkey next Tuesday after undergoing surgery to correct an eye problem.
