FR940725-0-00134 FR940725-0-00019 Paragraph (e) of §1910.146 requires general industry employers to institute a permit system for permit space entry operations. This paragraph requires the employer to document, by means of a permit, the completion of measures required for the safety of entrants. A permit must be completed before entry is allowed into any permit space. The notice, reopening the record on Subpart B, requested comments on whether or not such permits should be required for entry into spaces addressed by the shipyard standard. The vast majority of commenters stated that a permit system as set out in proposed §1910.146 was unnecessary for incorporation into Subpart B (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;7, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;32, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;36, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;40, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;42, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;45, 11&hyph;46, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). They argued that shipyard employee safety would not be increased through the imposition of such a requirement. Many also argued that the system in use in shipyards and required by proposed Subpart B was the equivalent of a permit system (Ex. 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;10, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;32, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;36, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;51). These commenters noted that the only spaces employees were permitted to enter were those designated as ``Safe for Workers'' after initial inspection and testing. For example, Moon Engineering Co., Inc. (Ex. 11&hyph;14), stated: Moon Engineering feels a permit system is necessary for any confined space entry aboard vessels or any land-side operations. We do not believe the proposed system described in 1910.146 is feasible for shipboard applications. The system, used successfully by Moon Engineering since the early 1970's, is simple and applicable to our operation. The individual shipyard shops communicate with the Safety Department on a daily basis and advises what spaces they will be working the following day. The Safety Department uses OSHA Competent Persons and/or NFPA certified Marine Chemist to test all spaces due to be worked for that particular day. The results of inspection are posted at the entrance of the space and highlight inspection date, time, tester and whether the space is SAFE FOR WORKERS/SAFE FOR HOT WORK or whatever the status. This designation is consistent with the language of the existing 1915 standard. This Log of Inspections is available and it is the responsibility of all employees to view this documentation prior to beginning their work. This system works and has an excellent track record. Other commenters believed that a permit system similar to that required under §1910.146(e) should be imposed (Ex. 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;28, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;33, 11&hyph;34, 11&hyph;37). NIOSH (Ex. 11&hyph;33) explained this position as follows: NIOSH recommends that entry into a confined space be by permit only. *␣*␣* The permit is an authorization and approval in writing that specifies the location and type of work to be done, certifies that all existing hazards have been evaluated by the qualified person, and that necessary protective measures have been taken to ensure the safety of each worker. The permit requirements will vary by the nature of the space, the nature of the hazard, and the work to be performed. All confined spaces should be evaluated by appropriately trained and qualified persons to determine that the space involved and the work to be performed will not present a hazard to the worker; the permit system ensures that this evaluation has been performed. OSHA has not incorporated a requirement for a formal permit system in the final revised subpart B. The Agency agrees with the commenters who stated that subpart B provides an informal permit system that contains evaluation mechanisms, tracking criteria, and control measures that are as protective as the formal one required under §1910.146(e). Confined and enclosed spaces on vessels and vessel sections that might contain a dangerous atmosphere are certified ``Safe for Workers'' when they are safe for employees to enter, and entry is not permitted until that certification. Shipyard employees are also trained to remain outside of any space not so certified. Additionally, under §1915.14(a)(1), a Marine Chemist (or, with certain restrictions, a Coast Guard authorized person) must inspect and test the space and certify its safety before work in the most hazardous conditions can begin. Furthermore, OSHA believes that imposing a §1910.146-type permit system for shipyard work because of the content and placement of the permits could undermine the effectiveness of the Marine Chemist's certificate, which is the primary vehicle for certifying certain spaces ``Safe for Hot Work.''
