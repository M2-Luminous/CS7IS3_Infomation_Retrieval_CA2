During a conversation, the Hungarian ambassador said in particular that the Hungarian Government does not recognize the so-called Ruthenian "shadow government" and regards the question of the recognition of Ruthenians as an independent nationality as a Ukrainian internal affair. The ambassador stressed that certain assessments and views with regard to the "Ruthenian" question that appear in some of Hungary's mass media do not always coincide with the government's position.
