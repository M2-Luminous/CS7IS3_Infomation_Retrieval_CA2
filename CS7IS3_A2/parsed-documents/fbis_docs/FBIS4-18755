In an interview with THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH, two leading members of the outlawed organisation, which carries out sectarian murders against Catholics in Northern Ireland under the the title of Ulster Freedom Fighters, also warned that it will continue its activities even if the IRA eventually calls a permanent ceasefire. The warning, in the wake of the IRA's refusal to extend its three-day ceasefire of last week, will deal a further heavy blow to John Major's peace initiative. The IRA resumed its campaign early yesterday morning shortly after the ceasefire ended, when shots were fired at two army checkpoints near Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh. The two UDA leaders, who described themselves as the heads of the UDA's southeast Antrim and south Belfast battalions, also confirmed that the UDA has drawn up contingency plans in the event of civil war in Northern Ireland, which they believe is moving closer, and called for clarification of the Downing Street declaration. In what appeared to be a direct threat to members of the Irish Government, one of the men said: "There's a price to pay. They haven't paid it yet...all their dues are being recorded and they'll have to pay up." The Republic, they said, must abandon its constitutional claims on Northern Ireland, and what they see as "one geographical state thinking" aimed at removing Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and bringing about a united Ireland. They described the Irish Government as part of a "pan-nationalist front" that includes the IRA, Sinn Fein and the SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party]. The UDA's campaign would therefore continue, they said, since in the event of an IRA ceasefire the constitutional claim would remain. One of them confirmed that the UDA would continue its activities even were the IRA to lay down its weapons permanently: "There must be a prize for the IRA to call a ceasefire. The reasons for it would have to be closely looked at. Our days of reacting to the IRA are over as far as we are concerned. Our agenda now is pro-active." The other man said: "We see a grim future. I think civil war gets nearer by the month, and that's not warmongering, that's a fact." Anyone who believed that Unionists would allow themselves to be drawn into a united Ireland was "making a big miscalculation," he said. "The feeling in our community now is that violence pays. Morale has worsened since the declaration was signed. The only people that we can trust are ourselves." The UDA leaders said that the joint declaration by the British and Irish Government "means nothing to us." However, they added that clarification would be welcome: "The IRA want to know ,what comes next. We would like to know that too." The two men said the UDA is stepping up its political profile. A working party is drawing up a paper based on two previous publications, Beyond the Religious Divide and Common Sense, which favour power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and a bill of rights. "It aims to fuse the two together, and we expect to publish it in about two months." They indicated that the UDA may propose an independent Northern Ireland, which would have links with Britain and the Republic within an expanding EC. Nationalists in Northern Ireland would be allowed to pursue their aspirations democratically, although institutional north-south links were ruled out. "We can all be good Europeans, and are willing to extend the hand of friendship towards London and Dublin. But we will never be forced into a united Ireland."
