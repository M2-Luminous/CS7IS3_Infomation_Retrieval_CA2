Thigpen, President of KRT Drywall/Acoustical, by Federal Express, postage prepaid, at the following address: 1375 West 200 North, Logan, Utah 84321. Sonya Boyd, Legal Technician. Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 1 Plaintiff Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (``OFCCP'') filed this action on July 12, 1994. As is set forth more fully in OFCCP's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions filed this date, defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical a/k/a Construction Associates (hereinafter ``KRT'') failed to answer the Administrative Complaint or to request a hearing within the period provided by the applicable regulations. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.6 and 60&hyph;30.32. The Administrative Law Judge therefore is required to enter a default judgment against KRT. 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.32(c). 1 All the statements contained in this document have been drawn from the Administrative Complaint and OFCCP's Requests for Admission. Because KRT failed to answer the Requests for Admission, they should be deemed admitted. OFCCP proposes that the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law be included in the Order of Judgment issued in this case. I. Findings of Fact 1. KRT Drywall/Acoustical (``KRT'') is a construction contractor specializing in drywall work. 2. At all times pertinent hereto KRT has held a federal or federally assisted construction contract or subcontract of $10,000 or more. 3. On May 12, 1992, OFCCP commenced a compliance review of KRT. 4. On May 26, 1992, OFCCP issued to KRT a Notice of Violation finding that KRT had violated its affirmative action obligations in six specific respects and was not in compliance with the requirements of Executive Order 11246. 5. On June 16, 1992, OFCCP and KRT entered into a Conciliation Agreement resolving the deficiencies identified in the May 26, 1992 Notice of Violation. 6. KRT agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to provide OFCCP with personnel activity reports at six month intervals. These reports were to include information for the relevant six-month period on the number of vacancies for each craft, the number of contacts KRT had with linkage and recruitment sources to fill those vacancies, the number of applications received by KRT from each of its recruitment sources, the number of hires, and the total number of applicants and hires by race, sex and ethnicity. 7. The Conciliation Agreement was to remain in full force and effect until OFCCP determined that KRT had submitted two acceptable reports as defined by the Agreement. 8. KRT agreed in the Conciliation Agreement to notify certain employment and recruitment organizations when job vacancies arose and to seek referrals from those organizations. The organizations to be contacted included the Turning Point Program, the Indian Employment Service and the Utah State Job Service. 9. The first personnel activity summary report was due to OFCCP on November 10, 1992, and was to cover the period of May 1, through October 31, 1992. 10. On November 30, 1992, KRT submitted a report which stated that the company had hired 10 male applicants in the six month period covered by the report. 11. KRT's first personnel activity report was not timely submitted. 12. KRT did not notify the Indian Employment Service or the Turning Point Program of these 10 openings and did not request that these sources supply applicants for any of these positions, as agreed upon in their conciliation agreement. 13. KRT did not specifically request qualified female and minority applicants when it listed job openings with Job Service.
