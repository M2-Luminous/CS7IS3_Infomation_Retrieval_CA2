At a press conference here, Ilievski said the census will take place in the conditions of continuing systematic violations of the human rights of citizens of Bulgarian nationality and its results will not be objective and reliable. The leader of this opposition party outlawed by Macedonia's Supreme Court in January said the questionnaires for the census did not contain "Bulgarian nationality" as an option. He also said this year's census will violate the major document of the UN Economic and Social Council saying such censuses should take place in a year ending in 0 or 5. Ilievski discussed his Geneva visit from June 1 to 3 and said he briefed on these matters the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, the UN Commission on Human Rights and international nongovernmental human rights groups.
