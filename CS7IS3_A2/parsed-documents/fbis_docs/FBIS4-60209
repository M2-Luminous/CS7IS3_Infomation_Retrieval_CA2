Salih told a press conference at the presidential palace that fighting had raged on after southern forces ignored a three-day truce the north declared late Friday. Southern troops were still fighting so "there is no ceasefire," he said. "We already said we were adhering to the ceasefire but the separatist forces initiated fighting on all war fronts this morning, so fighting is going on." The president added: "We are now putting a military ring around Aden," the former capital of Marxist South Yemen, which united with conservative North Yemen four years ago. "After putting this ring around Aden our intention was not to enter the city. However, after the announcement of separation by the south we are obliged to enter the city at all costs." He added: "Then the armed forces will continue to pursue the separatists in al-Mukalla," a port east of Aden where his southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid reportedly moved his base earlier this week. The northerners have been battling to reach Aden all week, but had earlier said they would only blockade the city but not enter it, and promised not to harm the civilian population of more than 500,000. The north had announced the ceasefire for the Moslem feast of 'Id al-Adha (sacrifice), which starts on Saturday. Asked how long the war, now in its third week, would last, Salih said: "This decision can be made only by commanders in the field. We hope it would end as soon as possible." "We are facing the war machine of a former state which was a member of the socialist bloc, armed to the teeth," he said. But he added that Bid's army had lost 80 percent of its equipment since the start of the conflict on May 5. He charged that two Tupolev transport planes had arrived at al-Mukalla airport and another ship was unloading military hardware at the city's port. "These aircraft and ships will be considered as the enemy," he warned. He said a number of southern units had "declared loyalty to the legitimate authority after they heard the declaration of separation," especially the powerful 'Abbas brigade in the oil- producing province of Shabwaho. Several members of al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party had also assured him of their loyalty. "Al-Bid has no cause," he said. "If he had a cause he would have stayed in Aden, now he has escaped to al-Mukalla. "Al-Bid will eventually have to run away to Oman or Saudi Arabia. He will eventually have to join his separatist colleagues living abroad. In fact, he has already sent away his family." Asked about possible support from other Arab countries for al- Bid, Salih said: "Any Arab country or friendly state which may try to sympathise with this position puts itself in the rank of the enemies of the Yemeni people." "This would represent a flagrant interference in Yemen's internal affairs," he said.
