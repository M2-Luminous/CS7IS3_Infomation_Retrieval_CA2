FR941205-0-00054 FR941205-0-00012 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;77] Correction to Amendment of Class E Airspace; Lyndonville, VT AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final Rule; correction. SUMMARY: This action corrects errors in a final rule purporting to establish Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT, published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40800). That action was a result of a review of standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Caledonia County Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. This action corrects references in the final rule to show that the final rule revises airspace already designated instead of establishing new controlled airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles M. Taylor, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7532; fax (617) 238&hyph;7560. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On August 10, 1994, the FAA published a final rule (59 FR 40800) to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) purporting to establish Class E airspace at Lyndonville, VT. The proposal was prompted by a review of standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP's) for Caledonia County Airport which showed a need for controlled airspace upward from 700 feet above the surface to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at the airport. The final rule described the action as establishing new controlled airspace. Since Class E airspace already existed at Lyndonville, this action corrects references in the final rule to show that the final rule revises the description of airspace already designated instead of establishing new controlled airspace. Correction to Final Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the final rule relating to the Lyndonville, VT Class E airspace as published in the Federal Register on August 10, 1994, (59 FR 40800), ( Federal Register Document 94&hyph;19405), is corrected as follows: On page 40800, middle column, change the title of the action from ``Establishment of Class E airspace, Lyndonville, VT'' to ``Amendment of Class E airspace, Lyndonville, VT.'' On page 40800, middle column, Summary section, 1st line, change the word ``establishes'' to ``amends.'' On page 40800, middle column, History paragraph, 5th line, change the word ``establish'' to ``amend.'' On page 40800, 3rd column, 3rd paragraph, 1st line, change the word ``establishment'' to ``amendment.'' On page 40800, 3rd column, The Rule paragraph, 2nd line, change the word ``establishes'' to ``amends.'' On page 40801, 1st column, in the amendment to incorporation by reference, change the first line of the description of the airspace from ``ANE VT E5 Lyndonville, VT [New]'' to ``ANE VT E5 Lyndonville, VT [Revised].'' * * * * * Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on November 21, 1994. John J. Boyce, Acting Manager, Air Traffic Division, New England Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29795 Filed 12&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
