FR940712-0-00029 FR940712-0-00010 The observer requirements and the requirements for electronic communication capabilities are necessary for NMFS to monitor the ``other'' salmon bycatch limit effectively. The affected mothership processing vessels and processors must obtain for observers' use the data entry software program provided by the Regional Director. To enable the observers to report haul-by-haul statistics and salmon bycatch numbers on a daily basis, the operator of each mothership processor vessel that receives fish harvested in the CVOA must provide INMARSAT Standard A satellite communication capabilities and associated software (cc:Mail remote and a data entry program provided by the Regional Director) for observers' use. Each mothership processor vessel must also have the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith and having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program: a personal computer (PC) with a 386 or better processing chip, a DOS version 3.0 operating system, and 5 megabytes of free hard disk storage available for the observers' use. Each shoreside facility that receives pollock harvested in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season and that is required to have 100-percent observer coverage under 50 CFR 672.27 and 675.25, must have the capability to transmit data over telephone lines using a computer modem. These processors will make available to observers the following equipment or equipment compatible therewith: a PC with a 386 or better processing chip, with at least a 9600 baud modem, and a phone line. The PC must be equipped with a mouse, Windows version 3.1 or a program having the ability to operate the NMFS-supplied data entry software program, and have at least 5 megabytes of free hard disk storage. Economic Considerations Pollock harvests during the non-roe season are apportioned between the ``inshore'' and the ``offshore'' components. During the 1993 non-roe season, the inshore component was comprised of seven shoreside processing plants, one mothership processor vessel, and five trawl catcher/processors. These processors processed approximately 235,000 mt of pollock. The offshore component was comprised of three mothership processors and 52 trawl catcher/processors. Sixteen of these trawl catcher/processors also received pollock deliveries from catcher vessels. The offshore component harvested about 414,000 mt of pollock during the directed non-roe season fishery. Sixty-five trawl catcher vessels delivered pollock to shoreside processing plants and 25 trawl catcher vessels delivered pollock to mothership processors. These 90 catcher vessels delivered about 233,000 mt of pollock to shoreside processing plants and 121,000 mt to mothership processor vessels, for a total of about 354,000 mt of pollock. Therefore, trawl catcher vessels harvested about 55 percent of the pollock during the 1993 non-roe season and trawl catcher/processors harvested about 45 percent. The salmon savings area is completely within the CVOA. Closure of this area would affect only the pollock harvest areas available to trawl catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants and mothership processor vessels. Most of the harvest by these catcher vessels during the 1993 non-roe season occurred within the CVOA. Preliminary examination of 1993 ADF&G fish tickets indicates that at least five out of seven shoreside processing plants received some pollock harvested within the salmon savings area during the 1993 pollock non-roe season. Harvests within the salmon savings area represented about 10 percent of the total 1993 non-roe season pollock harvests by trawl catcher vessels delivering to shoreside processing plants. Closure of the salmon savings area would only occur if the salmon bycatch limit was reached and would not affect significantly the opportunity available to catcher vessels to harvest available pollock TAC. Most of the area within the CVOA that is currently available to the catcher vessels would remain open to pollock fishing. Based on 1993 non-roe season fishing patterns, closure of the salmon savings area would have resulted in relocation of catcher vessels within the Bering Sea for less than 10 percent of their pollock harvests. The observer and equipment requirements of this action apply only to mothership processing vessels or shoreside processing plants receiving fish caught by catcher vessels from the CVOA. Direct costs are limited to those participants, estimated to be four mothership processing vessels and seven shoreside processing plants.
