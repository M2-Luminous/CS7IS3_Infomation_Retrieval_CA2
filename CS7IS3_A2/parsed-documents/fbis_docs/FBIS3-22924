Miriam Ortiz has the report. In his latest speeches, President Cesar Gaviria always linked the Cali Cartel to the controversy over the presence of U.S. military personnel in Juanchaco. The defense minister today reiterated his position, which many people are now viewing as plausible. [Begin Pardo recording] When the whole thing began, we noticed that drug traffickers were interested in some aspects of this scandal. I also think that the debate has had its own dynamics, and in many cases it is also a product of some people's deep-rooted ideas. We are not discarding the possibility that some sectors linked to drug trafficking are interested in this situation. [end recording] Pardo also said that as long as applicable international agreements are in effect, U.S. troops will continue to come to Colombia.
