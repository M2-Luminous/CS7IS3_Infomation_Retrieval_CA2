That is why we fluently speak the common language of development today. A civilized way of life and democracy have been threatened similarly in Colombia and Peru. Colombians and Peruvians, however, have responded readily to the scourge of narcotraffickers and terrorists. Our societies know that we will succeed in establishing a genuine peace on which we can build true progress and justice. I am convinced that as of now, based on the premise of consolidating the processes of modernization of our countries, perspectives will open so that the existing bilateral mechanisms will become more dynamic and high-level contacts between our governments will become more frequent and profitable. I am sure, President Gaviria, that Latin America's hour is at hand. The bases that we are laying today are the cornerstones of the building to be shaped by the hands of the new generations with a view to the future. Our independence will be sealed with our national development. For this new stage of Colombian-Peruvian relations and for the realization and progress of our peoples, we mutually wish ourselves much success. Thank you very much. [applause]
