Characteristics of China's Economic Development in 1993 A. Characteristics of the overall position. To judge the characteristics of the overall position of China's economic development in 1993, it is necessary to observe and study the background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations to see what position the year 1993 occupied in this round of China's economic fluctuations over the past few years. The year 1990 was the trough of China's previous round of economic fluctuations, with a 3.9 percent growth rate in gross domestic product (GDP); China's economy began rising again in 1991, and entered a new round of fluctuations, with an eight percent GDP growth rate; she saw high-speed growth in 1992, with a 13.2 percent GDP growth rate; and the growth rate for the whole of 1993 was 13 percent. Judging by the situation in each month of 1993, the growth rate of total industrial output value reached a peak of 30.2 percent in June compared with the corresponding month of the previous year; beginning in July, the temperature [of growth] declined moderately each month, falling by an average of 3.45 percentage points each month. Based on the above situation, we can draw the conclusion that the characteristics of the overall posture of economic development in 1993 were: The year 1993 was the peak year of the new round of fluctuations in China's economy, and was also a turning point in which the economic growth rate began to decline. B. Characteristics of macroeconomic regulation and control. 1. Characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control. Fluctuations in China's economy are closely linked with the macroeconomic regulation and control policies taken by the government. In 1991 and 1992, until the first half of 1993, the characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control were policies taken to comply with and promote economic acceleration and expansion, and, especially after the important talks given by Comrade Xiaoping in early 1992 during his inspection tour to southern China, the strength of such policies was further intensified, thus promoting high-speed economic growth. Beginning in June and July 1993, the characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control changed from complying with and stimulating economic expansion to a policy of moderate contraction, which caused an excessively high rate of economic growth to decline to some extent. The reason why such a change took place in the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control was that some problems appeared in economic life with high-speed growth which merited serious attention, and the outstanding problems were the "four highs, four heats, four tensions, and one chaos." The "four highs" were high investment expansion, high industrial growth, high monetary issue and credit input, and high prices rises; the "four heats" were stocks heat, real estate heat, development zone heat, and fund-raising heat; the "four tensions" were tensions in communications and transportation, tension in energy, tension in some important raw and processed materials, and tension in funds; and the "one chaos" was a chaotic economic order, in particular a chaotic monetary order. To enable high-speed economic growth to continue in a healthy and sustained manner and to enable the system of a socialist market economy to be built up successfully, the central authorities introduced in time a number of measures to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, thus making economic development in the second half of 1993 gradually become normal. 2. Characteristics of the means of macroeconomic regulation and control. The conspicuous characteristic of the means taken by the central authorities in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control was starting by rectifying the monetary order. In the past, in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, to fit in with the highly centralized system of the planned economy, macroeconomic regulation and control mainly relied on financial means; after entering the 1980's, to fit in with the transition to a socialist market system, more and more monetary means were used in macroeconomic regulation and control; in particular, in the current macroeconomic regulation and control enacted in the second half of 1993, the function of monetary means has already risen to a key position. In the past, to fit in with the highly centralized system of the planned economy, the department that occupied a prominent position in macroeconomic regulation and control was the State Planning Commission; now, to fit in with the transition to a socialist market economy system, the department that occupies a prominent position is the central bank. This shows that banking and finance have already entered their appropriate core position in China's modern economic life. Such a special function of banking and finance is also fully embodied in an important goal that macroeconomic regulation and control is trying to achieve--control over the growth of fixed assets investments. In the growth of fixed-asset investments, in the years of high-speed growth since the 1980's, for example, 1984, 1985, 1987, and 1992; the rate of increase in state loans reached 47 percent, 97 percent, 31 percent, and 66 percent respectively, all higher than the margin of self-raised capital investment in the corresponding period and far higher than the rate of increase of state budgetary investments. Judging by absolute amounts, state budgetary investment in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992 declined continuously. Therefore, in the expansion and contraction of fixed-asset investments, the role of banking was distinctly strengthened, and the role of state finance declined remarkably. C. Characteristics of demand push and internal structure of industrial production. In the 1980's, the characteristics of China's high-speed economic growth in demand push were that the expansion of investment demand and the expansion of consumption demand was a two-way push. But since 1992, the characteristics of high-speed growth have been expressed in a one-way push by the expansion of investment demand, and consumption demand has been relatively smooth and steady. Regarding the growth rate (calculated at constant prices) of overall fixed-asset investments, the peak year (1985) in the 1980's was 38.8 percent, it was 42.6 percent in 1992, and it was estimated at 46 percent in 1993, which turned out to be the year which registered the highest margin of increase since the 1980's for overall asset investments. The above characteristics were shown in the sectoral structure of industrial production, and under the two-way push of investment and consumption in the 1980's, light industrial growth was faster than heavy industrial growth for several years running from 1985 to 1988. In 1990 and 1991, light industry continued to grow faster than heavy industry, but under the circumstances of a one-way push by investment in 1992 and 1993, heavy industry turned to grow faster than light industry. Total heavy industrial output value for 1993 was estimated to grow by 25 percent, and total light industrial output value by 23 percent. Before the 1970's, China emphasized one-sidedly the development of heavy industry. From 1953 to 1978, the average growth rate of total heavy industrial output value was higher than that of total light industrial output value, with the former at 13.8 percent and the latter at 9.3 percent. Admittedly, such a situation had something to do with the building of the initial industrialization system in the early days after the founding of the PRC, and also with the need for national defense construction, but the delay in the development of light industry also seriously held back the development of heavy industry and affected the enhancement of living standards. In the 1980's, residents' consumption and light industry made compensatory development. From 1979 to 1991, the annual average growth rate of total light industrial output value (14 percent) was higher than that of total heavy industrial output value (10.6 percent). In 1992 and 1993, the growth of heavy industry was again faster than light industry. We believe that such a characteristics will be a long-term trend in the coming one or two decades. It has something to do with the development stage of China's industrialization. At present, China has entered an intermediate stage of industrialization. According to the experiences of industrialization in some countries, in the intermediate stage of industrialization, it is necessary to take heavy industry as the dragon's head to bring up the development of the national economy. On the one hand, this is because a large amount of growth in investment requires a large amount of investment articles provided by heavy industry; on the other hand, with the heightening of residents' consumption and changes in the consumption structure, heavy industry will also be required to provide more consumer goods directly and indirectly. Moreover, proceeding from China's national conditions and also for the sake of breaking bottleneck restraints in communications and transportation, energy, and some important raw and processed materials, the high-speed growth of heavy industry is also required. Of course, it is not a one-sided development of heavy industry, but the coordinated development of light industry and heavy industry, and we cannot rule out the possibility that light industry will grow faster than heavy industry in particular years. D. Characteristics of different types of industrial enterprises. After macroeconomic regulation and control in the second half of 1993 turned tight, different characteristics were expressed in different types of industrial enterprises: State-owned industrial enterprises again faced a difficult situation, but there was a striking contrast with non state-owned industrial enterprises, which continued to grow at high speed. Since the 1980's, growth of state-owned industry has always lacked strength. The output value growth rate of state-owned industrial enterprises has always been in a low range of 3 to 13 percent. In 1989 and 1990 in particular, state-owned enterprises were faced with the difficult situation of production depression, overstocking, declining performance, and serious "triangular debts." With the high-speed growth of the national economy as a whole in 1992 and the first half of 1993, the difficult situation of state- owned enterprises was relieved slightly. However, after June and July 1993, once macroeconomic regulation and control turned tight, the difficult situation of state-owned enterprises again revealed itself immediately. If we compare the growth rate of China's total industrial output value for the same month in the previous year, October was down by 2.7 percentage points from September, and state-owned industry dropped by 3.2 percentage points. That is to say, the decline in the growth of total industrial output value was mainly borne by state-owned industry. Calculated by cumulative totals from January through October 1993, total industrial output value as a whole grew by 23.2 percent over the corresponding period of the previous year, while state-owned industry only grew by 8.6 percent, collective industry by 40.1 percent, and "foreign-invested" and other industries by 66.2 percent. At present, under the circumstances of tight macroeconomic regulation and control, rapid market changes, and an aggravation of tension in funds, a number of state-owned industrial enterprises are basically in a state of production suspension or semi-suspension. Since the 1980's, the growth of non state-owned industry has always been quite rapid. Output growth of non state-owned industry has always been in a high range of 10 to 40 percent. The proportion of output of non state-owned industrial enterprises in total industrial output value had already risen from 22 percent in 1979 (calculated by prices in same year) to 52 percent in 1992. Therefore, in the growth and fluctuations of China's industrial production, state-owned enterprises have been replaced by non state-owned enterprises as a source of growth and leading fluctuations. Such a situation was shown more obviously by the macroeconomic regulation and control of 1993. II. China's Economic Trends in 1994 and Relevant Policies A. The overall posture of economic development and overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and control. 1. The overall posture of economic development in 1994. To forecast the overall posture of China's economic development in 1994, we must similarly observe and study the background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations to see what position the year 1994 occupies in this round of China's recent economic fluctuations. We believe that in this round of economic fluctuations the year 1994 is a year of sustained and high-speed growth after the peak. Such a judgement has two meanings: First, compared with the peak of 1993, the growth rate in 1994 will decline to some extent; second, although the growth rate will decline, it will maintain a high level. According to our forecast, the GDP growth rate in 1994 will remain at about ten percent. Why will the economic growth rate in 1994 decline to some extent? Mainly for the following reasons: First, bottleneck restraints. Successive high-speed economic growth in 1992 and 1993 made it difficult for communications and transportation, energy, some important raw and processed materials, and other bottleneck sectors to cope. If we force ourselves to do so, it will inevitably lead to powerful fluctuations and big ups and downs like slamming the brakes on. Second, restraints of price rise. Continued high-speed economic growth in 1992 and 1993 has already brought about big increases in prices. If the economy continues to operate at high speed, it will be difficult for society to bear price rises, which could affect social stability and the lives of the people. Third, the moderate contraction policies that started in June and July 1993 have just made some achievements. At present, investment growth and monetary growth remain too high and the situation of revenue and expenditure balance and foreign trade still must be improved. Therefore, such a contraction policy requires persistent implementation to fulfill the task of the current readjustment and create conditions for a successful transition to next round of new growth. Fourth, a moderate decline in the economic growth rate in 1994 will loosen the bow-string that has been drawn too tight in economic life as a whole, which will be favorable to carrying forward various decisions on reform made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress and to speeding up the pace of building the system of a socialist market economy. Why does the economic growth rate in 1994 remain at a high level? First, investment will remain large scale. 1) Large numbers of projects started in the past two years need to continue, which makes the scale of construction large; moreover, some important new projects are waiting to start. 2) Earmarking large amount of funds to readjust and optimize the industrial structure is still required, as is strengthening infrastructure construction and basic industries. 3) Residents' savings continue to increase by a large amount, and banking and financial departments and affiliated organizations have also gathered a considerable amount of funds after the rectification, which has provided sources of domestic capital for investments. 4) Investment by foreign businessmen is at a second peak. The first peak was from 1985 to 1988. In the growth of overall fixed-asset investments, the growth rate of the use of foreign investments reached 30 to 48 percent. Beginning from 1992, a second peak appeared in investment by foreign businessmen, and the growth of the use of foreign investment that year reached 44.5 percent. At present, the major industrialized countries in the world lack strength in economic recovery, and large amounts of capital are looking for new investment sites. China's social, political, and economic situation are favorable, which has created favorable conditions for attracting foreign investment. In the current peak of foreign investment, investments by foreign businessmen are not just limited to coastal areas, but also go right to the interior, and they are not just limited to processing industries but also extend to infrastructure and basic industries. Second, residents' consumption demand will grow steadily. In the past two years, there were new increases in residents' income levels, the consumption structure was up-to-grade, and the selectivity of commodities purchased further increased, which competition fierce in the consumer goods market and reinvigorated what was once weak during the trough of economic growth a few years ago. The growth of residents' consumption will promote the growth of industry and tertiary industry. Third, in the second half of 1993, contradictions between supply and demand in communications and transportation, energy, and some important raw and processed materials were somewhat alleviated. In 1994, judged by the production capacity of these bottleneck sectors and the readjustment of imports and exports, it will be possible to sustain GDP growth of about 10 percent. Fourth, maintaining a certain growth rate and allowing the economic growth rate to decline steadily and avoid large drops between years is beneficial to ironing out economic fluctuations and preventing large chain reactions and shocks between various links of social reproduction caused by excessive slumps. 2. Overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994. The economic trends of 1994 analyzed above depend in actual operations to a large extent on the orientation, strength, and implementation results of macroeconomic regulation and control policies. The overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 are "soft landing" policies, that is, policies of moderate contraction, neither powerful expansion nor overall contraction. We must be extremely careful about the strength of macroeconomic regulation and control, because if the strength of such contraction policies is not well controlled, if the strength is too powerful, it will make an already declining economy slide by a big margin; however, if the strength is too loose, it will not bring a "soft landing" into position, which will cause growth to rebound forcefully and lay hidden dangers for healthy, sustained, and high-speed economic growth in 1995 and even in the second half of the 1990's. Proceeding from the above considerations, major economic indicators of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will be controlled at: 1. GDP growth rate will be controlled at about 10 percent; 2. The growth rate of total industrial output value will be about 16 percent; 3. Overall fixed-asset investment will be controlled at about 1,360-1,400 billion yuan, about a 20-percent increase over 1993. With the price factor deducted, actual growth will be about 12 percent, slightly higher than the GDP growth rate and slightly lower than the growth of industrial production; 4. New loans will be controlled at about 550 billion yuan, about a 20 percent increase over those of 1993; 5. New monetary supply will be about 100 billion yuan, about a 17 percent increase over 1993. B. Soft restraints by the system, hard restraints by bottlenecks, and policies. Since reform and opening-up, profound changes have taken place, compared with the past in some aspects of China's economic oscillations, but fundamental changes have not yet taken place in other aspects. The changes that have taken place include: 1) In the nature of the oscillations, they have changed from classical type as the leading factor in the past to growth-type fluctuations as the leading factor. So-called classical type fluctuations refer to the fact that during periods of economic contraction, major economic indicators such as GDP, national income, total industrial output value, and other major economic indicators decline absolutely, that is negative growth. So-called growth-type fluctuation refers to the fact that during periods of economic contraction, no declines appear in the absolute amounts of major economic indicators, but growth rates slow. Such a change in the nature of economic fluctuations shows that China's economic development has more powerful strength for growth and against depression than in the past. 2) The amplitude of the fluctuations has obviously been reduced. This shows that steadiness has increased to a certain extent in China's economic development and that the government has made greater progress than in the past in controlling the direction and strength of macroeconomic regulation and control. 3) In generating a mechanism of industrial fluctuations, the role of state-owned enterprises has been reduced and that of non state-owned enterprises has been increasingly enhanced. In industrial fluctuations, non state-owned industry has already become the leading source of fluctuations. 4) In generating mechanisms and investment fluctuations, with a multiplicity of investment subjects, self-raised fund investments and bank loan investments have become the leading waves of investment fluctuations. 5) In the transmission of information on fluctuations, price signals have started playing their role. However, fundamental changes have not yet taken place in the following two important aspects: First, soft restraints by the system. If we make a comprehensive survey of China's previous economic fluctuations, the source of expansion of the investment scale exceeding national strength lay in the original planned economy system which lacked a responsibility mechanism and restraint mechanism. The problems brought about by high-speed economic growth in the first half of 1992 found their source in the delay in reforms of the investment, finance, and taxation systems and in the delay of reforms in state-owned enterprises. That is to say, the "overchaotic" economic order caused by systemic factors was the source of the "overheated" economy. Therefore, the fundamental way out is to speed up reform and quicken the pace of building the socialist market economy. The posture of economic development in 1994 is also conducive to promoting various reform measures worked out by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress. In this respect, we believe that the emphases of reform in 1994 should be: Enterprise reform for the purpose of building a competition mechanism, an encouragement mechanism, a restraint mechanism, and a risk mechanism and reform of government functions for the purpose of building an improved system of taxation, finance, investment, planning, and other macroeconomic regulation and control systems. The reforms of 1994 are large in operations and quick in pace, with extensive aspects involved, and they are of a strong nature in storming heavily fortified positions and are required to succeed in time to coordinate and complement overall work. Whether or not a "soft landing" in 1994 will be successful, and whether or not the economy can grow smoothly will be an objective examination of whether or not these reforms are successful. Second, hard restraints by bottleneck sectors. If we make a comprehensive survey of China's previous economic fluctuations, beside factors affected by politics, systems, and policies, so far as material factors are concerned, most economic expansions finally cannot but be postponed because of bottleneck restraints either in agriculture, or in communications and transportation, energy, and important raw and processed materials. Therefore, to readjust the industrial structure by vigorous efforts and fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these bottleneck sectors are important links in ironing out economic fluctuations, improving the overall performance of the national economy, and ensuring sustained and smooth economic growth. A moderate decline in the economic growth rate in 1994 will temporarily relieve bottleneck restraints. According to historical experience, what merits mentioning is that such relief should not be misunderstood as the fact that industry has been well-restructured and that bottleneck restraints no longer exist. There are two types of industrial restructuring: One type is adaptive restructuring which only has short-term significance, that is, after high-speed economic expansion, less demand makes proportional relations achieve a temporary balance at a reduced level of demand, but when the next round of high-speed expansion appears, such a balance is soon broken again. Another kind of industrial restructuring is fundamental restructuring of long-term significance, that is, unremittingly strengthen construction of bottleneck sectors, fundamentally breakthrough bottleneck restraints, and promote the national economy as a whole. Judged by historical experience, it is often the case that after adaptive restructuring of only short-term significance has achieved certain results, fundamental restructuring of long-term significance slackens. To restructure industry and strengthen the building of the bottleneck sectors are issues of strategic importance in economic development. 3. Trends in commodity prices and policies. To forecast trends in commodity prices in 1994, it is necessary to analyze the major causes of prices rises in 1993, and then see whether or not these causes will still function in 1994 and to how large an extent they will still function. There were four major causes of price rises in 1993: 1. Long-term and deep-level causes, i.e., price rises inevitably brought about by the transition from the original planned economy to a market economy. They include: 1) Under the original planned economy, cost accounting was incomplete. Now, as China is transforming from the original planned economy to a market economy and from incomplete cost accounting to complete cost accounting, this will inevitably bring about price rises. 2) Many service trades in tertiary industry were looked upon as welfare undertakings under the planned economy, and prices were set very low. In the transition to a market economy, prices will inevitably go up. 3) Under the planned economy, state finances had to render price subsidies to the production and circulation of important commodities that had a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Now, this has changed from covert subsidies to overt subsidies, which will inevitably give rise to prices rises. 2. The direct impact of the readjustment and release of prices. From the second half of 1992 to the first half of 1993, the state introduced measures to release and readjust prices for a wide range of commodities. This was a stage in which the largest steps were taken since price reform. During this period, the readjustment and release of prices was mainly concentrated on grain, energy, raw and processed materials, communications and transportation, and on prices in other tertiary industries. According to an estimate by specialists in a state department in charge of prices, the state's readjustment and release of prices in a planned way after the second half of 1992, plus increases in retail sales business tax, had an impact of 60 percent on overall price level. 3. Demand push by investment expansion and excessive monetary issuance. The years 1992 and 1993 had the highest growth rates of overall fixed assets investments since the 1980's. Powerful expansion of investment demand led to big increase in prices of building materials and the means of production, which built up cost pushes for processing industry. Moreover, expansion of the investment scale, high-speed growth in the economy as a whole, and increasing financial deficits during these two years compelled banks to issue money to excess. In 1992, money in circulation grew by 36.4 percent, in the first half of 1993 it grew by 54.1 percent, and 30 percent growth was estimated for the whole year. Excessive growth of money in circulation inevitably led to price rises. 4. The impact of a chaotic economic order, in particular a chaotic monetary order on price rises. In the second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993, there was the phenomenon of illegal bank lending of a large amount of funds that had not appeared in over 40 years; some local banks directly participated in stocks and bonds businesses and real estate investments. In the "funds-raising heat," many fundraisers competed with each other to raise dividends and bonuses. Under the signboard of developing tertiary industry, some government departments indiscriminately collected fees, increased prices, and apportioned expenses. Chaos in economic order led to "bubble"-type hotspots and helped increase prices of the means of production, real estate, stocks, funds, services, and swap foreign exchange prices. In 1994, the fourth kind of cause mentioned above, i.e., the impact of a chaotic economic order on price rises, is being overcome. The first and the second causes, that is, various kinds of cost push brought about by the readjustment and release of prices during the transition to a market economy, are still playing a great role in raising prices objectively. The remaining third cause, demand push by investment expansion and excessive monetary issue, will become the crucial link. This will depend on the results of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994. In macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994, if investment expansion and excessive monetary issuance can be appropriately inhibited to make the economic growth rate drop to some extent, then it will be possible to reduce the margin of price rises. However, if the investment growth rate, the money growth rate, and the growth rate of the economy as a whole rebound too soon and too drastically, then price increases will also go up further on the basis of the first and second causes. In corresponding policies, besides continuing to carry out the important policies of moderate contraction policies in macroeconomic regulation and control, problems to which attention should be paid and policies should be taken are: 1) In all possible factors that affect prices rise, an impact which cannot be neglected is the residents' psychology. It is necessary to pay attention to and correctly explain the causes of price rises and correctly analyze the price situation, and do not arouse residents' psychological expectation of price rise, far less stir up panic purchasing. 2) The situation of agricultural production has a direct bearing on the stability of prices. On the basis of intensifying rural reform, promoting agricultural development, and increasing peasants' incomes, further mobilize the production initiative of the peasants, and try to reap a good harvest in agriculture in 1994. 3) In 1994, affected by the lag effect of various cost pushes during the previous period, the decline in the margin of price rises of consumer goods and services may possibly be smaller than the decline in the margin of price increase for investment goods. Moreover, in the "rise amidst stability" in prices of consumer goods in recent years, there were very rapid increases and strong rigidity in prices of basic daily necessities and services which were relatively small in income elasticity and price elasticity. Therefore, for prices of consumer goods, in particular for those basic daily necessities and services, it is also necessary to give play to the role of guiding and mandatory regulation and control by the state while the functions of market regulation are brought into full play. Strengthen the management of market prices and avoid artificial prices rises. 4) In enterprise reform, encourage competition, improve performance, and strengthen enterprises' capacity to digest cost-push factors. Taken as a whole, through the various efforts being made, we can expect to keep the overall price level at about 8 percent in 1994 and create favorable conditions for a further decline in the margin of price rises in 1995 and the years to come.
