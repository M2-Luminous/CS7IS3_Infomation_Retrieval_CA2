FBIS4-408 "drafr069_c_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Summit Ends Without Deal; Further Talks Planned Summit Ends Without Deal; Further Talks Planned Leaders Hold News Conference MB0804233994 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English 2245 GMT 8 Apr 94 MB0804233994 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network English BFN [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC President Nelson Mandela near Skukuza at the Kruger National Park on 8 April-- recorded, broadcast in progress] [Text] [De Klerk] ...they had to adapt and make special arrangements to enable us to meet at this venue and we thank them very much for the very efficient service which they rendered to us and the discomfort they also had in the process, during a very popular week, in making available this special venue of which we made use. We have distributed a joint statement, which no doubt you will interpret that it hides more than it discloses. If that is your conclusion you are absolutely right because that was the intention, not because we have not had fruitful discussions, but because our discussions in many senses of the word have not been completed. For that reason we have appointed a task group with a specific instruction. You might say, oh, another task group. [laughter] I would like to say that this one is different in that it has to report back in less than a week, to the leaders, and in that there is an agreement for a follow-up meeting during which the discussions will be taken further, and this is the main reason why the statement is incomplete on all the burning issues, which are not dealt with specifically in the statement. I feel that we have made good progress in some respects today. On the burning issue and the very important issue of the accommodation and the full recognition of the monarchy of the Zulu nation, of the Zulu kingdom, I am confident that this task group will come up with good results because my perception is that between our proposals, the proposals of the ANC, the proposals from the side of Chief Minister Buthelezi and the kwaZulu government, there is already discernible, a broad consensus and that it is now a question of putting together the how -- of the accommodation and recognition of the Zulu kingdom. The fact that it is to be recognized, and that that is to be done constitutionally, I think can be accepted as having been fully established and that there is a broad consensus on that. On some of the other issues I am disappointed that we haven't made more progress, but the door is not closed and discussions will continue. There will now be a broadened basis of discussion on the issue of mediation and mediation can play a constructive and a positive role and the government will be cooperative on the basis that we reach agreement on a number of outstanding aspects affecting the issue of mediation. If we can reach such agreement mediation can make a constructive contribution towards bringing us nearer to solutions on many of the substantive issues at stake. In general, I think we have achieved today the beginning of a discussion and a continued negotiation process between main role players which should have started long ago. I have for many, many years been advocating a meeting like the one we have had today and I'm glad that at last it has taken place, and as far as the government and the National Party is concerned, we will seek ways and means of ensuring that also this important forum which has been brought together today, will continue to operate and interact with each other because there lies a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of the four people and that which they represent in public life, sitting before you. To a certain extent we have come to the brink of a very serious situation, and our responsibility is to through dialogue and negotiation, find ways and means to defuse the issue in the province and to ensure that peace comes to all the people of South Africa, and that the full opportunity for all those who want to participate, to participate freely and without fear, will be ensured and for those who choose the other options, and that is not to participate, to also do so without interference. Participation or not is a choice. It is part of the democratic process, but the rights of those who want to participate is as sacrosanct as the rights of those who don't want to participate, and I'm glad that nothing has happened today which in any way takes away from a previous agreement reached between me and Chief Minister Buthelezi, that this principle of free democratic organization for those who participate and who don't participate, is an important principle which should be upheld throughout our country in every inch and every corner. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. [Zwelethini] Well, from all that the state president has been saying, I should say to the discussions that have taken place in the meeting, which actually everybody has been ... has been looking for, I'm so pleased that the meeting has taken place today although some of my demands, as far as I'm concerned, has never been met yet, but as far as this meeting is concerned I hope that it's going to be very concerned about the problems that have been accumulated in this country, especially from the political parties whom actually their followers are in a problem of fighting against each other, which I hope that today, this meeting of today is going to show, especially to the grassroots level, that the leaders themselves -- what do they want from their own followers. So, I don't think there is anything that I can say thereof, except that the joint press statement for myself and the chief minister is going to be right by him. Thank you. [Buthelezi] Today his majesty, the king of the Zulu nation, leaders of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC and the South African Government and the National Party, and their respective delegations met in a summit in a venue within this Kruger National Park. The parties in this summit exchanged presentations on their respective positions with respect to the grave issues which are facing the country in the present national crisis. Unfortunately, progress could not be made with respect to most of the fundamental issues tabled by his majesty the king of the Zulus and by the Inkatha Freedom Party to which the leaders and the delegations of the South African Government, National Party and of the ANC, could not provide any responsive answer as they still had to consult with their cabinet and with the members of the working group through the ANC before responding. The IFP upholds the summit to seek ways and means to reach a constitutional compromise which could form the basis for a broader political settlement and reconciliation which would enable the IFP to join the electoral process on an equal footing with all other political parties of South Africa. In this respect the IFP felt that a postponement of the election date is essential to achieve an all inclusive participation. Both his majesty the king and the IFP also tabled the issue of the Shell House massacre and of the most disturbing lack of police action to secure evidence and ensure the conviction of those who perpetuated that carnage. The issue of the sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu was tabled once again by his majesty the king and the Zulu nation and an ANC proposal continued provisions to be implemented by a government of national unity after elections was found to be unacceptable by His Majesty and his delegation. The issue of violence in the country and especially in the kwaZulu-Natal area was discussed and the IFP tabled its firm opposition to the declaration of the state of emergency in kwaZulu-Natal and intervention of the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF [South African Defense Force], which has already proven to escalate the situation of violence and arrest in that region. The IFP insisted that the immediate lifting of the state of emergency is a necessary precondition to the holding of free and fair elections in the region. In order to seek compromise and reconciliation the IFP tabled further proposals to reach a constitutional settlement contained on pages five and six of the presentation delivered by the president of the IFP. Such proposals were not even discussed. International mediation between the South African Government, the IFP, and the ANC was also discussed and all parties stated their commitment to it. In this respect the president of the IFP further proposed the involvement of Norway in the mediation process, to which there was no objection from the other parties. That is a statement which His Majesty commanded me to read to you just now, and I must say that just like the state president, I feel that although there may be that disappointment that there has been nothing concrete as far as the expectations of many people in this country and also outside this country are concerned -- but nevertheless I do believe that the day was not wasted. I believe that every minute that was spent in addressing the issues of the king and the kingdom, in addressing all the other issues that the state president has mentioned and also issues that I mentioned, were well spent. [Mandela] Firstly, I would like to say that the statement read by the chief minister comes to me as a complete surprise. I certainly was not informed about it before now. The statement that has been distributed to the press was drafted by committee representatives -- all the parties involved in this discussion -- and I would have expected that if there was a separate statement we should have been informed, warned about this. The second point I want to make is that the IFP wanted the date of elections to be postponed. We have emphatically rejected that. That day is sacrosanct and there can be no compromise over it whatsoever. The third point I would like to make is that we would expect the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to give full facilities to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to deploy the voting stations and to make all preparations for the elections, as has happened in other parts of our country. There is no area in which the IEC has encountered problems and we would appeal to the authorities in kwaZulu-Natal to cooperate with the IEC. Those who want to participate in the elections should be free to do so and those who want to boycott the elections should also be free to campaign for the boycott of elections, after all, that is what democracy is all about. The only issue which we (?are against) -- as we have done in our resolution, is the question of seeking to obtain ones objective through the employment of violence. We have harshly condemned these massacres and called upon our followers to commit themselves to peace and we have condemned all forces, including those that are known and unknown which are responsible for this violence, but we hope that the authorities in that area will give full cooperation to the IEC in its work. Now, we made certain proposals to his majesty, as the ANC, in order to meet his concerns. We went out of our way to address everything which we believe a constitutional monarch would like to enjoy -- the powers, the rights which are sovereign everywhere in the world, in a constitutional dispensation, enjoy. There is hardly any power in our view which we reserved, except perhaps we were silent on the question of the right of His Majesty to communal land and to indigenous law. When this was pointed out to us we indicated that as the African National Congress we are prepared to address this question because we are keen that the fears and the concerns of his majesty must be fully addressed and I will be going back to my organization to point out that amongst the proposals that we made, his majesty felt that this particular question of his rights in relation to communal land and to indigenous laws is a matter which he feels we should have addressed, and we will treat this with all seriousness. This discussion with his majesty is going to continue. We will address it if we are unable to resolve it before the election. We propose to continue after the election. Without going into details I do not want us to have exaggerated expectations about the task group because the reasons for the reservation that have been expressed -- his majesty expressed a certain reservation about the proposals that were made to him and in my view these are reservations which cannot be properly addressed by a task group. They are reservations which can properly be addressed by a government of national unity. Nevertheless, I will not oppose any mechanism which my colleagues and all the other parties involved think might be useful, but I would like to warn you that we should have no exaggerated expectations as to what this task group is likely to achieve. Now the issue of the powers, the rights, the privileges of His Majesty, have nothing to do with the form of state. Whether it is a federation, or a unitary state, or a hybrid state, his majesty will enjoy the rights of a constitutional monarch, with all ceremonial powers. I believe that you must have gone through our proposals because they are now in the hands of the press, and we believe that subject to the two issues on which our proposals seem to be (?based), subject to those two, we believe we have gone a long way to address the concerns of his majesty. But the addressing of his concerns is totally unrelated to the form of state and that is the spirit in which we handled the affair. Now in regard to the Shell House massacre, that was raised by His Majesty and I pointed out that this matter is now in the hands of the Goldstone Commission and we better wait until that commission has made a finding. We will then take up the matter on the basis of the finding of the learned judge, and I believe that we saw more or less eye to eye on this point. Now we are unable to place before you any tangible results of these discussions, but of course as you know the fact that we sat together to exchange views is itself progress. We now know what the concerns of his majesty are, what the demands of the IFP are. We have responded to them. They know what our point of view is and further discussions, therefore, will build on what we believe the basis that was made and the proposals that were made to his majesty are a basis for further discussion of his position. The African National Congress is very much concerned about the demands of his majesty. It is one of the most illustrious royal houses in this country and we would like his majesty to feel sure that we are proud of the achievements of that illustrious royal house, and it is for that reason that the ANC has gone out of its way in order to meet the fears of his majesty, and we are, therefore, leaving the meeting in the knowledge that we have tried our best to meet the concerns of his majesty, and as I say the discussions between ourselves on his position, and his majesty, will go on before the 27 April, and if we do not reach a solution, those discussions will go on after the 27 April, but I want to make sure there should be no doubt, whatsoever, about the elections on the 27 April. As I said elsewhere, we cannot postpone our freedom and we are determined to set up a government of our own choice on that day and I hope that everyone will understand why we are so determined that the elections should take place as scheduled. [Buthelezi] I just want to clarify one thing that Mr. Mandela says, when he says that he was not informed about a separate statement that I have made. I think the issue Mr. Mandela has discussed very clearly and I think that it was Mr. Matthews in our party who stated there was a time when we were not, in fact, in favor of issuing part of a joint communique, but then the state president said that there were issues in which we had agreed, that in fact we all agreed -- it was sure. We are making it very clear that each person has the right to make their own statement. The fact that we have put down what, in fact, is our point of view doesn't mean to say that there is no right to state our own point of view, but I mean it wasn't as if we were doing this secretly. I don't know whether, maybe, Mr. Mandela could not have understood the argument. There are some arguments about it when we agreed on this matter, and I would also like to, and I would also like to say that as Mr. Mandela has put it, the discussions have gone -- inasmuch as the state president has stated -- but concerning, you know, elections the head of state in this country, Mr. de Klerk, has stated to you that in fact I have not deviated from all the undertakings that I made to him previously, and in fact all of you have got my statement which I have given to you and all of you are aware of the fact that it isn't as if on our part we are trying to, you know, to deprive the IEC of any facility that it is within our competence and powers to make available, and thirdly, I would say that when the king raised the issues that he has raised about the sovereignty of his people, and also the whole issue of the Zulu kingdom, you stated that if there had been a federal state that we would never had raised the issue. So that, therefore, I think that the issue arises precisely because the issue of the federal state, the three of us -- I think the president, the president of the ANC, and myself we are not at the negotiation council, except that they attended of course the Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] plenary sessions, which I did not attend. But I would say that the issues that the king has raised have a lot to do with the self- determination of the Zulu people, that the issue is not just a personal issue which his majesty the king raises, you know, about himself and his person and his family. It's an issue which he raises on behalf of his people as a whole, and if the issue is not, actually sorted out, and he has pleaded that it should be sorted out from January this year, when he spoke to the state president, then it is a very problematic situation because, therefore, I mean those of us, who may be members of the IFP who are Zulu speaking will find it very difficult to participate in the elections. But I would like also to draw your attention to my statement that I think I have made some very reasonable proposals because the IFP intends participating in the elections, in fact we do want to participate in the elections, and therefore, we made some very reasonable compromises in an effort to try and have this issue resolved before the elections because we do want to participate in the elections. Now to say that when there should be a government of national unity, and we should be called the government of national unity, in which we are not part of -- I think that of course is a misnomer because we cannot really be a government of national unity in this country -- in which quite a large segment of the people of South Africa are not represented. So I just wanted to clarify those issues, and to say to Mr. Mandela that there is no -- our meeting has gone on very amicably and there was no tensions in the discussions, even between us and that, therefore, there is no subterfuge, there is no issue of us issuing a statement which was secretly (?drawn up).
