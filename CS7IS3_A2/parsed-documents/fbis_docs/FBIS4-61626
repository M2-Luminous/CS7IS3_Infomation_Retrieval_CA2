More Signatures Appeared Under Social Accord Treaty Yesterday"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Before the ceremony began, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondents turned to those who had been invited to St. Vladimir's Hall to put their signatures to the accord document. "The treaty which we are signing," Yelena Voldemarova, chairman and coordinator of the Moscow Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, said, "is something Russia undoubtedly needs. But it is more the initial form of accord rather than the only necessary one. With its help we at the level of political parties and the three branches of power are -- figuratively speaking -- drawing up the ground rules. But genuine accord cannot be achieved unless all strata of the population are involved in the process. In particular, this is the task being set by the Russian Land Movement [Rossiyskoye Zemskoye Dvizheniye], of which I am the chairman." [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What specifically do you plan to do? [Voldemarova] First and foremost we need to create the legal possibility for transformations. A board of trustees has now been set up on the initiative of the Land Movement, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Union of Russian Small Towns, and the Russian Local Self-Government Union. This is a coordinating structure for implementing local self-government. If we succeed in initiating the adoption by parliament of a law on local self-government, then, in our view, we will have taken a real step toward nationwide accord. "The accord is a life belt for society," in the view of the famous economist Pavel Bunich, who was representing the Union of Industrialists and Leaseholders in the Kremlin. "It could be of educational importance. For instance, since the start of the year the State Duma has not passed a single economic law. The accord document will prompt parliamentarians to move in this direction. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that the recession does not continue this year. This is not wishful thinking. The decline cannot continue, otherwise it will be a collapse, not a recession!" In the opinion of Vladimir Bashmachnikov, president of the Association of Peasant (Private) Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives, in economic activity it is time to stop "pulling the blanket" only over ourselves and living on the basis of narrow departmental or regional interests. He believes that the agreement being signed is also aimed at preventing extremes and at stopping people from resorting to tough measures. ...The treaty has been signed by representatives of the Agro-Industrial Union of Russia, the Union of Young Entrepreneurs, the Chamber of Trade and Industry, the Interregional Society of Merchants, commercial banks.... Those present in St. Vladimir's Hall were addressed by Russian Federation Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. [passage omitted]
