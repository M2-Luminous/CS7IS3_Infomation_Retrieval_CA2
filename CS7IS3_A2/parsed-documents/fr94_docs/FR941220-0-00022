FR941220-0-00022 FR941220-0-00005 Comment: Several commenters stated that this section should be revised to allow Medicare coverage of medical social services furnished to a beneficiary's family when such services are necessary to resolve an impediment to the beneficiary's medical treatment. Response: We agree with the commenters and have revised §409.45(c)(2) accordingly to allow for Medicare coverage of medical social services furnished on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver when it can be demonstrated that a brief intervention (that is, two or three visits) by the medical social worker is necessary to remove a clear and direct impediment to the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. We believe that medical social services furnished to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver in these circumstances will enhance the effectiveness of the treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury. In those cases where a family member or caregiver is directly impeding the beneficiary's medical treatment or rate of recovery (for example, by failing to provide necessary care or by engaging in abusive neglectful behavior), we believe that short-term medical social services furnished to the caregiver or family member for the purpose of removing that impediment will greatly benefit the home health patient by enhancing the effectiveness of his or her medical treatment and, ultimately, the rate and level of his or her recovery. We also expect that, in these circumstances, the effective use of short-term medical social services will result in a reduction in the beneficiary's need for other home health services (such as skilled nursing care to observe and assess the patient's treatment and progress). In some cases, these services may also prevent a costly inpatient stay by the beneficiary necessitated by his or her unhealthy or unsafe home environment. We also note that Medicare currently covers family counseling services furnished by a physician to a beneficiary's family when the primary purpose is the treatment of the beneficiary's condition and not the treatment of the family member's problems (see §35&hyph;14 of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual). We believe that the services of a medical social worker furnished to a beneficiary's family member under similar circumstances would also be of value. In addition, this coverage is consistent with our long-standing policy regarding the coverage of home health skilled nursing visits for purposes of teaching and training family members or caregivers. Medicare has long covered a limited number of skilled nursing visits for teaching and training family members where the teaching and training is appropriate to prepare the family member to furnish treatment or support for the beneficiary's functional loss, illness or injury. Again, as with the physician counseling, Medicare covers these visits. It is important to emphasize that this revision is intended to cover medical social services furnished to a family member or caregiver only when a brief intervention will resolve a problem which clearly and directly impedes the beneficiary's medical treatment. To be considered ``clear and direct'' the behavior or actions of the family member or caregiver must plainly obstruct, contravene, or prevent the patient's medical treatment or rate of recovery. The HHA is responsible for demonstrating in its documentation that the problem is a clear and direct impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or rate of recovery. Medical social services furnished to address general problems that do not clearly and directly impede the beneficiary's treatment or rate of recovery as well as long-term social services furnished to family members, such as ongoing alcohol counseling, are not covered. Because we have limited coverage to medical social services to address only clear and direct impediments on a short-term basis, it is our expectation that medical social services furnished to family members or caregivers should require only a brief intervention on the part of the social worker, which should rarely exceed two or three visits. We intend to include an example of covered medical social services furnished to a family member in the Medicare HHA Manual. We have also revised in this final rule the paragraph (g) that we had proposed to add to §409.49. That paragraph will now exclude from Medicare coverage medical social services furnished to family members, except as provided in §409.45(c)(2). Comment: One commenter objected to this section's requirement that covered medical social services must be necessary to resolve social or emotional problems that are expected to be an impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. The commenter stated that the services of a social worker may address a wide range of difficulties in addition to those that present an impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition. Response: The Act at section 1861(m) specifically defines medical social services as a covered home health service. In addition, section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act excludes from Medicare coverage any service that is not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's illness or injury. Therefore, Medicare is limited to covering those social services that are provided to treat the patient's medical condition; that is, they are directed at resolving impediments to the treatment of the patient's illness or injury. Although we agree that professional social workers are qualified to address a wide range of problems beyond those that may affect the treatment of the patient's medical condition, we do not agree that Medicare should cover such services. Comment: Several commenters objected to the provision that covered medical social services must require the skills of a social worker or a social work assistant to be performed safely and effectively. Response: We do not believe that this requirement is unreasonable. It would not be proper for Medicare to pay a social worker to perform services that do not require his or her unique skills. It is important to note that this is a longstanding coverage requirement that also applies to skilled nursing and therapy services (see §§409.44(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii)). This longstanding requirement is intended to protect Medicare from making payment to a skilled professional for services that could have been furnished by the average nonmedical person. Comment: One commenter suggested that paragraph (e) be revised to describe Medicare coverage of certain intravenous pump supplies specifically as it is described in section 3113.4 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual.
