Aliyev stressed that the war is going on on the Azerbaijani territory. "Nagorno-Karabakh which is an integral part of Azerbaijan and seven other regions outside Karabakh are currently under complete control of the Armenian troops", he said. The president resolutely rejected media reports on major losses allegedly suffered by the Azeri army and said it is Armenians who sustain most losses. "The Armenian units are on the offensive and therefore suffer bigger losses. We are waging a just war and defend our land from the occupants", Aliyev said. The president used the opportunity to appeal to the Armenian leadership and the nation to halt the senseless war. "As the president of Azerbaijan, I guarantee safety to all Armenians who reside in Nagorno-Karabakh and their equal rights with all other citizens of Azerbaijan", he said. The president noted that his country will never agree to be dictated by force and will never "sign an agreement humiliating for our people and state".
