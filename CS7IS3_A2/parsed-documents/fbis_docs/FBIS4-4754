But in a small number of cases the local governments have already started merger moves through legal procedures, leading the government to support them. The survey conducted by KYODO News Service showed the local governments concerned with the proposed merger plans totaling 120 cities, 310 towns and 50 villages -- about 15 percent of Japan's municipalities. The Home Affairs Ministry is planning to back the proposals by extending and reinforcing a special law to help merging local governments, ministry officials said. The law which grants financial support to local governments after incorporation is realized will expire in March 1995. Of the 91 regions, local governments in four regions have already put their merger plans on track. The Katsuta city government and the Nakaminato city government in Ibaraki Prefecture, north of Tokyo, are expected to merge in October this year. Also, officials of the local governments in eight regions have started considering how to administer their future broad governments after incorporation is achieved, the survey said. The survey said 60 percent of plans recommended by private organizations, such as local chambers of commerce, envisage the incorporation of nearby towns and villages into each core city. Of these, 14 cities, including the northern Japanese cities of Morioka and Iwate, are likely to be designated as new core cities with over 300,000 residents under a new law expected to be enforced within this year. Furthermore, municipalities surrounding ordinance-designated cities such as Sendai, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu and Fukuoka have visions of their being incorporated into those cities. In Saitama, Gunma, Niigata and Shizuoka Prefectures, local governments are aiming at being promoted to ordinance-designated cities with their prefectural capitals as the center. There are 11 ordinance-designated cities in Japan. Most of the local governments polled said they are in favor of mergers because they think broad administration is expected to bring more efficiency to their jobs and help develop their regions faster. But some local governments, which have been proposed for incorporation into core cities nearby, expressed concerns over the possibility of deterioration in their public services after mergers. There are 17 prefectures in which no merger plans have been proposed by the private sector, the survey said.
