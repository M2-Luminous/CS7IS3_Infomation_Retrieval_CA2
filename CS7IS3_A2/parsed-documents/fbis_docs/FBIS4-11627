FBIS4-11627 "drlat083_p_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 Ecuador _O_ Crime, Human Rights, Unemployment Statistics _O_ Crime, Human Rights, Unemployment Statistics 94P20695 94P20695 CSO [Editorial Report] Crime -- The Andean Center for Popular Action, (CAAP), reported in the Quito daily HOY of 3 April that from 1982 to the present the country's crime rate has increased by 9.4 percent annually, exceeding the urban growth rate of 4.3 percent per year (since 1974). CAAP believes that one of the main reasons for this spiraling crime rate is the increase in poverty resulting from the economic crisis of the 1980's. Crimes against property increased 20.8 percent and represented 51 percent of the total reported crimes in 1992-93, while crimes against individuals increased 11.6 percent and represented 14 percent of total reported crimes. CAAP also reports that the regional distribution of crime has changed "drastically." For example, population groups most hit by the economic crisis, the poor in large urban areas and in the most "neglected" provinces, now register the highest crime rates. Crime increased at a faster rate in the Amazon region (19 percent), followed by the coast (17 percent), and the highlands (8 percent). The provinces with the largest increases in the crime rate were Esmeraldas (37.9 percent) and Loja (35.1 percent). In absolute terms, however, CAAP reports that Pichincha Province registered the highest crime rate with 12,900 cases per year, followed by Guayas Province with 12,600 cases. The National Rehabilitation Council reported in Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO of 23 March that, of Ecuador's total prison population of 8,856 distributed among 33 penal institutions, 4,878 are in Guayaquil and Quito. Drug-related crimes constitute 39.3 percent of all crimes for which people are jailed. Crimes against property follow at 27.2 percent. H0Y 3 April also reported that the number of people detained for drug-related crimes increased 8 percent in 1993. However, 70 percent of those arrrested were only drug possessors or consumers; drug traffickers were a small percentage of those arrested. Guayas, Pichincha, and El Oro Provinces have the highest incidences of drug-related crimes. Human Rights -- Citing the monthly journal PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, 4 April HOY reported that in 1993 human rights violations increased 65 percent, from 641 reported or detected cases in 1992 to 1,055 in 1993. The same daily also quoted CAAP statistics charging that the police are responsible for 43.9 of all human rights abuses. According to CAAP "authorities, individuals, the military, public functionaries, penal authorities, private employees, and unknown persons" are responsible for the rest of human rights abuses. Unemployment Rate -- The 18 March issue of the Quito daily EL COMERCIO reports that Labor Minister Alfredo Corral said that Ecuador now has one of the highest unemployment rates in Latin America with 14 percent of its economically active population without work and a 50 percent underemployment rate. This was contrasted with 1992 when the unemployment rate was at 8.9 percent. The minister added that unemployment and underemployment were the country's most "pressing" problems, and that the Duran-Ballen administration is committed to carrying out projects that will generate jobs mainly in the "education, health, transportation, and housing sectors." The same daily observes that the government's modernization program, launched in 1993, has "substantially" reduced employment in the public sector. In 1993, over 26,000 employees "resigned or terminated their employment with the state." It is estimated that a similar number will do the same in 1994. Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers Front (FUT), commented to EL COMERCIO that the current unemployment figures put the country on "red alert": 57 percent of unemployed are between the ages of 15 and 24; 47 percent of unemployed are women; 12 percent are heads of households; Ponce pointed out that "unemployment is a direct route to social upheaval," and it is therefore necessary for government and business to come up with a "responsible, viable, and humanitarian solution to the problem." He noted that past government labor reforms have not brought results, stating that "in 1993, 23,670 workers were dismissed and only 3 percent found other jobs." He also charged that the Labor Ministry's employment program is a "mockery of all workers," since in more than two years it has managed to create only "500 temporary positions."
