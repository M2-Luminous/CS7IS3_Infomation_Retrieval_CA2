Officials and Korean residents under the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon went to the prefectural police on June 8 to express their resentment at the authorities' refusal to make an apology. They strongly urged the police to make an apology in a responsible manner and show sincere attitude and action. The Japan Social-democratic Party [JSDP] has conducted positive activities to investigate the truth behind the police crackdown on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and lodge a strong protest with it. It decided at the Tuesday meeting of its leading officials and at the Wednesday general meeting of its Dietmen to send a fact-finding team to Kyoto and actively call the authorities to account for it at the Diet. Inquiries were made at the judicial affairs committee of the Japanese Diet on June 7 by Tomio Sakagami and, on June 8, at the Budget Committee by Sekisuke Nakanishi and at the Judicial Affairs Committee by Tatsukuni Komori, accusing the authorities of their unjust and illegal search. The JSDP Nagano prefectural headquarters, prefectural government centre and prefectural people's council, in joint name, and the chief of the JSDP Miyagi prefectural headquarters made public protest statements and sent them to the Kyoto prefectural police authorities. The 67th regular meeting of the Fukuoka prefectural Teachers' Union adopted a special resolution, and decided that all its branch organizations should take an emergency act of sending protest telegrams to the prime minister and the chief of the Kyoto prefectural police headquarters. Korean residents under Higashiosaka and Minamiosaka branches of the Chongnyon Osaka prefectural headquarters staged protests against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the Higashi police station. Delegates of the Federation of Korean Traders and Industrialists in Japan and the League of Korean Youth in Japan joined in the struggle, encouraging compatriots in Osaka prefecture. The chairman of the Higashiosaka Council for Japan-Korea Friendship, a representative of the Nishigobe Society for the Study of Korean Affairs and delegates of the Amagasaki Society for the Study of Japanese-Korean affairs in their respective protest messages published in front of the Osaka prefectural police headquarters condemned the unjustifiable police search and encouraged Korean residents.
