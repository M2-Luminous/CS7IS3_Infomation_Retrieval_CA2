In a written speech delivered at Brussels airport, Li said China and Belgium stand on the two ends of the Asian and European Continents and are far off geographically, but Belgium is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. He said the Chinese people admire the Belgians for the achievements scored in the long-term cause of developing their national economy and building their country. Li recalled the cooperative relationship between China and Belgium, saying the Sino-Belgian ties have well developed since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971. There have been many exchanges of high-level visits between the two sides and the bilateral trade volume has increased dozens of times, said the Chinese leader. He noted that there is a new momentum for the two countries to promote their cooperation in all fields thanks to the efforts of both sides over the past few years. So long as China and Belgium observe the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and of mutual respect for each other, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and mutual benefit, Li said, the mutually beneficial relationship of cooperation between the two countries can be developed steadily. This will not only serve the interests of the Chinese and Belgian people, but also world peace, stability and development, added the Chinese leader. Li will hold extensive talks with Belgian leaders on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. He expressed hope that his visit, which came at the invitation of the presidents of the Belgian Senate and Chamber of Representatives, will further enhance the understanding between the two peoples, thus pushing forward the Sino-Belgian friendly cooperative relationship in future. Li is on a five-nation European tour which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
