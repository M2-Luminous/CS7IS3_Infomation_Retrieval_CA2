The conflict can be solved only by negotiations, she stressed. Stiborova pointed to the possible escalation of the conflict which would endanger civilians and UNPROFOR forces, including the Czech units operating in the area. She said she believed that the security of the Czech Republic would be jeopardized as well, due to its "being involved in the War conflict." The SLB was opposed to the strengthening of the Czech military unit in the region in 1993, and now it urges its withdrawal, she stated. The conflict could be solved by immediately convoking a peace conference attended by representatives of the former Yugoslav lands, representatives of international institutions and top European politicians, Stiborova said. The SLB thinks that world politicians who should have efficiently intervened in the talks between the antagonists in Bosnia have so far taken part in them only as observers, she added.
