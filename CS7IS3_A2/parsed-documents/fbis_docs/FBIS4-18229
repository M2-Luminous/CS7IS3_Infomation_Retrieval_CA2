But, he implored his party friends, "the conclusion is not that we should cry and run away." Has the FDP reached its end? Will the Bundestag election on 16 October also seal the fate of Helmut Kohl? Since last Sunday [20 March], when the FDP with 4.4 percent of the votes in Lower Saxony failed to get over the 5-percent hurdle, the time of nervousness has begun for the Free Democrats as well as for the coalition. The liberals have become the greatest security risk for the chancellor. The debacle at the very beginning of a series of elections and precisely in one of the most solid land associations heralds a continuing disaster. In the opinion of the Election Research Group in Mannheim, their forecast has been confirmed: the FDP does not have a secure voter base anywhere, neither in the laender nor at the national level. Dieter Roth from the Research Group: "It is in danger everywhere." It is no longer represented in the parliament of Hamburg and Lower Saxony. It is threatened with a shameful result in the Europe elections in June and with extinction in Bavaria a few months later, according to the Research Group. Nationally the Mannheim pollsters put it at less than 5 percent. The decline in the east is threatening. The FDP is still safely over the 5-percent mark in Saxony-Anhalt, where they will vote in June. There Hans-Dietrich Genscher from Halle brought his party to 19.7 percent in 1990 and the liberal Uwe-Bernd Luehr won an electoral district directly. "That is only a sham boom," analyzes Roth. Just as the Union, the Free Democrats were among the winners from unification--good fortune that cannot be repeated. The glance into the abyss makes the liberals shudder. Appeasers and dramatists are feuding with each other. They are looking for culprits and offering formulas. But they have not yet discovered the cure-all. They are now arguing whether some flexibility in the care insurance was the cause of the dismal result. Was the strategy wrong not to issue a clear statement on the coalition and to wait until quite late to wink at the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]? And what are the consequences for the alliance in Bonn? They are all in agreement that the party lacks something unmistakable and that is a profile. What does the FDP stand for? At the present time, it is for slogans, for a few target groups, and, as always, for participation in power. General Secretary Werner Hoyer dreams of the "fascination of freedom." He wants to rediscover a "liberal feel for life" in his party. At the same time, Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, who is seeking a liberal signature, is being hidden from the public--she could scare away conservative voters. Former Minister of Justice Kinkel also extols his party as the "guardian of the rights of liberty." But he is worried enough to state that citizens are more fearful of criminals than of encroachment by the state. Liberty instead of populism--the Greens have taken over this role. Kinkel knows that it is "an ideal catch basin for the dissatisfied." "Industrial site Germany" is another catchword. What is meant, in the version of the FDP, is the concern for their mid-level clientele. "The themes and target groups do not fit together," criticizes Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for regional planning, housing, and city planning. And this omission is attributed above all to the minister for economics. Old chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher mounted a massive attack against Guenter Rexrodt in the presidium last week, saying that he was continually presenting proposals that soon afterwards disappeared in some drawer. He is bustling about in secondary theaters of war instead of serving the specific needs of his own clientele. Genscher called Rexrodt's idea of taking away tax privileges for carnival promoters and their associations an especially horrible example. According to Genscher's tastes, Gerhard Schroeder, the election winner for the SPD, showed in an exemplary way how economic competence can be gained--a lesson for Rexrodt: sharpen themes for target groups, repeat them, and "make them more acceptable to hearts and minds." But most of the blame for the party's dilemma is being assigned to Chairman Klaus Kinkel: he is too close to the Union and adapting rather than setting apart. Whereas party chief Genscher understood very well how to link conflict, self-presentation, and independence of the FDP, his successor pays more attention to style, decency, and dependability. The result: the profile of the party is being blurred. "Peace in the coalition is no objective for the election campaign," criticizes Bonn FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle. And when Kinkel warned against "unfaithfulness" in the executive board last week, Juergen Moellemann, the land chief of North Rhine-Westphalia, suggested that the term be "restricted to married life and not transferred to party life." Unfaithfulness might even be "expedient" in politics. Moellemann, who as an "antipope" is waiting for his hour, is vehemently demanding what Kinkel wants to avoid: the FDP ought to separate itself from its partner and finally "run away." But Moellemann's paper on "fundamental change" likewise contains only a collection of old proposals. His slogan is this: "Keep conflicts cooking." At times the FDP ought to act as though it is not even part of the government: "One must have chutzpa." His advice: "Hit Kohl, Waigel, and Scharping between the horns every day." The troublemaker fears that the FDP will go down together with the Union if it does not finally seek its distance: "More and more people see a need for reform that cannot be accomplished by this coalition." After the election, he threatens, "it is time for a general operation in any case." Kinkel praises himself as someone who at critical moments "remains calmer and more composed than others"--pure self-conjuration. For the man who was once the great hope of the liberals is irritated and nervous. The election defeats are getting under his skin and Moellemann's continual intrigues are bothering him. He angrily reviles the "know-it-alls" who pound the table hysterically and cry "separation, separation." According to Kinkel, it "does not agree with anyone" to leave for new shores when things are going downhill. The successor learned the business of politics at Genscher's side but he did not learn his sovereignty. The then-party chief spent the largest part of a three-day party congress in Berlin in the hotel. He got out of bed only long enough to stand before the television cameras. But Kinkel, party friends complain, "allows every local chairman to invite him to a cookout." The double office of party chairman and foreign minister is too much for him. He sometimes loses sight of the big picture in all that is going on between Norwegian fishing quotas, German negotiations on nursing care insurance, and municipal elections in Schleswig-Holstein. He reacts impulsively and undiplomatically, as in the negotiations in Brussels for the accession of Norway, where he is said to have threatened to break the back of the Spanish. Last week he formally called French Ambassador Francois Sheer to the Foreign Office. Kinkel made a German-French affair out of a couple of critical remarks of the diplomat. His predecessor loved to let things take their course before he made a decision. He kept all the options open for himself. His trainee, on the other hand, "asks immediately where the piano is," complains a diplomat in the foreign ministry, "and does not look for the crane." In the election of the federal president, Moellemann wants to give a demonstrative signal for the desertion with his vote for SPD candidate Johannes Rau. Such an option would we quite all right with Genscher as well: "There is still a lot there." So much independence goes too far for Kinkel. He hopes for a majority for the Roman Herzog, the candidate for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. His message is more of the same with Helmut Kohl. Still, the successor is holding back with a statement in favor of the continuation of the coalition--a remnant of willfulness. "The more they talk about it, the less interested we are in making a decision," says General Secretary Hoyer. In reality, the decision for the Union has already been made. "If there are enough votes, that is the key principle," says Irmgard Schwaetzer. And it is a banality. The party chief believes there are. In the end, the voters will take the safe side and avoid any experiments. In comparison with the CDU-chancellor who is esteemed worldwide, the candidate from the SPD does not look good, in Kinkel's opinion. "The disenchantment effect is inevitable." Kinkel does not think much of the Greens, a "democratic force that must be taken very seriously." They are "not able to solve practical problems." His conclusion: "too unreliable to participate in the government." The chancellor sees the situation more realistically. The Greens no longer serve as a bugaboo, according to an adviser: "There is no miracle weapon, we must work with small change."
