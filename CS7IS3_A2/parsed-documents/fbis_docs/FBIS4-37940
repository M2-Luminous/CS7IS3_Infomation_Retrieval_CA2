International Cooperation and Planning Minister Nabil Sha'th chaired the talks at the old Israeli administration building in Gaza City. The session was to be followed by a meeting with representatives of the World Bank on the disbursement of international aid to the Palestinians, who have criticized the lack of readily available funds since autonomy was launched on May 4. Sha'th, who negotiated the Cairo agreement which launched autonomy, said Saturday that Israel and the PLO would resume talks on Tuesday on outstanding questions involving self-rule. These would include the size of the self-rule enclave of Jericho and the fate of thousands of Palestinian prisoners as well as the spreading of autonomy across the West Bank. But the venue for the negotiations has not been settled and Israel, which has suggested Cairo, has not officially announced any meeting. Among those attending Sunday were West Bank Fatah leader Faysal Husayni, Local Government Minister Sa'ib 'Urayqat and Tourism Minister Ilyas Frayj. A press conference was due to be held later in the day.
