Today 12,000 Ingushi Live in North Ossetia"] [Excerpt] Although, contrary to Ruslan Aushev's wishes, the document signed the evening of 26 June in Beslan, (Vladikavkaz Airport) "On Procedures for the Return of Refugees and Forced Resettlers to Places of their Former Residence," did not become a full-scale treaty "resolving all the urgent problems between North Ossetia and Ingushetia," it definitely not only filled a temporary pause in the Vladikavkaz-Nazran dialogue but, with both sides willing, can be accepted as guidance for action. Coordinated in detail at the level of conciliation commissions from both republics and with the participation of officials from the Provisional Administration, the document envisions an extended preparatory stage, part of which, it needs to be recognized, has already been completed: Lists have been made up of Ingushi citizens who earlier lived in North Ossetia (the starting point is 31 October 1992 or -- here Vladikavkaz showed flexibility -- on the basis of any other documents confirming residence registration in the republic). Public security on resettlement territories is entrusted to the forces attached to the Provisional Administration and the Internal Affairs Ministry of North Ossetia. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told, if any of the newly arriving Ingushi citizens express the wish to join North Ossetian law enforcement bodies, this wish will be granted immediately. The problem of "screening" -- so painful in the previous talks -- has been resolved quite happily in the document: The sides agreed that the return of the refugees must not depend on the presence of criminal elements among them, while the extent of their guilt will be established by the relevant bodies. Under the document signed, development of the social infrastructure in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages is to begin on 1 July. The first to return to their homes will be the owners of houses that are still intact. The "prime contractor" will be the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations; its representatives will ensure the building of temporary structures for people who lost their homes and property to fire. In accordance with the agreement, work related to the return of Ingushi citizens will be financed by federal power bodies which, as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent understands, have not up to now unduly forced their attention on either side. Coordination (transportation, communication, and escorting) has been assigned to a special department formed in the Provisional Administration, which is to draw up a schedule for the transportation of citizens by 5 July. Vladikavkaz hopes that the newly arriving Ingushi citizens will not only recognize the republic's territorial integrity and its laws and renounce any attempts to propagate interethnic strife, but will also show an example of obeying the law to all other citizens of North Ossetia. According to statistical reports by the Republic of North Ossetia, since November 1992, 12,000 Ingushi have retuned to the republic for permanent residence. [passage omitted]
