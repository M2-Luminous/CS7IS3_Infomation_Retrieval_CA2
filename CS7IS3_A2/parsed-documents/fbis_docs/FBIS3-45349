Wang Zhaoguo, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, said the principle of "one country, two systems" is the concrete application of Marxism in contemporary China. Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that it is the outcome of the party's line of seeking truth from fact and constitutes one important part of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He called for earnest study and implementation of Deng's idea of "peaceful reunification" of the motherland and "one country, two systems", adherence to the one China principle, safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and opposition to any advocacy of "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" and "Taiwan independence". Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association of the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that his association aims to develop the exchanges and relations across the Taiwan Straits and to promote peaceful reunification of the motherland. He said that with the approach of the 21st century, the Mainland and Taiwan should enhance their economic cooperation to attain mutual benefits. Cai Zimin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that the Taiwan people have a patriotic tradition which remains unchanged. He said that the principle of "one country, two systems" respects the realities on the two sides across the Taiwan Straits and agrees with the Taiwan compatriots' wish for being their own masters. He said that the claims for "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" advocated by some people in Taiwan or outside Taiwan are doomed to fail.
