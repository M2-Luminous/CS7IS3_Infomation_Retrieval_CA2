Let us hear what Mayak's ever-objective correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov has to say. [Plotnikov] Good day. Today we have the session of the Crimea Supreme Council continuing--that is where emotions are highest. The main issue is forming a government for the republic and the working group to continue the talks with the Ukrainian side on the problems of which you and our listeners are well aware. The deputies did decide to deal with the first issue, the working group, first of all, because continuing the talks and curbing the tension between Simferopol and Kiev are exceptionally important and time is very tight--just 10 days. More than half the time that has been allocated has already passed. Having discussed the personalities, the deputies elected the working group and the Ukrainian Supreme Council will now also appoint a group. In the next few days they will continue their joint search for ways out of the political confrontation. Peace and calm in the peninsula are essential conditions for economic reform. Removing this tension is absolutely vital and this is what Deputy prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov talked about in his speech. He addressed the deputies for 40 minutes, outlined the main problems for the economy of Crimea and the options there are for its development. He then spent 90 minutes, maybe more, answering questions, and after that there was even more discussion and something I think was quite unexpected--for Saburov himself and even for President Meshkov: The majority of deputies were very sharply critical of the government's program, in particular, for being woolly, for not making provision for public welfare for the poor, for not taking account of the ideas and suggestions of Crimean economists and their managers in the economy. Key posts in the government have been allocated not to local officials, but to people from Moscow. It began to look like a government crisis, and President Yuriy Meshkov took the floor. You know how passionately he can speak, and that is how he spoke on this occasion. He appealed to the deputies to cast aside grievances and reproaches and to vote for the government. Several proposals were then made. Saburov spoke once again and deputies then broke up for a recess, for consultations, and at 1720--in one hour's time--they will gather for the vote. So I hope we will find out what the outcome of our latest government crisis--and I hope that the crisis will not materialize, that the deputies will vote for--in an hour's time.
