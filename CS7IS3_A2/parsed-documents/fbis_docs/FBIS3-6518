The Anticorruption Steering Committee of the city, however, affirms that the number of corruption cases which have been uncovered is still far below its actual number. The noteworthy points drawn from the uncovered cases so far are that corruption activities nowadays do not exclude any particular areas, and that bad elements in various levels cooperate and protect each other. Many new forms of corruption have emerged, transforming state-owned property into private ones. The City Anticorruption Steering Committee admits that there have been cases where corruption suppression activities were not timely, resolute, and just. The recovery of property, which had been lost to corruption, is still inadequate. Meanwhile the handling of complaints and denunciation is too slow, and the rectification and consolidation of the state management structure to prevent corruption are unable to match the demands of the new situation. Generally, comprehensive measures to effectively detect, handle, and prevent corruption in Ho Chi Minh City have yet to develop. We cannot solve the problem hastily since the battle against corruption is a long and complicated one. But, we need more resolute and well-coordinated measures right from the beginning. We need to eliminate conditions that nurture corruption such as authoritativeness, and we need to constantly improve our structure, policies, and legal systems as our economy changes to a market-oriented one.
