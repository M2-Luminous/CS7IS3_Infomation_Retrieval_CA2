It can be integrated into one device by using a Dammann splitting grating and phase-type Fresnel microlens array based on the phase superposition principle and VLSI techniques. A new beam-splitting array device--the computer-generated Fresnel holographic beam-splitter (CGFBS)--has been fabricated. This device enables spots splitting of 128 x 128 arrays and superlarge spots arrays. Three figures, not reproduced, show the following: a schematic of the CGFBS principle, a schematic of the CGFBS phase superposition principle, and three photos of the CGFBS structural-design results.
