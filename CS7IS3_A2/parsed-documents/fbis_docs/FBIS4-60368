Mr. Peres, how do you see the future of peace in the region following the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? [Peres] There is no doubt that wars have slowed economic development in the region. It is in our interest to have an economic revival in the region. We are focusing on economic development. It is also important for us that the conditions of the Palestinians improve because a well-off neighbor will certainly be more stable. We are helping the Palestinians as much as we can. This does not mean we have withdrawn militarily from the land to come back and occupy it economically. ['Abd-al-'Ati] What was your feeling when you saw the transfer of authority to the Palestinians? And what will be the fate of the rest of the occupied land? [Peres] This is the first time the Palestinian people have lived on their land and been in control. I do not know what the future will bring. We must continue the negotiations without delay. These negotiations should not remain confined to the extension of self-rule to other areas, as was the case in Washington. They should also deal with the transfer of authority in the areas of education, health, social affairs, and taxation. I think it is wrong to believe that we can control the Palestinian presence in Nabulus, Hebron, and Ramallah, situated respectively in the north, south, and middle of the West Bank. What matters now is that we are relieved of the burden of Gaza. When I hear of the sense of relief among our soldiers who were dispatched to face the rock-throwers there, I say: Our soldiers have been brave but thank God it is over. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel insists that Jerusalem will remain its eternal capital and the Arabs counter that with their own claim. How do you see this issue being resolved? [Peres] Jerusalem does not represent a problem for us now. It is unified from the political side and divided from the religious side. There is full freedom of access to all Jewish, Christian, and Islamic holy places. Religious shrines must be respected and we protect and guard them. We have signed an agreement with the Vatican by which Israel will protect Christian shrines. We are ready to sign a similar agreement with the Islamic world. Jerusalem was never an Arab capital. The Jewish people have never had any capital but Jerusalem (!!) [punctuation as published] ['Abd-al-'Ati] Why has there been no progress on the Syrian track? [Peres] The Syrians are very hardline. President Hafiz al-Asad does not want to do what President al-Sadat did. We do not know how long al-Asad wants to wait. Seventeen years ago the problem was simple and Syria would have achieved a better deal. But it seems that President al-Asad wants to take his time. All this time is being wasted. But I believe Syria will ultimately follow in Egypt's footsteps and begin open negotiations with Israel. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Israel talks a lot about peace guarantees and security arrangements but it does not trust the Arabs. Still, Egypt is an Arab country and for the past 17 years there has been no violation of the Camp David Accords. Why is Israel, then, afraid of peace with Syria? [Peres] Yes, Egypt is committed to peace with Israel and is even playing a major role in the region to narrow differences. The question is: Why is Syria not following Egypt's example? The problem with the Syrians is that they want to get to where Egypt is without following the same path. ['Abd-al-'Ati] How does Israel feel about Islamic violence in Egypt? What is your view of the future of peace between Egypt and Israel? [Peres] Evidently the emergence of Islamic extremism threatens all the peoples of the region. The situation in Iran shows that Islamic extremism has solved nothing. I believe the extremists and fundamentalists entertain the illusion that they can solve their countries' problems if they assume power. ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Dayr al-Sultan issue [a church in Jerusalem at the center of a dispute between Egyptian and Eritrean Copts] is one of the pending issues between Egypt and Israel. Why didn't the Israeli authorities intercede to solve it when an Israeli judicial verdict was handed down to give Dayr al-Sultan to the Egyptian Copts? [Peres] The problem is not between us and Egypt but between Egyptian and Eritrean Copts. ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis seized the keys of the church and handed it to the Eritreans. There is a judicial verdict in favor of the Egyptian Copts. [Peres] A ministerial committee will discuss the problem and decide. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Next I met Benyamin Netanyahu, the Likud leader and successor to Yitzhaq Shamir, in a suite in the Holiday Inn in Jerusalem. I asked: The voting in the Knesset on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement demonstrated strong opposition by the Likud Bloc. Why are you opposed to peace? [Netanyahu] The Likud is opposed to the Declaration of Principles agreement known as the Gaza-Jericho Agreement but is not opposed to peace. The Likud signed the peace agreement with President al-Sadat at Camp David in 1977. And the Likud started the peace process with the Arab countries concerned at the Madrid Conference. So what is said about us is untrue. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Then why do you reject Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area? [Netanyahu] No Israeli withdrawal should take place before confidence is built between the Palestinians and Israelis. This also applies to the Golan. I do not trust the security arrangements being worked out with the Arabs. I will give you an example: Iraqi President Saddam Husayn used to embrace the amir of Kuwait and repeatedly declared that he would not enter or occupy Kuwait. What did Saddam Husayn do afterward? He occupied Kuwait. So how can I believe any talk about peace between us and the Arabs unless we build confidence and bridges between our peoples. They will merely be speeches full of air. A genuine peace is one that is built through confidence between the peoples. Naturally, the Arabs and Jews need time to build this confidence. ['Abd-al-'Ati] In your view, what is the future of peace in the region after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? [Netanyahu] There are many questions that should not be asked now, not before we give peace a try. We are waiting to judge the Palestinians. We want to build confidence between the peoples first and then discuss the peace process and what might happen. ['Abd-al-'Ati] Does this mean that if the Likud assumes power, it may revoke the agreement signed between the Palestinians and the Labor Party led by Rabin? [Netanyahu] This is untrue. The Israeli people agreed on this accord. We are discussing building confidence and the Palestinians should comply with the agreement. ['Abd-al-'Ati] The Israelis insist that Jerusalem is their eternal capital and the Arabs also insist that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state and that they will not cede Jerusalem. Your comment? [Netanyahu] Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital and there will be no going back. We will not even accept partitioning the city. Let us give peace a chance, for there is a long way to go and there are other issues before the negotiating committees. [passage omitted]
