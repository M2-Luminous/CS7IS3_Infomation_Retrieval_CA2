Attila Fekete; place and date not given] [Text] In an interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Dr. Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Election Commission (OVB), has said that the political parties and their candidates, as well as independent candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks between the two rounds of voting to introduce themselves to the voters and outline their programs to them in detail, instead of switching to a dirty campaign. According to the OVB chairman, the role of the electronic media in the campaign has risen since 1990. This explains in part the fact that the number of filed objections to the programs of Hungarian Television, for instance, has multiplied in comparison with the number filed four years ago. [Fekete] In recent weeks the Supreme Court has reviewed on appeal several opinions of the OVB. At first the court set narrowly, and then ever wider, the limits within which the OVB could condemn violations. Would it not be more expedient if the OVB could issue not just opinions but also binding orders? [Nemeth] With due consideration for the provisions of the law and the decisions of the Supreme Court, since its establishment the OVB has been seeking the legal instruments and other means through which it could express its opinion of conduct described or presented in various petitions. I know this is difficult to understand for persons whose background does not include legal training. The law assigned the OVB the task of safeguarding the fairness and legality of elections. At the same time, the legislators failed to give the OVB suitable instruments with which to enforce the Electoral Law. According to my experience, however, the very fact that the OVB's proceedings on every petition are open to the press, and that its opinions regularly receive full coverage in the press and on radio and television, is sufficient to deter violators from continuing to break the rules. [Fekete] What happens when violators disregard the opinion of the OVB? Those who attempted to buy nomination forms have been arrested. [Nemeth] Section 34, Paragraph 2 of the Electoral Law defines the jurisdiction of the OVB in specific cases. There you do not find any provision that would enable the OVB to penalize conduct aimed at "gaining an unlawful advantage," for instance. That, too, explains why we have never claimed that the Electoral Law, which is rather sketchy on procedure, is our very best piece of legislation. [Fekete] You were OVB chairman also during the 1990 elections. In what respects are the 1990 campaign and the present one similar, and how do they differ? [Nemeth] Four years ago the political parties had substantially less money for campaigning. This is evident also from the substantial increase in political advertisements in public places, in the press, and also on radio and television. In comparison with the 1990 campaign, the role of the electronic media has risen. It is no accident that the OVB has received substantially more complaints, objections, and notifications concerning Hungarian Radio and especially Hungarian Television. [Fekete] What objections did the notifications contain? [Nemeth] One group of notifications protested that Hungarian Television had refused to broadcast one or another political party's election program. But another group of notifications was not critical specifically of the election programs. In conjunction with the increased number of complaints against Hungarian Television, however, one must also realize that the country itself has become more politicized. People very often believe to perceive political overtones even in programs that have no political message whatever. On the whole, it seems to me, there was less rudeness in this election campaign than had been expected. [Fekete] But most of the complaints critical of Hungarian Television's programs must have had some foundation. After all, the OVB recently called on Hungarian Television, Hungarian Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency to observe the provisions of the Electoral Law, and it warned them that the principles of fairness and impartiality must not be violated even in programs not related to the elections. Could you explain this somewhat Dodonian opinion? [Nemeth] The Electoral Law specifies what the public service media are required to do during an election campaign, what kind of programs and announcements they are obliged to broadcast. Except in the case of election programs, however, the law contains no provisions regarding the conduct of Hungarian Television, Hungarian Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency. We drafted our exhortative opinion, for impartiality and fairness in the elections, on the basis of Section 26 of the Electoral Law. [Fekete] For Hungarian Television, what would be the consequences of failure to change its programming policies, despite the OVB's warning? [Nemeth] The OVB has no authority to impose a penalty on Hungarian Television. Should Hungarian Television's programs fail to conform to the OVB's opinion in the future as well, the political parties or voters could claim a violation. [Fekete] Four years ago the campaign really degenerated only in the second round. [Nemeth] I sincerely hope that will not be the case in 1994. The parties and their candidates, as well as independent candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks between the two rounds of voting to outline their programs in greater detail instead of discrediting each other. The voters will punish any candidate who conducts a dirty campaign. [Fekete] Much of the time during the OVB's sessions is spent arguing whether the question that happens to be on the agenda is or is not within the commission's jurisdiction. Why is that? [Nemeth] It would be unfair of me to blame everything on the Electoral Law's shortcomings. Parliament elected four members and the secretary of the OVB, and 15 members have been delegated by political parties running national lists. Some of the disputes stem from the political parties' contrasting interests. Naturally, it would be better if the OVB were following legally correct rules of procedure--say, rules contained in the Electoral Law itself. [Fekete] Has it never occurred to the OVB to propose amending the Electoral Law and to draft a bill on electoral procedures? After all, the Electoral Law now in force has simply proved to be bad. [Nemeth] I am unable to fully agree with your last comment. In my opinion, the Electoral Law's substantive provisions are not bad. It is the law's procedural part that has been left unfinished and is causing countless problems. The OVB does not have authority to draft legislative bills, and no one has requested it to do so. Of course, if the Interior Ministry or the Justice Ministry were to begin work on amending or further amending the new or amended Electoral Law, the OVB would gladly share its experience with the authorities concerned.
