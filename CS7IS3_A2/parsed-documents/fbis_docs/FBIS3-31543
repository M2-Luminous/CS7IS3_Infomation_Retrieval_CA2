Redman was accompanied by Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith. The meeting was also attended by Jure Radic, head of the president's office. Ambassador Redman informed the president about positive U.S. attitudes toward the convergence of Croatian and Muslim stands regarding the securing of a cease-fire and the implementation of a final solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He supported Croatia's approach based on a peaceful solution and promised the international community's support in protecting the Croatian areas that are under siege at the moment. He stressed in particular the United States' readiness and resolve to contribute -- in parallel with resolving the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis -- to the establishment of the full sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia in all areas within its internationally recognized borders, urging the opening of communications, and restoration of economic links. President Tudjman thanked the ambassador and the U.S. Government for their constructive and active role in resolving the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia.
