"Its (the RDP) effect will be retarded if inflation erodes the real income earned in newly created jobs or micro and small enterprises, areas which are most vulnerable to inflation," he said. Consequently, President Nelson Mandela and the cabinet were "unquestionably" committed to ongoing monetary and fiscal discipline. "We all agree that we need reconstruction... but, in government we accept that we cannot spend our way to these objectives," he told the opening of the new headquarters of the International Bank of Southern Africa in Johannesburg. A ballooning fiscal deficit would likely increase inflationary pressures and thus would also harm the ability of South Africa's industries to restructure in a highly competitive global environment. "It (industry restructuring) will not succeed if domestic prices rise more rapidly than international prices," he said. Mr Erwin said a comprehensive and precise white paper on the RDP was being prepared for tabling in Parliament, which would include proposals on the RDP fund. Government would Allocate R2.5-billion [rand] in the upcoming budget to the fund, and it could be supplemented by international grant aid and private sector assistance. The state's committment would be derived from departmental savings and re-allocations in the budget to be presented on June 22. "These funds will go back through government line departments at national, provincial and local level to kickstart the reordering of priorities in the areas indentified in the president's state of the nation address," Mr Erwin said. The government also intended to augment domestic savings with foreign capital resources once the preparations for a comprehensive RDP had been completed. The government is awaiting an international credit rating assessment before approaching global capital markets to raise financing. "(In addition), there is likely to be a considerable increase in demand for corporate, trade and structured financing and we welcome the role that international bank and the three major European banking houses it represents will play in this regard," he said. Germany's Dresdner Bank AG, France's Banque Nationale de Paris and Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert are the three shareholders in the Johannesburg-based international bank. The opening of the bank's new premises was attended by senior executives from all three financial institutions. "We hope to play a role in facilitating SA's re-entry into the global financial community, working alongside established local banks," Dresdner Bank AG international head Volker Burghagen told reporters earlier. "Sa needs international investment and we hope to be a link in the chain that brings it... We are also ready to serve leading SA companies in their domestic markets and as they take advantage of new international opportunities."
