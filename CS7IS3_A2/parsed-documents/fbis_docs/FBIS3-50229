[Churov] In essence, Partnership for Peace is a compromise between at least three quantities. The first is NATO as an organization, which is well aware that it has to change its character and, probably, its range of action. Second, there are the countries of Eastern Europe, practically all of which have declared that they want full membership. The third factor is Russia. As a result of the balance between these three quantities, whose interests both coincide and diverge in certain fields, we have Partnership for Peace. For some time now, NATO has been facing the problem of how to take account of the new circumstances, which tend to induce changes in an organization that from the outset was formed and adapted to the bipolar security model. Now there is a new understanding of security, a realization of the need for a new architecture for the security structures and, in the final analysis, for new, more varied forms of behavior. For its part, Russia displays a degree of sensitivity regarding NATO's position and, more precisely, its geographical scope. Russia is a state of the first magnitude, regardless of the problems that it is suffering at the moment. It continues to be a leading state and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and it has a first-grade nuclear potential at its disposal. As a state, it carries great weight in international relations, and NATO cannot fail to take it into consideration. A further important factor is the internal political balance inside Russia between forces that are rather skeptical about cooperation with the West and other forces that believe this is the only reasonable alternative. Third, we have the states of Central and Eastern Europe. Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, they have found themselves in a certain "security vacuum" and naturally have the lawful right to seek guarantees for their security, territorial integrity, and sovereignty, which includes following a consistent policy aimed at joining the West European or Euro-Atlantic structures. Accordingly, in the final analysis, Partnership for Peace is a vector resulting from these three lines of force representing different interests and foreign policy behavior. [Badzheva] Is Moscow applying any pressure on our statesmen to keep us from joining NATO? [Churov] I have no information to confirm such a thesis. I think rather that Russia's attempts to exert influence are directed toward the West. A certain postulate has been strongly expressed in statements recently made by NATO politicians, and it contains a grain of logic. It suggests that the immediate inclusion of a group of states from Central and Eastern Europe, or only from Central Europe, in NATO would in practice mean shifting a line of division further to the east, no matter where it should end up -- at Russia's borders or somewhere to the west of our own border. I think that at the present stage, we cannot fail to appreciate Russia's problem -- no such line of division should exist. Anyway, this was the message sent to the NATO summit meeting in Brussels. [Badzheva] In the Western press, Partnership for Peace has revived the hypothesis of a "new Yalta," according to which the Central and East European countries would again be left within Moscow's sphere of influence. What do you think about this? [Churov] To be able to claim that such an accord exists, one needs to have absolutely authentic information. One cannot simply put forward hypotheses. On the other hand, attempts are still being made to delineate spheres of civilized compatibility. Ideas were suggested of making culturological divisions between the countries of Europe, based on religious traditions, alphabets, and ethnic features, and according to this, we lie in the eastern orbit. However, this thesis does not hold water, because it refers to a Byzantine Europe, but the state that historically personifies Byzantium turns out to be one of the Western group of countries. I am referring to Greece, which is already quite well integrated in both NATO and the European Union. [Badzheva] Nevertheless, views still prevail that Partnership for Peace restricts the countries of the former socialist block from holding full membership in NATO. [Churov] First and foremost, Partnership for Peace represents a commitment on the part of NATO to open up the organization to the East. It is something like the EU's Copenhagen declaration, in which it declared that in principle it was an organization with an open character. The states that have been active in the Partnership for Peace Initiative will be able to hold consultations similar in scope and content to those specified in Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This means that in the event of a direct threat appearing to their national security and sovereignty, the member countries will be able to seek consultations with NATO on these issues. The second level of Partnership for Peace is that it gives the opportunity to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, if they so desire, to participate in important NATO military and political bodies. This gives them real access to the process of formulating decisions, despite the fact that this cannot, of course, be compared to full-blown participation in the decisionmaking process. In addition, the initiative provides for cooperation in specific military-technical fields, such as military planning, access to certain types of confidential information, cooperation in the fields of troop training, command, and administration, and, naturally, participation in wide-scale costly operations, such as joint military exercises, joint peacekeeping operations, and so on. [Badzheva] Has NATO invited us to take part in joint military maneuvers this year? [Churov] In principle, NATO is planning to hold joint maneuvers in 1994 but, so far, it is not clear which states in Central and Eastern Europe will take part in them. It has been left to them to decide whether they are ready to join in and allocate the relevant resources. However, we have already been invited to notify them which of our combat units might be placed at NATO's disposal for joint operations of this type. [Badzheva] Are we ready to answer in the affirmative? [Churov] No, and not only us. It is still too early. [Badzheva] Are you afraid that the states of the former socialist camp are moving toward NATO at two speeds and that we are in the second group? [Churov] I would say that from now on, the states of Central and Eastern Europe, and not only them, will move at more than two speeds. Despite our formal equal standing, in a certain sense, this is embodied in the Partnership for Peace initiative itself. For many countries, the initiative essentially represents a solution to their situation and, for this reason, they find this program exceptionally acceptable. Some states will turn out to be better organized, better equipped from the material viewpoint, and with a stronger psychological motivation and a higher level of public awareness. In other words, these states might prove to be more suitable for faster integration into NATO. [Badzheva] Nevertheless, we can demonstrate our activity only within the limits of our financial capabilities, because no one knows how we will be able to pay for our cooperation with NATO. Does this mean that the richer states will overtake us? [Churov] This is possible. However, if we give high priority to our links with NATO on national security grounds, we could allocate more funds. If again we reach the assessment that the balance between the economic factor, including our financial problems, and the aspiration to integrate with NATO is in favor of giving priority to economic problems, the outcome would be different. In this case, however, the statement made by Ms. Albright during her visit offers us some reassurance. She said that the quantitative aspect is not so important as the qualitative one, and as far as the latter is concerned, I do not think we are inferior to any other state. [Badzheva] What does the qualitative aspect include? [Churov] From the political viewpoint, it includes conducting sensible foreign policy, acting as a stabilizing factor, not having any territorial claims against our neighbors, having a democratic social system, abiding by international obligations, and so on. As regards all these requirements, Bulgaria is in no way inferior to the other states of Central and Eastern Europe. Our state also has to prove that it is a reliable partner in the Partnership for Peace initiative. [Badzheva] Do you consider that a condition for us joining NATO is that our weapons should conform to Western standards? [Churov] If we talk about Western standards, it is a somewhat paradoxical fact that the East European armies are standardized to a far higher degree -- that is, they are far much more compatible than the NATO armies. In this respect, I am inclined to think that the idea that we are unsuitable for NATO because our standards are totally different is somewhat of a myth. [Badzheva] Is it possible to say that, in a certain sense, military diplomacy has outstripped classical diplomacy on our path toward NATO? [Churov] I would not make this distinction, because it is very difficult to separate the one from the other. It is true that a number of specific programs for cooperation with NATO exist in the military-technical field. On the other hand, the political process is also quite well developed. [Badzheva] In your opinion, who in Bulgaria is afraid of NATO? [Churov] I do not know if we can talk about fears. However, a certain trend does exist, and among serious politicians at that, who think that it is not the best thing for Bulgaria to commit itself to one or another organization or state, and that Bulgaria should be neutral. In the present conditions, the very concept of "neutrality" is losing its meaning in a world that is no longer bipolar, thus presupposing the existence of third neutral countries. In organizations like NATO, in which mutual cooperation is developed to a high degree, a democratic process exists for reaching decisions, and the interests of all are considered, the member states are divided into two groups: the insiders and the outsiders. The ones inside have advantages, while those outside are in practice prevented from being able to influence the collective decision- making process. If we decide not to integrate ourselves with NATO at such a speed and show a tendency to consider whether we have any other alternatives, this will inevitably place us in the second category, even when we are equal in all other respects to the other Central and East European countries. In this case, there is a very big risk that this would have a knock-on effect regarding the process of our integration into the European Union and other similar structures.
