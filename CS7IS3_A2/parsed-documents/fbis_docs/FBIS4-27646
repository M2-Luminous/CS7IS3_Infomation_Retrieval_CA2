Elbegdorj leader of the largest public and political establishment of Mongolia -- the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) who was one of those laying down foundations for democratic transforming of the country and being currently in opposition to the incumbent authorities has been released today by the session of the Great State Hural of Mongolia of his duties of a member of the parliament. Out of the 57 members of the parliament being present at the sitting some 69.6 percent of them voted for complying with the request by T. Elbegdorj on releasing him of his duties of legislator which was filed by himself during the days of this April hunger strike. His refusal of parliamentarianship he motivated by the impossibility to be representing the interests of its voters in the parliament. He reaffirmed his refusal at the meeting. Meanwhile the majority of members of the parliament were of other opinion considering T. Elbegdorj has lost both moral and juridical right to be an MP bearing in mind the recent hunger strike calling for the resignation of the government of members and supporters of the MDU and the accuse of being guilty in leaking the state classified information which was brought against him by the Central Investigation Board. It is likely that it is the latter which would be applied as a basis for the parliamentary bill on releasing T. Elbegdorj of his duties of an MP.
