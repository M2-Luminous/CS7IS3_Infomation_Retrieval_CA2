Pairic MacFhloinn, 40, who came from Dublin for the operation, and Nottingham-based IRA "sleeper" Denis Kinsella, 25, were convicted of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life. They were also found guilty of attempting to murder a policeman who stopped them, of kidnapping a motorist at gunpoint and of possessing a firearm. MacFhloinn's sentence is amongst the longest handed out to IRA terrorists by a British court. The pair were convicted after a six-week trial arising from the night of February 25 last year. With another terrorist, who was never caught, they planted bombs and incendiary devices at the gasworks, which ignited gas from one tank and set off a spectacular fireball, causing Â£1 million worth of damage, but failed to explode the total of 11 million cubic feet. Kinsella's uncle, John Kinsella, 49, who was born in Dublin but had lived in Nottingham for 34 years, was convicted of hiding Semtex in an allotment, though he did not go to Warrington. He was jailed for 20 years for possessing Semtex. Mr Justice McCullouch told MacFhloinn: "I have no doubt, as far as you are concerned, the bigger the explosion, the better." The judge told Denis Kinsella he accepted he would not have participated "unless you had been persuaded to do so by another member of your family, perhaps two members, whose requests you would have found it difficult to refuse." The jury heard that Kinsella's father, also called Denis, introduced him to MacFhloinn. But the judge said: "You were not as helpless and dim as the picture you sought to give to the jury. You had sufficient strength of character to say no." MacFhloinn and the escaped terrorist, known only as Michael Timmins from Ireland, made up the Semtex bombs in a room in Denis Kinsella's home in Manvers Street, Nottingham. Kinsella drove them in a battered old Mazda van on the 87-mile journey to the works on the A49, one mile from Warrington town centre. After planting the devices, they drove off through Warrington but were stopped by a diligent patrol officer, Pc Mark Toker, 25, who thought they might be drunk. Kinsella tried for 25 minutes to talk his way out of the questioning by Pc Toker. The officer ran a police computer check on the van and a breath test on Kinsella, both proved negative. But he want he wanted to search Kinsella and his two colleagues. They could not risk his discovering their gun and so MacFhloinn fired five bullets at him, at close range from the back of the van. Pc Toker was hit in the stomach, thigh and buttock and was left bleeding in the road as the trio escaped. But he had the presence of mind to relay descriptions of the trio and van on his radio. The bombers abandoned their van in the Cheshire village of Lymm and forced 19-year-old Lee Wright to stop his Ford Escort, Kinsella putting him in the boot. The motorist then endured a 25-minute journey as the trio drove to the Trafford Park area of Manchester. There, a policeman thought they might be "ramraiders" and gave chase. They out-manoeuvred him and the pursuit was taken up by Pc Andrew Mackay in his Ford Cosworth. He saw the front passenger, Timmins, lean out to throw a brick or video recorder at his car, a common tactic of ramraiders. But as he swerved, Timmins fired the handgun at him, hitting the engine and stopping his car. The chase was then continued by an officer in a dog van. Mr Wright, who was still in the boot, was alert enough to try to stop the Escort once he heard the sirens and shots. He disconnected a wire in the boot, wrongly believing it might control the petrol tank. But it did control the petrol gauge and the terrorists abandoned their car because they thought it had run out of fuel. All three made off across fields. MacFhloinn was brought down by a dog, Kinsella was found cowering in a ditch but Timmins escaped.
