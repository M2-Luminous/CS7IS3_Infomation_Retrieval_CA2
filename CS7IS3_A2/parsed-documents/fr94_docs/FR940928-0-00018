FR940928-0-00018 FR940928-0-00004 It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest in that: (a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the continued pooling of the milk of dairy farmers who have historically supplied the market without the need for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; (b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective date; and (c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. No opposing comments were received. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective less than 30 days from the date of publication in the Federal Register .
