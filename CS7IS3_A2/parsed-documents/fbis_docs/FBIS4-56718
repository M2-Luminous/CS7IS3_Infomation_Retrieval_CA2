I think the best way to handle this conference is by my answering questions. [Reporter] Your opinion of the Electoral Tribunal's first results? [Blades] Although the Electoral Tribunal's results, which place us in third, are preliminary, we have no reason to doubt the figures. [Reporter] How do you correlate this report with the opinion poll results released a few days ago? [Blades] We have always said that we had a job to do regardless of the results of the polls. Let us wait until the final results are released. [Reporter] Do you still have the faith you had spoken about? [Blades] I will tell you something. We have been ranked third. But in relation to whom? Two groups with tremendous general experience. They are people with great resources and experience in and from government offices. I think Papa Egoro Movement [MPE] did an excellent job, regardless of the final results. [applause] Had I been advised, before the beginning of the campaign, that the movement would occupy third place as part of the defense of a different option, I would have participated all the same. [applause] I will not accept any results until the final figures are given. If Dr. Perez Balladares wins, rest assured that the MPE will endorse this decision of the Panamanian people and that we will hand over to him our whole program and our position. Because this is not an issue among parties, but one that involves the whole country. We never took an antagonistic position. Some people ask me whether we will become opposition. I have answered that we would constitute a group of proposals, something we have always been. We will not change this position. Nor will we reject the results of the people's will. [Reporter] In other words, the party will keep going. [Blades] We will keep going with all of the Panamanian people. [applause] We will not shift our position. We started this political work because we have always believed there must be a different alternative. In the national political system, we have found plenty of selfishness and division. Regardless of the future political panorama, the country can rest assured that everything we said we said from the heart and will do. Papa Egoro will not vanish. Many parties, created just to have access to the distribution of power, will disappear. We did not create our political party with this purpose in mind. We will keep working, we will not vanish. I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all of the MPE members who have worked to create this movement for more than three years. There are many heroes, men and women. There was a time when it appeared impossible to have an alternative outside of the parameters used by traditional parties. Party members did everything possible to contribute their faith and hope to this movement. Rest assured that this quota of hope and faith will flourish and grow. No one is defecting. The party is not for rent or for sale. The party will not quit. [applause] I also wish to tell everyone that I am very proud of belonging to the movement. I believe that the work we have done has set new parameters in national politics. This is the first time that a political party has been formed without having been founded on ideological or economic terms or without pressure from certain national [?groups] or sectors. This is the first time that this has occurred. I think we have altered all the parameters of national political conduct. On the personal level, I am very happy that I participated on behalf of a party that always presented its position in decent terms. We never attacked anyone; we never insulted anyone, even though there were campaigns against me, my wife, and my family. We never stepped back from the threshold of decency and did not fall prey to the temptation of returning insult for insult. We are not going to do this now either. The person who obtains the majority of votes, and in this case it might be the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] and Dr. Perez Balladares, can be completely certain that the MPE will accept this popular dictate. As I said earlier, we are going to present our programs to improve any proposal they might have. I would like to say in passing that our proposals were the best. [unidentified voice says: Right on!; followed by cheers and applause] We are going to present our plans to improve theirs. They can be completely certain that we are not going to become an obstacle out of selfishness or pettiness. I would like the other political parties in Panama to not react in the traditional manner, and to refrain from attempting to block initiatives that are going to benefit the country. [Reporter] You have said that you are going to wait for the last vote to be counted to recognize.... [Blades, interrupting] Not necessarily the last vote. [Reporter] Do you think you could surpass that figure? [Blades] Let me tell you something: there are still many votes to be counted. I am not saying that we are going to wait in order to offer our support. We already are supporting the winner. I simply believe that we should wait for all the figures out of respect for the Electoral Tribunal [TE], and because this is the right thing to do before conceding, so to speak. However, I am already taking a step forward, and am saying we are going to support whoever wins and will not place obstacles before his government. We ask the same from the other political parties. We are not like the other political parties, and that is why we are asking them to do this. We are asking the traditional political parties to please refrain from trying to hinder the work of whoever wins. The work of that government will be done for the good of the country. For basic reasons, not because we are in third or fourth place, we are going to wait for the TE to make its announcement, and we will accept their decision. Right now, as far as figures are concerned, everything indicates that Dr. Perez Balladares has won the elections. I congratulate him, the PRD, and the country because the electoral process was carried out honestly. Everyone came out and voted. We supported that and support the actions of the Panamanian Government, which represents Panama, not a party. [Reporter] Mr. Blades, for some time the MPE held second place behind the PRD. Many people believed that the MPE would be the winner and that it would be able to beat the PRD, a traditional party. What happened? Was there some sort of strategic mistake for the 94 elections? [Blades] No. I believe there were a number of factors. On the one hand, economic problems kept us from launching our campaign earlier. Many people on the streets told us: If you had started your campaign earlier, perhaps you would have had a chance. This argument is not a solid argument, however. We would not have been able to do this because we did not have the economic means, on the one hand, nor the organization that we needed at that time. Additionally, we did not have a list of candidates. Any group that begins, and begins broke and in a decent manner, and I am going to repeat this over and over again -- in the history of Panama there has never been a party like the MPE. [unidentified voice says: "Never!"; followed by cheers and applause] Within that reality, within that reality [repeats himself] we were never able to have a greater presence in our country's rural areas -- given the lack of resources, organization, and so on -- and we needed that. On a personal basis, everyone ganged up against us. Let us call things by their name. The partocracy [partidocracia] ganged up against us. A very negative campaign was launched in recent weeks and, perhaps, it yielded certain results. On a personal basis, we simply accepted that as a test. We overcame that and we continued with our efforts. The movement does not end. That is the good news for the Panamanian people. The struggle continues. [applause, shouts] Second, I will tell you something. In the event, which apparently occurs now, we lose the elections, in 1999 no one will beat us. [applause, shouts] [chanting: "Ruben! Ruben! Ruben"] This does not mean I will necessarily be the candidate in 1999. That is something the national convention and the national reality will decide, but I think the MPE and its roots of decency are deeply planted. We will settle the situation of slanders and other issues in the courts; and that begins tomorrow. [applause, shouts] [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit, Mr. Blades? [Blades] What? [Reporter] Against whom will you file the lawsuit? [Blades] We will file the lawsuit against the persons who used false information to denigrate persons and ideas. [Reporter] What party is involved? [Blades] This is not a matter of parties, this is not a matter of parties. [repeats himself] I previously said totally absurd and groundless accusations have been issued. We will not do this in terms of a vendetta, only because we believe the conditions should be given in our country to clearly tell the whole nation you cannot say a person is something he is not. [Reporter] In what way do you feel offended? [Blades] Look, it was said here that I was a gringo. [unidentified woman laughs] It was said here that my diploma was forged. [unidentified woman says: It was said he never attended the university.] My mother, may she rest in peace, was attacked here. My wife was attacked here. Well, that... [pauses] she deplores it but we have discussed that issue and, well, such is life. Anyway, people have said things that are not true. Groups.... [pauses] persons within our group have been accused of being members of a national organization -- I was accused of being an employee of the government. In other words, a series of accusations have been made and we will prove in a court of law that they are false; and the people who published that will pay [words indistinct]. [applause, shouts] [Reporter] What will Ruben Blades' future be while this happens? Will you remain in Panama? Will you continue to sing and feature prominently at international level? [Blades] Well, since you did not give me the job of president [laughter heard in the background] I have to work any way I can. I have not worked for eight months. A lot of emphasis was initially placed on the fact that I am a singer; and many people in the media asked me: Well, will you stop singing? I always asked them: If I were a painter, would you ask me to stop painting? If I were a poet, would you ask me to stop writing? That is part of an erroneous perception that an artist can only play a superfluous role in our society. This singer, because that is what I have always been and I feel very proud of that, is a singer who has placed his role as an artist, and his condition as a Panamanian, in a prominent place at the world level [applause, shouts] and I continue to do this in the measure of my possibilities. I feel absolutely no shame about this. I believe that, quite the contrary, we have given Panama a very positive image, and we have always continued to extol the role of music as a means of communication. The real question is whether I will stop taking part in the political process and the reply is no. This is a categoric no. We will continue our work; the MPE will not disappear, and it will not disappear because it represents a banner of national decency. We are not going to leave, we are not going to allow other people to usurp what the people have given us. Something else I want to say today is that in every tour people would say to us.... [pauses] right, Ricardo [Bermudez]? Do not deceive us, do not deceive us. You can be completely sure that this was never our intention. The other thing people would say is we will not see you again. We said we will return regardless of whether we win or lose. The country can be totally sure that I am going to return to all the places I visited to thank everyone for all the support they gave us and to tell people that we will continue to work and toil. [applause] I believe this exercise has been very positive for the country. I would like, please, for things to be seen in their proper context. We have struggled with what we call vernacularly the bullies [mayullones] in politics. [chuckles] We faced some bullies and we fought clean. The bullies delivered low blows, below the belt, but we did not fall. [applause] This is not the right moment, on national network, to call attention to these sorts of things, but we do need to say this at the party level. Do you know what it takes to organize a group in three years and that this group suddenly becomes the second or third political force without resources or alliances? [applause] What we simply did was to give shape to a national thought and feeling. People want something different. I hope and everyone hopes that the next government leads us in resolving problems. Again, with all respect, and with our current position as a political party of national importance, I ask, please, that traditional political parties not interfere negatively in the work of the elected government. We must move ahead; we have no more time to lose in more fights, more insults, more slander. Now we all have to work, time is running out. The country needs immediate replies. We will continue to contribute things. It is important that this be clearly understood. I ask, please, all political parties. It is very important that we now concentrate on the task of governing the country, especially with the National Assembly. It is important that we cast aside party rivalries; the personal and selfish aspects so obvious with the country's traditional political class. The MPE will not hinder the national work because we are part of this work. I ask the other parties to please not hinder the work of the national government, whatever the party. [passage omitted]
