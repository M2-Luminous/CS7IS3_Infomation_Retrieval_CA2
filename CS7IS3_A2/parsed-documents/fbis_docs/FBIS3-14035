According to the spokesman, India is very disappointed by the Pakistani campaign against India. Pakistan took back the resolution it presented in the United Nations when India expressed a desire to discuss the various disputed issues, including Kashmir; expressed its willingness to add the Kashmir issue to the agenda as a separate item; and some friendly nations had assured Pakistan of India's serious interest in holding developmental talks. This resolution was introduced by the former government with the cooperation of some friendly nations. When it was taken back, it did not mean that Pakistan had forfeited its right to introduce it in any other forum of the United Nations. Providing India an opportunity for some constructive talks was a step to prove to the international community that the main stumbling block to these talks is India's stubbornness. Thus, Pakistan initiated talks at the foreign secretary level in Islamabad at the beginning of January. Seeing India's negative attitude, however, we fought India's efforts to lengthen these talks. The opposition expressed anger and disappointment at our government's step and reproached the government. The government, however, had made it clear that if the these talks failed, it would raise the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum. At present, the situation is that Pakistan distributed a draft of the resolution among commission members, and its representatives are lobbying with representatives of other countries to pass this resolution. Russia, the United States, and Great Britain have expressed displeasure at India's attitude, and India is worried that on 25 January, when this resolution is introduced in the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, it will face failure and disappointment. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali, and some diplomats have raised this issue among the international organizations very effectively. Therefore, it is expected that this Pakistani resolution in support of the Kashmiri people's struggle will be approved. Thus, the struggle of the Kashmiri people will get the moral and political support of the international community. The fact is that the present government has not shown any hesitation or weakness on the Kashmir issue. Instead, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, after giving a decisive opportunity for some serious talks, and after their failure, has raised this issue during all her foreign trips and in front of various international agencies. The Indian government's reaction also proves that Pakistan's diplomacy on this front has been successful, and that they are threatened by it. They have come down to various negative and capricious actions. Keeping in mind the solid efforts by our government, we can expect that the Human Rights Commission will approve the resolution and that the international community will increase its pressure on India. That, in turn, will force India to involve itself in result-oriented talks with Pakistan. Its threat of canceling the talks will only prove to be a false one. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, in a speech in Lahore, expressed her support for the Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom. She said, "Pakistan supports the Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom and will continue to do so. We want to see the Kashmiri people free in the 21st century." There is no doubt that Pakistan is very busy supporting the Kashmiri people's cause on the diplomatic front; however, bearing in the mind the seriousness of this situation and the political ups and downs in this region and at the international level, we must ensure that our nation is united in action and thought. We lack this unity, and our weakness on the internal front can affect our efforts on the external front. Particularly in the National Assembly, the opposition's confrontation with the government, blocking the passage of laws, the making of flagrant accusations against each other, and starting a no-confidence campaign against the chief minister in the assembly have all created a situation that is unacceptable. All these are destructive incidents and keeping in mind India's attitude about the Kashmir issue, the Indian government's threats of war against us, and threats of some serious consequences all demand that we be fully united in our country to be effective in our foreign affairs. The nation demands that our politicians and leaders be aware of their responsibilities. Only then can we play a constructive role in making sure that the freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people is successful. *
