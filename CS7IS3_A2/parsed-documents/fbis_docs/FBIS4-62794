This is what Shmidt Dzoblayev and Oleg Novikov, members of the Russian president's public chamber told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today after their visit to the area under the emergency situation in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. The members of the public chamber under the Russian president and heads of the two republics agreed on cooperating more closely to settle the conflict between Ossetia and Ingushetia. In particular, Shmidt Dzoblayev, who is general secretary of the Assembly of Democratic Forces of the Northern Caucasus, proposed holding a conference of ethnic leaders in the region in the immediate future to reconcile the "brothers" [krovniki]. This would create the conditions necessary for the ethnic Ingush and the peoples of North Ossetia to be able to live together in the future.
