If the conflict between NATO and the Serbian forces becomes generalized in Bosnia, do you foresee Portugal getting involved in NATO actions? [Silva] Portugal has made a limited contribution, about 50 men, to the humanitarian operations in the region. But I do not foresee greater Portuguese involvement in that part of the world. However, let us bear in mind that according to UN resolutions, flights over Bosnia are banned, so we cannot allow the aggressors to try to test the determination of the allies to put an end to this Yugoslav tragedy. According to the information we have, what happened was that planes, believed to be Serbian, entered no-fly zones and NATO planes, with UN authorization, opened fire and shot down four planes. It is believed that there were six planes -- four were shot down. What we have here is a tool to pressure the sides into negotiating and into reaching an accord through negotiations. [Announcer] Do you not fear the fact that Portugal's noninvolvement in the NATO effort could be wrongly interpreted by our allies? [Silva] We cannot forget that Portugal has other commitments, mainly helping the United Nations with the Mozambican and Angolan peace processes. We have concentrated our efforts in this area, in the context of the United Nations. Portugal is not as well placed as other countries to deploy soldiers in the [former] Yugoslavia. I just want to add, as I have said before, bombing is a tool to pressure the sides. It is a tactical tool, but alone it will not achieve the final objective which is to stop the carnage, the tragedy we have all witnessed. What was done today, and other pending NATO threats are merely aimed at bringing the sides to the negotiating table, to accept an accord favorable to peace in the region.
