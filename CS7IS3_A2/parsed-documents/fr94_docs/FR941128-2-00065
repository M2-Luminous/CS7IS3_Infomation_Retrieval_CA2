Of the total long-term assets, 31 percent are assumed to be financed by long-term debt and 69 percent by equity. 4The pre-tax rate of return on equity is based on the average after-tax rate of return on equity, adjusted by the effective tax rate to yield the pre-tax rate of return on equity for each bank holding company for each year. These data are then averaged over five years to yield the pre-tax return on equity for use in the PSAF. 5Systemwide 1995 budgeted priced service expenses less shipping are $608.5 million.
