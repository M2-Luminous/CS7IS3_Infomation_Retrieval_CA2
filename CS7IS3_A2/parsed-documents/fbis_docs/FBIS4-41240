He said at a press conference in Minsk on Tuesday [21 June] that in accordance with the Constitution the powers of the president would automatically go to the parliament's speaker if the elections failed to take place. Hryb avoided prognostication of the results of the coming elections and refused to say for whom he would vote. Hryb said that the future president must concentrate on achievement of accord in the society. "No prosperity and well-being for the people can be achieved without accord," he stressed. Certain media editions blamed the Central Election Commission for the particular attention attributed by Belarusian television to the election campaigns of some of the candidates for the presidency. Tens of foreign monitors have arrived in Belarus in order to control the elections. Hundreds of journalists from the CIS and other countries will be reporting on the presidential elections. However, the poll conducted by the Institute of Sociology under the Belarusian Academy of Sciences on Tuesday showed that about 80 percent of Belarusian voters would not come to ballot boxes. All the same, this does not mean that the president will be elected in the first round, experts said.
