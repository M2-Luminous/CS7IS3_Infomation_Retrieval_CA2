The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry, which sets the direction of the country's economic development, highlighted this problem in the latest issue of a White Paper, suggesting the introduction of the indicator Technostock as a yardstick for scientific research results. Technostock is the total amount spent on research and development taking into consideration the obsolescence factor. To calculate Technostock, R&D expenditures are multiplied by the Technoflow factor, the amount of which is lower than one and depends on the time required to introduce new technology. Technoflow is added to Technostock for the previous year, taken also with the obsolescence factor, and the resulting sum is the Technostock for that year. There are two kinds of Technostock: the first calculates expenditures for production and profits and the second--so-called intellectual property. Japan has been rapidly catching up with the United States in production-directed Technostock. For the period 1970-1988, this indicator increased by 608% in Japan and by a total of 10.8% in the United States, although in 1970 the United States had 31 times as much production-directed Technostock as Japan. In 1988, the gap had narrowed to 4.8. Japan's intellectual property indicator rose 320% and that of the U.S.--50%--for the period indicated. The gap between the countries narrowed from 15:1 in favor of the United States in 1970 to 5:1 in 1988. In the process, the gap in total GNP between Japan and the United States has been closing even faster. In 1988, the GNP of the United States was only 1.7 times that of Japan. Japan lags behind not only the United States but also Great Britain, France, and Germany in the intellectual property indicator and in the number of published scientific papers. Only R&D expenditures and the number of patents applied for in other countries were growing in line with GNP. The White Paper recommends strengthening basic scientific research while considering the results of a poll taken among university and public officials that suggested assigning priority to work in the areas of the ecology and energy-saving technologies.

Expenditures on Space Programs The cost of civilian space exploration being carried out by approximately 25 countries and international organizations is assessed at $25 billion today. According to data in SPACE NEWS, the United States, France, Japan, and China alone are annually spending more than $1 billion on these needs. NASA, with an annual budget of $14.7 billion which is spent primarily on spacecraft, surveillance satellites, and the development of the Freedom Space Station, remains the main space exploration center. NASA's main partner on the continent is Canada ($292 million). Brazil annually allocates $100 million for the launch of satellites and Argentina--$10 million for the launch of satellites to conduct astronomical exploration. France, which spends $1.38 billion per year, leads on the European Continent. Italy ($973.4 million), Germany ($969 million), and Great Britain ($206.6 million) follow. According to official data, Russia allocates $741 million per year on space programs. In Asia, the space budget of two countries exceeds a billion dollars. They are Japan ($1.262 billion) and China ($1.2 billion). China spends its resources primarily on launches, for communications satellites and for meteorological satellites. India, Taiwan, South Korea, and Pakistan also participate in this activity. Australia allocates $13 million per year for space exploration. Only the RSA [Republic of South Africa] is represented in space from countries on the African Continent. The European Space Agency (ESA), with a budget of $3 billion per year consisting of contributions from 14 European states, coordinates European space programs. Canada is an associate member of ESA, and ESA, in turn, is participating in the development of the Freedom Space Station with a 10% share. Washington (AFP), 2 September 1992. Germany Increases Amount of Financing for Scientific Research Germany's Ministry of Research and Technology has a 3.55 billion budget for this year, or more than a 3.8% increase as compared to the 1991 level. A large part of the allocated resources is earmarked for eastern Germany. In 1993, £627 million or 18% of the science budget will be invested to build up research on the territory of the former GDR, which signifies an increase in appropriations of 9.8% compared to the 1992 level. Approximately £100 million from this amount is being designated for universities. The increase in financing comes in the wake of reports by government and private agencies that the quality of research in eastern Germany still lags far behind. Research into climate, ecology, and public health won the largest increases in funding. The Ministry of Research and Technology has allocated £5.7 million for this purpose. In its space strategy, Germany is shifting from large-scale manned flights toward unmanned flights and the expansion of sensing from space, and is conducting negotiations with the CIS countries about expanding cooperation in space research. NEW SCIENTIST, 25 July 1992, Vol. 135, No. 1831, p. 4 Siemens and Philips Joint Ventures in Germany and China The EEC Commission intends to conduct a study of certain agreements between Siemens (Germany) and the German subsidiary of the Dutch firm Philips Electronics in accordance with the law on company mergers. According to the Commission's data, documentation will be studied on the transfer of Philips cable plants in Koln and N�urnberg to its German joint venture with Siemens--Nachrichtenkabel und Anlagen. In December 1991, Philips reported negotiations on the transfer of its German and Dutch cable and optical fiber manufacturing enterprises to Siemens. The EEC Commission task also includes studying Siemens' plans to repurchase from Philips half of the share in the Chinese firm Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable Company. The remaining 50% of the capital belongs to Chinese organizations. The EEC Commission intends to investigate Siemens' plans to increase its share in the German firm Norddeutsch Zeekabelwerke, which specializes in the production of cables and measurement equipment. The EEC Commission has four weeks to ascertain if the Siemens and Philips agreement will inflict damage on the situation in the European Common Market. In the event serious doubts exist in the advisability of the deal, a more thorough four-month study of the state of affairs will be conducted. The Commission has the right to change the terms and even block an agreement that lessens competition. Brussels (AP), 9 September 1992. South Korea Finances Leading Technology Projects In the middle of August, South Korea's Ministry of Science and Technology announced the first projects proposed within the framework of government efforts directed at achieving the technological level of Japan and the leading Western countries by the beginning of the 21st century. The government program, assessed at $6 billion, is known as the G-7 project (seven is the number of countries that are at the level which South Korea intends to achieve. Besides Japan, they are the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain). The South Korean Government plans to invest more than 2,400 billion won (790 won = $1) into the project by 2001 matched by a similar amount from the country's industry. The announced projects encompass three of the 14 scientific research areas (new pharmaceutical and agrochemical substances, new materials, and new functional biomaterials) and come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Science and Technology. Other projects, covering such areas as high-definition television, semiconductors, communications lines, and automated manufacturing systems, will be announced shortly by other ministries. More than 20 government institutes, 50 universities, and 60 private companies will participate in the already announced projects. The Korea Institute of Science and Technology [KIST] and the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology [KRICT] will lead the research. The industrial firms participating include such conglomerates as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, and also several pharmaceutical companies. In 1992, the government and industrial firms allocated 27 billion won ($34 million) to develop the three indicated research areas. Distribution of approximately half of these budget resources was cited in a table and more complete information will be published in several months (the data was expressed in millions of won). Dozens of pharmaceutical companies and several universities will participate in research in the sphere of new medicines and vaccines, to which a large portion of budget resources has been allocated. Two nonprofit government-industry consortiums--the New Medicine Development Consortium and the Genetic Engineering Research Consortium--have been established. Hyundai, Samsung, and Daewoo have supported research to develop new ceramic materials for use in the heavy industry, automobile, and electronic sectors. But so far there is no sign of cooperation proposals from other countries, as the South Korean Government had hoped. NATURE, 20 August 1992, Vol. 358, No. 6388, p. 613. R&D Expenditures in OECD Countries The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes 24 industrially developed countries, has published information on the organization's member-countries' expenditures for the conduct of scientific-research and experimental design work. The OECD has published this information for the first time, which provides the opportunity to conduct an accurate comparison of R&D expenditures in the United States, Japan, and the European Community countries. Per capita R&D expenditures in the EC countries total $310 per year, as compared to $510 in Japan and $600 in the United States. In the process, these expenditures account for 2% of Gross National Product in the EC countries, 2.9% in Japan, and 2.8% in the United States. However, government appropriations for R&D in the EC countries cover 17.7% of total expenditures for this work, compared to 8% in Japan and 12.4% in the United States.

Tax on Packaging One of the most complex issues that manufacturers, ecological experts, and government organizations of the world's various countries face right now is the continuously growing amount of packaging materials that are used. Until recently, the adoption of stricter decrees that provide for the government's increased role was proposed as the solution to this issue. These are legislative acts that oblige manufacturers to collect and reuse used packaging materials in increasingly large quantities and also attempt to establish quantitative indicators of the increase of the percentage of wastes that are reused. Decisions were also made to ban certain methods of destroying used packaging materials, such as burning them. The social and economic research center in the sphere of global ecology thinks that using market laws is the most effective method to resolve the problem. Center experts think that we need to create conditions so that the minimum possible amount of material is used during the manufacture of packaging and introduce economic incentives to intensify the collection and processing of used packaging we must do. The introduction of a progressive tax on packaging materials, the amount of which would depend on the degree of danger this type of packaging poses for the environment, is being proposed as the best solution. It can be levied both directly by government agencies and also by the manufacturers themselves in the form of an additional collection. In this case, the market will determine the best method to package goods. It is proposed introducing three indicators as a general established range on which the amount of the tax will depend in order to ensure practical implementation of the approach "let the polluter pay." The former takes into account the ratio of the weight of the packaging to its volume, the second--the number of times the packaging has been used, and the third--the cost of collecting and reprocessing used packaging. So, if the packaging manufacturer reduces its relative weight (the ratio of the weight of the packaging to the volume occupied by the packaged goods), the tax will be reduced correspondingly. The same will occur in the event of an increase of the number of times the packaging has been used. As a result, an "additional" portion of the cost of packaging must be reduced to the amount of compensation for harming the environment which is a consequence of just the process of manufacturing and transporting packaging materials. Questions regarding other sources of environmental pollution, like the process of extracting bauxites that are needed to obtain material for aluminum cans, will be resolved separately by government organizations. Introduction of an additional collection to the cost of packaging to compensate for the impact of similar sources of pollution would result in the emergence of ineffective dual taxation. The obvious difficulty when introducing a new tax system will consist of the fact that its amount will be different for various countries and various goods. So, the cost of avoiding the use of packaging in the United States will be much lower than in the Netherlands. In part this can be explained by the fact that there is a risk of obtaining a swimming pool during an attempt to dig a garbage pit. So, new taxes must be calculated on national and possibly even regional levels. Practical problems of organizing tax collection and their impact on the international trade process also arise. Preliminary calculations of the amount of taxes for various types of packaging have led to interesting results. So, if we examine various types of containers used to package nonalcoholic beverages in Great Britain, the least amount of tax is for a cardboard container (obviously, primarily due to its low weight), the amount of tax will be higher for plastic bottles (made of polyethylene terephthalate), still higher for reusable (an average of 14 times) glass bottles, and also for aluminum cans. The tax for heavy glass disposable bottles is very high. The listed calculations were conducted by independent researchers using specialists of the Swedish firm Tetra Pack, which is the largest producer of multilayer cardboard beverage cartons in the world.
