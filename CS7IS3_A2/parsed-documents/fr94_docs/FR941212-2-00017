ACTION: Notice of the opportunity to file briefs as amici curiae in certain unfair labor practice proceedings in which agencies have refused to provide information requested by labor organizations under section 7114(b)(4) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. 7114(b)(4)). SUMMARY: The Federal Labor Relations Authority provides an opportunity for all interested persons to file briefs as amici curiae on a significant issue common to a number of cases pending before the Authority involving the refusals of agencies to provide labor organizations with information requested under section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute. DATES: Briefs submitted in response to this notice will be considered if filed by January 6, 1995. The date of filing shall be determined by the date of mailing as indicated by the postmark date. If no postmark date is evident on the mailing, it shall be presumed to have been mailed 5 days prior to receipt. If filing is by personal delivery, it shall be considered filed on the date it is received by the Authority. ADDRESSES: All briefs shall be captioned ``Necessary Information, Amicus Brief,'' and shall contain separate, numbered headings for each issue discussed. An original and four (4) copies of each amicus brief, with any enclosures, on 81/2Ã—11 inch size paper, shall be addressed to Alicia Columna, Director, Case Control Office , FLRA, Attn: Necessary Information Cases, 607 14th Street NW., Room 415, Washington, DC 20424&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Alicia Columna, Director, Case Control Office, Federal Labor Relations Authority, (202) 482&hyph;6540. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Labor Relations Authority has pending before it cases where agencies have refused to provide labor organizations with information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute because the agencies allege, inter alia, that the requested information is not ``necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[.]'' 5 U.S.C. 7114(b)(4)(B). In National Park Service, National Capital Region, United States Park Police, 48 FLRA 1151 (1993) (National Park Service) (Member Talkin concurring in part and dissenting in part), the Authority adopted the standard set forth in National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ( NLRB v. FLRA ), for determining when requested information involving advice, guidance, counsel or training provided for management officials is ``necessary,'' within the meaning of section 1714(b)(4)(B). The Authority is now considering application of the National Park Service standard to pending cases, including whether a different standard should be applied to requests for other types of information. In this context, parties in the following pending cases have been directed to file statements with the Authority addressing certain questions. The cases, and the types of information at issue therein, are: Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Ventura District Office, Case No. 8&hyph;CA&hyph;20443; where the union requested supervisors' ``memory joggers.'' United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, Case No. 6&hyph;CA&hyph;10866; where the union requested memoranda written by employees requesting assignments to certain work units. Social Security Administration, Dallas Region, Case No. 6&hyph;CA&hyph;10825; where the union requested ``memory joggers'' pertaining to a certain bargaining unit employee who was challenging an appraisal rating. United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Case No. 7&hyph;CA&hyph;0658; where the union requested a performance appraisal of an employee who was appraised under a performance plan identical to that of a unit employee who was dissatisfied with her appraisal rating. Federal Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, Pennsylvania, 12&hyph;CA&hyph;20160; where the union requested a crediting plan for a first-line supervisory position for which a bargaining unit employee was not selected. Parties in the aforementioned cases were directed to provide briefs addressing the following questions: 1. Do the requested documents constitute guidance, advice, counsel or training provided for management officials or do they fall within some other category? Why do you so characterize them? 2. If the requested documents do not constitute guidance, advice, counsel or training provided for management officials, should the standard set forth in National Park Service be applied to such documents, in light of NLRB v. FLRA; Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base v. FLRA, 956 F.2d 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1992); U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, Pennsylvania v. FLRA, 988 F.2d 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA, 1 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, El Paso, TX v. FLRA, 991 F.2d 285 (5th Cir. 1993); and United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Northern Region, Twin Cities, Minnesota; Office of Inspector General, Washington, D.C.; and Office of Professional Responsibility, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA, No. 93&hyph;1284 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 4, 1994), slip op. at 16&hyph;17? If not, why not, and what standard should be applied? 3. What showing of need for the requested information has the Union established? 4. What interest has the Agency established for not disclosing the requested information? Although these questions were asked of the parties in the above-referenced cases, the matters addressed in the questions posed are likely to be of concern to the Federal sector labor-management relations community in general. With respect to questions 3 and 4, the matters of broader concern would be the showings of need (question 3) and interest (question 4) the union and respondent, respectively, would be required to establish under whatever standard is advanced as appropriate for application. Therefore, the Authority finds it appropriate to provide for the filing of briefs as amici curiae addressing any or all of these matters. Dated: December 7, 1994. For the Authority. Alicia N. Columna, Director, Case Control Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30494 Filed 12&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6267&hyph;01&hyph;M
