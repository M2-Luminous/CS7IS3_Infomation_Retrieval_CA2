"How to guide the economic fundamentals is the most important," Mieno said, citing the huge trade surplus as the key factor for Japan in hinting why the Group of Seven major nations are not taking joint moves as it did in may. In making a speech and answering questions at the National Press Club, Mieno said Japan's huge current account surplus "often" surfaces as a major factor behind the yen's rise, and measures to correct this is "the most important." His comments came after the dollar plunged in New York Tuesday to hit a new global low of 99.85-95 yen. It is now moving nervously around 101 yen with dealers saying that the market is testing an accord among Group of Seven (G-7) major nations to act jointly to stem excess currency volatility. But unlike the joint G-7 intervention taken in May when the dollar tumbled near to fall below 100 yen, they said the Bank of Japan has acted alone to defend the dollar's fall against the yen. In a disappointing U.S. move for market participants, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement Wednesday, only saying, "we continue to be in close communication with our G-7 partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as appropriate." Mieno also said he is watching currency movements with great concern and will take "appropriate and timely actions in close contact with other G-7 nations." The central bank chief reiterated that the yen's rise is one of the key risk factors for the recovering economy, and noted that the stronger yen first brings "near-term demerits" on exports although there are benefits on import prices in the longer run. The yen's rise makes Japanese products expensive overseas and foreign goods cheaper in Japan. On the economy, Mieno said in his speech it has "moved one step" forward, and in answer to questions, that it is "steadily moving" toward a recovery. The recent improvements are supported by a background that is different from that prevailing at the same time last year, when the economy fell back toward the summer after showing signs of recovery, he said. Mieno cited recovering corporate earnings, progress in restructuring efforts, and improving economies abroad as the main differences with last year. Considering risks aside from the yen's rise, Mieno pointed out still-tough conditions of corporate capital investment and labor, and said more time is needed for adjustments. He also expressed concern over emerging competition from other asian nations and former communist countries, deriving from the yen's rise and favorable conditions in the labor-intensive field. Against this backdrop, Mieno said that macroeconomic measures should continue to serve as a "cushion" against still-tough conditions, primarily by supporting personal and corporate spending. On long-term interest rates, the central bank chief said the recent rises reflect market sentiment about the economy, but market players should take more carefully into consideration "both good and bad indicators" yet expected to appear. Long-term rates should settle at levels reflecting the state of the economy, he said.
