FR941116-1-00002 FR941116-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;136&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A300 B4&hyph;2C, B4&hyph;103, and B4&hyph;203 Series Airplanes; and Model A300&hyph;600 B4&hyph;620, B4&hyph;622, B4&hyph;603, and B4&hyph;601 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A300 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the fuel tank jettison system. This proposal is prompted by a quality survey which revealed that the electrical bonding of the fuel jettison system has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent electrical arcing and resultant fire in the event of a lightning strike. DATES: Comments must be received by December 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;136&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
