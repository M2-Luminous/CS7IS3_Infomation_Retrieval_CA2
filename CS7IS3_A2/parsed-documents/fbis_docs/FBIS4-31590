"We have followed the lead of a question raised by an assembly deputy and discovered that there really was nuclear waste deposited in barrels in the tunnels of the abandoned uranium mine in Kalna," Dr. Jovan Aleksic said to reporters at a news conference. His findings indicate that the waste originates from the Vinca Institute, however, a question remains whether it was the experts at this institute who did this or some other institution that did not know what to do with the radioactive waste. In any case the waste will be returned to its true owner and residents in the vicinity of Kalna will again be able to graze their cattle on the nearby clearings. Dr. Aleksic was resolute in his conclusion that the problem of depositing nuclear, industrial, and any type of waste must be resolved expertly and with considerably less harmful consequences for the human environment. A question remains as to who will attest to the great damages suffered by residents of Kalna, Mezdrej, Gabrovica, and other nearby villages.
