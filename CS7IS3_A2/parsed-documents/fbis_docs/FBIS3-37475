This date, when, five years ago, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan was completed, is not marked in the calendar. But for the people is it a Day of Remembrance, when we remember those who did not come home. A ceremony was held 14 February in the Central House of the Russian Army to mark the fifth anniversary of the withdrawal of the 40th Army from Afghanistan. It was conducted by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. "Whatever society thinks of the Afghan war today," Hero of the Soviet Union Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation defense minister, said in his opening speech, "it is clear to us, the military, that the vast majority of Afgan war veterans, as soldiers in that undeclared war, displayed true courage and heroism and loyalty to the military oath and to the homeland. We are not to blame for the fact that the Army was forced to pay in blood for the political leaders' mistakes, and pay dearly -- 13,833 of our fighting comrades died brave deaths in Afghanistan. May their memory and reputation live forever!" The ceremony participants observed a minute's silence in memory of the dead. "There are around 30,000 commissioned and noncommissioned officers in the Russian Army at the moment who served in Afghanistan," Hero of the Soviet Union Colonel General Boris Gromov, Russian Federation deputy defense minister, stressed in his report. "The Defense Ministry has done and will continue to do everything possible to provide social protection for Afghan war veterans and in particular for the families of the dead and missing and for invalids." He noted that, despite financial problems, the Defense Ministry has just recently given assistance to more than 7,000 families of soldiers killed in the Afghan war and to around 4,600 invalids living in Russia. The meeting was addressed by Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergey Sokolov, retired Colonel General Yuriy Tukharinov, Aviation Colonel General Viktor Kot, and USSR People's Artist Iosif Kobzon. Yesterday, 15 February, wreaths were laid on the Grave of the Unknown Soldier and at the Perovo memorial to Muscovites killed in the Afghan War on behalf of the Defense Ministry leadership and the Committee for Internationalist Soldiers' Affairs under the Council of Commonwealth States' Heads of Government.
