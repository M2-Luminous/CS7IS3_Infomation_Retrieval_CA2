FR941021-0-00157 FR941021-0-00022 d. Interim plan. 49. As we discussed in the Notice , interference problems between MSS and certain proposed applications on GLONASS, the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System, will not permit co-frequency co-system coverage in the United States and internationally in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band. Specifically, if GLONASS is used in conjunction with the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) to provide aircraft precision approach and terminal communications, as contemplated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), MSS would not be able to operate in the shared band because of the potential for MSS mobile terminal interference into GLONASS mobile receivers. 57 We indicated in the Notice that we had initiated inter-agency and international negotiations regarding the use of GLONASS and were encouraged that even if GLONASS were ultimately used to provide services incompatible with MSS, the GLONASS final frequency plan would be changed to bands below 1606 MHz only, making the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band available for MSS operations. 58 We recognized, however, that a GLONASS transition to bands below 1606 MHz may not be completed when the first MSS satellites are launched in the late 1990's. In that case, we stated we would need to develop a transitional plan for MSS migration into the vacated 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band ``with MSS licensees operating on less than the full amount of their assigned spectrum during the initial phases of their operation.'' 59 57 The FAA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are investigating using the GLONASS and GPS systems in a joint Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that can support the civil aviation community with the integrity that is required to provide for precision approach landings. The Russian Federation is now launching a second generation of GLONASS satellites, GLONASS&hyph;M, which is operating over 24 channels in the 1596.7&hyph;1620.6 MHz band. GLONASS&hyph;M has not been coordinated internationally. Approximately 40 administrations, including the United States, have submitted comments or objections to the ITU Radiocommunication Bureau with respect to GLONASS&hyph;M. However, the Russian Federation has been coordinating the GLONASS&hyph;M system and has indicated that it has resolved most of the objections by these administrations. 58 The Russian Federation has indicated a willingness to use channels 0&hyph;12 (1602&hyph;1608.75 MHz center frequency) commencing in 1998. A guardband of approximately 4 MHz would be required to protect GLONASS&hyph;M narrowband signals from ground-based Mobile Earth Station (MES) out-of-band radio frequency emissions on aviation GNSS receivers using GLONASS signals. 59 Notice , note 2, supra , at n.59. 50. The applicants agree in their Joint Proposal that if GLONASS is not moved in a timely manner, the Big LEO licensees should share the burden of any spectrum loss. They argue, however, that we need not develop a transitional plan now, but, rather, that we should allow the parties to negotiate and reach such an agreement in the event GLONASS compromises MSS operations. Both Motorola and LQP argue in their comments that an interim plan would impede MSS by suggesting to GLONASS equipment manufacturers and other countries that they need not plan for the change in GLONASS frequencies and may lead to the view that revision of the GLONASS frequency plan is optional. 51. Our ongoing discussions with other agencies and with the Russian Federation continue to clarify the GLONASS issue. While we are confident that GLONASS will be moved to bands below 1606 MHz, we do not know when a full transition will occur. At our most recent bilateral discussions, the Russian Federation suggested that a GLONASS migration may not begin until 1998 and may not be completed until 2005. 60 We do not know whether GLONASS operations, before a migration to the final frequency configuration, will affect MSS CDMA systems operating in the lower frequency portion of the 1.6 GHz band, domestically or internationally. This depends upon two related factors: (1) the extent to which domestic and international civil aeronautical agencies and organizations (such as ICAO) use GLONASS to provide approach and terminal communications that are incompatible with MSS operations and (2) the extent to which out-of-band emission limitations may be needed for MSS transmissions. 61 Nevertheless, a portion of the 1.6 GHz MSS frequency band may not be available for first-generation domestic MSS operations. At this time, the most likely worst-case scenario is that the 1610&hyph;1612 MHz band segment assigned to CDMA systems in our sharing plan may not be available for initial operations in the United States. 62 This is based on the launch and operation schedules outlined in the various applications. 60 The Russian Federation has indicated that it can operate on channels ^7 to +6 after 2005 (1598 to 1605.375 MHz center frequency). It has also indicated that it would only use channels 5 and 6 as technical channels over the Russian Federation. When this is implemented, GLONASS's highest effective operational channel will be 1604.25 MHz center frequency. Allowing for a 4 MHz guard band, there will then be no restrictions on MSS in the 1.6 GHz band. 61 RTCA, Inc., an advisory committee to the FAA, is studying out-of-band emissions from mobile earth stations among other potential interference sources to GNSS receivers. RTCA, Inc. has formed an Ad Hoc Interference Subgroup (AHIS) of Special Committee 159 (SC&hyph;159) on Global Positioning Systems. A special Joint Task Group on SATCOM/GNSS Interference is also studying the mutual problems of electromagnetic compatibility of AMSS and GPS/GLONASS equipment operating on the same platforms or on platforms located at very close distances, i.e. , airport terminals. See para. 137, infra . 62 We note that to the extent MSS systems are launched before 1998, the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz portion of the 1.6 GHz band segment might not be available if GLONASS is being used in the GNSS for aeronautical operations. In that case, licensees can begin to implement channels starting from the highest frequency range downwards in conformance with the interim plan. We believe that this should not present significant problems since it will occur at the earliest stages of operations. We also note that it is possible that the FAA will decide not to use GLONASS until it shifts its frequencies to its final configuration. It may be prohibitively expensive for airlines to develop and install equipment using interim standards capable of protecting equipment using GLONASS. In that event, we believe that it is likely that the Russian Federation will advance the date to shift GLONASS frequencies to channel 6 and below as early as possible. The most recent bilateral discussion with the Russian Federation provides for periodic review of this time table and the deployment of the MSS systems in order to resolve any interference. 52. We agree with the applicants that the burden of the potential 2 MHz shortfall should be shared among all 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS licensees. We believe, however, that a transitional plan is warranted. Such a plan will allow system launch to begin without potential delay and without the uncertainty associated with allowing the licensees to attempt to devise an interim plan on an ad hoc basis, as the Joint Proposal suggests. 63 In adopting an interim plan, we emphasize that we remain optimistic that the plan will not need to be implemented. Indeed, as provided in the Joint Proposal, all Big LEO operators will be authorized to construct systems capable of operating across the entire band allocated for that system architecture, that is, 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz for CDMA systems and 1616&hyph;1626.5 MHz for bi-directional FDMA/TDMA systems. Further, even if the transitional plan is implemented, MSS operators will be permitted to expand into the unused 1.6 GHz MSS frequencies immediately after the GLONASS migration is completed. We believe that any necessary transition among LEO licensees can be completed within six months of that date. 63 We will, however, entertain a request for modification of the interim plan if agreed to by all licensees.
