Slezevicius be trusted? As it had been reported before, such a topic for a televised discussion was proposed by the Democratic Party. Five of the six participants in the program are Seimas [parliament] deputies -- G. Pavirzis and A. Kuncinas (the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] ), V. Andriukaitis (the Social Democratic Party), S. Peceliunas, and J. Tartilas (the Democratic Party). Thus, it is natural that the debate reminded everyone of the "sweet" oral clashes between the majority and the opposition in the legislature, and echoed the recent Seimas discussion on the country's internal situation. [passage omitted] The only person not "elected" by the nation was A. Ambrazevicius, representative of the Movement for National Progress. Opening the discussion, S. Peceliunas raised two questions: Would the change of government provide anything today, and would the new officials really conduct a policy that is not harmful to the state? Has the time come to replace those who appointed this government? Providing examples from the recent activities of the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Transportation (uncontrolled military transit, the problem of the Adutiskis railway station [dispute with Belarus], attitudes toward the Polish-Lithuanian treaty), the democrats' representative drew the following conclusion: "I think that we should not discharge the government en masse now." It might be sufficient to replace four ministers by citing specific charges of acting against the state. In S. Peceliunas' opinion, however, there is another problem: The ruling party itself is incapable of managing the country. "Therefore, it is getting upset and angry with itself and others." The fact that the entire LDDP list found itself in the Seimas after the elections is responsible for this situation. Many representatives of the majority do not even know now what they have to do. Would not they be worth replacing? A referendum on the people's confidence in the government could answer this question. A. Kuncinas, who had told journalists back on Wednesday morning that the topic of discussion was formulated incorrectly, reminded everyone that the manner of changing the government is indicated in the Constitution and the Seimas Statute. Therefore, there was no need to discuss such an issue in public. It would be also improper for the LDDP to express no confidence in its own government. The LDDP may criticize and reprimand it, which is being accomplished, and search for solutions. V. Andriukaitis repeatedly listed the promises and commitments given by the sixth cabinet of ministers which it failed to fulfill, and reminded the government of its political responsibility. At the same time, he stressed that the government crisis in Lithuania is deep and that it has continued for several years. There is hardly such a political force today which could resolve all our problems by itself. In V. Andriukaitis' opinion, it would be useful to draft a doctrine of interpellation that would help determine whether a broad political coalition was possible, attract specialists, freeze all claims for two years, and design a serious program which would be approved by all forces after reaching a consensus. According to V. Andriukaitis, an interpellation to the government does not mean its overthrow. It could manifest itself through parliamentary criticism, debates, and proposals, which would be a serious step toward progress. According to G. Pavirzis, even though the government is reprimanded greatly, it is imposing. The Seimas deputy reminded everyone that after the elections, the LDDP called on all political forces to form a coalition government, but the latter refused. [passage omitted] It is easy to criticize programs. However, the times when five-year plans were fulfilled in three years are already over. We should not interfere with the government's work, the more so since the LDDP does not shun responsibility. "Lithuania will hardly ever be in such a unique situation as today," said A. Ambrazevicius. The LDDP has the parliamentary majority, the Presidency, the government, and the prime minister, who is also the party chairman. Thus, its responsibility is unequivocal. However, the LDDP often behaves as though it did not have this majority. This is bad, because these four years in office are the party's chance. LDDP's political future will depend on its ability to use this chance. The opposition should not obstruct the ruling majority, demand early elections, and so on. Unfortunately, it resorts to the principle "the worse for the state, the better for the opposition" more often today. [passage omitted] J. Tartilas shared A. Ambrazevicius' opinion on the government's dependence. "The spectrum is really monochromatic -- the president, the Seimas, and the government." However, two years have passed since the "red color began to administer Lithuania," and what has been accomplished? J. Tartilas said that he saw a much deeper meaning in this issue than just a government collapse. This might be the desire to avoid responsibility and oust the government with the opposition's hands. One could explain later that the opposition is to blame for everything. Thus, J. Tartilas suggested that the LDDP government be allowed to work for its full four-year term. However, if we were to replace it, we should change the entire "spectrum." Replying to some people's doubts, S. Peceliunas explained: "We do not seek power. We are talking about Lithuania's situation and perspective. We see that the current manner of governing reduces this perspective, while the majority would not listen to our proposals."
