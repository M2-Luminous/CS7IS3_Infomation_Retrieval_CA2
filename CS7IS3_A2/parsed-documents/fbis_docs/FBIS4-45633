The environment minister, Mr. Kamal Nath, told the UN Commission on Sustainable Development that there should be a change in pattern of consumption, favoring lesser use of energy and lesser waste. The minister was addressing the commission in New York yesterday. Mr. Kamal Nath said unless the gap between the quality of life in the developing world and that in the developed nations is narrowed down, there can be no sustainable development. Mr. Kamal Nath said developing countries cannot be expected to be frozen at some marginal level of subsistence. He said even a marginal reduction in consumption by rich people in advanced countries could make a large number of poor people better off without affecting the rich. He welcomed the beginning made with the Global Environment Facility, the GEF, but cautioned that the gains of the GEF will be overwhelmed if they are not followed expeditiously.
