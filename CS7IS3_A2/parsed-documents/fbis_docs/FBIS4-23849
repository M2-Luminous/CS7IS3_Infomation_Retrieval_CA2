Assane Diop met him in Tunis this morning. He asked him if he really thought that the Rwandan belligerents will respect the cease-fire agreement negotiated under the mediation of the Great Lakes countries: [Begin recording] [Mobutu] I think so. The two parties promised to respect the cease-fire and its immediate implementation unconditionally in the presence of the heads of state of the region. [Diop] What will your role be later in the implementation of the cease-fire? [Mobutu] In the Rwandan conflict, my role has always been that of a mediator. Now, concerning the follow up and the supervision of this cease-fire, either all the heads of state of the region will go to Arusha for the dialogue that will be started immediately, or each of us will send a delegate or a representative [to Arusha]. [Diop] And what have you decided about the peacekeeping force? [Mobutu] I believe eight African countries have already agreed to provide the UN with troops. [Diop] What about France's position on this issue, Mr. President? [Mobutu] My deputy foreign minister followed [French Foreign Minister] Mr. Juppe's statement on TV. As far as I am concerned there are two things: either the two parties [to the Rwandan conflict] who have agreed on a cease-fire, behave with honesty toward each other or they do not behave with honesty. I think France is not the only state [prepared to become involved]. Other states are ready to intervene to put an end to this horror. As far as Zaire is concerned, had we intervened in Rwanda, the situation would be different today. [Diop] Has your meeting here [in Tunis] helped to remove suspicion? [Mobutu] I have two answers to your question: First, those who have proof that my country supplied arms [to the Rwandan Government] should provide it. Second, Museveni was the first to congratulate me on the success of the mini-summit of heads of state of the region that I chaired on Tuesday. There is no problem regarding this issue. [Words indistinct] for the liberation of his country. I think that as far as Rwanda is concerned, we, the heads of state, absolutely should not be hypocritical. It is easy to say Zaire is supplying arms. Let me emphasize again that if Zaire intervened [in Rwanda] the situation would be different. [end recording] [passage omitted]
