[Danes] What is your assessment, a week later, of the visit to Prague by the U.S. President and of the Partnership for Peace plan? [Zieleniec] I think that President Clinton's visit was important not only for us and for designing the new security architecture in Europe but, from a certain point of view, also for the United States. The very fact that the visit took place and that President Clinton chose Prague as one of the places to hold talks during his first visit to Europe was also significant for us. This is recognition of what we are doing, recognition of the success of our reforms, and is a manifestation of the friendly relations between the United States and our country. In my opinion, this visit was also important for the United States. U.S. foreign policy has been seeking a specific form ever since President Clinton came into office. It has often had to endure harsh accusations from European politicians and media that the country is again seeking isolation, that it is becoming wrapped up in itself, or that it is reorienting itself toward Asia. At the same time, it is obvious that, from the security point of view, Europe was, is, and will be for a long time a key continent. Clinton's European visit, the way it was planned, and its results prove that Europe remains a central feature of U.S. security policy. The visit was also important for us because it acted as a major stimulus in the debate on expanding the Western security system. It demonstrated that the anxiety about the West's reluctance and inability to gradually fill the security vacuum in Central Europe was unfounded. The Partnership for Peace plan originally offered, in principle, only joint exercises and the possibility of other military activities with NATO. What the NATO summit in Brussels finally approved and President Clinton outlined in Prague is much more. The plan now contains a serious offer of political cooperation. [Danes] What does this offer of political cooperation consist of? [Zieleniec] The approved document contains a relatively detailed definition of the political values on which Partnership for Peace is based. This is important because the North Atlantic Alliance defends the West European, if you like, Western Christian, system of values--freedom, democracy... So as not to use any high-flown words, it defends our way of life. This specification is also the basis for future differentiation between the individual partner states. If the Partnership for Peace is established explicitly on this value basis, a basis that also serves as a criterion for the success of the bilateral agreements, I have no doubt that it will lead to our country's membership in the Alliance. Since the beginning, Czech diplomacy has been striving actively to ensure that, for these practical reasons, the plan attained a substantial political dimension. The fact that this has happened is undoubtedly a result of this endeavor. Moreover, during his visit to Prague, President Clinton put forward other specific projects in support of the new European democracies, projects that should intensify the ties between our republic, the other Central European countries, and NATO countries. It is apparent from all of this that the Partnership offer is not a decoy or a blind alley but is a real step forward--a step that, at the same time, also relates to Russia and presents alternatives in the event of unfavorable security developments in our region. [Danes] Did you get, for instance, an indirect promise from the U.S. President of involvement in our security, and were specific dates mentioned in this regard? [Zieleniec] No promise of specific involvement was made, and no dates were mentioned, but I do not think this is what is important here. The visit by the U.S. President and the talks as a whole mean that they are taking us into consideration. Moreover, President Clinton said very decidedly that the security of the Czech Republic is important for the security of the United States. I would also like to refer to the reverse aspect of this issue, an aspect that is often overlooked. If we feel like a future NATO member--and I believe justifiably so--we should think about it within the scope of its future efficiency. That is, one day the Alliance will also guarantee our state's security. I admit, therefore, that, in reply to a question of whether NATO should be opened up immediately to all the countries of East Europe, I personally do not come up with the answer as easily as some Czech journalists. Perhaps it would be worth thinking about this, about whether it would be better to wait a while--as far as our entry into NATO is concerned, of course--with the aim of maintaining the Western alliance's efficiency. The immediate incorporation of inconstant Eastern states, many of which do not yet have a deep-rooted system of Western values and are economically and politically unstable, into the Alliance could seriously impair its defensive strength. No such considerations are ever published in the Czech press. [Danes] How distant does the prospect of signing a bilateral treaty with NATO within the framework of Partnership for Peace seem to you? When, thereafter, will we join NATO? [Zieleniec] I generally estimate our entry into NATO within a few years; the entire process, however, is to a considerable extent associated with the development of the security situation in Europe and throughout Eurasia. As far as signing our bilateral agreement with NATO within the framework of Partnership for Peace is concerned, I think this is a matter of a few months. The government has to discuss the NATO offer formally and submit its proposal to the NATO secretary general. The Alliance will then submit its proposal on the basis of this. These two proposals create the bedrock for treaty-based relations. The government must also consider how much money we want to spend on this. [Danes] According to the decision made in Brussels, the size of the financial investment each country is willing to make in the Partnership for Peace will also influence the extent of its cooperation with NATO. How much money will our government earmark for this plan? [Zieleniec] I will intentionally not answer the question of "how much." The issue does not only involve money as such. Our participation in the plan must reflect our willingness to take part in the activities of the NATO countries and our coresponsibility for defending the region of democracy. This is an important matter (it is possible to declare anything verbally), but we recognize real will according to the willingness to make sacrifices. On a specific level, this means conducting an analysis of the costs and comparing them with the possibilities. Inasmuch as we have not used up our military budget, we will draw the money, first and foremost, from it, and perhaps we will also add something from other sources. [Danes] Prague has shown a more enthusiastic attitude toward the Partnership for Peace than the other Visegrad Four countries. Is this because our prospects for exchanging the partnership for membership are greater than the prospects of the other countries? [Zieleniec] I want to speak not about prospects but, rather, about a real estimate of the situation. Of all of the Visegrad countries, we had the most unequivocal policy toward NATO. The aim of joining the North Atlantic Alliance was expressed, if not immediately, then relatively soon after the revolution--as an element of the state's political orientation, of course. It would be hard to find such unequivocalness in the policy of other countries. In some places, I observe a chopping and changing--from rejecting NATO and seeking salvation in the CSCE to joining NATO immediately. [Danes] I cannot completely agree with you on the issue of the unequivocalness of our stance. Your predecessor, Mr. Dienstbier, preferred, in contrast to you, a concept for creating a single Eurasian security zone and organizations like the CSCE.... [Zieleniec] Our stance has been stable since 1992, at least, when we won the election. Of course, the Civic Democratic Party had an unequivocal stance on this issue before the elections; it has had one virtually since its establishment. The Czech approach of steady orientation toward NATO was eventually accepted as the most practical one during the Prague summit. This does not mean that I could not imagine a better option, for example, with a specific entry date and so on. Of course, when there is more than one partner, not all of them can ever be 100-percent satisfied with the result. If I gauge development in the Partnership for Peace plan from the point of view of the potential for influencing its final shape, we have achieved above-average results. [Danes] A meeting of the Visegrad countries' defense ministers, which our Minister Baudys refused to attend, was held in Warsaw just before the summit. Polish representatives, in particular President Walesa, then accused the Czech Government, which was rejecting military cooperation within the framework of the Four, of shortsightedness and egoism. The West still views these countries as a single geopolitical zone. Are you not concerned that the West may interpret our veto on military and political coordination within the Four as a destabilizing factor in the region? [Zieleniec] We have to confront absolutely this evaluation of the situation. I would consider the "all or nothing" stance of some countries to be more dangerous for stability in the region. It is difficult for more than two partners to agree upon the "all or nothing" principle. For multilateral cooperation, it is always essential to define the areas in which all of the participants will agree. The Prague summit, however, also contributed to clarifying this issue. It is necessary to deal with security cooperation on a bilateral basis--that is, each country with the North Atlantic Alliance separately--on account of the very nature of this cooperation and to prevent the creation of alternative blocs. The Czech Republic cannot accept such a risk. [Danes] Are you aware of any attempts to create an alternative military bloc? [Zieleniec] The way things are in policy, if you take the first step, logic will push everything forward. The example of Visegrad is typical of this. You can see how much passion our decision to exempt one aspect from it is arousing in such a loose association--in fact, a symbolic association. I agree that integration with the North Atlantic Alliance is in our common interest, but, if we look farther to the East, our ties and those of Poland with the East are not the same. This is because our geopolitical situation is different. I think that we would be making a bad job of defending our interests if our security interests were exactly the same as the security interests of all of the countries in the region. Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher left his colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt about the importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in the security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of bilateral ties between these states and NATO. This point of view was also expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by President Clinton. It is essential within the framework of Visegrad to execute regional cooperation by carrying out specific deeds, for example, in the trade and economic spheres, and not just hold ostentatious summit meetings at which the perfidy of the West is cursed. This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so that it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is not true that, if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors. We are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and straightforwardly.
