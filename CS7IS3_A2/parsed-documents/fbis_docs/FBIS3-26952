On the eve of the Chinese New Year, a traditional festival of the Chinese nation, the fact that great progress was made and several common consensuses were reached in the talks between the heads of the Association for Relations Across the Straits [ARATS] and the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] in Beijing has brought a meaningful spring-festival gift to compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Following the Wang-Koo talks, ARATS and SEF held three rounds of talks on routine affairs in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taipei. This time, ARATS Executive Vice President Tang Shubei, and Zou Zhekai, vice president and secretary general, held frank and wide-ranging consultations with Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman and secretary general, on the work and routine affairs of the two organizations and on related issues. During consultations, the two sides maintained that they should avoid political issues with pragmatic attitudes. They discussed three routine topics which included the repatriation of personnel entering each other's territory in violation of relevant provisions and other related issues, and they reached a high degree of consensus. They agreed that the fourth round of consultations on routine affairs will be held in Beijing and unanimously agreed that in the fourth round, they will exchange views or hold consultations on a number of economic, scientific, and technological topics as listed in the common agreement at the Wang- Koo talks. We can say that with their concerted efforts this time, some differences in previous routine affairs consultations between ARATS and SEF have been resolved, to a considerable extent, laying the groundwork for the routine affairs consultations next time. Mr. Chiao Jen-ho said: "This is conducive to the ties and cooperation between ARATS and SEF in the future and conducive to promoting the virtuous and interactive development of relations between the two sides of the Strait." The talks this time lasted for five days and were very fruitful. The experience of the talks this time and the preceding rounds of consultations gives us these inspirations: First, for routine affairs consultations, we should insist on the nongovernmental role of ARATS and SEF. Their major functions are to handle specific routine problems arising from contacts and exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. The two organizations, whose roles are clearly specified in their own articles, are officially empowered nongovernmental bodies. Having a good understanding of this, one does not need to attach too much political significance to the contacts and consultations between the organizations. One still recalls that at last year's Wang-Koo talks in Singapore, the two sides of the Straits stressed ARATS's and SEF's nongovernmental and economic nature, their being limited to handling routine affairs, and their functionality. Precisely because the two sides adhered to this pragmatic spirit, the Wang-Koo talks were a complete success. In the wake of the Wang-Koo talks, some people in Taiwan argued that they gave prominence to the fact that "the two sides of the Strait are divided and ruled separately, and are on an equal footing." These irresponsible remarks which did not tell the truth about the facts have made the just-begun routine affairs consultations between ARATS and SEF more complicated and more politicized and are, at a time when the political differences between the two sides of the Straits have not been resolved today, nonconducive to promoting the building up of mutual trust between ARATS and SEF and between the two sides of the Straits, and nonconducive to the smooth development of relations between the two sides of the Straits. At the consultations this time, the two sides reached a common consensus on adhering to the nongovernmental nature of the routine affairs consultations between ARATS and SEF and avoiding sensitive political issues. This is objective and pragmatic and will play a positive role in the implementation of the various agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks and in future consultations on routine affairs topics. Second, keeping the linking channels between ARATS and SEF unblocked is an important means for the two sides of the Straits to improve understanding and strengthen mutual trust. The two sides of the Straits have been separated for a very long time, and their differences have deepened. The establishment of a systemized linking and communication channel will undoubtedly help alleviate their differences and clear up their misunderstandings, "erecting a bridge of friendship and paving a road to success" for the development of relations between the two sides of the Straits. One important achievement at the Wang-Koo talks was the signing of an agreement on the system of ties and talks between the two sides of the Straits. The function and obligation of ARATS and SEF are to implement the agreement loyally. Over the past year, ARATS has been positive and serious about implementing the agreement. Last November, in order to strictly implement the provision in the agreement that the secretaries general or vice presidents of ARATS and SEF have one meeting every six months, ARATS took the initiative to write to SEF, inviting Mr. Chiao Jen-ho to Beijing for a meeting. Afterward, they went through a tortuous course: Tang Shubei could not make a trip to Taiwan for some reason on the Taiwan side, and Mr. Chiao "had to reconsider whether or not he would have to postpone" his trip to Beijing. Therefore, the talks this time did not begin with ease, and the achievements made should be cherished doubly. Meeting with Mr. Jen-ho Chiao, Director Wang Zhaoguo said: "Although ARATS and SEF are nongovernmental organizations, their good or bad cooperation can often reflect the development of relations between the two sides of the Strait. Despite the fact that the two sides of the Strait still have political differences, it is very important to establish a channel of communication on issues of routine affairs." This affirms the function and significance of keeping the linking channel unblocked between the two organizations from a higher and wider field of vision. Based on this, we maintain that, on the one hand, the two sides should strictly abide by the relevant agreements and continue to keep the linking and communication channel, unblocked between the two organizations, and that, on the other hand, it is of course good if the two sides can reach agreement or consensus at each round of consultations, and if they fail, they should not be disappointed because there is hope and there will be achievements as long as they come into contact. The saying runs: One makes plans in the spring. The talks this time was the first consultations between the heads of the two organizations following the Wang-Koo talks as well as their first contact and consultations in 1994. The success of the talks is a good beginning for ties and cooperation between the two organizations and for various routine affairs consultations between them for this year. Compatriots on the two sides of the Straits look forward to the earliest possible implementation of the important consensuses reached at the talks in their consultations and relevant agreements.
