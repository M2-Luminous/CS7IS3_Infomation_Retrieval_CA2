A recent investigation of 572 joint ventures in 14 provinces, conducted by the State Auditing Administration, disclosed the increasing illegal practices in foreign funding, such as: --A big part of promised foreign investment is not channeled into the joint ventures. Of the 572 enterprises' 2.609 billion yuan ($300 million) in registered capital that should have been provided by foreign investors, only 43 percent was actually handed over. --Many investors provided outdated machinery and technology to fulfill their contractual investment. What's worse is that such investments also can entitle the investor to dividends, which will result in long-term harm to the Chinese partners. --Some investors use various means to withdraw their investment after the joint ventures have been establisted. Many borrow money from the enterprises and some sell raw materials and equipment to the joint ventures at prices higher than on the international market. --Some joint ventures were set up with loans from Chinese banks or money borrowed from Chinese partners. Such enterprises, which are actually solely Chinese funded, are created to take advantage of the country's preferential policies for foreign-funded ventures. "All these problems call for closer attention from high levels," said Xu Yudi, director of the State Auditing Administration's foreign funds application audit department. "It's time for action," Xu said. He said joint ventures are no doubt playing an ever big role in introducting foreign capital and advanced technologies. However, if these illegal practices cannot be rooted out, not only will joint ventures be unable to introduce foreign capital and advanced equipment and technology to China, but they also will bring about long-term losses to Chinese interests. "We can't just sit by and see these problems become more and more severe," Xu said. He said the State should organize an examination of the nation's joint ventures that would involve the departments of foreign trade, administration of industry and commerce, customs and administration of State properties. Foreign equipment and technology should also be evaluated more closely to stop such subterfuge, he said. Xu said the intensified monitoring of joint ventures would not affect foreign investors' interests since an improved investment environment and management will help protect their legal rights. With some joint ventures, a major problem is tax evasion. For example, an audit last year of 109 large joint ventures showed they owed the State 27.82 million yuan ($3.2 million) in back taxes and other overdue charges.
