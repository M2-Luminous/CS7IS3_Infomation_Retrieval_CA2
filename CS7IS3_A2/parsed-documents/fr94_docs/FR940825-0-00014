A new §319.56&hyph;2dd is added to read as follows: §319.56&hyph;2dd Administrative instructions: conditions governing the entry of pink or red tomatoes from Spain. (a) Pink or red tomatoes (fruit) ( Lycopersicon esculentum ) from Spain may be imported into the United States only under the following conditions: (1) The tomatoes must be grown in the Almeria Province of Spain in greenhouses registered with, and inspected by, the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (MAFF); (2) The tomatoes may be shipped only from December 1 through April 30, inclusive; (3) Two months prior to shipping, and continuing through April 30, MAFF must set and maintain Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) traps baited with trimedlure inside the greenhouses at a rate of four traps per hectare. In all areas outside the greenhouses and within 8 kilometers, including urban and residential areas, MAFF must place Medfly traps at a rate of four traps per square kilometer. All traps must be checked every 7 days; (4) Capture of a single Medfly in a registered greenhouse shall immediately cancel exports from that greenhouse until the source of infestation is determined, all Medflies are eradicated, and measures are taken to preclude any future infestation. Capture of a single Medfly within 2 kilometers of a registered greenhouse will necessitate increasing trap density in order to determine whether there is a reproducing population in the area or if the single Medfly has been introduced accidentally. Capture of two Medflies within 2 kilometers of a registered greenhouse and within a 1 month time period shall cancel exports from all registered greenhouses within 2 kilometers of the find, until the source of infestation is determined and all Medflies are eradicated; (5) The tomatoes must be packed within 24 hours of harvest. They must be safeguarded by a flyproof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the packing house and while awaiting packing, and packed in flyproof containers for transit to the airport and subsequent shipping to the United States. (6) MAFF is responsible for export certification inspection and issuance of phytosanitary certificates. A phytosanitary certificate issued by MAFF and bearing the following declaration, ``These tomatoes were grown in registered greenhouses in Almeria Province in Spain,'' must accompany the shipment. (b) [ Reserved ] Done in Washington, DC, this 19th day of August 1994. Terry L. Medley, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
