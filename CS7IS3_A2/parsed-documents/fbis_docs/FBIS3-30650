Prof. Petyo Petkov, said at a press conference today. Members of all trade union organizations at the university have joined the effective strike. The Sofia University students have been on strike since January 21. The Neofit Rilski Southwestern University in Blagoevgrad will join the strike tomorrow. Academic work -- examinations, lectures, seminars, laboratory research and preparations for the admission of new students, at Bulgaria's largest university has stopped. Classes are conducted only with extramural students and persons doing postgraduate work. The strikers' demand for the allocation of 2.3 percent of the gross domestic product to education and science (1.5 percent for university education and 0.8 for science) is realistic and necessary, reporters were reminded again. Addressing all Bulgarians, the Strike Committee of the Sofia University Lecturers and Employees calls for support. The document makes it a point that "the university lecturers and students are not on strike for salaries and scholarships, meager as they may be." They are fighting for the very survival of education and science, so that Bulgaria can exist, it is stressed in the address. At a working meeting in the University of Veliko Turnovo, central Bulgaria, representatives of the rector's offices of six provincial universities adopted a document expressing their stand on the acute problems of higher education in Bulgaria. The document says that the financial collapse of higher education institutions may have serious negative consequences, causing unforeseen damages over the next five or ten years. The Council of Rectors in Sofia will be familiarized with the document. After the talks of Ministry of Science and Education officials and representatives of the striking students and the lecturers' strike committee, it became clear that except for the financial demands, all other ones were feasible and included in the Ministry's programme long ago.
