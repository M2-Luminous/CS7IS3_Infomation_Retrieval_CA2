Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed special concern on the socioeconomic programs that Quang Tri going to carry out in the period to come. He recommended that for the hilly areas of the province, the local authority should work out a comprehensive plan to cover with greenery and other industrial plants for over 20,000 hectares of bare hills and empty lands, in conjunction with plans to reallocate the population and resolve its infrastructure issues. The prime minister urged the leaders to consider thoroughly and select wisely the plants to grow on suitable land, to create rich forest with high-industrial-value plants and trees, thus efficiently utilizing the assistance of the government in forms of capital, plant species, and purchase of products. Apart from the local labor force, provincial leaders should motivate the contributions from the immigrants who came to resettle in the province, so that the uplands areas would grow quickly out of poverty and hunger, and the plains areas would also see their residents' living standards improve. The settled life and settled farming program for mountain areas should be completed quickly according to a detailed plan with concrete objectives and fixed time schedule, so that the bad practice of slash-and-burn farming could be eliminated in parallel with an improvement in living standards of minority ethnic people. For the people living along the coast, in addition to development of the catch, rearing, and processing of aquatic products, the local authority should set up concrete economic development plans for every village located in the area of 30,000 hectares of sandy land along the coast, to ensure an ever-improving life for both the people fishing offshore and those who work inland. In plain areas, the leaders should strive to bring production opportunity to each family living in safe and stable areas. To the areas where production activities are not stable, alternate species planting should be considered as a measure to avoid harsh weather conditions. In terms of industry, the prime minister maintained that the leaders should firmly grasp contents of the industrialization process for Quang Tri Province so that the process would be carried out steadily and suitably, thus creating conditions for the transformation from the present agro-forestry to the agro-industry economic structure in a near future. The province should strive to develop early its industry, especially processing industry and construction material production at small and medium scales, utilizing modern technology obtained with assistance of foreign partners. The prime minister also reminded leaders of Quang Tri to strive for better implementation of reallocation plans for people in Dong Ha and Khe Sanh Route No. 9 so that the locations would be able to become commercial and tourist attractions of the province. The task of developing cultural, social, medical, and education activities should also receive appropriate concern and care from leaders. Families of war dead and social pension recipients should be cared for since the people of Quang Tri are those who suffer the most heavy consequences in all aspects of the war.
