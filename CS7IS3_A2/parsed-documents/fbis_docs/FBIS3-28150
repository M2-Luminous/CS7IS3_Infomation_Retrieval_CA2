FBIS3-28150 "dreas023__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Report by Securities Oversight Office Outlined 942A0051A Tokyo KINYU ZAISEI JIJO in Japanese 8 Nov 93 pp 34-37--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0051A Tokyo KINYU ZAISEI JIJO Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Tadashi Omae, general coordinator for the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission: "With Inspections, To Watch With Impartial Stance and Handle Infractions Resolutely; Year's Activities of Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission"] [Text] More than a year has passed since the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission was established on 20 July 1992. Ever since, the surveillance commission has worked to get itself set up in various respects, such as firming up the organization and in-service training for its staff, endeavoring to put its operations into effect quickly and concretely, and so far, it has conducted its assigned duties in a generally orderly manner. The surveillance commission is required by law to report publicly its business affairs. Responding to that on last 15 October, it pulled together the situation of its activities to date and published it as "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission." In the following, I wish to report on the year's activities since the surveillance commission started out, based on the contents of the report. Report's Significance Under laws establishing the Ministry of Finance, the surveillance commission "must annually publish the situation of its business affairs." Amidst the soul-searching on the so-called security scandals of 1991 and the study of countermeasures to that, the surveillance commission was set up as part of the measures to review the inspection and surveillance setup. For the securities market and other institutions to discharge their functions smoothly, it is essential that investor trust be sustained that fairness of trading in the market is guaranteed and that the market is fair. In that sense, if the surveillance commission--having ensured fairness in securities trading and so on--handles its functions properly and lets such activity be widely known, it can contribute much to upholding investor trust in market fairness. From such a viewpoint, reporting on the activities of the surveillance commission is considered obligatory; and, giving consideration to the objectives of the laws, we have concretely considered the substance and methodology of the report. Report Methodology The report of the surveillance commission pulls together business affairs that the surveillance commission handled during the year and in its contents considers a fair amount of the things it had to do. It was prepared in the form of a pamphlet and mailed to those concerned so that it might also be offered for perusal at outlets of the surveillance commission, financial authorities, and institutions with voluntary controls. Also, a summary of the report was carried in the official gazette. We thought that putting out the report in this manner would make it possible to have a wide sector of the public know about the surveillance commission's activities. Gist of Report In the "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission" pulled together this time we covered activities which the surveillance commission engaged in from 20 July 1992, when it was set up, through 30 June 1993. The "Activities and Other Affairs of the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission" consists of an introduction and main text. The introduction describes the details of setting up the surveillance commission, its organization, and a summary of the surveillance commission's business, while the main text separately describes the chief duties of the surveillance commission: Chapter 1. "Inspections"; Chapter 2. "Examinations"; Chapter 3. "Investigating Infractions"; Chapter 4. "Advisories"; Chapter 5. "Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of Finance"; Chapter 6. "Institutions With Voluntary Controls"; and Chapter 7. "Other Activities." Based on the report's contents, the following sets forth the surveillance commission's activities for the year. Inspections 1. Based on the inspection authority granted by the minister of finance, the surveillance commission conducts on-site inspections of securities firms and other financial institutions with permits for security business from the standpoint of ensuring fairness in things like securities trading. 2. For conducting inspections, the surveillance commission laid down a basic inspection policy and basic inspection plan in August 1992 for the 1992 business year (July 1992 through June 1993). In this basic inspection plan for conducting inspections of securities firms, et al., we set out to conduct accurate inspections using the following points of emphasis: a) Many-sided checking on observance of the various market rules from the standpoint of ensuring fairness in securities dealing. b) From the standpoint of sustaining a healthy managerial posture by securities firms and others, fully checking on such aspects of their business posture as the facts on their encouraging investments. c) From the standpoint of ensuring reliability in the securities business, reviewing and getting a grasp of the circumstances of the internal management setup so as to fully check on whether it is functioning effectively. 3. In the 1992 business year for inspections, the surveillance commission and financial authorities undertook 84 inspections of securities firms and 11 inspections of financial institutions with permits for handling securities business. Of the inspections begun in this period, inspection findings had been delivered by 30 June 1993 to inspected institutions and inspections completed on 49 securities firms and seven financial institutions with permits to conduct securities business. 4. To consolidate the results of inspecting securities firms, et al., according to the points of inspection emphasis: a) As to their observance of trading rules, we found such problems as inducements promising to provide special profits (so-called "stock shuffling" [tobashi]), entrusting improper trading deals in transferred company debentures and entrusting transaction cleanup deals; b) as to their business posture, we found the problems of placing excessive trust in clients and excessive switched sales of investment trusts; and c) in their internal managerial setups we found such things as corruption and client disputes, leaking reports of corruption cases, and taking and transferring orders with persons other than clients. As for findings of major regulatory infractions as a result of inspections, as stated below we sent advisories to the minister of finance, contacted administrative authorities about problems found in the inspections, and had instructions for improvements sent from the said authorities to the parties inspected. Examination of Transactions 1. As for examining transactions, based on authority granted by the minister of finance under securities trading laws to collect reports and data, we do daily market observations by collecting reports and data from securities firms and financial institutions with permits to conduct securities business. 2. In the period for this report, a total of 170 examinations were conducted. Breaking these down by content, 154 examined price structure, 12 examined insider trading, and four examined other areas. 3. As to characteristics of the cases that were subjects of examinations, due to the fact that, compared to earlier periods, the activities of so-called "speculators" in buying up stocks in volume have subsided amid the general stagnation of the securities market, large and long-term cases were few and small cases became more numerous. As for the work of transaction examinations, although we found that in many cases there was no problem, the examination activity itself is functioning as a direct and indirect deterrent to the kinds of transactions that become problems. Investigating Infractions 1. When it was necessary for the surveillance commission staff to investigate infractions injurious to fairness in dealing, they can do discretionary investigations by conducting interrogations, inspections, custodial detainment, etc., as well as mandatory investigations by spot inspections, searches, and seizures under warrants issued by a judge. The surveillance commission receives reports of investigation findings from its staff and, when it gets proof of an infraction, issues an indictment. The authority to investigate infractions is a newly created power attendant to the surveillance commission's creation. By bringing to light the truth about pernicious acts injurious to fairness in dealing and by seeking criminal prosecution from indictments, we hope it will play a major role in securing fairness and health in the market. 2. In the period of this report, because of suspicions of market manipulation of Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section listed stock, in December 1992 the homes and offices of those suspected of infractions were raided, searched,items seized in an enforced investigation, and the needed investigation was conducted. 3. As a result of such investigation, on 21 May 1993, given the fact of market manipulations by the two persons suspected of the infractions, they were indicted by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office for violating the securities trading law. (Note: With the surveillance commission's indictment, an arraignment was effected 16 August by the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office against the two suspected of an infraction.) Advisories 1. When it has conducted inspections or investigations of infractions and found it necessary, the surveillance commission can advise the minister of finance, based on its findings, on administrative punishment or other measures that should be taken to ensure fairness in securities trading, etc. 2. In the period of this report, it provided the minister of finance with the two following advisories on the outcome of its inspections. Receiving these, the minister of finance effected specific punishments. a) With securities firm A, a violation having been found of the regulations (inviting investments by promising to provide special profits and entrusting improper dealing) by officers and staff of the securities firm, an advisory was issued to seek administrative punishment and other appropriate measures. Based on this advisory, the minister of finance applied such punishment as suspending the business of the involved section of the securities firm. Also, receiving notification from the Ministry of Finance, the Japan Association of Securities Dealers levied the punishment of canceling its canvasser's registration. b) With securities firm B, an infraction of relevant regulations by an employee (concluding a contract for entrusting a transaction cleanup deal) having been found, we issued an advisory requesting suitable measures. Based on the advisory and having received notification from the minister of finance, the Japan Association of Securities Dealers carried out the punishment of suspending the work of the canvasser. Inspections of Financial Institutions by Minister of Finance 1. For basic items relating to the inspections it conducts of financial institutions, the minister of finance must heed the views of the surveillance commission and must report to the surveillance commission each quarter on the status of inspections under way. Furthermore, for inspections of financial institutions conducted by the minister of finance, the surveillance commission can make recommendations; but during the 1992 inspection year, it found no situations for which recommendations were deemed necessary. 2. As to the inspections the minister of finance conducts, the surveillance commission stated its opinion in August 1992 that, "based on current financial conditions, in inspecting financial institutions, we should seek to understand precisely the details of their assets, grasp the status of each financial institution's rethinking of its internal office management, etc., and by checking on whether that is functioning effectively, should seek to conduct effective inspections in carrying out our inspections. 3. According to a report from the minister of finance, in the 1992 inspection year it initiated 249 inspections of financial institutions, 54 inspections of foreign exchange institutions, and 191 inspections of securities firms. Of these, as of 30 June 1993, it had completed the inspections of and sent instructions to 158 inspected financial institutions, 32 inspected foreign exchange institutions, and 134 inspected securities firms. Other Matters Besides what has been stated above, in this report we describe in detail the activities of such voluntary control institutions as the Securities Dealers Association and securities exchanges. Also, concerning the activities of the surveillance commission, it touches upon 1) the fact that, within the period of this report, the surveillance commission did not find conditions on which it should make recommendations on policies the Minister of Finance should adopt; 2) information received from all sources during the period of this report came to 497 items; and 3) to build links with authorities regulating securities in other countries, we are applying for membership in the International Organization of Securities Control Officers (abbreviated IOSCO). (Note: At the committee meeting of IOSCO representatives in Mexico City on 25 October, the surveillance commission was formally admitted.) As indicated, we believe the surveillance commission has so far faithfully carried out its expected role. Henceforth, in doing inspections and other work we will be watching transactions on the securities markets in accordance with laws and regulations and with an impartial stance, while following a course of resolutely dealing with infractions. As for the surveillance commission, we will be pleased if through such activities we can ensure fairness and transparency of the market and contribute to the healthful manifestation of its functioning.
