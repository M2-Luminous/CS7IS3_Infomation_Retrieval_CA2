The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu Ciller for two and a half hours last night. In a statement after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state minister and government spokesman, said that the interior minister briefed the Council of Ministers on the developments in the fight against terrorism. Aktuna pointed out that as a result of the determined attitude of the government regarding this issue, the terrorist organization incurred significant logistic [word indistinct] and personnel losses, especially during recent months. He pointed out that the morale of the separatist terrorist organization is very low, and consequently, increasing numbers of members are deserting the organization. Aktuna charged that the terrorist organization is continuously avoiding a confrontation with the security forces and is suffering from a shortage of food, weapons, and ammunition. He said: Our security forces will continue to effectively carry out operations both inside the country and across our borders until such time as the separatist terrorist organization is completely eliminated. Aktuna then said that the foreign minister briefed the Council of Ministers on the latest developments regarding the Cyprus and Azerbaijan issues. Replying to a question, Aktuna stressed that the terrorist organization's efforts to force the citizens in the southeast to emigrate to northern Iraq are aimed at deceiving the world. The necessary measures have been taken in connection with this issue, he said. Replying to another question, Aktuna said that the Council of Ministers did not discuss whether or not to extend the state of emergency.
