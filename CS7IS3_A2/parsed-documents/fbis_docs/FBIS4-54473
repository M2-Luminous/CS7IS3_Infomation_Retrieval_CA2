The same sources interpret this as a consequence of direct activities by the international Contact Group, which held talks in Sarajevo yesterday with representatives of the Muslim leaderhip. Reasons for the reduced level of combat activity by the Muslim units lie in the international efforts to bring about a four-month cease-fire, something which had been demanded by the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo, Serbian military sources point out. This is explained by the need to provide a let-up for the Muslim formations, which also gives them enough time to prepare new wider attacks against the RS, some of which are already under way. Serbian military sources say that republic of Srpska army units yesterday completely crushed an extremely strong two-day attack by the Muslim artillery and infantry units, mainly on the Mackov Vrh-Javorak-Neokrinje line in the Vlasic area.
