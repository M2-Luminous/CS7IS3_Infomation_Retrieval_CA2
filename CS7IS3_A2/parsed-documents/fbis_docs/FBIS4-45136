The request was prompted by the fact that the U.S.-Russian declaration of 14 January 1994 confirmed the intention of the presidents of the two states to discontinue aiming their strategic missiles by 30 May 1994. The State Department confirmed to the embassy that the aiming of all U.S. strategic missiles had been discontinued, including those aimed at Belarus, from whose territory Russian strategic missiles are currently being withdrawn. Our reporter points out that this is an important step toward definite elimination of the traces of the cold war.
