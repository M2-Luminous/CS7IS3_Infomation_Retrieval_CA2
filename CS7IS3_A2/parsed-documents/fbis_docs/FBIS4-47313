I. Adamatskiy, St. Petersburg State University; UDC 519.713] [Abstract] Cellular automata are discrete mathematical models of multi-component natural and artificial systems consisting of a large number of relatively simple elements linked locally into regular structures. Cellular automata may be applied to parallel asynchronous computation or image processing. This article examines an algorithm to model multi-dimensional deterministic finite asynchronous cellular automata with memory in a Turing machine with one-dimensional tapes (Turing machines without memory are also considered). Turing machines are claasical devices for evaluating the complexity of calculations. Estimates are obtained for the spatial and temporal complexity of modeling. It is found that the number of cell states, the size of the vicinity around a cell used to determine its state, the amount of memory, and the maximum delay as a cell changes from one state to another are either constant or vary insignificantly as the number of cells increases. Formulas are presented which are useful in evaluating the complexity of modeling asynchronous cellular automata with memory. Examples of the modeling of multi-component systems are presented. The case of a network of cellular automata is considered. Figures 8; references 16: 8 Russian, 8 Western.
