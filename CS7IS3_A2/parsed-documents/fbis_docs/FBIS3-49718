From the very beginning, you have been a great supporter of this integration initiative. How do you see all this now as reflected in the current summit? [Goncz] I would not say that the Visegrad cooperation was buried in Prague, because this is the regional cooperation of four given countries. In my opinion, this summit gave an impetus to this cooperation; it will probably accelerate it, or at least will increase the desire for economic cooperation. At the same time, this summit could bring the region's stability closer by the emergence of a negotiating mechanism capable of solving the possible differences of views. Thus, the common work of the four definitely contributes to the stability of the region and plays a balancing role in Central Europe. [NEPSZABADSAG] However, the Czech leaders openly say that they have something else in mind and, for some time, they have practically refrained from uttering the word Visegrad. [Goncz] It makes no difference whatsoever if someone mentions Visegrad or not. The essential think today is that the forms of cooperation have emerged and, although not a security guarantee, the region received the possibility of a negotiating mechanism that has a balancing power in itself. [NEPSZABADSAG] Should one fear that rivalry in Central Europe might even accelerate after the acceptance of the Partnership of Peace program? [Goncz] Yes, there will obviously be criteria here, and the compatibility of the countries in the region for closer cooperation with NATO will be examined also from a military viewpoint. Given the fact that these conditions have not been formulated at this summit, and they will probably be formulated later, I cannot tell which country will be the first to join. Honestly speaking, I think this is a rather secondary issue, because the stability of the region itself if what matters. I interpret security in a much broader sense than only military security. Naturally, NATO is an extremely important element of European security, but it does not replace an all-European security system. The way I see it, we have now made a step forward in this direction, and a considerable step at that. [NEPSZABADSAG] President Walesa made a particularly dramatic statement before the meeting. What was your impression about the Polish attitude in Prague? [Goncz] My impression is that Lech Walesa came with the most colorful proposals to Prague. Naturally, it was impossible to debate these proposals in detail, but this can obviously be done at a later date. [NEPSZABADSAG] Does your meeting with Michal Kovac represent any progress in the Hungarian-Slovak relations? [Goncz] This was a really important meeting, and it was held in a very good atmosphere. From Michal Kovac's words, I think the most important is that they are trying to solve the issues in harmony with the ideas of the Hungarian minority, and not by excluding this national minority. This was not my first meeting with Mr Kovac; I am absolutely convinced of his good will; he spoke wise and well-thought words. The invitation to come to Budapest continues to be valid, and I hope that this visit will take place soon.
