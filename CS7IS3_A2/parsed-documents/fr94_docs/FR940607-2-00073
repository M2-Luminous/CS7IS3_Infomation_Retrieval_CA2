FR940607-2-00073 FR940607-2-00053 Draft Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a draft of a new guide planned for its Regulatory Guide Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses. The draft guide is temporarily identified as DG&hyph;6002, ``Establishing Quality Assurance Programs for the Manufacture and Distribution of Sealed Sources and Devices Containing Byproduct Material,'' and is intended for Division 6, ``Products.'' DG&hyph;6002 is being developed to provide guidance acceptable to the NRC staff on the essential elements needed to develop, establish, and maintain a quality assurance program for the manufacture and distribution of sealed sources and devices. This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position in this area. The draft guide has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position. Public comments are being solicited on the guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Comments will be most helpful if received by August 12, 1994. Although a time limit is given for comments on this draft guide, comments and suggestions in connection with items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time. Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC.
