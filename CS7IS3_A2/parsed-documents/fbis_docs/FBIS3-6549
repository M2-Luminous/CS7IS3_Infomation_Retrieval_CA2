Police explosive experts defused the device without incident. National police chief Prathin Santiprapop said Thursday night on television that the bomb "clearly was the work of foreigners and was targetted at foreigners in Thailand." He said the body, which was found in the same large, rectangular metal tank as the explosive device, was that of the original driver of the truck. The dead man was a foreigner and at first was thought to have fled the scene following the accident, Pratin said. He did not give further information on the victim's identity. Another police officer, who was not identified, said on television that the bomb was "the most powerful explosive device ever found in Thailand," and was similar in composition to bombs frequently used in Northern Ireland. The device included a large amount of ammonium nitrate, a quantity of flammable liquid and a car battery. The six-wheel truck, which had been rented with a driver March 9, was involved in a minor accident with a motorcycle two days later in the vicinity of the Israeli, British and US embassies, police said earlier. A foreigner who spoke almost no Thai was driving at the time, police said. When the owner appeared at the police pound Thursday to claim his vehicle, a police search turned up the metal container with the body and the home-made explosive device.
