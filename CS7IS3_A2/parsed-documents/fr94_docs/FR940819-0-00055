FR940819-0-00055 FR940819-0-00017 In regulations promulgated under section 608, EPA discussed the differences between the disposal sector and the servicing sector. (See 58 FR 28705.) EPA noted that unlike the servicing sector, the disposal sector does not reintroduce refrigerant to equipment, after removal. Refrigerant is merely being removed, usually after the appliances have been removed from operation. This removal may occur at any stage either before it enters the waste stream or once in the waste stream. Since the types of recover-only processes used with small appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment tend to be relatively straight-forward and a simpler task than recycling or the recovery of refrigerant from larger types of appliances, EPA did not require the certification of technicians disposing of small appliances. Since the circumstances for disposing of small appliances is quite similar to the circumstances for disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like equipment, EPA believes it is appropriate to revise the definition of ``technician'' to exclude any person disposing of MVAC and MVAC-like equipment. The revised definition will consequently read as follows: ``Technician means any person who performs maintenance, service, or repair that could reasonably be expected to release class I or class II substances from appliances into the atmosphere, including but not limited to installers, contractor employees, in-house service personnel, and in some cases, owners. Technician also means any person disposing of appliances except for small appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like equipment.'' 2. Adoption of Standard Based on ARI 700&hyph;1993 in Definition of ``Reclaim'' Section 82.152(q) defines ``reclaim'' to mean ``to reprocess refrigerant to at least the standard of purity specified in the ARI Standard 700&hyph;1988, Specifications for Fluorocarbon Refrigerants.'' A standard based closely on ARI 700&hyph;1988 is included in the rule as Appendix A. During the comment period on the proposed ยง608 refrigerant recycling rule, the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute had requested that EPA adopt a standard based on ARI 700&hyph;1993, which is an updated version of ARI 700&hyph;1988. ARI described the differences between ARI 700&hyph;1988 and ARI 700&hyph;1993 during the public hearing and submitted a draft version of the updated standard, which was included in the public docket for the rule. The updated standard included changes in three areas:
