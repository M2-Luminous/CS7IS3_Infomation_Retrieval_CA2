The opposition delegation to the talks is expected to respond to Russia's offer to hold the first round of talks in Moscow, Adamishin told TASS. He reported that his visit to Iran aimed to negotiate a political settlement of the Tajik conflict. Tajikistan has been in turmoil since independence after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. Adamishin, whose government has thousands of troops in Tajikistan guarding its southern border with Afghanistan against Moslem rebels based here, told Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati that Moscow was not seeking a military solution. He stressed Tajik opposition had come to understanding there was no alternative to a political solution of the problem. According to the Russian diplomat, the main thing now is to open talks. To get this process moving, Russia suggested that the confronting sides enter dialogue on March 16 and pledged safety for both parties to the talks. According to Adamishin, the programmes of settlement set forth by the sides differ considerably, but the negotiating process is designed to draw them closer. The deputy foreign minister stressed that nobody but Tajiks themselves could settle their problems. For this reason, Russia thinks participation of any third countries in the talks to be unnecessary. U.N. mediation will be quite enough.
