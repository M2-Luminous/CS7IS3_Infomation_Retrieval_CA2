She said that she decided to weigh some of her purchases when the young man brought them to her from the store. She began with the rice: six ounces was missing. Then came the sugar: five ounces was missing. [passage omitted] I mention this because I have precise information about other places where similar incidents have occurred. Of course, the rice and sugar later end in the black market. Where do these and other products come from? I believe they come from the stores, among other places, and, in some cases, from what is not delivered to the stores and butcher shops. I am not saying that this applies to all the stores, supermarkets, and butcher shops because it is not true and it would not be fair. One cannot judge everyone alike; one must not use the same median to judge everyone. To tell you the truth, certain places are not weighing the products correctly, and the surplus is accumulated and used to speculate, to sell it, to embezzle the people, etc. In fact, on certain occasions the rice, beef, ground meat, hot dogs -- whatever other product arrives -- are unscrupulously sold in the same stores and butcher shops. In some way, these cunning people, these thieves, are deceiving the inspectors or, simply, some inspectors are not doing what they should and are being swindled. I believe the situation which currently prevails in the country, the shortage, all the problems which afflict the population...[pauses] I believe all the staples should be subject to controls. The measures should be particularly strict dealing with those products. We cannot have the same controls that we had, for example, 10 years ago and that were not precisely the best. It is necessary to be stricter now, and the organizations which have inspectors for that control should or are dutybound to be more demanding. We have ways to prevent that type of theft, and, if this is so, those who have the responsibility of preventing this theft are dutybound to do so.
