[Giuily] The American and Japanese protectionist systems, which work to the disadvantage of the European shipowners, have indeed been retained. But the freeing up of the markets, to which we are committed in order to reestablish a certain balance, could have challenged certain market organization principles (with the shipowners' associations) that we would hope to maintain. [LE QUOTIDIEN] What do you plan on doing with regard to the foreign competition on your traditional markets? [Giuily] We must improve our competitive capacity and reduce our costs. Our strategy will also be based on alliances with the European shipowners--the Bollore group's SDV, or others. But the opening up of the American and Asiatic markets should in any case be negotiated. The European Community should not propose additional liberalization on a unilateral basis.
