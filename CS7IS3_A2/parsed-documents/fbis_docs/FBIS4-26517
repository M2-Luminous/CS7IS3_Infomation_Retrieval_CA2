They must increase their sense of responsibility and urgency in deepening the three kinds of work in the anticorruption struggle. Comrade Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements in the anticorruption struggle in our province since the three plenary meetings of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. In the meantime, he also pointed out: At present, there remain problems of failing to firmly grasp the work of investigating and handling major and important cases, and of unhealthy trends gaining ground. Governments and relevant departments at all levels must pay close attention to this matter. He emphasized: It is necessary to further unify our understanding so as to increase our consciousness of doing two types of work simultaneously, and attaching equal importance to both. Proceeding from the overall situation of maintaining a lengthy and peaceful reign in our country, we must be firm and unshakable in carrying out our anticorruption struggle in a deepgoing, solid, and more effective way. We must increase the weight of investigating and handling major and important cases, with the focus on cases involving corruption, graft, fraud, smuggling, and severe violation of financial and economic discipline. [passage indistinct] Comrade Lin Zhaoshu put forward specific demands for the work arrangements in the next stage of our anticorruption struggle. He pointed out: It is necessary to continue grasping the work of maintaining leading cadres' cleanliness, honesty, and self- discipline, and of correcting unhealthy trends. It is necessary to continue exercising control over revenues and expenditures to solve the problem of unhealthy trends at its root. It is necessary to strengthen supervision and examination work. [passage indistinct]. Leaders of the provincial court, procuratorate, and public security bureau also spoke at the meeting.
