Analyzing the two-year experience of this process, we must point out that many notions had to be reviewed, transformed, and created anew in the course of carrying out this task. The structure of that part of the Soviet Army which was inherited by Ukraine from the USSR did not correspond with Ukraine's new tasks, its domestic and foreign political situation. Thus, this structure had to be reformed. The groups of forces acquired by Ukraine were not integral military entities. The system of their command, control, and communications was disrupted; the operational-strategic structure of troops demanded radical changes and orientation solely toward domestic resources. Learning other countries' experiences and analyzing suggestions and propositions, we came to the conclusion that the new Ukraine needed a new Army that would neither be the successor of the Soviet Army nor follow the pattern of any Western army. This new army had to take into account national and historic peculiarities and be based on domestic infrastructure. Besides, the new Ukrainian Armed Forces demanded the creation of a national officers' corps. In light of this, we have to build anew the Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the same time resolving several intertwined issues: reforming existing groups and units and creating new ones; dismissing a large number of servicemen and replacing them with Ukrainian nationals serving in other CIS states; eliminating acute social problems and resolving issues of spiritual and national rebirth, and the like. The cornerstone of these tasks is the formation of a system of training and upbringing national officers. The critical analysis of the elapsed two-year period has demonstrated that certain things could have been done differently and better. One of the reasons that we have not accomplished more were drawbacks in personnel policy and the failure or impossibility to appoint professional officers to the main sectors of our activities. Any army that uses mixed methods of staffing, faces the primary issue of a professional approach to the military trade. This issue determines an army's morale and psychological atmosphere and thus, success in combat. In our opinion, three factors are crucial for military professionals: competence, responsibility, and loyalty to the motherland. These are the features that distinguish a professional from a dilettante caring only how to get more and give less. The complicated economic and sociopolitical situation in Ukraine undoubtedly influences the situation in the Army which makes us seek unconventional approaches to the training and upbringing of officers. Besides, we must take into account that any restrictions in the social, legal, or spiritual spheres of officers' lives hamper the processes of professionalizing the Army. An officer who is constantly being distracted from his duties by his housing problems, his wife's employment, his children's protection from hooligans, and the like, can hardly be expected to be very efficient in his duties. The more so that both he and his family see that shady deals guarantee better lives for many people around them. [passage omitted] We believe that an officer can achieve a high degree of professionalism only by being assisted by a properly organized uninterrupted system of professional training. This is even more necessary given the fact that every five to 15 years, knowledge becomes obsolete in different branches of science. Such a flexible multifold system of continuous improvement of cadets' and officers' skills should be introduced in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We have drafted a concept of continuous training which includes the following postulates: First: The creation of an organized intertwined system of continuous training of officers, not only by military institutes and academies but also at different courses, officers classes in military units, self-education, as well as closer integration of military and civilian education. Second: More fundamental schooling within the framework of higher education, especially in initial years. In military educational institutions during the first three to four years, emphasis should be placed on learning basic subjects, as well as elements of military and general educational programs that entitle students to receive civilian diplomas. Besides, we believe that the new conditions demand a change in the essence of education. Military education used to be oriented toward training personnel for commanding troops in combat. The new type of schooling, not diminishing the role of this kind of training, should provide knowledge necessary for building the new Ukrainian Army and ensuring its readiness to perform peaceful tasks (including participation in peacekeeping forces). [passage omitted] Assessing the situation that developed in the professional training of officers, we cannot disregard the issue of the Ukrainian language becoming the main working language of every professional officer, the language which he can freely speak, write, read, and use to give commands to his subordinates. This is a natural precondition which is not in any way insulting to the Russian language, which will remain the official language of the CIS. However, this precondition is hard to implement in the Ukrainian Armed Forces now. In our opinion, we need an all-out state program to teach Ukrainian, involving appropriate educational institutions. For the Armed Forces, this is a very urgent problem, because all the official documents are published in Ukrainian, while a comparatively small number of officers can freely speak Ukrainian, and there is a shortage of special military literature in this language. In my opinion, the problem can be resolved by better financing of the process of training and by convincing officers that learning Ukrainian is crucial. Officers should be led to understand that Ukraine's glorious history, its customs and traditions, important for both individual development and for teaching one's subordinates, can only be done in the native language. [passage omitted] I think that we should once again point out the depolitization of the Army. Ukraine's military doctrine and the Law of Ukraine on Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and Members of Their Families stipulate that "complete depolitization" of the Army is one of the primary principles of building the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which amounts to a ban on servicemen's participation and membership in any political parties, organizations, or movements. In a majority of developed countries, political activity is a profession just as diplomatic, legal, or military. Why should Ukrainian servicemen be preoccupied with mastering politics rather than their profession? He who wants to devote his life to professional politics should give up his military career. At the same time, this does not mean that there is negative attitude toward any political party or its leadership within our Armed Forces. We have nothing against cooperation with parties and movements, the more so that some of these express opinions regarding the situation in the state, that are similar to ours. However, it should be precisely stated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces are state structures and they should pursue governmental policy which I would term "centrist," in terms of attitude toward the standpoints of different parties and movements. [passage omitted] To provide the performance of tasks outlined by President Kravchuk in his speech at the meeting devoted to Ukrainian Armed Forces Day on 4 December 1994, the Ministry of Defense has issued an order pointing out concrete measures for the Army. The main task in the sphere of training the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1994, is implementing the military doctrine, and maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of troops (forces) at the stage of their forming, at the level safeguarding the protection of national sovereignty and political independence of Ukraine, its territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, and fighting back armed aggression from any side. In the situation when the Armed Forces are being built and defense budget reduced, combat and mobilization readiness of troops (forces) must not be lowered. In operational training, efforts should be concentrated on deep studying and practical implementation of issues of organizing efficient defense of land and sea borders in all directions, as well as antiaircraft and antimissile protection of important state installations. Combat training should be brought close to real conditions in which troops (forces) have to perform combat tasks, especially fighting back aggression in the initial stages of war. By the end of 1994, we are planning to adopt the contractual system of manning our officers' corps, paying special attention to officers having the experience of working in operational and operational-strategic units, fighting in the Afghan war, and eliminating the aftermath of the accident at Chernobyl nuclear power station. In the scientific aspect, we will continue researching the problems of developing the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We will direct our efforts at providing a theoretical basis for the organizational structure of troops, and the combat structure of units in light of the economic potential of the state and quotas stipulated by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. We will continue working on developing the system of military education, supplying the Armed Forces with skilled specialists, ready to perform their duty to protect Ukraine's independence and sovereignty. Special attention should be paid to learning the Ukrainian language and history. Thus, complicated and responsible tasks posed by life to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, require the strenuous work of every general, officer, warrant officer, and all personnel. Only by joint work and efforts will we be able to overcome the hardships of the transitional period of building our state and the Army.
