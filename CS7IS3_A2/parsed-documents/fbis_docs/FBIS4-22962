P. Kostikova, D. V. Korolkov, and Yu. P. Kostikov; St. Petersburg State University; presented by Academician Yu. A. Buslayevyy; UDC 541.67:541.451] [Text] In our previous article [1], we proposed that a periodic redox reaction is the basis of high temperature conductivity in oxides. It was shown that a system in which such a reaction proceeds exhibits all the properties of high temperature superconductors (HTSC), and in a number of cases (isotope effect, effect of paramagnetic impurities or ionizing radiation), the explanation of HTSC properties derived from the developed model appears to be more natural than those derived from classical positions. In this work, a comparison of experimental data on HTSC concentration characteristics with results of a thermodynamic analysis of the possibility of the occurrence of a periodic redox reaction in an oxide, depending on its composition, was conducted in support of this model. Required thermodynamic data were taken from [2], and calculations of missing values were conducted according to well known laws of thermodynamics [3]. The central question consists of whether, on the basis of the thermodynamic values that characterize a periodic redox reaction, one can determine the composition of superconductors at which a mamimum effect would be observed. For YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-�[/], the composition parameter is the oxygen index; for BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/], it is the bismuth index. The condition at which the periodic reaction occurs is, naturally, where the change in the Gibbs free energy is equal to zero [4]. The actual process in YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-�[/] is modelled, obviously, by the reaction Cu[.sub]2[/]O + BaO[.sub]2[/] <--> 2CuO + BaO. The free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero in the bulk structures of BaO[.sub]1.52[/] and CuO[.sub]0.74[/] oxides. When translated to the superconductor formula, this yields an oxygen index of 6.76, i.e., superconducting properties should appear in the composition YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]6.76[/]. The superconducting property dependence of this compound has been studied in many works. According to data in [5], superconducting properties appear in the composition interval 6.5 - 6.98 (in oxygen index values). Later studies [6] have narrowed this interval to 6.8 - 7.0 for T[.sub]c[/] = 90 K and 6.6 - 6.75 for T[.sub]c[/] = 60 K. In the BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/] superconductor, where, according to RFE-spectroscopic data, Pb[.sup]II[/], Pb[.sup]IV[/], and Bi[.sup]III[/], Bi[.sup]V[/] are present, the primary process through which electrical current transmission is made possible is the reaction PbO + Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] <--> PbO[.sub]2[/] + Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. The free energy of formation of Bi[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]4[/] is in the interval 130-150 kcal/mol. Taking this value into account, the free energy of this reaction oscillates about zero for the composition BaPb[.sub]1-x[/]Bi[.sub]x[/]O[.sub]3[/] at x = 0.16-0.34. Actually, the maximum superconducting properties of this compound are observed at x is approximately equal to 0.25 [7]. It should be noted that these were evaluated for a temperature of 298 K. The transition to temperatures characteristic for superconductors introduces only insignificant corrections. Free energy values were calculated for reactions that model processes in more complex systems. The formation of a complex oxide, in which the discussed redox reactions occur, uniformly affects the thermodynamic properties of all components participating in the reaction without affecting their ratio. The role of atoms of elements contained in the structure of the compounds but that do not participate in the redox reaction (Y in the first case, Ba in the second) apparently leads to the establishment of a unit cell metric and a temperature dependence of the metric that also governs the electron tunneling potential. The developed model allows one to predict combinations of elements and the valent forms of their oxides where the periodic redox reaction will probably occur. In this regard, S. A. Shukarev's hypotheses about how the relative stability of various valent forms of a single element depend on ``isometalloid'' values, which are the free energy of formation of the oxide divided by the number of oxygen atoms in the oxide [8], are useful. Values of the Gibbs free energy for oxides with varying degrees of metal oxidation are presented in table 1. A convenient parameter for matching redox pairs is the isometalloid difference _D_. Oxides that are either contained in superconductor structures or are used as alloying dopants and for which reliable data on the free energy of formation are available are presented in table 1. <graphic> Table 1. Thermodynamic characteristics of oxides. If one were to start from the premise that a superconductor is a system with periodic redox reactions, then it is clear that the appearance of superconducting properties may be expected for redox pairs whose _D_ values agree in sign and are close in magnitude. In this case, the free energy of the reaction will be equal to zero for equimolar ratios of oxidized and reduced forms. The maximum electron tunneling potential should be at precisely these concentrations. Based on this, one may conclude that for the pair Cu[.sup]I[/]-Cu[.sup]II[/] (a required component for all superconductors with maximum T[.sub]c[/]), favorable partners for occurrence of the periodic redox reaction will be the VO-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/], and CoO-Co[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] pairs. In the case of chromium oxide, equilibrium would be strongly shifted from the equimolar ratio; therefore, the probability of occurrence of the redox reaction in mixed oxides of copper and chromium would be significantly lower. In mixed oxides of iron and copper, the type of periodic reaction discussed here is generally impossible. Let us turn our attention to the system of mixed oxides of iron and tin. Based on our hypotheses, one would expect the appearance of superconducting properties in the system FeO-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SnO-SnO[.sub]2[/] or in more complex systems with the participation of components that are inert with respect to the redox reaction, e.g., yttrium in YBa[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-�[/]. In such a manner, the thermodynamics of possible redox reactions in the discussed compounds within the framework of hypotheses about the periodic reaction allow one not only to calculate experimentally confirmed compositions of already known superconducting oxides, but also to predict new oxide systems with high temperature superconductivity.
