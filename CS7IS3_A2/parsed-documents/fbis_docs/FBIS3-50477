The group sieged and assaulted the garrison of the 31st Military Zone, 10 km north of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, and according to the National Defense Secretariat, the attack lasted into the afternoon. In the predawn hours of Saturday, armed Indians of the self-styled Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), which was previously unknown, forcefully seized the towns of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano in that region. Official reports indicated that the Indians had left San Cristobal de las Casas early on Sunday without clashing with the Mexican Army. The occupation of the four towns left a toll of three dead and some 14 injured. The Army communique did not report casualties on the attack against the military zone. The same communique reported that the Army expected "a possible dialogue" with the local government of Chiapas -- a Mexican state bordering Guatemala -- to see that the "attacking groups" cease their illegal actions and resort only to lawful means.
