It will be the second unofficial visit by President Li in his capacity as a president to a state with which we have no diplomatic relations since he took office. It is predicted that President Li will meet with Indonesian President Suharto during his coming visit, thereby establishing a friendship between the paramount leaders of the Republic of China [ROC] and Indonesia. Because Indonesia will host an annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum at the end of this year and has already said that it will invite the leaders of all APEC members states to an informal summit, it is generally believed that President Li will broadly exchange views with the Indonesian side on the APEC meeting and on the ROC's policy toward the region located to the south of Taiwan. It has been learned that the advance men of the Foreign Ministry have already visited Indonesia to discuss protocol-related issues. Barring an unexpected change, President Li should be able to make his visit in early February. However, as for whether the president will go abroad for a vacation during the Spring Festival, (Chang Ping-nan), deputy director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Office, emphasized in an interview with reporters yesterday [11 January] afternoon that he was not aware there existed such a plan as the one mentioned above.
