Elevated values in the NBT test indicates, in most cases, the presence of a bacterial infection. Neutrophil activity is stimulated by latex or bacterial antigens to clarify the reserve capabilities of the neutrophil. In earlier work, the researchers studied the spontaneous NBT test in full-blown leptospirosis, identifying a considerable elevation of mean NBT-test values. Some patients, however, produced values that were below normal. In the work reported here, the researchers observed 148 individuals with icterohemorrhagic leptospirosis in order to study the possibility of using the NBT test to predict the severity of the course of the disease and the probability of the development of complications. The indices for the spontaneous NBT test and the staphylococcus- stimulated NBT test were, in fact, found to be a function of severity of course and developing complications. Elevated values for the spontaneous NBT test were typical of a mild or medium severity or for a severe, but uncomplicated case. In patients with a severe form of the disease, but low spontaneous NBT-test values, the absence of staphylococcus stimulation served as a predictor of the development of life-threatening complications. Leptospirosis vaccine depressed NBT-test levels. Persistence of the depressive effect in convalescents indicated a high probability of the development of late complications.
