FR940620-0-00080 FR940620-0-00027 Rule Changes 47 CFR Part 90 is amended as follows: PART 90_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 90 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sections 4, 303, 48 Stat., as amended, 1066, 1082; 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, unless otherwise noted. 2. 47 CFR 90.619 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(5) and removing and reserving (b)(6) to read as follows: §90.619 Frequencies available for use in the U.S./Mexico and U.S./Canada border areas. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (5) Applicants requesting authorizations in the frequency bands in the geographical areas listed below shall submit documentation indicating compliance with the following protection criteria to the indicated Canadian television station. Protection to Canadian television assignments and allotments is based on the field strength of an interfering mobile radio signal at the TV station's calculated Grade B contour (64 dBu) not exceeding the TV field strength by more than 20 dB (i.e., 84 dBu). The field strength of the TV assignment or allotment is calculated using the R6602 [F(50,50)] propagation curves and any land mobile base station interfering signal is calculated using the R6602 [F(50,10)] propagation curves at a receiving effective antenna height of 9.1 meters (30 feet). Where the calculated field strength of the TV assignment or allotment exceeds the Grade B contour value of 64 dBu at the Canada/U.S.A. border, the land mobile radio signal may not exceed the actual calculated TV field strength at the border by more than 20 dB. ␣ 1Frequency bands (MHz) 1Areas 852&hyph;853.25 MHz (Cornwall_TV Channel 63) Area bounded by a line joining, clockwise, the following coordinates: starting at point 45 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ N.
