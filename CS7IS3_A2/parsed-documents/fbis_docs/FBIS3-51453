"Our meetings are characterized by their substantial agendas; there is no time for such unimportant issues," Robaina said in the second part of an interview published today by EL SOL DE MEXICO. "Thoughts about multipartyism are not among our country's many priorities at this time," Robaina added. Asked if there has been any reaction within the government to exiled Cubans' statements supporting multipartyism, the Cuban foreign minister responded: "From the time I began participating in the meetings, an issue of such little importance has never been on the agenda. The historical reasons that joined us into a single party are stronger today than ever." Robaina asserted, "There used to be multipartyism in Cuba and all those parties did very little to resolve the considerable problems our society had experienced for over half a century."
