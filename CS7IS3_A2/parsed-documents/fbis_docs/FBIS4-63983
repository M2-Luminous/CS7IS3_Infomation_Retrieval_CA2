IZVESTIYA was informed of this by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department. According to Chinese special services data, over 70 gangsters have been arrested. At least 140 violations of the law have been detected, including fights, robberies, rape, and hostage-taking on trains, as well as criminal offenses in Moscow. The Chinese criminals decided to head for Russia and Hungary posing as businessmen and students. But few reached Budapest, they settled mainly in Siberia and the Far East. The criminals' calculations proved correct. Because the Chinese victimized "their own," they did not attract the Russian militia's attention for a long time. Finally, after receiving the signal from China, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs sent a snatch squad onto the Beijing-Moscow train. The first four bandits were seized first and the militia arrested the others later. Karasin reported that Moscow had spoken up for the Russian citizens detained in the PRC as "hostages." Russia's claims to the former USSR's property in 11 Chinese cities were also discussed. An entry and exit visa procedure was introduced in January for Russians and Chinese holding general civilian foreign passports. But in recent months variant interpretations by the sides have emerged regarding the range of people who are also entitled to receive free multiple visas for official trips. It has been agreed to settle this question as well.
