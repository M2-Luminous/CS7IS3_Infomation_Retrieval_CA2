In brief, military and intelligence personnel mainly fear that Russia could be deprived of the opportunity autonomously to choose a model for future military building and development and for reforming the Army and Navy: The Russian Armed Forces could cease to be an independent military organization, and in the light of that the Russian Federation could switch from being an autonomous factor for security and stability in the world to being an element subordinate to another mechanism. In the words of one participant in the recent Russian-American seminar devoted to these problems in the Russian Federation Center for National Security Problems, the U.S. representatives often simply failed to dispel the Russians' fears. They were forestalled by a representative of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry, who defended the partners' interests with even greater fervor than they themselves. The Foreign Ministry leadership's interest in joining the "Partnership" and NATO can be explained: As a result of gross foreign policy miscalculations in neighboring foreign states, powerful political and military clots have formed -- Tajikistan, Moldova, Georgia-Abkhazia, and Armenia-Azerbaijan -- which the Russian Federation cannot resolve alone. So a gamble is being placed on NATO peacekeeping forces. However, in the view of a number of military experts, these would be false gains.
