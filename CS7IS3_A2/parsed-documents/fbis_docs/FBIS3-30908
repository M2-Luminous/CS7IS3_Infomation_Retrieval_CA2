Regarding another issue, Mr. Gherman assessed that the open letter addressed to the parties that belong to the Democratic Convention and the Democratic Party represents the decision of the permanent delegation and means that the ruling party is open for political dialogue. In the view of the PDSR, three stages are necessary to finalize the dialogue: to establish the principles for a cooperation in the political arena; to work out a program regarding the unfolding of the reform in Romania; and to hold discussions on the basis of a government coalition. Referring to the recent declarations made by the president of the Republic of Moldova and Agrarian Party leader, Ioan Solcanu, vice president of the PDSR, expressed his concern that such pro-Russian ideologies tend to become state policy. The message of the PDSR is the following: We should not forget that all of us are Romanians and history cannot be distorted according to momentary interests.
