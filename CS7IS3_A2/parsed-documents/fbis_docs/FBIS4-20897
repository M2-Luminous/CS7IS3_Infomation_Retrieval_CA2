Gen. Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the state testing area under Russia's Strategic Missile Command. On Monday, a large group of journalists from various publications, information agencies, and radio and TV stations arrived at the top secret garrison in Mirny. They will be able to acquaint themselves with some of Russia's latest military technology, in particular, with the "Topol" experimental missile system which is expected to become part of the armed forces in a couple of years. The journalists' arrival corresponded with celebrations of Cosmonaut's Day. In Mirny, this holiday is widely celebrated, since much has been done here for progress in space. "We have no secrets to hide from Russians and the world community, but our openness does not hinder our responsibility for the security of Russia," Yuriy Zhuravlev declared.
