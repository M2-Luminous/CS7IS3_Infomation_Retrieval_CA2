This is revealed by an analysis of the current situation by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV], in which the authority points in particular to important changes in the situation within the terrorist Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF is entangled so much in quarrels about is direction that there has even been a split of the militant extremist organization, the BfV report says. Its so far stable structure -- a complex construct consisting of the so-called command echelon, the ``prisoners' collective,'' and about 250 supporters, the ``RAF scene'' -- has ``broken apart.'' Links between members of the RAF scene and the also left-wing extremist Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) are known. Thus, the authorities noted recently that an activist who belongs to the RAF scene participated in a ``leading function'' in a PKK-controlled Kurdish solidarity rally in Bonn. At a meeting of the Hanns-Seidel Foundation in Budapest, BfV Vice President Frisch discussed the ``international ties'' of the RAF scene. There he cited the ``participation in demonstrations against the PKK ban and the trips of some members of the RAF scene to Turkey.'' However, Frisch did not talk about PKK support by the RAF command echelon or of a ``massive, in particular logistical support,'' the BfV said, correcting corresponding press reports yesterday. The RAF has further expanded its contacts and its ties with other European terrorist groups. This also applies to its links with the banned Turkish extremist organization ``Devrimci Sol'' (Revolutionary Left). In the meantime, the ``Dev Sol'' has even been integrated in the ``SpinnenNetz'' [CobWeb] mailbox system, which was started in 1991 -- an information and leadership instrument of the inner RAF scene, which is camouflaged as an ``information shop'' of the ``antifascist action.''
