SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 15, 1994, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) published in the Federal Register (59 FR 59070&hyph;59071, Docket No. 94&hyph;116&hyph;1) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of public meetings concerning the possible importation of fresh Hass avocado fruit grown in approved orchards in approved municipalities in Michoacan, Mexico, into certain areas in the United States. The two public meetings were held on November 28 and 29. Interested persons were invited to present either written or oral comments at the public meetings on the Mexican proposal. The notice stated that copies of the Mexican proposal were available by calling or writing Mr. Victor Harabin. All written comments on the advance notice and Mexican proposal were required to be received on or before December 13, 1994. At the public meetings, copies of the Mexican proposal were also made available. A number of persons in attendance at both public meetings stated that this was their first opportunity to review the Mexican proposal and that the copies of the proposal provided were incomplete because Appendices I, II, and III were not included. They requested that the Appendices be provided and that the comment period closing date be extended to allow time for review of the complete proposal and comment. APHIS has forwarded copies of these Appendices to those interested persons who requested copies of the Mexican proposal pursuant to the November 15, 1994, Federal Register notice or who received copies of the proposal at the two public meetings. So that interested persons may have additional time to prepare and submit comments on the Mexican proposal, APHIS is reopening and extending the public comment period on Docket No. 94&hyph;116&hyph;1 until January 3, 1995. APHIS will consider all comments received between November 15, 1994, and January 3, 1995.
