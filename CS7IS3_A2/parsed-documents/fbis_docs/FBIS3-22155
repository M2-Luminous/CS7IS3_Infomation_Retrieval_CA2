The figure you gave does not seem to correspond to reality taking into account of the vast amount or volume of wood that have been extracted from those concessioned areas? Chit Swe: The whole forest cover area involved in the border concessions is only 2.6 percent of our total forest area and besides, these forest have been more or less untouched in the past. We gave concessions of 200,000 hoppus tons only. We gave some concessions for four to five years to Thai companies. Up to now a little more than 150,000 hoppus tons a year were extracted during the peak years. When we started the concession, the average extraction was 150,000 hoppus tons a year along the whole stretch of the border. However since 1992 it was taken off, because all the concessions started to expire and we did not renew them. Now I have to see Thai friends everyday, at least one or two. They have got heavy commitments with foreign companies to get the raw material in time. It is very important for them. Lertcharoenchok: Now that these logging concessions are gone, what are you going to do? Chit Swe: I have never said that logging concessions have gone. In concessioned areas we can do something for mutual benefit. We can harvest from those areas with our local people, but foreigners are not allowed to get concessions. That is why some people are asking if insurgents coming out to legal fold, would they be entitled to the concessions. For this, we need time to consider. For the Burman it is not easy for them to stay in that area, only the nationalities (ethnic minorities) stay there. To enter into the forestry related businesses, all interested local parties would have to deal with the central government or enter into joint ventures with foreign partners: If the area is 100 percent secure and our forest people can go in to check every tree, then we can consider which kind of business is suitable for that area. We have to consider that on a case by case basis. Lertcharoenchok: So it means that even though foreign logging concessions have gone, the local people still have the chance to obtain them? Chit Swe: Yes. However, it is not easy to export logs to other countries. Preference is given to value-added industries. I cannot for certain say what kind of business is good. But in general there is plenty of raw material there and one can enter into whatever forestry-related business. In some areas we can set up pulp and paper factories. Because of certain tree species, some areas are good for veneer and plywood industries. Lertcharoenchok: Now that all logging concessions to Thai companies have gone. [sentence as published] Would you please say what experiences and problems you have learned from giving out timber concessions to Thai companies? Chit Swe: Before I gave out concessions, my knowledge about forestry was like that of a primary student. Now after five years experience, I can say I have a PhD. We used to receive messages sent to us everyday from local commanders saying they seized 3,000 (illegally felled) logs here or 2,000 trees there, and some pointed to me saying: ``Since you are the Forestry Minister, you are responsible for it. But I said it came under the jurisdiction of the police and hence not under my office.'' In Burmese we have a saying: ``If you make it easier even for a very rich man, he still becomes a thief.'' It is not easy to conduct checks because we are far away from the forested areas. Because of this even a rich man can become a poacher. That is why in some areas we give concessions to them and at the same time put up border checkpoints. Anyhow they still take logs from some other areas. So in many areas there are many problems. Lertcharoenchok: So the main problems you face stem from illegal cuttings? Chit Swe: Yes. Lertcharoenchok: Even by concession companies? Chit Swe: Some companies are very good. They do their job systematically. But others however they have sub-contracts and the sub-contractors further sub-contract them. There are no checkpoints, no border police and no forest guards. Lertcharoenchok: Roughly how many companies received your concessions and how many are good companies? Chit Swe: Only one third of the companies behave well. We gave out about 42 concessions to 34 companies. Mostly of them were not original timber business people and that is the root cause of the problems. Of those, who tried to get concessions, I think only 10 percent were real timber men. More than 90 percent were not. Lertcharoenchok: What are the real reasons for you to stop border logging concessions? Is it because of illegal logging or are you environmentally conscious? Chit Swe: When we decided, it is not because of illegal logging. It is secondary. The first is because of the watershed. Our watershed is your watershed. For instance, the Tenasserim Mountain is a large range and is also the watershed of Thailand. There are also some other very high mountains in the Tenasserim-Division. From our side it is not easy to extract logs because of the high mountains. So if logs are cut on our side there will be drought and flooding in your country 100. Also, people from developed countries are putting pressure. Up to now there are no big problems with the environmental people, but anyhow we must be very careful, because if the population become bigger, forest cover will become lesser and lesser. The logging concessions are not only on the border areas but also deeper inside the country too. Our concern is that foreign partners would become richer and richer, but local partners would have no change in status. Because of this we want to encourage local people. Lertcharoenchok: Thailand has plans to develop several hydropower dams along the Thai-Burmese border such as the over 6,000 Megawatt Salween Dam, and many envirommentalists are concerned that those projects will have negative impacts on your natural resources, mainly the forests. What is your opinion? Chit Swe: Now they are discussing natural gas to Thailand through Kanchanaburi Province. The project does not affect a big area--only a small area for the gas pipeline and only some roads. I think there is no problem. As for the Salween Dam, I think it is a very big project. It has to go phase by phase. You should ask the Energy Minister. He may be able give you some ideas. Lertcharoenchok: Which country is the biggest investor in your forestry industry and the biggest log buyer? Chit Swe: I think Thai companies. When it is not easy to get logs from the border, they come here. Thai people have very good experience in the timber business. They buy from our country, logs as well as other forestry products. The Japanese are usually the highest bidders. They buy the best quality teak and other hardwood. However, they usually sell it later, especially hardwood, to the Taiwanese. There is a case when a Japanese company bid highest in one tender for some logs. We thought it was going to Japan, but it turned out that the company sold the logs here to a Taiwanese company. When I met the Taiwanese gentleman and asked him if he was going to take the logs to Taiwan he said he was going to sell the logs to China. So it is just changing hands causing the value to go higher and higher. Because of this, we are trying to sell directly to the real buyers. Lertcharoenchok: Is China one of your biggest timber buyers? Chit Swe: No. It is Japan. The West also buys quality teak. Fourth quality teak is bought mainly by the Indians. They have got a very good market with the Middle East, which we don't. Because of this we go through the Indians as third party.
