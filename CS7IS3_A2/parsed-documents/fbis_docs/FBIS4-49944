As a result, many government-sponsored state agencies in charge of nonexecutive issues are told to earn their own money. For some, however, it is very hard to make profits, at least for the time being. Management involved with subsidization of plant protection, water and soil conservation, pest control, and technology promotion fall into such a category, said Li Zhensheng, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. With these people struggling to eke out a living, "few bother about their proper duties," he said. Much of the damage caused by insect pests and crop diseases in recent years Li attributes to the crippled state agencies in charge of rural technical promotion. Many participants to the 1994 session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) criticized a tendency in some local authorities to shirk responsibility in the name of reform. Agrotechnology -- the application of science to farming problems -- was neglected by cadres who were misinterpreting the reform message as profits and good-looking financial accounts. Agrotechnology promotion agencies should be retained and strengthened, they contended, to support agriculture -- the most important and fragile industry in China. "Although we've been affiliated to the state, we are only responsible for technological promotion. Such nonexecutive agencies as ours should go public in the long run. But there should be a process," said Zhang Yaozong, director of the National Centre for Agrotechnology Promotion (NCAP), in an interview with CHINA DAILY. "Though this time reforms are targeted at reducing the government's direct involvement in economic activities, many local governments gave priority to reducing financial burdens," said Xu Weisheng, deputy director of NCAP. The problem is that some local farm authorities have deserted their responsibilities instead of diversifying management to ensure main duties. With some agriculture-related agencies at the county level being dismembered or merged, some funds earmarked for agrotechnological promotion have been diverted to balance the books and make up for financial deficits, Nie Chuang, a division chief with NCAP, pointed out. NCAP officials are disappointed the Law on Promotion of Agrotechnologies has not been well implemented. The 1993 law urges local governments to ensure setting up county level farm management with personnel and financial support. NCAP's opinions are echoed by researchers at the Institute of Political Science (IOPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. "A latent motive behind the initial call for government reforms was mounting financial pressure," said Chen Hui, IOPS researcher. "That is why burden reduction receives priority over functional transfer." Chen and his fellows, in consensus with the NCAP, appealed for a step-by-step procedure while stressing the necessity of current reforms. The government should not relinquish its control before a socialized service system is set up, according to Bai Gang, a senior IOPS expert in charge of county-level research programmes. Closing government agencies and diverting their staff have been repeated several times in China's governmental reforms. But each round was followed by an even more cumbersome administrative body. Zhang Dongchang, also an IOPS researcher, insisted that mere simplification cannot solve all the problems at county level. "This approach excelled mostly because of its immediate effects in poverty-stricken counties," he said. "Since local finance can see rapid improvements after streamlining the payroll, the results are of course conspicuous. "But excessive publicity has made this a model for all areas." Placing emphasis on the peculiar situation of the transition from a planned economy to a market one, they appealed for an even stronger role for the government. "The most important factor that has enabled sustained prosperity in many other nations is sophisticated control by the government," Chen said. The most basic functions of any county government is the development of its agriculture, they said. "The central government must reinforce its intervention during the transitional period to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated transfer," Bai said. The embarrassment of agrotechnical departments, in their eyes, exposes local governments' indifference to agriculture. Emphasis on numerical criteria in official accounts also explains local cadres' eagerness to neglect the basics. Work performance evaluations generally emphasize output value and tax-profits turnover. Agriculture, however, always needs government subsidies. "The government's role in such fields as rural education, health care, family planning, and technical services should not be weakened for the time being," Bai said. "Otherwise, there will only be chaos." But Wang Qinfeng, with the General Office of the Central Organization and Establishment Committee, sees a brighter picture. Difficulties of rural technical agencies are just like the throes of childbirth, painful but temporary, according to Wang. "If people knew more about local conditions, they would draw a different conclusion," he said. He stressed that pilot reforms were carried out not only in poor regions but also involved economically-advanced areas. His committee has never asked local governments to follow any identical model. "Our policy is to encourage early separation of nonexecutive branches from the chains of government offices in localities where conditions are ripe, instead of making it compulsory everywhere," he said. "And there should be a process." Problems do exist in the course of reforms, he noted, but most derive from policy distortion and practical implementation. Current problems can only be solved through further reforms. Misuse of funds, for example, has little to do with the reforms themselves, he said. "So far as I know, the experiments are generally successful," he said. Qin's optimism is based on the focus of debates that it is not whether but how the nation should push forward reforms. Difficulties of agrotechnical service agencies are not peculiar in such comprehensive reforms in a populous country like China. Losses of vested interests are inevitable in the transition from the old to the new mechanism. As long as reforms are still on the right track, the agony is worthwhile. The most essential task now seems to be how to ensure reform measures that are not misinterpreted.
