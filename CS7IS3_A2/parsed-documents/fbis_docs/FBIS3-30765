Only someone who is crazy could want these air strikes, Owen said adding however that the present situation in which so many people were being killed, like in Sarajevo on Saturday, could no longer be tolerated. He made this statement after his meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Monday. The mortar shell, fired Saturday from positions still undetermined by UNPROFOR, killed 68 and injured almost 200 persons. Owen described as extremely important his meeting with Milosevic which was also attended by the second co-chairman on the conference of the former Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. One of the main topics discussed was the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and ways of ending it, as well as ways of preventing tragedies like the one that happened in Sarajevo on Saturday, Lord Owen said. In answer to questions about air strikes Owen said he favoured negotiations and expressed hope that through negotiations steps would be adopted to prevent tragedies like the one in Sarajevo. Concerning his talks Sunday evening with the president of the Bosnian Serb Republic Radovan Karadzic Owen said that Karadzic accepted the proposal to negotiate about the demilitarization of Sarajevo and its placement under a two-year UN administration. Lord Owen announced that the talks on Sarajevo set for Thursday would discuss confidence-building measures and not the global peace settlement for the Bosnian crisis.
