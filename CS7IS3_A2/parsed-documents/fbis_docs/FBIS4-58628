The battles extended to cities and villages in three of the four Kurdish governorates. Sources of the two parties agree that the fighting, which started on 1 May, stopped yesterday, leaving an unspecified number of casualties, both dead and wounded. The two parties' sources, contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, said that the leaderships of the two parties and figures from other Kurdish parties and Iraqi Arab opposition parties succeeded in stopping the fighting which had started in the Qal'at Dizah area near the border with Iran in the wake of a tribal dispute over land ownership between individuals with split political loyalties to the two parties. Relations between the two parties have been characterized by rivalry and sensitivity, and at the end of last year they formed a joint command to avoid armed clashes between them and to coordinate their supervision of the local government which they formed and in which they shared influence for the past two years. Statements issued by the two parties yesterday said that clashes occurred between their peshmerga forces in the main cities of al-Sulaymaniyah and Dahuk and also in the city of Raniyah in the extreme east and in Zakho in the extreme west near the border with Turkey. The European branch of the KDP distributed an appeal for an end to the fighting by its leader Barzani the night before last. It said: "Despite the very serious aggressions against our party in Qal'at Dizah, Raniyah, and al-Sulaymaniyah in recent days, as the future of our Kurdish people faces a most serious threat, and to prevent any further appalling tragedies, I call on all parties to remain calm and to stop the fighting immediately." He also called for a meeting of the Kurdistan Front which is an alliance of Kurdish parties, in existence since 1988. That meeting was supposed to take place yesterday. According to sources from both sides, the political bureaus of the two parties held a joint meeting in Barzani's presence but in the absence of Talabani, who is in Italy. They issued a joint appeal to their forces and supporters calling for the immediate cessation of fighting, the release of the detainees from both sides, and the return of the gunmen to their bases and camps. But a statement issued by the PUK said that the fighting spread to Dahuk and Zakho after that appeal was made. The PUK statement urged forces of both sides "to stop the military operations immediately and not to allow any new eruptions."
