He also exchanged views with those cadres on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Liang Pingbo, member of the provincial CPC committee and head of the provincial CPC committee's propaganda department, presided over the opening ceremony. Li Zemin stressed the need for all levels of leading cadres to conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "Decisions" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to grasp well work of overall importance; to correctly understand and handle well the dialectical relationship between reform, development, and stability; and to ensure that the basic principle of the party work for this year will be implemented in our province. Li Zemin said "seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability" are the party's overriding task for this year. Reform is the motive, development is the target, and stability is the guarantee and prerequisite for China. The three conditions taken together are an integrated whole. A correct understanding of the guiding principle for this year's work will help continue and develop the excellent situation in our province. The key for handling well the relationship between the three conditions lies in comprehensively and scientifically understanding Comrade Deng Xiaoping thought on development, reform, and stability. He said the issue of development is a very important idea in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the conditions of developing a socialist market economy and of reforming the financial, monetary, and investment structures and when seeking development, we should stop adopting the old, lax, and inefficient management style which was characterized by superficial expansion, unplanned investment, and single-minded pursuit of high output value; instead, we should seek development through deepening the reform, readjusting and optimizing the economic structure, improving the quality of the entire economy, and raising economic efficiency. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on reform and opening up is one of the important parts of the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the party's basic line. Now the ideological and theoretical basis for reform are in place. We should rely on reform measures to solve the deep-seated contradictions and problems in economic life. Reform entails risks. But we must not stop embarking on our reform goals just because there are risks ahead. We need to develop unified thinking and to make meticulous arrangements, in order to reduce risks and to implement various reform measures in a positive and steady manner. Li Zemin added that the most important element in implementing Comrade Deng Xiaoping's call for "stability as the overriding task" is to maintain economic, social and political stability, and properly handle various interests and relationships. At present, particular attention should be given to upholding the authority of the CPC Central Committee, to maintaining the unity and enforcement of the government laws and orders, and to ensuring that reform, opening up, society, and the economy develop in an orderly and healthy manner. Li Zemin said all levels of leading comrades should take the lead in conscientiously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and raising their capability to solve complex contradictions and to cope with various situations. The provincial CPC committee has decided that cadres involved in management enroll in study classes in six batches at the party school. They will concentrate on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the "Decisions" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Sponsoring the training classes for provincial management cadres is one of the important measures adopted by the provincial CPC committee to enhance leading cadres' ideological and theoretical levels. The purpose is to make them well-prepared for the introduction of new reform measures this year. As the provincial CPC committee attaches great importance to the training classes, it will assign a leading comrade to attend each of the training class so that the leading comrade will join discussions and exchange views with cadres attending the training class. He expressed the hope that cadres attending the training class would integrate the actual situation in our province's reform and opening up with their own ideas; know well the emancipation of mind and of seeking truth from facts which are the essence of Marxism; raise the problem-analysis and problem-solving capability by applying Marxist positions, viewpoints, and methods; and improve administrative and leadership levels in a down-to-earth manner. Also attending the training-class opening ceremony were Yu Wenhua, deputy secretary general and director of the general office of the provincial CPC committee; Chen Sining, deputy head of the organization department under the provincial CPC committee; and Liu Guangyi and Tang Rongsheng, vice presidents of the party school under the provincial CPC committee.
