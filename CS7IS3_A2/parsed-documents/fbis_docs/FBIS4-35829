The president said: The big problem of the world of Islam is the lack of unity between Muslims. The Islamic Republic of Iran will do its best to create unity and has reached out the hand of unity toward all Islamic countries. According to our correspondent, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any country. We hope Islamic governments do not interpret our advice as interference in their domestic affairs. Referring to the fact that Islamic Iran is very serious in the country's construction the president said: Our dependence on the outside world is being reduced every day. What worries us today is the existence of problems in the world of Islam, such as in Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Palestine. Stressing that the Islamic revolution has continued on its course for the past 15 years without any foreign backing, he said the success and the historical miracle stem from the power of Islam and the wise leadership of the imam [Khomeyni]. Criticizing certain Islamic governments for mischief-making against the Islamic revolution, the president said: They intend to divert toward Iran the opposition of world Muslims to Israel. That is an astonishing crime and very woeful for the Muslim world. The president added: Public opinion in the world of Islam has been awakened. We hope that the enemies of Islam will realize that and cease their mischief-making. [passage omitted]
