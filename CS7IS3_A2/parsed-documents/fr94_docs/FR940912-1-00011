FR940912-1-00011 FR940912-1-00003 Cessna's market for the Model 750 Citation X includes, at the present time, two European JAA member countries. Consequently, Cessna intends to pursue certification to meet the European JAA requirements as well as the FAA requirements. To reduce the testing required, Cessna proposes to test to an environment that combines a proposed FAA certification environment (from the SAE AE4R Subcommittee) and a proposed JAA certification environment (from EUROCAE WG&hyph;33) to form a ``worst case'' certification environment. This environment will consist of the following: Where the combined proposed certification environment is less than 100 volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed certification environment (JAA or FAA, whichever is higher). Where the combined environment is greater than 100 volts per meter, Cessna will test to the proposed JAA environment (less aircraft attenuation above 200 MHz). The aircraft attenuation will be established by the results of full vehicle tests conducted by Cessna on Model 650, Citation III, and Citation VII aircraft. Cessna's proposed Model 750 HIRF certification environment is as follows: Proposed Cessna 750 (Citation X [CX] HIRF Certification Environment 1Frequency (HZ) 1Proposed FAA certification environment (peak/avg) 1Proposed JAA certification environment (peak/avg) 1Proposed CX threat environment (peak/avg) 10K&hyph;500K 50/50 40/40 50/50 500K&hyph;2M 40/40 40/40 40/40 2M&hyph;30M 100/100 100/100 100/100 30M&hyph;100M 20/20 20/20 20/20 100M&hyph;200M 50/30 50/30 50/30 200M&hyph;400M 70/70 70/70 70/70 400M&hyph;700M 1520/750 700/30 700/30 700M&hyph;1G 1300/170 1300/70 1300/70 1G&hyph;2G 2500/180 2500/160 2500/160 2G&hyph;4G 3500/360 3500/240 3500/240 4G&hyph;6G 6800/280 3200/280 3200/280 6G&hyph;8G 1800/330 800/330 800/330 8G&hyph;12G 3500/215 3500/330 3500/330 12G&hyph;18G 1700/270 1700/180 1700/180 Conclusion This action affects only certain design features on the Cessna Model 750 (Citation X) airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The authority citation for these proposed special conditions is as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). The Proposed Special Conditions Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Cessna Model 750 (Citation X) series airplanes. 1. Lightning Protection (a) Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to lightning. (b) Each essential function of electrical or electronic systems or installations must be protected to ensure that the function can be recovered in a timely manner after the airplane has been exposed to lightning. 2. Protection From Unwanted Effects of High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields. 3. For the Purpose of These Special Conditions, the Following Definitions Apply Critical Functions. Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Essential Functions. Functions whose failure could contribute to or cause a failure condition that would significantly impact the safety of the airplane or the ability of the flightcrew to cope with adverse operating conditions.
