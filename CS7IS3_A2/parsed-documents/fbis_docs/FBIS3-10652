Furthermore, the PSDB bloc should approach Cardoso today to ask him to announce his decision this week. Everyone is under the impression that Fernando Henrique will run for election because if his decision was to remain as finance minister, there would be no reason to postpone the announcement. Deputy Joao Abraao, one of the most involved in Finance Ministry affairs, commented: "If he announced now that he will continue as finance minister, he would end the speculation regarding the name of his replacement." The movement -- still rather surreptitious -- of currents for or against this or that name during the past days has increased expectations, irritated people, and stirred up ancient ill-feelings. On 7 March, during a trip from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia, a member of the economic team did not conceal his annoyance over politicians' negative comments about Finance Ministry experts. According to the expert, the purpose of those who criticize economic team members one by one is precisely to demoralize the entire team in order to get Cardoso to remain in the ministry and thus prevent him from running in the elections. The actions, according to this argument, are allegedly orchestrated by another candidate who aspires to the presidency. This theory may even make some sense regarding a specific group of politicians but there are some within the PSDB federal bloc who openly uphold the names of Pedro Malan and Edmar Bacha for this post. According to this theory, the two allegedly meet the necessary requirements because they are well acquainted with the economic plan and will be capable of efficiently implementing it. Negotiations with Congress, in the case of a technical solution, may be conducted by Fernando Henrique himself, who would resume his seat in the Senate. Rubens Ricupero, who until not long ago made a point of saying -- rather jokingly -- that he would rather seek asylum in Switzerland than run the Brazilian economy, may be the big surprise. Ricupero gained a lot of experience and international prestige in the foreign trade field through his work with GATT and has received significant support from the business sector. The possibility that the finance minister might postpone his decision even more, in keeping with the amendment extending the deadline for governors and ministers to resign until 2 July, is dismissed by the PSDB. The reason for this is, according to information available on 7 March, that 80 percent of the PSDB deputies and senators are against the proposal because they believe it is tied to circumstances and, instead of helping, will mortally wound the credibility of Fernando Henrique's candidacy. The possible replacements: Pedro Malan: Central Bank president and one of the most mentioned candidates to replace Fernando Henrique. His supporters are in every area: ministries, the economic field, Congress, and within the PSDB itself. There might be someone better acquainted with the economic plan, but Malan is always regarded as the expert with the best minister-like face. Edmar Bacha: Special Finance Ministry adviser. Was one of the experts most involved in drafting the economic plan. He has the advantage of also having being greatly involved in the Cruzado Plan and, therefore, fully aware of the causes of the failure of the Funaro plan. He enjoys the support of economist deputies; he is regarded as arrogant by political circles. Rubens Ricupero: Current environment and legal Amazon region minister, was Franco's first choice as finance minister. He rejected the offer in his capacity as ambassador with the excuse that he had spent too much time out of the country. Now he believes he is fully acquainted with Brazilian problems. At Planalto Palace he enjoys the support of institutional communications adviser Augusto Marzagao. Osiris Lopes: Federal Revenue Secretary and favorite of presidential secretary general Mauro Durante, who wants to promote him. The problem is the public arguments in which he calmly engaged with the economic team regarding tax increases. Tasso Jereissati: PSDB president, he almost became finance minister during [Jose] Sarney's administration. Now, however, he has the obstacle of the elections because, running again for the Ceara governorship, it is quite unlikely he will be elected. He is finely attuned to Fernando Henrique. Beni Varas: This senator will be sworn in today as planning minister and, although discreetly, he already is mentioned as one of the possible leaders of the economy. Politically, he would be a God-sent gift for the PSDB.
