Kayoko Hosokawa said, "It is natural that the premier and the chief cabinet secretary express different opinions," noting that the Hosokawa Cabinet is different from previous governments under control of the Liberal Democratic Party. The difference between Hosokawa and Takemura "doesn't mean a gap between them has widened," she said. "Contrary to media reports, their relationship is not serious." She also told reporters she has doubts about the media because they often distort facts or write stories based on imagination. She did not say whether the prime minister wanted to remove Takemura from the key post of chief cabinet secretary and give him another position. The premier has expressed hopes of reorganizing his six-month cabinet later this month, which the media has speculated could mean the removal of Takemura. Parties in Hosokawa's ruling coalition are divided on an early cabinet reshuffle, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) against it, and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito pushing strongly for it.
