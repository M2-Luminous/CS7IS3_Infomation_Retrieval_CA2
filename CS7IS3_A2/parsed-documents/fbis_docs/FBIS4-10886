"Moreover, we can now happily observe that there is the beginning of an opening on the Caribbean island," Rodriguez said after a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at his home in the Asuncion neighborhood of Las Carmelitas. "The systems that are in force in friendly countries must be respected, but at least we must indicate the interest that exists in wanting them to follow the same (democratic) path and the same course to improve relations between one country and another," [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's predecessor said. He stated that it has not been possible until now to reach a stage of transition in Cuba like the stage occurring in our country, but he expressed his hope that this democratic opening will open up new horizons and thus involve the political sector. When asked if the Wasmosy government's position of not maintaining diplomatic relations with Cuba is the best one, Rodriguez said: "Diplomatic relations cannot be discussed before Cuba has a democratic system or opening. The foreign minister (Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner) is trying out the possibility of maintaining trade relations. But at this time I cannot give an opinion; only the government and president can give an opinion." Rodriguez stated that he would vote in favor of the U.S. blockade of Cuba if the possibility arose in an international forum, such as the occasion on 3 November 1993 when our country voted against Cuba. Paraguay was the only Latin American country to do so with the exception of Argentina, which abstained.
