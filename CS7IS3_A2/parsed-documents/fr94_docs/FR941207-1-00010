The FAA is considering rulemaking for each area where rulemaking is appropriate. In announcing these recommendations, the NTSB stated that the standards for safety should be based on the characteristics of the flight operations, not the seating capacity of the aircraft and that passengers on commuter airlines should be afforded the same regulatory safety protections granted to passengers flying on Part 121 airlines. With this notice, the FAA is soliciting comments on the following recommendations and the FAA's response thereto: 1. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations such that: •All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 20 or more passenger seats be conducted according to the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121. •All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 10 to 19 passenger seats be conducted in accordance with 14 CFR Part 121, or its functional equivalent, wherever possible.
