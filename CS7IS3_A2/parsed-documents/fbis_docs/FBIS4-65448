Having come under the pressure of the large corporations, President Clinton feels forced to renew the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause before 3 June. The White House is now desperately looking for a face-saving formula, because last year Clinton made the renewal of the MFN dependent on a generally improved situation of human rights in China and Tibet. The Situation of the Dissidents Has Not Changed Not only in the WASHINGTON POST can Clinton read that the actual situation in China has not changed. The usual cynical game is being played with the dissidents. Political dissidents, people who think differently, and intellectuals who are too bold are subjected to the arbitrary actions of the Chinese security organs. Recently adopted new laws, which can be interpreted in various ways, give the police a wide leeway for action. Some leading dissidents have been arrested or deported. With a view to the fifth anniversary of the bloody clearing out of Tiananmen Square by the military, CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin said that the development has shown that the actions taken on 4 June 1989 were right. This is to be understood as a warning to the dissident scene. The government is trying to tighten the screws again. Stricter control of the media and the film industry has been put into motion. Newscasts such as the BBC World News, which are very popular in China, have been switched off. Journalists, particularly from Hong Kong, have been sufficiently intimidated by deportations and trials. The obvious impatience with which U.S. companies are pushing into the Chinese market, which is now opening up, brings problems of argumentation for the U.S. Administration in Washington. In an analysis, which has been leaked, Winston Lord, who was U.S. ambassador to Beijing until 1989 and is now a high-ranking State Department official, confirmed the mistakes of the policy of coupling the MFN clause to human rights, even though it was Lord, deeply disappointed and personally affected after 1989, who had advised Clinton to pursue this policy. The Chinese are watching the confusing game of the Americans with some amusement. It is not the government in Beijing but the Administration in Washington that is under self-inflicted pressure, in particular since for some time ordering a different treatment of state companies and joint ventures in granting trade preferences was even considered in the U.S. capital. Such a policy cannot be implemented in administrative terms at all and is pointless, because it has been proved that working conditions in joint-venture factories of businessmen from Guangzhou and Taiwan in southern China are often much worse than those in state companies, where things are inefficient but at least relatively socially acceptable. For Clinton the policy toward China is only one aspect of a policy without contours toward Asia. At the summit in Seattle in November 1993 he had classified the importance of the Asia-Pacific region as being greater than that of relations with Europe. In the meantime he has ended up in a clinch with the Japanese; a war of words is under way with Singapore; Indonesia has forbidden U.S. interference in trade union issues; and Malaysia is keeping its cool distance. The people in Washington are now learning that dealing with the old partners in Europe is easier than with Japanese, Chinese, and other Asians. Honesty in Washington Would Be Refreshing Under pressure from Congressional and Senate circles, Clinton is now in the unpleasant situation of having to slap China's fingers without annoying the U.S. business world. One out of seven planes produced by Boeing are nowadays sold to China. U.S. banks and securities companies are smelling big business, and many products in U.S. shopping centers would become more expensive if the customs preferences were abolished. In view of this helpless situation, honesty would be refreshing. Washington should admit that quite definite economic interests are determining its policy toward China.
