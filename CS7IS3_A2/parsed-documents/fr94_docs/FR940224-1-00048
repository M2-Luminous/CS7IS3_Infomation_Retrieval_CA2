FR940224-1-00048 FR940224-1-00010 Net Benefit to the Nation In addition to the findings above, the Council found other compelling reasons to support the proposed rule and concluded that it would provide the greatest net benefit to the nation. Option 1 addresses concerns that there be equal sharing of the conservation burden between the at-sea and the shoreside processing sectors. A percentage allocation more equitably shares between sectors both the conservation burden when the harvest guideline is low, and the benefit when the harvest guideline is high. The harvest guideline in 1994 is much higher than previously expected, almost twice the 1993 level, but is expected to be lower in 1995 and 1996. Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than in 1993, additional overcapitalization is not expected. The shore-based industry already is developed and the 104,000 mt reserve is close to the 100,000 mt estimate of shoreside capacity in the EA/RIR. (Maximum annual harvest by shore-based whiting fishery was estimated at 134,000 mt in 1994&hyph;1996.) The proposed rule, if implemented, would apply only for the next 3 years, a long-enough horizon for stability in planning, but short enough to indicate to the public that the Council may reconsider this issue after the fleet has had a chance to adjust to the limited entry program and whiting markets have stabilized. The proposed rule is not a major departure from the approved 1993 allocation percentage of 30 percent for the shoreside sector. The Council recommendation for 1994&hyph;1996 would give shoreside priority to 40 percent of the harvest guideline, supplementing any amount taken during the olympic fishery for the first 60 percent. Also, with implementation of the limited entry program, participation by the at-sea processing fleet may be much lower than in 1993, although the exact level will not be known until the fishery occurs. The reserve release assures that the harvest guideline will be fully utilized. The release date of August 15 is 2 weeks earlier than in the past, and provides a longer opportunity for the at-sea fleet if a release is made to them. August 15 also coincides with the opening of the pollock ``B'' season in Alaska, and therefore would provide a more subdued level of effort and a more orderly fishery than if the reserve were released much earlier or later in the year. In addition to the above considerations, NOAA also has considered the Council's response to the following three questions asked at the November 1993 Council meeting: 1. Why is allocating between the sectors by regulation superior to allowing the market to determine the shares between sectors? Each of the sectors has the capacity to take a substantial portion, if not all, of the whiting harvest guideline in the next 3 years. It is not clear if each would choose to do so given current low prices and uncertainty in the availability of markets. The shore-based and at-sea sectors operate optimally at different rates, however, with the shore-based component generally preferring a longer, slower fishery and the at-sea component best served with a relatively shorter, more intense operation. Extended seasons at sea and on-shore actually enhance market opportunities for catcher boats that would have their choice of markets. Furthermore, providing an opportunity for all sectors would divert effort from other fully utilized fisheries that already are severely restricted. Additional effort into those fisheries would have a cascading effect, causing earlier and/or more restrictive management measures and even greater stress on shore-based processors of those species. (Whiting is the only trawl-caught species off Washington, Oregon, and California that is processed offshore to any large extent.) Allowing the at-sea processing sector to even partially preempt the shoreside sector would reduce national net benefits to the nation from the fishery and destabilize the successfully developed shoreside economic infrastructure. Thus, there is ample justification to allocate between sectors. The proposed rule would provide each sector with a reasonable opportunity to utilize this public resource. However, if a sector does not need or intend to use its opportunity to the fullest extent possible, any unused portion of the harvest guideline would be made available to the entire whiting fishery. 2. Will this proposal encourage further capitalization in either sector? None of the options, including the preferred option, are expected to encourage further capitalization in either sector. The at-sea and shore-based processing sectors and the catcher fleet are fully developed and are believed to be capable of taking the proposed amounts. Even though the tonnage available in 1994 is substantially higher than in 1993 (and is the highest level in the 3-year period under consideration), market prices for whiting currently are at such low levels that it is unlikely that additional processing capacity would be attracted. At issue is the extent that existing capacity will be utilized on whiting, other species, or not at all.
