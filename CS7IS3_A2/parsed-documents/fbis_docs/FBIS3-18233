Giorgio Napolitano -- speaker of the lower house and the progressive forces' candidate for Naples -- is worried, and is not concealing the fact: "Throughout the legislative term parliament has worked hard to support the course of justice, helping to establish judicially significant responsibilities. This, without violating the guarantees provided to defend both the function of parliament and the citizens, and without neglecting the need -- in order to begin a new phase in the life of the Republic -- for reforms that can come only from parliament and obviously not from the judicial authorities. Whether or not we have been successful in this endeavor may be a matter for discussion, but political and judicial considerations must not be confused." [Franchi] The fact is that nobody seems to be very clear about how to avert this danger of superimposition.... [Napolitano] In order to guarantee the proper and calm conduct of the election campaign there must be a great sense of responsibility and restraint on the part of all the state authorities and bodies. But confusion is often also avoided by clarifying matters. [Franchi] You are talking about the media. The only thing that cannot be demanded of them is not to provide information, however. [Napolitano] Yes. But it is extraordinary, for instance, that the existence of the so-called register of investigatees was discovered only a few months ago and that there has been no explanation of what it is. [Franchi] Have you formed an idea of the reason for this "discovery?" [Napolitano] I think that since the abolition of the application for authority to proceed in the case of deputies and senators, with the reform of parliamentary immunity -- and we are well aware of how newsworthy every such request was -- its place as a piece of sensational news has been taken over by disclosures about inclusion on the register. This is irregular: That register, which the penal code significantly assigns for information about crimes and not investigatees, automatically includes names of persons who subsequently may very well not receive the notice of investigation which, however, used to be the precondition for authorization to proceed. Therefore, a category of suspicion that was already quite inevitably associated with the first official stage of an investigation has been brought forward to an entirely primal level. [Franchi] Did you know that it is rumored that your name too is included on the register in Naples? [Napolitano] I did not know, and it does not interest me. In any case, the penal code forbids any communications in this regard. I only know that I have initiated proceedings for slander against a certain Mr. Greco for the ridiculous fabrications that he apparently presented to the magistrate who questioned him, and that were denied by Deputy Pomicino, whom he himself cited as his source. [Franchi] Leaving judicial initiatives aside, are you not aware of a sense of disappointment among the public? Is this really the advance of the New? [Napolitano] Innovation does not happen overnight; an electoral reform -- even the best -- does not produce its positive effects immediately. What were, and what are, people's aspirations? On the one hand, openness, political and ethical honesty in relations between the institutions and the country, between representatives and represented. On the other hand, a simplification of the debate before the voters and within the elective assemblies, in order to permit greater government stability and efficiency. Well, progress is possible in both areas, both now and in the near future. But there needs to be an effort of reflection and realism on everyone's part. It must not be forgotten that until 1992 it proved impossible to produce even a corrective measure to the proportional system by introducing a threshold. Each political force remained attached to its own more or less obsolete identity; its own political, cultural, or government stances; resisting any possible combination with other forces. [Franchi] Yes. But then came the scalpel of the first-past-the-post, single-round, single-candidate system... [Napolitano] ...And we must not be surprised if the alignments that this system has caused to be formed more or less hastily are proving, to a greater or lesser extent, controversial, artificial, and subject to successive disruptions. I mean that a first step has been taken: All three main alignments display a common denominator, internal difficulties, and uncertainties about the future. It will be necessary to work patiently and responsibly to keep united that which can reasonably unite on the left, on the right, and in the center. [Franchi] The single-candidate system was sought for the sake of selecting a political class having connections with the ground, with the voters. Precisely the opposite is happening, however -- recycling, the search for safe constituencies... [Napolitano] I am worried by the fact that the political forces have not properly understood the rationale of the single-candidate system. But this option is destined to endure: Other aspects of the electoral system may be revised, but not this. It is also extraordinary that, even before the election, so many attacks are being made on a reform approved by the voters themselves, instead of appreciating all its potential for change. [Franchi] I understand that. But there is still a strong feeling that many expectations could be disappointed. And it is a sense of danger. [Napolitano] This is a traumatic transition -- even chaotic, as [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli says -- because of the terrible delay with which it was begun. We must also understand that everywhere -- from West Europe to the United States -- democratic systems are experiencing difficulties that are not easy to understand or to control. The wind of antipolitics; of intolerance; and of opposition to the parties, politicians, and parliament is not blowing in Italy alone. And the only democratic response lies in the regeneration of political life and of the representative assemblies. That is, unless... [Franchi] Unless what? [Napolitano] Unless the voters' choices are well pondered -- and this includes the individuals concerned, their qualities, and their real suitability for representing and governing. As a voter, I would urge candidates standing in my constituency to pledge, first, to attend parliament as long as debates and votes require. [Franchi] Mr. Speaker, you try to keep out of the fray as far as possible. But I would remind you that you are competing on behalf of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the progressive forces. To return to your idea, what could remain "reasonably united" on the left after the election? [Napolitano] The demarcation line with the right is very clear. I am hoping for a civilized debate also between the progressive forces and the "pole for freedoms," but certainly all the components of the progressive cartel identify with certain major principles. First, the commitment to preserve, reappraise, and strengthen social and civil gains, which are the fruit of action over several decades on the part of the left-wing and progressive forces and which are essential to further democratic development. On this basis we can and must shoulder all the burdens necessary for the reform of public finance, to boost the economy, for reform of the institutions, and for the country's social and ethical rebuilding. [Franchi] But it is precisely in these fields that the splits are occurring. [Napolitano] It would of course be ridiculous to deny or to conceal the differences concerning the prospect of government, important aspects of economic and financial policy, and even foreign policy: Be that as it may, the voters can express their preferences for the various stances through their votes for the lists for the proportional quota. After the election we will see what possible common ground exists on the controversial issues. But we will focus on the need to formulate consistent and feasible proposals for an alignment that intends to shoulder government responsibilities.
