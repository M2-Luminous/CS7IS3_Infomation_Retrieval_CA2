There are about 100 of these documents, and the committee has made a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry to submit them to the Federal Assembly's upper chamber, Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the committee, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In accordance with the Russian Constitution, the federal laws on the ratification and denouncement of Russia's international agreements are subject to mandatory ratification by the Federation Council, he noted. Podoprigora stressed that his committee will closely coordinate work with colleagues in the lower chamber, and he has already agreed with Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma's relevant subdivision and experienced diplomat, to act in harmony to ensure fruitful work. In his view, this is very important since the process of passing agreements through parliament will now become more complicated as they will be discussed at separate sittings of the chambers.
