These projects include the construction of an oil pipeline from Burgas, Bulgaria, into Greece. Shokhin said that this would be a new export route by-passing the Bosphorus and Dardanelles which might be closed for environmental reasons. Under another project, Greek ship-owners would contribute to the revival of the Russian merchant fleet. To the best of Interfax's knowledge, during the Papoulias visit to Moscow the two sides held intensive talks on the continuation of the construction of an alumina works and gas pipeline in Greece with Russian participation.
