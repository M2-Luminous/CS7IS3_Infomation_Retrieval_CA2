The Georgian delegation included Ajarian Supreme Council Chairman Aslan Abashidze. [Abashidze] I will say from the outset that this first official visit marks a new stage in our country's history and relations, which will certainly yield solid, practical results. As far as history is concerned.... You yourself know how troubled our two countries' relations have been over the centuries. There was more darkness than light, but times have changed. We are all gratified now about this sharp turnaround in our relations, as reflected in the visit to independent Georgia by Turkey's present president (who was the Prime Minister then) Suleiman Demirel. He was the first to announce out loud, "Georgia and Turkey must have not only friendly but brotherly relations." This was followed by 50 million dollars' worth of credit for Georgia, wheat, humanitarian aid, and so on. Turkey was the first to extend a helping hand to us. I will not attempt to describe the wonderful reception our head of state got in Turkey; that has already been reported. I will try to single out a few highlights. Shevardnadze's great popularity and respect in Turkey was something we felt a half hour before we were to land in Ankara, when our airplane was met by an honor escort consisting of four of the Turkish Air Force's Phantoms escorted to Ankara airport. It was an impressive sight. Before that, we, the people and leaders of Ajaria, counted it a real honor when the head of state's airplane made a major change in its route to land in Batumi so the Ajarian delegation could join. This fact places a great responsibility on us in the future, and we will try to reciprocate. Earlier, again by way of Batumi, a "working group" headed by Batoni Zurab Kervalishvili headed to Turkey; in Batumi we looked over the programs together, to which we contributed our own proposals as well. For example, Batumi was also added to the housing plan; it had not been included. Naturally, this carries considerable political weight, because our two countries' relations begin at the border, in this case from Sarpi and Batumi. This is a very important factor. The lavish ceremony that was put on in front of Turkey's presidential palace in honor of Batoni Eduard was most impressive, a confirmation of the esteem the hosts hold our outstanding political leader in. And wasn't it the same in Germany, China, and elsewhere? As I watched, I felt a mixture of pride and regret, thinking what strange and ungrateful people we Georgians are: even today, hardly anybody in the world knows about Georgia, but just mention the name of Shevardnadze and... everything falls into place. But are we making use of the Shevardnadze factor? Quite the contrary: it is as if we are sacrificing Georgia's great opportunities today to certain persons' individual and party interests. Forgive the awkward comparison, but even a soccer team, if it is in trouble, will go to any lengths to buy someone who will take charge and help it win. Not us: instead of making use of this big factor, we have yet to show him anything but pain, distrust, abuse, and ungratefulness. It is sad, but "a prophet is without honor in his own country...." If other countries had a man like him, they would probably have stood the world on its ear by now and made their own country into an Eden instead of building state policy on personal sympathies and antipathies. Please consider this a lyrical digression. [Chelidze] Your recent statement about supporting the Georgian Citizens' Alliance made your position clear once more. [Abashidze] I'm not the kind of man to shout about it every day, but I have said more than once: the head of state needs the kind of faithful allies who will stand by him in deed rather than in words. We ourselves, and the whole population of Ajaria, have done everything we could. In our recent interview we acquainted readers with the relevant documents, but that's not the main thing. The point is how to help the country, how to put the economy back on its feet, how to renew the rebuilding process. This is what we had in mind two years ago when we created the Ajaria Revival Alliance with the slogan "Georgia Above All." This new stage of relations with Turkey holds promise for Georgia and for Ajaria, which directly borders on Turkey. Keep in mind, moreover, that many of our brothers, our close relatives, live and work in Turkey. The two days we were in Ankara, our whole diaspora practically camped in our hotel. You should have seen how delighted they were, how much they wanted to help and cooperate with us. One of them was a close relative of mine, my grandfather's nephew, General Akhmed Adzhari [name transliterated], a well known Turkish military man and industrialist. He now holds a high position in Turkey's military-industrial complex, which also includes other leading sectors of the economy. He has come to Batumi a number of times, and he asked me to introduce him to our head of state, which I did in Ankara. This time as well he had some interesting projects and proposals for us. We didn't go empty-handed either. We had a number of interesting projects with us. We want to build a large milling combine, a high-rise complex, and a power plant to supply electricity to both sides. We are planning a joint shipbuilding project based in Batumi's Shipbuilding Plant, to build river-maritime ships. I think this will strengthen and improve the quality of Georgia's maritime shipping. During our visit, they asked me to stay in Turkey a few days and see with my own eyes the plants which we have agreements with firms there to build. Plans call for building and starting up joint garment and wood processing enterprises. We will probably know in the first quarter of this year how practical the implementation of these agreements is. [Chelidze] For decades we waited for things to be brought to us on a platter. Maybe that has made us what we are today--inert, apathetic, lacking initiative and so on and so forth. [Abashidze] You are right. That's the way it was, but not any longer. The economic and cultural cooperation package that was signed during our official visit to Turkey opens up the way. Now it is up to our businessmen and business circles to see how skillfully we take advantage of these opportunities for our country's sake, how well we prepare new projects and carry them out. Hence, every ministry, firm, and organization will have to get busy and design projects which will serve our country's as well as the departments' interests. Preparing projects is no easy matter, however. It has to be preceded by considerable preparation. We need experienced and knowledgeable specialists, but, sad to say, we have very few. So we will have to import them from other countries, making use of our head of state's enormous prestige to do so. No one will refuse him, and we can always trust and rely on specialists he invites in. I would like to emphasize one thing. In Turkey, both the head of state and I had opportunities to meet with Turkish businessmen. They offered the kinds of projects and proposals to us which we are sending our own specialists to other countries for. This means that we lack information, we don't know what's going on in the civilized world in certain sectors. [Chelidze] When you came home from England and Europe last summer, you cancelled several of your decisions. [Abashidze] You just have to do that when you find that a contract is disadvantageous. We must admit that we are not yet well versed in the details and nuances of the market economy, so we have to do everything necessary to train knowledgeable cadres as soon as possible. I don't know about other people, but when I talk to foreign businessmen now I can't help feeling cautious, because I know that a real professional tries to turn negotiations to his own advantage. If you are incompetent and don't have up-to-date information, well.... Right now, most of our businessmen don't even know how to talk to foreigners in order to make the right deal. So we will have problems until we have gone through the labyrinth of the market economy. [Chelidze] Any trip or official visit, of course, not only includes diplomatic meetings but also events that are pleasant just to reminisce about later on. [Abashidze] Of course. Let me start with this pleasant recollection. During one reception, I found myself between Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and the wife of President Demirel. What better chance could a man wish for? For several hours I laid out for the Prime Minister all the problems we are trying to solve. I talked about future projects and proposals. Ms Ciller was so interested that she immediately summoned her apparatus's officials and ministries to the banquet table and gave them specific instructions, according to which our specialists and their Turkish colleagues will collaborate on projects and proposals which the prime minister submits to them. Ms Ciller also promised to study these projects herself, and she will come to Georgia this spring and also visit Ajaria. That is her desire. She has very warm feelings for Georgia, as do the president and his wife. As for strange episodes, they started when I set my watch on Turkish time as we arrived, and was therefore an hour late. Batoni Eduard was waiting for me at the Residence. As a result, the signing ceremony was delayed. I was horrified. I realized, of course, what had happened, but what could I do. That was one. For some reason, Batoni Eduard was always looking for me. I kept hearing him say, "Where is Aslan, where is Aslan?" I don't know; anyone who knows me knows I have no trouble walking or running. But our head of state goes so fast I couldn't keep up with him and often fell behind. I noticed how fast our head of state walks back in our own country, in mountainous Khulo. He sprained his foot there, but I still couldn't keep up. I thought to myself, maybe in these carpeted halls he'll walk a little slower, but I swear.... "Where is Aslan?", Batoni Eduard would say, and delegation members and guards, who sometimes broke the protocol rules themselves, would make a path for me so I could catch up. Even when I was late or got behind, he always greeted me with a smile. He never said a word of reproach, but I would have preferred that, because at such times a smile seems like more of a punishment. The visit ended, and we happily left Turkey's hospitable land, taking with us the hope and belief that Georgia and Turkey really will begin a new stage, a breakthrough, a stage of brotherhood which will benefit our peoples and Georgia.
