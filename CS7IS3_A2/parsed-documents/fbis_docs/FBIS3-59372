Thus Guangzhou has now become one of the top three cities of China in terms of comprehensive economic strength, while topping other cities in terms of some other economic performance indexes. Over the 13 years of reform and opening up, Guangzhou has always kept its economy growing at a two-digit annual growth rate. Guangzhou's GDP last year is expected to reach 68.2 billion yuan, an increase of more than 21 percent over the previous year. The tertiary industry sector is expected to share nearly 50 percent of this GDP, thus ranking Guangzhou second among other cities in this sense.
