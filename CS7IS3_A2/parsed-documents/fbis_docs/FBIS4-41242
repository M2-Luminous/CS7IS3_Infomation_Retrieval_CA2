[Paznyak] I believe that this is one of the key questions. Eastern policy, in particular our relations with Russia, will undoubtedly be a priority in our foreign political activities. What is my vision of this policy? I think that we should strive for initiating equal, partner-like relations with our eastern neighbor. This is very relevant, and Belarus should come forward with this initiative. I think that we will have to hold negotiations on this issue with the Russian president. We will have to try and organize a meeting and clear up all the issues concerning Russia, Belarus, and our mutual interests, the more so since quite a number of these issues have piled up. We are just as interested in good relations as Russia, given that Belarus is the state through which Russia can maintain contacts with the West. That is why we have things to discuss and must see them through to completion. I believe that the president of Russia is the right type of leader and the kind of politician with which we can discuss and resolve these problems. [Reporter] People sometimes ask whether [Russian Prime Minister] Chernomyrdin would like to conduct business with President Paznyak. As we know, Vyachaslaw Kebich's trump card is the allegation that Chernomyrdin will refuse to deal with anybody other than Kebich. [Paznyak] The prime minister of Russia will be dealing with the prime minister of Belarus, while the president of Russia will be dealing with his Belarusian counterpart. This is the procedure. [Reporter] The administration frightens people with cock-and-bull stories saying that once Paznyak assumes the post, Russians will be told to go back to Russia. [Paznyak] I must say that this is a hackneyed propaganda cliche. Still, this issue seems to worry many people, because many people treat the propaganda campaign very seriously. That is why I want to state clearly and precisely: Nobody, including myself, is going to drive Russians out of Belarus. This is absolutely absurd. Our task, including mine, will be to guarantee all Belarusian citizens, including ethnic Russians, a life that would be better than in Russia itself. Our task is to make Russians in Belarus feel that market reforms, democracy, and the freedoms for which we have been fighting will provide them with significant privileges. The Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] was the first to address the issues of the rights for ethnic minorities, religious groups, and cultural-national autonomy. The BNF addressed these issues in its first program; BNF deputies initiated their discussion in the legislature. The development of the law-governed state which we are advocating, reform, and the sociopolitical ideas championed by the BNF will guarantee civic peace in Belarus. It was the BNF that lobbied the idea of single Belarusian citizenship. The Law on Citizenship was almost entirely drafted by the BNF and the Supreme Soviet had to adopt it. [passage omitted] [Reporter] How many times a month will prices be increased if you become president? [Paznyak] From the first days of my presidency, I will pursue such a policy as to stop price increases altogether. This will be done in the following way: A national currency will be introduced, appropriate policy will be conducted, and appropriate laws adopted to prevent the senseless issuance of credits. Production output will increase -- all these measures will help curb price increases and stabilize the situation. The stabilization of prices is the primary task of reform. Later, when this stabilization is achieved and reform continues, the situation will diametrically change; and, having curbed inflation, we will gradually arrive at a normal price structure. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Kebich took out a lot of credits. How will President Paznyak deal with that issue? [Paznyak] In October 1992, Belarus had no debts. Today, our per capita debt is around $200. I discussed this problem at my meeting with President Clinton at the beginning of 1994. I asked why the United States was granting loans to the current government, which was not using them properly. The credits are being eaten away and embezzled -- we checked that. The government is granted credits, which later will have to be paid back by the people. We will start paying them back as early as 1996, when this government will have resigned and its officials are off living in their villas. That is why I suggested that credits be given to finance economic reform. I was happy to hear the U.S. State Department announce 10 days later that the United States was going to take such a stance with regard to credits. We will have to pay back those debts, but my government will try to put an end to embezzlements and improper use of funds, after which this capital will be used to finance economic reform. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What is your attitude toward the unification of monetary systems? [Paznyak] I have addressed this issue many times and I want to repeat that my attitude is absolutely negative, because this is a bluff. Russian economists, including Gaydar, and our experts have both proven in detail that this is an impossible operation. Nevertheless, this process is continuing. What is the essence of the unification? Instead of the unification of two monetary systems, the merging of two mafia clans, the Moscow clan and the Belarusian clan, is under way. Such clans have been formed in Russia and Belarus, and they have access to governing the state and they currently have common interests. The mafia is going international and becoming more integrated. The monetary merger is actually the unification of the interests of two clans. The Moscow grouping aims to grab our property by legal methods, have a guarantee of free transit of Russian gas and oil via Belarus. The military-industrial complex and certain political forces in Russia are interested in preserving nuclear arms and antiaircraft defense units on Belarusian soil. The Belarusian grouping has interests of its own, the primary one being to avoid responsibility for corruption and the collapse of the economy; shift this burden onto the shoulders of the Moscow administrations. They will also have guarantees that what they have managed to grab will not be taken away. This is a very grave problem, for we will be staying on our land but have no property. I am categorically against such policy, which has been continuing for eight months now. To what has it led? Belarus has lost one-third of its GNP; we are losing 25 billion rubles per day; business activity has stopped; investments frozen; plants are being closed down. [passage omitted]
