It adds that some UNPROFOR troops stayed on to control certain positions, including the summit of Mount Bjelasnica and its TV relay facility. "However, the Muslim forces today carried out a military operation and captured the summit of Mount Bjelasnica and the TV relay," the statement of the main headquarters of the Srpska republic army says. Thus, the area handed over by the Srpska republic army to UNPROFOR under the terms of the cease-fire agreement has been seized by members of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army. This creates conditions for offensive operations toward Trnovo and Rogoj, as well as major offensive operations to split and capture the Serb-held parts of Sarajevo. It is certain that the Muslims and UNPROFOR have used deceit to violate the terms of the peace agreement. "Nothing can be said with certainty about the fate of UNPROFOR members who stayed on at the summit of Mount Bjelasnica until the violent act committed by the Muslims," the statement issued by the information service of the main headquarters of the Srpska republic army says in conclusion.
