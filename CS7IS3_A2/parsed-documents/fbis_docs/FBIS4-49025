Our ad hoc reporting team, wishing to give an in-depth report on Jiangsu's present situation, went across the entire province and carried out a month-long investigation and news gathering, contributing to the making of this special issue. This special issue is divided into six main sections, giving reports on such special topics as Taiwan-Jiangsu relations, local economies across Jiangsu, village and town enterprises, society and culture, as well as tourism and consumption. In addition, Shen Ta-jen [Shen Daren] and Chen Huan-yu [Chen Huanyou], respectively former and incumbent secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, gave separate exclusive interviews to our editor-in-chief Huang Chao-sung [7806 5128 2646] and reporters Yu Yu-lin [0205 7183 7207], Pai Te-hua [4101 1795 5478], and Chou Yeh. During the interviews, both Shen Ta-jen and Chen Huan-yu answered in detail questions raised by our reporting team. During his exclusive interview with our reporting team, Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huan-yu pointed out: Although we do not have too many exchanges with Taiwan, Jiangsu will take a positive attitude toward exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and will try its best to help realize any plans favorable to cross-strait exchanges. Furthermore, Jiangsu will start a tuition class for the Taiwan Joint College Entrance Examination and pre-university courses for Taiwan students. The contents of Chen Huan-yu's interview with CHUNG KUO SHIH PAO [CKSP] are as follows: [CKSP] Last year Jiangsu Province put up an economic performance that was outstanding among various provinces on the mainland. Mr. Secretary, would you please tell us the main reasons behind the Jiangsu economy's relatively outstanding performance? [Chen] Outside people's affirmation of the noticeable results in Jiangsu's economic development last year is an encouragement for us. Encouragement from Taiwan in particular gave us a deep impression. On behalf of compatriots in the province, I express gratitude for this. We were able to score such results last year because of good opportunities, favorable geographical position, and, still more, the positive effect of human factors. We may call 1993 a year in which our provincial economy enjoyed sustained development. While the total annual output of goods and services for the province topped 255 billion renminbi yuan, up 18.5 percent over the previous year and topping up the second doubling in its value seven years ahead of schedule; the per capita gross national product for the province rose to 3,675 yuan, or 1,000 yuan more than the national average. [CKSP] You assumed the position of secretary at the end of last September while holding the governorship at the same time. As the new secretary, would you please tell us about your latest overall vision of the direction for Jiangsu's economic development and where the principal focuses of development lie? Implementation of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control is Favorable to Economic Transformation [Chen] We have determined two main objectives of struggle for Jiangsu's economic development: First, the objective of reform is to establish in about five years a basic framework for the socialist market economic system. Second, the objective of development is to double the province's total annual output of goods and services for the third time by the end of the century following the realization of the second "doubling" ahead of time in 1993, so as to lift the economy's overall quality and composite strength to a new level and bring about a relatively comfortable life for the people ahead of schedule. As to the question of where the principal focuses of future development lie, I would condense my answer into four phrases: seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider to the outside world, and accelerate development. So these will be our focus of development. As the state has introduced a few more major reform measures this year, our present task is to properly conduct propaganda, give explanations, and carry out organization, coordination, dovetailing, and implementation of measures. We should manage to carry out thorough preparation and meticulous organization to ensure success. It is necessary to advance opening up to the outside world at an even higher level to vigorously develop an open economy. We will make full use of the international market and foreign capital, technology, and resources; expand import and export trading, attract foreign capital from a high starting point and on a large scale, converge and merge with the international economy in an even faster and better way, and accelerate the process of building a new system of socialist market economy. In addition, we will strive for speed as far as possible based on the viewpoint that "development is the last word." So long as we have quality, good sales, efficiency, and basically satisfactory supplies of essential production factors, we will embark on as many projects as possible. Our general policy is: "The fast are not to be halted by force and the slow are not to be rushed by force either." [CKSP] As you are the first person in Jiangsu to hold dual positions [provincial party secretary and governor], we would like to know whether you have trouble trying to cope with the workload of managing both party and government affairs? [Chen] I am now concurrently holding two positions on a temporary basis under special circumstances, and this will not last long. I have two ways to suit myself to the dual positions: one is to rely on collectives -- our leading collectives; the other is to rely on the masses. An individual has very little strength and is unable to get things done all by himself. I rely on the collectives. I give the ideas, they carry them out, and the masses implement them. So things are easily accomplished in this way. [CKSP] I am sorry to chip in. You said you are holding dual positions on a temporary basis, but Hainan's Juan Chung-wu [Ruan Chongwu] has held dual positions for a long time while several other provinces, such as Fujian, followed suit recently. Can all these be viewed as temporary? [Chen] I am not too sure about explanations given by other provinces, but as far as I know, that was meant to be a temporary measure in Fujian also. As for us, it really is a temporary measure. Juan Chung-wu's holding dual positions is a procedural matter, on which the central authorities have taken a clear stand. Being a small province with a population of only a few million and with economic development at the initial stage, Hainan is suitable for a little experimentation. As we, Jiangsu, are a big province with a population of 70 million and economic development ranking among the top in the country, I would be able to cope with the heavy workload alone only temporarily but not in the long run. The central authorities have also made this clear. While some people say it is easier to get things done with concentrated authority, this has to be viewed in two respects: advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is swift handling of matters, while the disadvantage is a lack of restriction which raises the possibility of making mistakes. Things will go wrong in the long run when a person has to make policy decisions as well as carry them out all by himself; this just does not work. Therefore, my holding dual positions at the moment is only a temporary measure and not a matter of regular practice. From the standpoint of regular practice, it is better to separate the two positions. We had all the while separated party and government affairs, with major strategies being decided by the party committee and daily work and specific matters organized and implemented by the government. Outside people misread it as our current move toward combining party and government affairs; this is a misunderstanding. [CKSP] We all know the Central Committee of the Chinese Communists are now implementing measures for macroeconomic regulation and control and tightening finances. Is Jiangsu fully prepared for this policy and have you taken any corresponding measures such as reducing the scale of investment and tightening credits? Furthermore, what impact does this policy have on the economic development strategies formulated by Jiangsu? [Chen] The CPC Central Committee's measures drawn up last year to strengthen and improve microeconomic regulation and control played a very important role in overall economic development and social stability. However, we have to admit that these measures somewhat affected the pace of Jiangsu's economic development in the short run. Nevertheless, there are pros and cons to everything. With a smaller budget, we made careful plans, concentrated funds, and spent money on more important projects such as the renovation of the Nanjing Airport and the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway. Those small-sized infrastructure projects had to be suspended temporarily. If we took a passive attitude toward microeconomic regulation and control, we would have only noticed problems like the tight money supply, fund shortages, and a strained microeconomic environment. But in the long run, microeconomic regulation and control is helpful for quickening economic development and carrying out our economic development strategy. For example, village and town enterprises developed very fast in the past few years. The pace of development among them was uneven. Some of them wanted to continue expanding their scale of production without taking their poor quality of development into consideration. Now they have slowed down somewhat and found out about their mistakes. This enabled some small-sized plants to merge into large- sized factories. With more funds, these factories are, instead of manufacturing poor-quality products, producing high-quality products that generate greater economic efficiency. This might not be a bad thing. That is why I stressed that we have to understand microeconomic regulation and control with a positive approach. When the CPC Central Committee just began to carry out microeconomic regulation and control measures last year, we encountered the problem of fund shortages. The provincial party committee urged the entire province to economize as much as possible to save money not allocated for normal expenditures. The goal was to save 10 billion yuan by year's end. In only two months, we accomplished our mission of saving 10 billion yuan and resolved the fund shortage problem. We can see from this example that as long as the people support us, we will easily get things done. Village and Town Enterprises in South Jiangsu Are Required To Improve Their Quality [CKSP] Village and town enterprises in Jiangsu developed vigorously in recent years. Nevertheless, there are limits to the development of village and town enterprises, most of which are small- and medium-sized. Will Jiangsu consider expanding village and town enterprises in terms of their sizes? Moreover, does Jiangsu have a new development strategy for current and future village and town enterprises? [Chen] The flourishing of village and town enterprises is a special feature in Jiangsu's economic development, and such enterprises are the pillars of Jiangsu's economy. Especially since the 1980's, village and town enterprises in south Jiangsu have entered a new stage of development. We can sum up the following special features shared by the village and town enterprises in south Jiangsu: Enterprises' scales of operation became larger, domestically-made equipment was replaced by foreign-made supplies, product quality was improved, more investment channels were opened, more markets for products were found, and a better investment environment was created. These features indicated the development of village and town enterprises in south Jiangsu has entered the stage of quality improvement. Those traditional enterprises began to change themselves into modern industrial enterprises. At present, Jiangsu's village and town enterprises are indeed faced with such problems as fund shortages, insufficient markets, widening disparities between different regions, poor economic efficiency, and lack of specially-trained personnel. These problems are actually problems emerging naturally in the development of village and town enterprises. With clear goals, correct guidance, and solid work, we believe we will help village and town enterprises seize opportunities, overcome difficulties, and develop in a healthy manner. Jiangsu Strives To Shorten Disparity Between the South and the North [CKSP] As the provincial economies developed in the mainland, many provinces saw uneven development among various regions. Jiangsu seemed to have the same sort of problem -- the uneven development between the south and the north. Would you please tell us if you have any measures to shorten the disparity between the two regions? [Chen] The problem of uneven economic development between south and north Jiangsu does exist. Being restricted by certain conditions, economic development in south Jiangsu is faster than that of the north. We always attach importance to this problem. We hold that the disparity was hard to avoid. However, we cannot afford a great disparity in peoples' living standards. Things will eventually go wrong if the disparity among peoples' living standards becomes wider and wider. The second session of the eighth provincial people's congress which recently ended put forward the important task of bringing various regions' strong points into full play to promote the economic development of the entire province. To resolve the problem, the provincial government drew up the following four [figure as published] measures: 1. We are making efforts to assist northern Jiangsu in the construction of infrastructure projects, such as installing telephones and building electric power plants and roads. We first borrowed $170,000 [figure as published] from Sweden to solve the problem of inadequate telephone service in northern Jiangsu. Now the problem of telephone service at the county level and above in northern Jiangsu has been totally solved. Then we helped northern Jiangsu build electric power plants. Xuzhou had power plants with a total capacity of more than 1 million kw, and now we have built plants with an additional capacity of several hundred thousand kw. We also built electric power plants in Huaiyin, Yancheng, and Lianyungang. Although there are still some locales which have not solved the problem of electricity, we are determined to solve the problem within three years. The next is road construction. Now we are building highways between Nanjing and Lianyungang, between Nanjing and Nantong, between Nantong and Yancheng, and between Nantong and Lianyungang. Besides, we are also building some railways. 2. We are speeding up the structural adjustment of agriculture, making efforts to stabilize the production of grain and cotton, and vigorously developing diversified farming operations in order to improve the rural economy. Although Jiangsu has made quite rapid progress in industrial development, we have not overlooked agriculture. The total grain output of this province is still between 62 to 66 billion jin per annum. Jiangsu is different from Guangdong and Fujian. The latter provinces plant less grain and attach importance to growing bananas, chestnuts, and other cash crops. We cannot do the same thing because we have so many people and we must have enough rice. 3. We have made efforts to establish links between northern and southern Jiangsu. We have dispatched cadres from southern Jiangsu to work as deputy mayors or deputy county heads in northern Jiangsu and let them bring the concepts and experiences of southern Jiangsu to northern Jiangsu. Meanwhile, we have also transferred some cadres from northern Jiangsu to southern Jiangsu to let them learn the motive force of southern Jiangsu. In addition, we have encouraged enterprises, sci-tech research units, and individuals to visit and exchange experiences in various fields with units and people at various levels in northern Jiangsu. This is the exchange of personnel. We have also promoted the establishment of links between units in northern and southern Jiangsu. For example, textile mills in southern Jiangsu have established direct links with cotton-producing areas in northern Jiangsu to eliminate intermediary agencies and increase the income of the rural areas. [CKSP] Businessmen from Taiwan have made many investments in Jiangsu. What are the main areas in which they invest? Roughly speaking, what is the total amount of their investments? What will be the most desirable areas of investment by Taiwanese businessmen in the future? What preferential treatments do you have? [Chen] In recent years, economic and trade contacts between Jiangsu and Taiwan have developed very fast. Taiwanese businessmen have made many kinds of investments in this province, including light industry, chemicals, textiles, electronics, building materials, food products, agriculture, and tertiary industries. Judging from the figures of growth of Taiwanese businessmen's investments on the mainland, Jiangsu ranks first among all provinces. We have a favorable geographical position, a relatively good industrial foundation, and a favorable investment environment. Besides, the educational level in this province is also quite high. Therefore, we hope more financial groups and major corporations in Taiwan will make investments and set up plants in Jiangsu, and we hope they will bring in more new and high technologies, items of greater scientific and technological value, and more world renowned brands. Moreover, we highly welcome Taiwanese businessmen to make investments in transportation, energy sources, communications, and the production of raw materials. We are not afraid of letting Taiwanese businessmen occupy a larger share of those projects. On the contrary, we welcome Taiwanese businessmen to increase their proportion of investments. In this connection, we have formulated a series of policies to encourage investments by businessmen from Taiwan and foreign countries. On a mutually beneficial basis, we will protect the lawful rights of investors. Welcome Investments by Taiwanese Businessmen, Expect Exchanges With Taiwan [CKSP] There are many people in Taiwan whose native region is Jiangsu. What is the general situation regarding their relatives in Jiangsu? As far as we know, exchanges of various types between Jiangsu and Taiwan are not very frequent. I would like to ask: do you have any plan for strengthening exchanges between Jiangsu and Taiwan, and if so, how are you going to do this? [Chen] Exchange activities between Jiangsu and Taiwan are indeed not very frequent. However, generally speaking, some progress has been made in developing exchanges between the two areas. In 1993, Jiangsu and Taiwan conducted 70 exchange activities, involving 657 people. Of these, Taiwan organized 41 delegations to visit Jiangsu, involving a total of 606 people, while this province organized 29 visits involving a total of 51 people. Jiangsu held exhibitions and demonstrations of Yixing's pottery and Suzhou's embroidery in Taiwan. In the future, we will continue to maintain a positive attitude toward promoting exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. We will do our best to promote all beneficial exchanges between the two sides. This year we will hold a continuation class for students from Taiwan to take part in the joint college entrance examination and a preparatory class for regular courses. The Nanjing Teachers' University will also accept students from Taiwan beginning the next semester. At the invitation of the Kaohsiung Antiques Research Society, four experts of the Nanjing Museum will visit Taiwan. The Yangzhou Puppet Troupe, the Xuzhou Liuqin Theatrical Troupe, and the Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Troupe will all visit Taiwan at an appropriate time. As for the relatives of Taiwan compatriots in this province, there are more than 520,000 people, according to a statistical report. They are working at various posts. [CKSP] Finally, I would like to ask the secretary this question. Since relations between Jiangsu and Taiwan have become increasingly close in recent years, we wonder about your understanding of Taiwan. Through what channels do you know about the situation in Taiwan? [Chen] In recent years, in the wake of increasing contacts of people between the two sides of the Strait, a large number of Taiwan compatriots have come to Jiangsu to visit their relatives, to engage in sight-seeing, to conduct investigations and make investments, and to carry out other activities. Therefore, we have paid good attention to the situation in Taiwan. I have met with many Taiwan compatriots who came to Jiangsu to conduct investigations and make investments or to carry our other activities, including your colleagues in journalist circles. They have given me much information about the situation in Taiwan. Nowadays, the mass media have developed rapidly and there are frequent reports on Taiwan. It should not be difficult to understand the situation in Taiwan.
