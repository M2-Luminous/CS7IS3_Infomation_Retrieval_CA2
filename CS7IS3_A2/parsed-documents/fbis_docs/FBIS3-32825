Presidential designate (vice president) Walter Lopez, a former general, said in statements to the newspaper LA TRIBUNA: "There will be no exceptions because it will be compulsory." On Thursday, the Armed Forces announced a mixed commission will be created with the government to propose law reforms which allow the implementation of "a constitutional and educational military service." The announcement was made by Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua following a meeting with Reina. Reina, who replaced former President Rafael Leonardo Callejas on 27 January, promised "a military service that was educational" and voluntary, instead of the habitual "hunt" conducted in public places for poor, young men who are taken to the Army barracks. Nevertheless, the new president apparently failed to obtain the powerful Honduran military forces' support. Bertha Oliva, coordinator of a movement against conscription, said Reina's promise "is another lie from politicians who say one thing during their political campaign but do another once they achieve power." The leader said that members of her committee will organize a hunger strike in front of where the mixed commission will meet to discuss the alleged reforms to the military service law.
