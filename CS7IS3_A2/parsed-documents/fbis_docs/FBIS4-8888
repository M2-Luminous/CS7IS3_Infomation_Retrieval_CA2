Good morning to you, Sir. [Oleksy] Good morning. [Skowronski] Are you in favor of amendments to the Small Constitution that would limit the president's powers? [Oleksy] No, I think that right now, there is no situation where one would have to think about this as something very urgent. Work on a new constitution is going on, and I am of the view that the longer it takes to complete work on the new Constitution, the more often we can have situations--in these times, full of tension--where one can be tempted to make corrections to the Small Constitution now in force. The problem is that the Small Constitution's provisions are somewhat unclear on certain points that require interpretation, or that, for democracy's sake, require extensive interpretation. We have had such motions coming from the president regarding the Constitutional Tribunal and the ultimate nature of its powers. That is a very major amendment to the Constitution and also a change in the legal system and in the courts' verdicts and the judicial system. There have also been such cases pertaining to other issues, and, as we know, today a motion by Sejm deputies was submitted to have Article 68 changed precisely so as to define with greater precision situations in which there are deadlocks such as we are having now. The coalition wants to change something in the Council of Ministers, and the president is of a different view, and there is no further [words indistinct]. [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed? [Oleksy] I beg your pardon? [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed? [Oleksy] I do not know because it is just a proposal. It will be debated like any other proposal. I do not think there is a chance for that at the next session, but, when it comes to May... [Oleksy pauses] As usual, we think constitutional issues are a priority and the issue will be debated. Constitutional procedures require a big majority--two-thirds--so, knowing the president's position...[Oleksy pauses] One must assume that he will refuse to sign the amendment. We will perhaps be able to take a stand on the president's veto. It is quite a lengthy procedure and it does not happen immediately. The excitement that was created surrounding this issue, which I encountered on my return from Japan, is out of proportion compared to the initiative's essence and nature. [Skowronski] Where were you when the news broke that the president said that, if parliament attempts to limit his powers, he would try and dissolve it? [Oleksy] That was a shocking piece of news; we were on our way home from Japan. I must say I began thinking deeply about the president's statement because it is dangerous for the essence of democracy in Poland. [Skowronski] And instrumental attempts to amend the Constitution are not dangerous to democracy in Poland? [Oleksy] If that is the way you interpret it.... [Skowronski, interrupting] How else could one interpret it? [Oleksy] If one interprets it as some kind of revenge by the coalition or its attempt to fight the president or to limit his powers, there is indeed a source of emotion. But this is not how I perceive this. As I said, I perceive it to be an attempt to make constitutional provisions more specific so as to prevent deadlocks and dead-end situations when the coalition and the president may differ on personnel changes. But if one interprets this the way the propaganda currently has been portraying it for two or three days--namely, that it is a field for a coalition-presidential battle--it is really no surprise that there are all these emotions around. [Skowronski] But, in the end, it really is the field of a battle between the coalition and the president. [Oleksy] I think not. I think it is just an attempt to overcome the deadlock in a situation of a very tough position vis-a-vis [words indistinct] an important post in the government. [Skowronski] Why is the coalition not capable of giving up on Dariusz Rosati? [Oleksy] I am not sure whether it is not capable of doing that. From what I hear, it is a question of talks with the president, and I do not think there is anyone in the coalition who thinks along the lines of forcing the president to change his position. The president has a constitutional right not to sign a proposed nomination. So I do not make the assumption that this is some attempt to force the president to sign a nomination, but it could be an attempt to force him to initiate talks. In that regard, all I can do is make an appeal that these talks take place. Otherwise, all this will begin getting ridiculous in Poland. [Skowronski] You often meet with Lech Walesa. Why can you not lead up to a coalition-president meeting? Is that so hard? From where does the main resistance come? [Oleksy] I have not taken this kind of responsibility upon myself, even though I have conducted such talks with the president. Moreover, I cannot see resistance to talks on the part of the president. [Skowronski] So who resists then? [Oleksy] There is resistance with regard to just one situation. The president has talked to me about it, too, so he is persistent in that regard--namely, that he refuses to talk about the specific candidacy. The coalition knows that. But, for its part, the coalition wants the talks to be of a wider scope--that is, going beyond just this one issue. As far as I know, the coalition fears that the president wants to discuss just the finance minister nomination and nothing else. But, in my mind, and in all the efforts I have been making since I became Sejm speaker, the point is to have talks as an obvious mechanism of cooperation among the state's supreme agencies. If the talks were to be just about filling one post, not a lot would be accomplished through them. So the point is whether these talks, which I consider absolutely necessary and that they should take place as soon as possible--if these talks are to make sense, they have to be in the form of some permanent practice of talking to each other, face-to-face, without television cameras. I mean talks among the state's supreme agencies and organs. Otherwise, we just have an isolated case and that is it. [Skowronski] What do people in Japan say about Polish issues? [Oleksy] There is a lot of interest in Polish issues in Japan. We were even quite amazed to see that is the case. The visit was very tiresome because of the climate and also because of certain rigid ways of thinking that continue to.... [Skowronski, interrupting] When you say climate, do you mean the weather? [Oleksy] Exactly. [Skowronski] What was the weather like in Tokyo? [Oleksy] It was terribly exhausting. [Skowronski] Was it worse than today's Warsaw weather? [Oleksy] It was better, from a temperature standpoint. But, as a parliamentary delegation, we were very much determined to make permanent Poland's presence, the knowledge of Poland, and the awareness of a need for good Polish-Japanese relations. This also applies to Japan's presence in Central Europe, including Poland. I mean its presence in terms of capital, investments, and the economy. At all levels, perhaps with the exception of my conversation with the Japanese emperor, both during the talk with outgoing Prime Minister Hosokawa and with the finance minister, the trade and industry minister, with the leadership of a fund for regional and international assistance that has the sum of $70 billion at its disposal, and also with the leadership of (EximBank), Japan's largest bank fostering foreign cooperation, we raised the issue of unblocking financial and credit relations with Japan, which, to our surprise, are accompanied by very rigid reservations by Japan, some of which are philosophical [words indistinct]. [Skowronski] What is the essence of this Japanese philosophy? [Oleksy] It goes back to the time of the reduction of our debts in the Paris Club. Japan thinks that, at the time, it was forced by a debtor to give up its claims. Apparently, under Japanese philosophy, once somebody fails to return a loan, he can never again expect to be offered beneficial terms of cooperation. We were told that bluntly. We tried to overcome that because it is a very important issue: Japanese, government-guaranteed credits are an absolute precondition for Japanese companies to enter the Polish market. It seems that their responses varied a great deal. In some cases, the responses were tough, but, in others, there was a lot of readiness to change the state of affairs. Two important meetings will take place in Warsaw in May: There will be a meeting by a Poland-Japan working group for new economic initiatives between the two countries, and a meeting of East-West foreign trade ministers, the so-called ministerial initiative.... [Skowronski, interrupting] So you mean you were partially successful in changing Poland's image.... [Oleksy, interrupting] I think we were definitely successful in creating the right atmosphere and in convincing some interlocutors...[Oleksy pauses] We talked with party chiefs, chiefs of parliamentary factions, the leadership of the House of Representatives--the upper chamber--and also with former Japanese prime ministers and former foreign ministers. [Skowronski] What was the meeting with the emperor like? [Oleksy] It was very exotic to me because it was my first conversation with him. [Skowronski] What kind of protocol was there? [Oleksy] It was very complicated. We were taught various gestures and moves, but that is a usual thing. Let me remind you that, at the end of Emperor Hirohito's term, the emperor of Japan was regarded as a god. So that has an impact on protocol, but I managed to deal with it. The conversation was very nice. The emperor turned out to love Chopin's music, he has read the novel Quo Vadis, he is sponsoring subsequent editions of works by [Polish author] Sienkiewicz in Japan, and he was very interested in a Polish-Japanese cultural center in Krakow, which will open in November under Andrzej Wajda's auspices, with a substantial Japanese contribution. We talked about cultural exchanges, about relations with Russia, relations in Central Europe. The scope of the emperor's interests was wider than I would be willing to admit before my visit there. [Skowronski] So you met with the emperor, and, recently, you also met with Boris Yeltsin. What happened during the other meeting, I mean the one with Boris Yeltsin? This is also something we have not discussed at the Radio Zet studio yet. [Oleksy] Well, this was a face-to-face conversation, so it also included issues I cannot publicize. I conveyed the conversation's results and what happened during it to President Walesa. [Skowronski] So you cannot share it with our listeners? [Oleksy, hesitating] Not everything. I can say that Boris Yeltsin [hesitating] does not see everything the same way we do, when it comes to Central Europe--and this is not about Partnership for Peace, on which Russian politicians presented their country's position to us in wide-ranging terms. Whereas, we kept saying our thing--in terms of Poland's persistent striving.... [Skowronski, interrupting] And what are the most important differences of views? [Oleksy] But Boris Yeltsin looks at Poland as a country that [hesitating], while severing its ties to the region in a definite manner, wants to be a member of an arrangement in which Boris Yeltsin does not believe. He called it an arrangement of old structures established for West Europe's security and convenience. There is a difference between us on that. By the way, there were many themes full of disappointment with the West, which also prove that Russia feels alone and surrounded. This is the blunt way it was put. But, as I said, these were incidental themes, kind of in the background of conversation. [Skowronski] Russia's position of being alone is one fact, and is Boris Yeltsin also alone in the Kremlin, as a politician? [Oleksy] I must say, I heard a lot before the meeting about the state of his health and about the weak shape he is in. I must say I had in front of me a man of absolutely superb health--of both psychological and physical strength--and also with an enormous determination to remain in power. Stories told by diplomats and politicians about what bad shape Yeltsin is in proved untrue. [Skowronski] What [hesitating] will happen in the Sejm this week? [Oleksy] This week, the Sejm's proceedings will be very intensive. The agenda has already been adopted by the Sejm Presidium. That happened before my trip. Two issues will be debated. As I said, I do not think that the Sejm deputies' constitutional initiative will be placed on the agenda, but that has to be decided at Wednesday's [20 April] session of the Sejm leadership. There is the issue of the popiwek, or neopopiwek [wage-control legislation], which was submitted also in the form of a Sejm deputies' initiative, and it does not come from the government. So that defines the initiative's essence from the standpoint of time requirements.... [Skowronski, interrupting] It will take longer? [Oleksy] Yes, it will, and consequently.... [Skowronski, interrupting] But do we need the popiwek at all? [Oleksy] There are different [words indistinct] on that. Myself, I do not express my view because I prefer to base what I say on the opinions of professional experts, who deal with calculations and forecasts, rather than on the easy-sounding views of politicians. This is what I want to base it on. But first of all, there is no government initiative; instead, there is one coming from Sejm deputies. This changes the proceedings and intensity of the measures. It is happening on a very immediate basis. There is also a whole range of issues on the agenda. The session will last two days, and I doubt that [words indistinct]. [Skowronski] Will you try to alleviate the conflict between the coalition and the president? [Oleksy] That depends on the will of both parties. I am ready, and this is the way I see my role in the state, but, if the parties do not want that, I have no intention of imposing myself on them. [Skowronski] Who will it be harder to convince, Aleksander Kwasniewski or Lech Walesa? [Oleksy] One does not have to convince Aleksander Kwasniewski to do anything because he is a politician with a big picture of the totality of the political situation.... [Skowronski, interrupting] What about Lech Walesa? [Oleksy, hesitating] I think he probably also does that, but, in his case, he is more stubborn sometimes than.... [Skowronski] And what about Aleksander Kwasniewski? [Oleksy] I think he is less stubborn and more flexible. [Skowronski, laughing] So you are kind of a party to the conflict because you think Aleksander Kwasniewski's stubbornness is smaller? [Oleksy] It is not smaller. It is just that it is easier to make him flexible, but this is just for the purposes of a radio interview, and, currently, I play no role in the conflict. [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation. Radio Zet's guest today has been Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy.
