A memorandum of understanding [three preceding words in English] was signed in Jakarta on 22 November by Forestry Minister Jamaludin Surjahadikusumo and Australian Ambassador to Indoensia Allan R. Taylor. The Australian ambassador clarified that the effort was undertaken as part of the Australian community's responsibility in connection with environmental problems. The Australian Government believes that its cooperation with Indonesia will bring about mutual benefit. Mr. Taylor admitted that this is the first time that Australia has participated in any of the forestry projects. Besides, East Nusatenggara is not a new region because prior to this Australia had participated in several other projects such as the Joint District Development project which concluded in March 1992. The Noelmina DAS project was selected because the region is one of the 39 DAS projects which the Forestry Department considers the most prone to land erosion. In his statement, Forestry Minister Jamaludin clarified that the government has five objectives to achieve in carrying out the DAS projects. The first is to maintain a balanced hydrology condition in an effort to minimize forest degradation, prevent land erosion, destruction of land, and floods. The second objective is to increase land productivity, while the third is to create more public awareness about the importance of forests, land, and water pollution. The government's fourth objective is to increase the central and provincial government's capability of managing natural resources. The fifth objective is to increase the local community's living standards.
