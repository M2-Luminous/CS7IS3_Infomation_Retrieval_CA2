FR940920-2-00066 FR940920-2-00027 I. Best Management Practice Plan Requirement It is national policy that, whenever feasible, pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source, that pollution which cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner, and that disposal or release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner (Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 13101). Section 402(a)(1) authorizes EPA to include miscellaneous requirements in permits on a case-by-case basis which are deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act. Best Management Practices (BMPs), in addition to numerical effluent limitations, are required to control or abate the discharge of pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(k). Pursuant to Section 402(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act and Region 10 policy (EPA Region 10, 1992), development and implementation of a Best Management Practices Plan is included as a condition of this NPDES general permit. The proposed general permit requires the development and implementation of a BMP Plan which prevents or minimizes the generation of pollutants, their release, and/or potential release from the facility to the waters of the United States through normal operations and ancillary activities. Relevant operations and activities include material storage areas, site runoff, storm water, in-plant transfer, process and material handling areas, loading or unloading operations, spillage or leaks, sludge and waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage. In addition to developing and implementing the BMP Plan, the operator is also required to certify that the BMP Plan is complete, on-site, and available upon request (see Part II.F.1. of the permit). Certification is required no later than submission of their written notice of intent to commence discharge (see Part I.C. of the permit). These certification requirements are similar to the requirements for a mud plan. The BMP Plan must be amended whenever there is a change in the facility or in the operation of the facility which materially increases the potential for an increased discharge of pollutants. The BMP Plan will become an enforceable condition of the permit; a violation of the BMP Plan is a violation of the permit. VI. Other Legal Requirements A. Oil Spill Requirements Section 311 of the Act prohibits the discharge of oil and hazardous materials in harmful quantities. Routine discharges specifically controlled by the permit are excluded from the provisions of Section 311. However, this permit does not preclude the institution of legal action or relieve permittees from any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties for other, unauthorized discharges of oil and hazardous materials which are covered by Section 311 of the Act. B. Endangered Species Act The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allocates authority to and administers requirements upon Federal agencies regarding endangered species of fish, wildlife, or plants and habitat of such species that have been designated as critical. Its implementing regulations (50 CFR Part 402) require EPA to ensure, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, that any action authorized, funded or carried out by EPA is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or adversely affect its critical habitat. [40 CFR 122.49(c)]. In compliance with Section 7 of the ESA, an endangered species list was requested by EPA and received from both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the affected area. The following threatened, endangered and/or candidate species are reported to potentially occur in the vicinity of the discharges associated with oil and gas operations proposed by the permit: arctic peregrine falcon, spectacled eider, stellars eider, and bowhead whale. A draft biological evaluation was prepared by Tetra Tech under contract to EPA to determine whether the discharges authorized by this proposed general permit are likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species or its critical habitat (Tetra Tech, 1994b). Based upon the available information, it is not expected that the exploratory oil and gas permitted discharges and related activities will not adversely affect any of the listed species or their habitat. EPA has informally consulted with the USFWS and the NMFS pursuant to Section 7 consultation of the Endangered Species Act. The EPA shared the draft biological evaluation with USFWS at their request. Comments raised by the USFWS have been addressed. EPA has forwarded the revised document to both Services for their review. EPA will consider the Services' comments in developing the final permit. C. Coastal Zone Management Act EPA has determined that the activities authorized by this general permit are consistent with local and state Coastal Management Plans. The proposed permit and consistency determination will be submitted to the State of Alaska for state interagency review at the time of public notice. The requirements for State Coastal Zone Management Review and approval must be satisfied before the general permit may be issued. D. Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act No marine sanctuaries as designated by this Act exist in the vicinity of the permit areas.
