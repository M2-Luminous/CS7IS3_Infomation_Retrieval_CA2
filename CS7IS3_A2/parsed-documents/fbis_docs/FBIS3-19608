It can even be said that it is stronger than it was last year. This also indicates that, despite the current difficulties, the French have the feeling that the majority and the government are doing everything they can to get the country on its feet again. It is difficult, more difficult than you can imagine, but we are very encouraged by this result. You all said that this would be a test -- I did not, you did -- well the test is here and I have the feeling that [the results have been] rather favorable for us.
