That is why we deem it important to reiterate our profound commitment to assist in building in solidarity a multiparty, humanitarian, and developed Guatemala. This objective, however, will not be possible if we do not decentralize wealth and political power and simultaneously reconvert military doctrines at the domestic level. These are the basic principles on which we can build a new Guatemala and create conditions to achieve a new way for Guatemalans. At the international level, it requires the awareness that Guatemala must obtain the necessary unconditional support to create a true peace process, respecting our right to find a possible and realistic model for the country. We cannot survive on good intentions alone. Only facts serve as the guidelines to consolidate the present and view the future. By the same token, the relatives of missing persons today demand the willingness to engage in dialogue and peace negotiations. We must not create sterile expectations that do not materialize and heighten the people's frustration, leading only to acceptance and silence. We recognize, however, that 10 years later new spaces have been opened which can permit civilian society to play a predominant role. This demands that we cast aside traditional and backward positions that attempt to throw the country backwards at every level. Also, the civilian society must assume its responsibility with seriousness and obviate outmoded ideas, which would have us believe that order and security imply authoritarianism and the return of those who years ago harmed us a lot. It is also important to assess 10 years of struggle in which our organization should have readapted to the moment, without losing sight of its principles. Of course, the GAM views with good eyes the rapprochement with diverse sectors of civil society, which are not necessarily included within the context of the popular and labor movement. Currently there is a renewed form of thinking, which makes us believe that a common front of all sectors, including political parties, may exist in the immediate future to allow us to find solutions of consensus. We believe there is a moral force that obliges us to discuss significant topics. That does not imply that we fail to recognize that new forms of terrorism persist, seeking to destroy our small achievements, that perhaps we will have to face a new escalation of violence that will possibly claim many lives and intimidate others. We are aware of the historic moment we are living in Guatemala, and we assume it with responsibility.
