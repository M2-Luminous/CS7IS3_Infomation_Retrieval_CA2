This is the first trip ever made by a top Chinese leader to these neighbouring nations. Owing to the historical Silk Road, friendly relations have long existed between China and the Central Asian countries. Mongolia and China have long enjoyed good relations. And after the establishment of diplomatic relations in the last few years, ties between China and the four Central Asian countries have been expanding rapidly. The leaders of these five countries have all been to China in the last few years for visits which promoted mutual understanding and strengthened cooperation. Premier Li's return visit to these five nations is not meant only as a friendly gesture. It represents China's genuine desire to further develop mutually beneficial relations with its neighbouring states. In Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital, Li made a candid, sincere and comprehensive policy statement on China's relations with the Central Asian countries. And Li's speech was repeatedly punctuated by applause. The applause was especially strong when he said, "We cherish goodwill and friendly sentiment towards the people of Central Asian countries. We will always be your good friend and neighbour." When Li arrived in Kyrgyzstan, on the third leg of his tour,President Askar Akayev said Li's warm words in Tashkent had in the space of a few days become household words in the Central Asian nations. This shows that Li's statement reflected a common wish of all the people in the region and as a result his words touched their hearts. China and its neighbours in the northwest are developing nations who need a peaceful and stable domestic and international environment to develop their economies. And the friendship advocated by Li, constitutes the best guarantee for such an environment. Trade and economic cooperation between China and its northwestern neighbours have made much progress in recent years. However, there is still great potential for further development. Exchanges in the past have shown that the economies are complementary. And closer cooperation in economic matters will be to the advantage of all parties. Li was accompanied on his tour by a group of Chinese entrepreneurs. And on each leg of the premier's tour, these businessmen held talks with their counterparts and struck many deals. This was an effective way of speeding up economic cooperation. Li also discussed other projects with his hosts. The building of the Turkmenistan-China-Japan gas pipeline is just one example. Li's trip has deepened understanding and promoted goodwill with the five northwestern nations and has created conditions for further economic cooperation and cultural exchange. And it is expected that the new Silk Road will bring greater prosperity China and our northwest neighbours in the future.
