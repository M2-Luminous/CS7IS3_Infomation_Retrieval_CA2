A senior official at the National Unification Board (NUB) said, "inter-Korean trade is naturally recognized as an 'internal transaction' according to the basic agreement between South and North Korea concluded in early 1992 as well as to the United Nations Charter and the GATT regulations, both of which admit the self-determination rights of a divided country." The government will send its final implementation plan to the gatt on Feb. 15, but the issue of inter-Korean trade will not be included, according to the official. The clarification of NUB's position on inter-Korean trade came after Kyongsillyon, the Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ), recently announced that inter-Korean trade should be recognized as an internal affair just as that of West and East Germany had formerly been.
