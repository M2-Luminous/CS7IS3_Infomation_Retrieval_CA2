FBIS4-60491 "drnes101_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-101 Daily Report 21 May 1994 SYRIA Khaddam `Not Optimistic' on Talks with Israel Khaddam `Not Optimistic' on Talks with Israel PM2405105394 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 21 May 94 p 5 PM2405105394 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Wants To Reach Understanding on Everything with Israelis Before Signing Peace Agreement"] [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had hardly started to get ready to return to Washington at the end of his Middle East tour, which involved diplomatic efforts between Damascus and Tel Aviv, when Syria announced that the Israeli proposals conveyed by Christopher to President Hafiz al-Asad had not helped to achieve progress toward peace, because they did not contain a fundamental change in the Israeli position. And that the differences are still "wide" over the peaceful solution method. [passage omitted] Christopher's visit has revealed that the axes of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations are: withdrawal, security, and relations. And that with regard to the first axis the negotiations focus on the depth of the withdrawal, its duration, and its stages. With regard to the second axis, the two sides discuss security arrangements, their locations, their technologies, and deployment of the two sides' armed forces. As for the third axis, it concerns measures to build trust and relations between the two sides after the full withdrawal from the Golan, and the linkage between relations and the withdrawal question and the coincidence between them. While Israeli sources point to Syria's agreement to conduct a phased withdrawal over three years and to establish direct relations with Israel -- but Syria still has not agreed to the question of opening an Israeli embassy -- [Syrian] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam stresses the Syrians' rejection of a phased withdrawal, saying that Syria demands a "quick Israeli withdrawal from the Golan completed in a reasonable time," without Syrian officials' involvement in determining the period, leaving this to "the time Israeli forces need to conduct the logistic withdrawal process," otherwise the conflict between the two sides would remain, "and let it continue for 500 years" between Syria and Israel. Well-informed sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said "Israel did not occupy the Golan in stages. The Golan is 15 km wide (the front from north to south), so why phased withdrawal now." The sources, which attended Khaddam's meeting with a U.S. delegation during Christopher's presence in Damascus, said that Syria rejects a phased withdrawal. And that the vice president was not optimistic about achieving important progress in negotiations. "We cannot talk about optimism" as long as Israel is not committed to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the 4 June 1967 borders. This means Syria's rejection of any Israeli demand for "minor alterations" to the borders involving incomplete withdrawal. As for the security question, a high-ranking Syrian official stressed to AL-HAYAH that [security arrangements] should be "equal" on both sides of the border. He also stressed Syria's refusal to make security arrangements on the Syrian side different from those on the Israeli side, especially as Syria believes that, if arrangements are not equal, they should be at the expense of the Israelis, who "are the occupying party and the aggressor." This is in addition to deploying international forces (U.S. and Russian), as President Boris Yeltsin announced his country's willingness to respond to this request in more than one message conveyed to President al-Asad. [passage omitted] The sources told AL-HAYAH that Khaddam said: "Israel wants both land and peace, and the two conflict with one another. And no peace can be achieved without full withdrawal." The Syrian vice president believes that any agreement not based on justice and right "will not last long, and the principles of justice prompt that all the Golan Heights return to Syria." Khaddam was asked: "Do you believe that we could see the picture of an Israeli family under the flag of an Israeli embassy in Damascus?" He replied: "When Israel withdraws fully from the Golan and Yitzhaq Rabin announces his willingness to withdraw, he will hear the answer." [passage omitted]
