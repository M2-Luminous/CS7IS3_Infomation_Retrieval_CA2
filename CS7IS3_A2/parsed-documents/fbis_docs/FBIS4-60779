He said that this was a result of the fact that Ostankino owed a million litai (approx. 250,000 dollars). Programs will only be broadcast from 18:00 local time (19:00 Moscow time). As the debt question remains unresolved it is unclear how much longer even evening broadcasting will continue. The remaining time -- from 1:00 to 18:00 -- may well be leased to the Litpolinter private studio. As of next week, Niverauskas said, broadcast of the Mayak radio station will be suspended, also because of debt. It is suggested that relay stations now broadcasting Mayak lease their time to private radio companies.
