FBIS4-24571 "drchi105_a_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-105 Daily Report 29 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General World Bank Approves Loan for Yanzhou Thermal Power Plant World Bank Approves Loan for Yanzhou Thermal Power Plant OW2905152894 Beijing XINHUA in English 1454 GMT 29 May 94 OW2905152894 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- The World Bank recently approved a 350 million U.S. dollars loan for China in the construction of the Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant while providing a guarantee for the bank's extended Co-Financing Operations Program (ECO), also for the plant project. The ECO program agreement worth 120 million U.S. dollars was signed here today between China's Ministry of Finance and more than a dozen banks from six countries involved in the program. This is the first financing for China under the World Bank's ECO. The project is one of China's largest energy projects to date, and the financing also represents the first syndicated loan financing undertaken by the Ministry of Finance on the international market. Present at the signing ceremony were Chinese Premier Li Peng, Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli, Minister of Electricity Shi Dazhen and senior Jiangsu provincial officials. The Yangzhou Thermal Power Plant Project, about 100 km from Nanjing, the Jiangsu provincial capital, includes the construction of two 600-megawatt coal-fired generating units and ancillary facilities as well as two 30-km high-voltage transmitting lines. The whole project involves a total investment of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, of which 470 million U.S. dollars are coming from the World Bank and the ECO program. The remainder will come from domestic sources. The ECO financing consists of two parts: a 90 million U.S. syndicated loan facility involving 12 banks from six countries and a 30 million U.S. dollar-equivalent yen facility provided by four Japanese life insurance companies. Both facilities carry a 15-year final maturity and a 5-year grace period, with all principal repayment after 10 years fully guaranteed by the World Bank. An official from the finance ministry said the first syndicated ECO program extended the loan to 15 years from the earlier period of ten years. This, he noted, has opened a new channel for China to use more overseas capital, including financing from the World Bank.
