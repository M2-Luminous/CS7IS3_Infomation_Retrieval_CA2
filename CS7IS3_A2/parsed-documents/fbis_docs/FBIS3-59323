The party's resolution on history and other documents have summarized the principles, and further study is certainly needed on the details. As far as Mao Zedong's own thinking and understanding are concerned, the following two points should at least be given special attention. First, there were errors in assessment and a tendency toward rash advances in regard to China's effort to build socialism in terms of the historical starting point of the effort, the historical stage in which the effort was carried out, and the construction goals and speed involved in the effort. As discussed above, the understanding of socialism that the Communist Party of China, including Comrade Mao Zedong, had during the long period of struggle for democratic revolution was rather abstract, and it can be said that they were not fully prepared. One manifestation of such abstractness was that in regard to understanding Marxism, there was no sufficient understanding of the fact that Marx's discussions of socialism were based on temporal and historical conditions totally different from those in China; another manifestation was the practice of making Soviet experience and realities the only basis, despite the fact that Stalin had not resolved the issue of integrating Marxism with Russian realities either and that he had rushed things and disregarded the limits imposed by the historical stage, whether in declaring the establishment of socialism or in announcing the outlines of features of socialism (including making those later comments on the transition to communism). In the early years of the PRC, Mao Zedong was still rather cautious in his assessment of the process of socialist construction in China. Later, because of the expeditious achievement of socialist transformation and a lack of sober understanding of the masses' enthusiasm, his assessments of such things as the historical stage in which China was situated and the goals and speed of socialist construction became increasingly divorced from reality. In 1955, efforts to fight conservative tendencies were started, involving criticisms of "women with bound feet." The efforts started in the area of forming agricultural cooperatives, and then were extended to the economic spheres including the spheres of industrial and agricultural production, transportation, and capital construction as well as the scientific, educational, cultural and other spheres. It was demanded that there be persistent criticisms of right deviationist conservative views on the scale and speed of construction. In the period between the making of the speech, "On the Ten Major Relationships," and the Eighth CPC Congress, because of problems in actual economic construction and resistance from many in the party leadership, he gave approval to rather realistic plans and measures, but was never happy about the activity of "opposing rash advances." As discussed earlier, he made many creative breakthroughs on the issue of China's approach to socialist construction in view of the lessons of the Soviet Union, but he did not do one thing, that is, to criticize Stalin's simplistic summarizing of the process of socialist construction, the summarizing which had been done too early. On the contrary, he believed that China's approach to construction could lead to even faster development than achieved by the Soviet Union. At the 1957 Moscow conference, he and Khrushchev already had disputes between themselves, but they were basically in agreement on the situation and speed of the development of socialism, that is, believing that the east wind was prevailing over the west wind and that socialist economic development could soon lead to catching up with and surpassing the West. Hence the criticism of the activity of "opposing rash advances" in early 1958 and the "Great Leap Forward" later. The "Great Leap Forward" was a rash advance based on disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage in two aspects. The first was to propose struggle goals and development speed concerning economic development which were totally divorced from the realities in China, applying the phrase, "one day equals 20 years," used by Marx to describe the time of revolution to the development of economic construction, material production, and cultural undertakings. The second was the attempt to establish production and distribution relationships and to change the look of society completely according to the principles of communism with respect to the relations of production and even overall social development, disregarding the backwardness of China. This totally deviated from Marxism and was entirely divorced from the realities in China, becoming the root cause of all the errors on the issue of economic construction. Our country had previously been a large semicolonial, semifeudal country in the east, and was one era behind capitalist societies with ripe preconditions for socialist revolution and construction, in terms of the development levels of the economy and social relationships. Even the task of anti-imperialist, antifeudal democratic revolution which had involved the resolution of various social contradictions under ripe conditions had been completed only after long, tortuous, and hard struggle. In those years the insufficient understanding of the realities in China, of the historical stage in which China had been situated, and of the long-term and arduous nature of the revolution had resulted in the cause of revolution suffering great losses. Because of the absence of adequate economic conditions and social and cultural preconditions, the transition to socialism on the basis of the victory of democratic revolution and socialist construction would inevitably go through a series of transitional stages and an even longer and more arduous process of struggle, as Lenin said. People of each generation, Marx said, can only create their own history under the definite material conditions created by their predecessors; people, he also said, can only propose tasks for which historical conditions are ripe. That is, the development of the social productive forces and changes in the relations of production or in social relationships in general must all be based on definite conditions and laws. During the democratic revolution, Mao Zedong's understanding and handling of this issue was correct, and therefore he was able to lead the entire party and people in achieving victory step by step. However, after the victory of the democratic revolution, especially after the middle of the socialist transformation stage, he became increasingly unable to make sober assessments. "On the Ten Major Relationships" did contain some creative breakthroughs with respect to approaches to, and models of socialist construction, but still basically followed Stalin with respect to views on the historical stage of socialism or on criteria about socialist construction. As a result, under the theme of exploring China's approach to socialist construction lurked the danger of an even stronger tendency toward rash advances on the basis of disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage. Thus, at the time of the "Great Leap Forward," the series of correct policies and measures put forward in the period between "On the Ten Major Relationships" and the Eighth CPC Congress were completely changed. The "Great Leap Forward" was not only a manifestation of a simplistic and vulgarized understanding of socialism and communism, but also a manifestation of a lack of understanding of modern industrial society (that is, the entire stage of capitalism). It in fact reflected the mental state and limited horizon of the Chinese people who, living in a poor agricultural society, were anxious to change the existing state of affairs. This was exactly the reason why the "Great Leap Forward" was able to gather support from huge numbers of people in a short time and arouse tremendous, but very blind, enthusiasm. In this sense, Peng Dehuai hit home when he used the phrase, "petty bourgeois fanaticism," at the Lushan conference. As shown here, Mao Zedong's tragedy not only carried a personal flavor but also reflected characteristics of Chinese society. Second, he failed to achieve the transition from revolutionary movement (especially revolutionary war) to routine economic construction in respect to working methods, disregarding the laws of economics and one-sidedly emphasizing reliance on political mobilization and mass movement. The approach to socialist construction in China proposed in "On the Ten Major Relationships" represented breaking away from the Soviet Union's rigid model of construction (encompassing its development strategy and economic system); but there were more philosophical and political supporting arguments than economic supporting arguments. He did not take a position different from the Soviet model on a fundamental point, that is, the failure to regard the economic development of society as an objective process which would function according to its own laws irrespective of any human wills, and to understand that even the most advanced people and the strongest power would only be able to exercise guidance on the basis of the conditions they enjoyed, but could not make designs and plans at will as if building a house. In discussing the relationships among agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, he mainly discussed how to correctly adjust the distribution of investment in state plans; in discussing the relationships among the state, collectives, and individuals and between the center and the localities, he mainly discussed how the central state power should correctly demarcate various powers and correctly distribute benefits among groups. This was necessary, but in fact still represented the way of thinking characteristic of a highly centralized planned economic model as the Soviet Union had. He correctly emphasized that it was necessary to give great attention to agriculture and light industry, to pay attention to the interests of the localities, of various economic collectives, and of workers at large, and to arouse their enthusiasm. All this was basically in line with the objective demands of economic development. Such measures as delegating power and a series of "concurrent development" measures adopted for that reason were for the purpose of meeting those demands at the systems level (for instance, the effort to develop industry across the urban and rural areas nationwide through small-scale operations, the use of homegrown practices, and mass participation all failed together with the "Great Leap Forward," but gave the peasants some preliminary education on spreading industrialization; thus the effort had a historical link to the widespread development of township enterprises today). These represented fundamental differences with the Soviet system. However, on the whole, he was less inclined to consider analyzing things on the basis of economic conditions and the laws of economics and to exercise regulation and guidance through manipulating the economic system and economic policy. He was more inclined to rely on political mobilization and mass movement. Especially, later on, because of the abovementioned assessments involving the disregarding of the limits imposed by the historical stage and the development demands which contributed to rash advances, he disregarded objective economic laws to an increasing extent, and one-sidedly emphasized stimulating people's subjective initiative through political mobilization; he even promoted the "Great Leap Forward" coercively through applying the pressures of political criticism and mass movement. Aside from disregarding the law that the social productive forces should be developed gradually under the given material conditions and that the relations of production should suit the level and state of the productive forces, the most concentrated manifestation of the so-called disregarding of economic laws in the actual process was the disregarding of the law of value, the basic law of the commodity economy. For, under the condition of low level productive forces in China, whatever form the relations of production take, people inevitably demand the use of the principle of equal exchange to govern the exchange of labor with other people or society, and do not tolerate the uncompensated appropriation of their labor. The distorted public ownership system and egalitarian distribution based on disregarding the limits imposed by the historical stage in existence at that time inevitably inhibited or even hurt the display of workers' enthusiasm and the development of the productive forces; and political agitation, however forceful, could only achieve temporary effects. Because of such a state of affairs, the economic system and policy of that time were often in contradiction and conflict with the demands of the law of value and the wishes of workers; and Mao Zedong held wavering and contradictory views of the law of value, sometimes accepting the idea and sometimes rejecting the idea. Mao Zedong made a series of contradictory statements on the law of value, but fundamentally he disregarded or even rejected the idea. During the high tide of the "Great Leap Forward" he expressed approval to the effort to oppose bourgeois rights, and gave approval to many practices such as levelling, transferring, and egalitarianism. However, after he discovered that such practices had caused many difficulties in, and harm to economic life, and that Chen Boda and others were advocating the abolition of commodity production, he repeatedly stressed the roles of commodity production and the law of value. He criticized Stalin for setting the state and collective peasants against each other and for not daring to put means of production in the category of commodities, thereby being more advanced than Stalin; but he also criticized Stalin for talking about only economic relationships and material interests, but not making politics the commanding matter, and for failing to promote communist elements, thereby going one step backward from Stalin. He understood Stalin's contradictory state of mind, saying that Stalin had had 30 years of experience, but had not found the way out and that as could been seen he (Stalin) had been dejected. In fact Mao Zedong was also very dejected in relation to this issue. On the one hand he said that there was no need to fear that the negative effects of commodity economy and the law of value would lead to the appearance of the ghost of capitalism, but in fact he feared this ghost of capitalism greatly and thus tried every means to suppress it, giving increasing emphasis to relying on the practice of making politics the commanding matter and on mass movement. All this made it impossible to adopt the approach of applying the law of value in the form of using multiple economic forms and measures to arouse the masses' enthusiasm for production so as to promote the development of the productive forces, and eliminated various possibilities of reforming the economic system on the basis of proceeding from realities. Here we are only discussing how and why Mao Zedong turned from making creative breakthroughs into suffering tragic failures on the issue of China's approach to socialist construction, but are by no means arguing that there were no people with sober understandings of those issues within Chinese society and the CPC as well as its leadership. Whether among the cadres, masses, and intellectuals at large or within the party's leadership teams at various levels, there were many people who had rather sober understandings of the realities in China and the historical stage in which China was situated, and who put forward rather realistic views on the goals and speed of China's economic development and on the balances that should be kept, believing that various impure economic forms should be tolerated under China's socialist economic system. Such correct views and ideas were also the reasons why Mao Zedong could outline a correct approach to construction when making the speech, "On the Ten Major Relationships," in 1956, and why the Eighth CPC Congress was able to make correct decisions. For, at that time, inner-party democracy and the system of collective leadership were still in rather good shape; various ideas could all be put forward to be discussed so that they might complement each other. Nevertheless, after the start of the "Great Leap Forward" in 1958, people became more or less hotheaded; in addition, Mao Zedong severely criticized the activity of "opposing rash advances," and refused to listen to dissenting views, resulting in initial damages to inner-party democracy and the practice of collective leadership. This was an important reason. During and after the 1959 Lushan conference, inner-party democracy and the practice of collective leadership were thoroughly destroyed. Any discussions of, or debates over, different views on economic construction became political struggles; as a result, there emerged autocratic and arbitrary decision making on important issues, and checking and balancing forces disappeared. All this further deepened Mao Zedong's tragedy. It can be said that "On the Ten Major Relationships" and the Eighth CPC Congress were the crystallization of collective wisdom, and that the "Great Leap Forward" and the Lushan conference were the disastrous results of rejecting democracy and the practice of collective leadership. This is material covered by our next two topics. [15 Nov 93 pp 9-12] [Text] Part III--The Second Breakthrough and Tragedy: Concerning Contradictions Among the People and the "Policy of Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and Letting a Hundred Schools Contend" Socialism is not only an economic system. Socialism is a social system encompassing economic, political, cultural, and other systems and policies. Its central task is to promote the sustained and rapid growth of the productive forces. At the same time, it should also enhance the comprehensive construction of social relationships, enhance the construction of such things as democratic politics and spiritual civilization so as to ensure the healthy development of economic construction, improve the entire people's material and cultural standards of living, and promote comprehensive social progress. Thus, while exploring the approach to socialist construction in China, Mao Zedong also conducted bold explorations regarding the development of social relationships and the construction of democratic politics and science and culture under the conditions of socialism in China, and made creative breakthroughs. After leading the Chinese people in overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Communist Party of China established the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship which was led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Relying on this state power, it extensively transformed social and economic relationships, and carried out economic and cultural construction in a comprehensive manner. During this process, it created many things, with the people's democratic dictatorship being just a creation based on integrating the Marxist theory of proletarian dictatorship with the concrete realities in China; and it also followed and referred to Soviet experience in many areas. In 1956 and 1957 new situations and changes occurred at home and in the international environment, thereby prompting Mao Zedong to also think about new approaches to handling society, politics, science and education, and cultural construction. The first was the change in the domestic situation. By 1956, through a series of social transformation movements, not only had such remaining tasks of democratic revolution as land reform, suppressing counterrevolutionaries, and restoring the economy been completed, but with regard to the economic system, the socialist transformation of the relations of production, mainly the ownership system, had also been completed. Because of six or seven consecutive years of social transformation movements involving all the people, the social structure had undergone tremendous changes. The exploiting classes either had been basically eliminated as classes (the feudal landlord class and compradore bourgeoisie) or were in the process of being eliminated (the national bourgeoisie); workers, peasants, and intellectuals at large had been emancipated both politically and economically; the productive forces of society had been liberated; the state power of the people's democracy had been consolidated; and China had achieved such national unity, solidarity among the people, and social stability as had not been seen for over 100 years. This indicated that the many years of large scale and tempestuous class struggle between antagonistic classes had basically ended, and that class struggle was no longer the main contradiction in our society. At the same time, because the task of social transformation had not been entirely accomplished, because the old society had left behind various things still producing influences, and especially because China had a large population and was backward economically and culturally, various nonantagonistic contradictions among the people not only existed and emerged in large quantities, but had become even more prominent under the new situation. At that time there were such problems as the problem of different views on the campaign to eliminate counterrevolutionaries, land reform, and the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, the problem of different assessments of intellectuals' thought reform, the problem of attitude toward agricultural cooperatives, the problems of students' enrolling in schools of higher levels and the placement of graduates, the problem of workers' wages and benefits, the problem of differences in the lives of workers and peasants, and the problem of party and government workers' growing tendency to seek personal fame and interests, being divorced from the masses, and committing the mistake of having a bureaucratic way of doing things. In serious cases, there were such manifestations as peasants' withdrawing from cooperatives, workers' strikes, and students' strikes; many places saw marches, demonstrations, and "disturbances," and the democratic parties and nonparty figures had also expressed various views. All those problems manifested themselves directly or indirectly in the form of contradictions between the leader and the led, that is, contradictions between the ruling Communist Party and its cadres on the one hand and the masses of the people of all sectors and strata who were being led on the other. Such a situation shattered people's previously held simplistic understanding of socialism--the naive illusions based on a belief that all difficulties would be resolved as soon as the social system was changed and that socialist society would be an ideal realm with no contradictions, thereby confronting people with the question of how to understand the new situations and state of affairs. The contradictions discussed above were mostly contradictions about economic interests of various groups of people amidst social change. At the same time such social changes and changes in interest relationships also manifested themselves in people's thinking and ideology, mainly in the form of different views held by young students, intellectuals, party member cadres, and nonparty figures on various theoretical and practical issues; such different views in turn manifested themselves in the form of differences, discussions, and debates concerning political views, academic views, and artistic styles in the scientific, educational, and cultural spheres. The second was the impact of the international environment, mainly the impact of the changes in the Soviet Union. The 20th CPSU Congress revealed a great deal of problems in the history of several decades of proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union. Firstly, there had been abnormal phenomena in inner-party and social struggles, highly developed practices of personality cult and autocratic and arbitrary rule, cruel factional fighting, and the excessive expansion of the campaign to eliminate counterrevolutionaries; secondly, there had been ideological and theoretical dogmatism, arbitrary decisionmaking in, and the dogmatic control of the scientific, cultural, art, and other ideological spheres, and the practice of using administrative or even dictatorial means to suppress debates among different views and to inhibit the expression of different schools and styles. All those policies and measures had been adopted under the cover of the pseudo theoretical principles that in socialist society the relations of production had been in "complete congruence" with the productive forces and that the "political and moral unanimity" of Soviet society had been the motive force for social development. While the words of congruence and unanimity had been used publicly in an extensive way and while the idea that society had been full of contradictions, mostly among the people, under the new situation of socialism had been rejected, in practice very crude methods had been used to resolve those contradictions. As a result, various social contradictions had become ever more serious and numerous, and exploded in a powerful manner at the opportunity provided by the vigorous effort to expose Stalin at the 20th CPSU Congress. In addition, there were contradictions among the people as well as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, contradictions within and between the Soviet Union and East European countries, internal contradictions in those countries, and the impact of Western countries' infiltration efforts. All those things stimulated and promoted each other, resulting in very chaotic, complex, and tempestuous situations. The concentrated manifestations were the Polish and Hungarian incidents in 1956. Previously it had been believed that there had been no contradictions, and then all kinds of contradictions exploded together; consequently, many people in socialist countries, including many leaders of Communist parties, were stupefied and at a loss what to do. This showed that people still lacked an understanding of the new social system, socialism, and that especially in the Soviet Union Stalin's metaphysics still had profound influence. At the same time, it also reminded and prompted the Chinese Communists, first of all Mao Zedong, who had just won the victory of socialist transformation, to think about the relevant issues in a profound manner. How to understand the new domestic situation after the establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary manner, how to summarize the experience and lessons of the Soviet Union accumulated over several decades, and how to analyze the various international and domestic currents of thought after the 20th CPSU Congress were issues about which Mao Zedong thought repeatedly in 1956-1957. The overall theme of those issues was the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship, and the basic line of thought was to rely on and mobilize the force of the masses of the people, to enhance the construction of socialist democracy in the political, social, cultural, and other spheres, and to consolidate the state power of the people's democracy led by the working class, so as to promote the development of socialist economic construction. In this process, through mutual enlightening among, and repeated considerations by leaders of the party, Mao Zedong gradually formed two important ideas: The double-hundred policy and contradictions among the people. This issue and the issue of China's approach to socialist construction were considered almost at the same time. When delivering the speech, "On the Ten Major Relationships," Mao Zedong also expressed many thoughts on political, social, ideological, cultural, and other issues, in addition to issues relating to economic construction. The many discussions of the relationship between revolution and counterrevolution, the relationship between right and wrong, and the relationship between the party and those outside the party as well as the discussions of learning from all nationalities and countries and of the need to adopt an analytical attitude toward the Soviet experience and Stalin's mistakes conducted under the topic of the relationship between China and foreign countries all involved the double-hundred policy and the issue of contradictions among the people. Although no clear and concise principles had been worked out, it could be seen that those important ideas were in the process of being considered and formed. When the center discussed "On the Ten Major Relationships," Mao Zedong proposed that "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools contend" be made our policy. Not only was this policy put forward, but lively explanations of the policy were also made in view of the state of affairs in the academic and cultural communities, especially in view of the impact of dogmatic Soviet practices in our country. Also, the policy was expounded systematically through the article by Lu Dingyi, director of the CPC Central Propaganda Department. In view of the mistakes of "Left" dogmatism which suppressed the freedom of thought in the scientific and cultural spheres, the idea of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools contend" advocated the freedom of independent thinking, the freedom of debate, the freedoms of creation and criticism, and the freedoms to express one's own views and to hold on to and maintain one's own views, and so on. Thus, as soon as it was proposed, it was inevitably linked inseparably to the concept of contradictions among the people and to the idea of differentiating between two types of contradictions. Whether at that time or at present, people should not expect a proletarian statesman to allow absolute freedom for all without any distinctions and limitations. We ourselves and the enemy must be clearly differentiated from each other politically, and there must be freedom among the people; this proposition should be the inevitable conclusion. In the second half of 1956, the Polish and Hungarian incidents took place in succession; such complex situations occurring under the socialist system prompted Mao Zedong to give more attention to the issues of contradictions among the people and of differentiating between the two types of contradictions. His "Letter to Huang Yanpei," and the article "More on the Historical Experience of Proletarian Dictatorship," written under his guidance, both clearly put forward the concept of contradictions among the people, asserting the need to clearly differentiate between the nature of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and the nature of contradictions among the people as well as the need to use different methods to resolve the different contradictions. In February 1957, Mao Zedong made the important speech, "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," at the Supreme Conference on State Affairs, systematically expounding a series of theoretical and policy issues concerning contradictions among the people and the differentiation between the two types of social contradictions, while putting the "double-hundred policy" in the category of things involving the correct handling of contradictions among the people. As should be pointed out, despite the serious mistakes and detours later in the process of implementation, the putting forward of the two ideas of the "double-hundred policy" and of contradictions among the people has had long-term significance to shattering the traditional rigid understanding of socialist society and to the establishment of scientific theory and guiding policy based on realities with regard to the issue of how the political, ideological, and cultural spheres should promote socialist construction. There has been a great deal of summarizing and expounding of the ideas of the double-hundred policy and contradictions among the people proposed by Mao Zedong. As far as the scientific understanding of socialist society is concerned, as least the following several points are creative and of strategic significance. First, the concept of contradictions among the people and the correct handling of contradictions among the people have become the main themes of political life in the country. Mao Zedong said that contradictions among the people were not a new issue, but had been given less attention than now because of the acuteness of the struggle between ourselves and the enemy in the past. He based his views on historical development, changes in the situation, and the Marxist principle that the cause of the proletariat must rely on the broad masses of the people and must practice democracy. Actually the putting forward of this concept represented a new understanding of socialist society and further development of the theory of proletarian dictatorship (assuming the form of the people's democratic dictatorship in our country). On the one hand, he not only analyzed the various manifestations of contradictions among the people after the establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary manner in our country, but also made analyses based on principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism; that is, the law of the unity of opposites and principles on basic contradictions in society, to support the argument about the root cause of the inevitably prolonged existence of such nonantagonistic contradictions among the people, thereby revealing the fundamental method for observing socialism (and even communism in the future). On the other hand, he further developed the ideas contained in the article, "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," that is, holding that the people's democratic dictatorship was the combination of democracy for the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries; especially, drawing on lessons of the Soviet Union, he emphasized that practicing democracy for the people had become an increasingly widespread and prominent problem confronting the people's democratic dictatorship, and the main theme of the country's political life. This idea and another very important idea emerged and were formed at the same time. That is, after the establishment of the socialist system in a preliminary way, our country faced the transitions from class struggle to the struggle against nature, from revolution to construction, and from the revolutions in the past to technological and cultural revolutions. Since class struggle was no longer the main contradiction and since economic construction had become the focus of the party's and the state's work, functions relating to democracy, such as using democratic means to resolve various contradictions among the people as well as unifying the people's interest and will, consolidating the unity among the people and the unity of the country, and arousing the entire people's enthusiasm for working hard to build socialism through the system of democratic centralism had naturally become the main functions of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship. The second concerned the method for correctly handling contradictions among the people, the method of unity-criticism-unity. This was the natural extension of the preceding issue. As the nature of contradictions among the people and the nature of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy were different, the methods of handling were also different. In the process of exercising leadership over revolutionary wars and revolutionary base areas, the Communist Party of China not only accumulated rich experience with respect to the struggle against the enemy, but also accumulated rich experience with respect to the handling of inner-party contradictions, internal contradictions within the revolutionary army and ranks, and contradictions between groups of people in the base areas, thereby producing the method of unity-criticism-unity. After the nationwide victory, the use of the method had been spread across society so as to handle contradictions among the people at large. After putting forward the concept of contradictions among the people, Mao Zedong systematically summarized and explained the method in view of the new situations and experience (including foreign experience and lessons). The third concerned the "double-hundred policy" in the ideological and cultural spheres. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and letting a hundred schools contend" was proposed earlier than the issue of contradictions among the people was raised, and was later included in the general subject of correctly handling contradictions among the people, becoming an important component of the subject. Specifically, this policy advocated letting a hundred flowers bloom in the sphere of arts and letting a hundred schools contend in the scientific sphere, and was a policy of promoting socialist scientific and cultural prosperity. But its significance was more extensive and profound, involving the issue of how the ruling Communist Party should give play to Marxism's guiding role so as to exercise leadership over the ideological sphere and even involving the issue of what methods the Communist Party should use to lead the country. This policy included allowing and guaranteeing ideological and political freedoms and rights enjoyed by the people at large, advocating independent thinking, free expression, the freedoms to engage in scientific, literary, and artistic creation and in criticism, discussion, and debate. Thus, people could pursue the truth and develop science and culture amid contending and competition, thereby continuously forming ideological unity based on socialist and Marxist principles. This policy also included the adoption of the method of developing Marxism, defeating erroneous things, and overcoming the impact of various erroneous and reactionary ideas on the people through comparisons, competitions, and struggles between the true, good, and beautiful and the false, evil, and ugly as well as through discussion, criticism, and reasoning. This policy was different from Stalin's crude dogmatic policy, practiced in the Soviet Union, of exercising ideological and political control through administrative coercive means. That method not only could not improve and unify the people's thinking, but would also inevitably lead to the gradual loss of the right over leadership amid the superficial strengthening of control; as a result, hidden behind the facade of formal unanimity would be markets where various fallacious ideas would spread. Thus, Mao Zedong believed that the "double-hundred policy" should be a fundamental as well as long-term policy, but not a temporary policy. He reduced the issue of whether to adhere to the "double-hundred policy" to the issue of whether to have "loosening" or "tightening." He said that there could be two different methods, or policies, for leading our country, that is, loosening and tightening. One of the two policies, loosening and tightening, must be selected. We adopted the policy of loosening because that was a policy conducive to the consolidation and cultural development of our country. Of course, compared with the past situation in the Soviet Union when the crude and simplistic method was used, the use of the policy of loosening would make it more difficult and complicated to exercise the leadership of the Communist Party, to carry out guidance based on Marxism, and to manage the state, but would be an effective way to resolve contradictions and enhance leadership. The fourth concerned the matter of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. This policy was proposed, under the new situation, to handle the relationships between the parties formed in the history of our country. This policy was also put forward earlier than the idea of contradictions among the people, and can be said to have represented an important aspect of the process of considering and forming the concept of contradictions among the people. For, the relationships between the Communist Party of China and the democratic parties as well as the relationships between the different classes and strata that they represented respectively were all in the category of things involving contradictions among the people. In 1956, after the basic completion of socialist transformation, there occurred the issue of whether there should be the continued existence of the many democratic parties which, formed during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and composed of mainly members of the national bourgeoisie and intellectuals of the national bourgeoisie, had cooperated with the CPC for a long time. At that moment, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." In "On the Ten Major Relationships," he said: Is it better to have one party or several parties? It now seems that it is better to have several parties. Not only was such the case in the past, but such can also be the case in the future, that is, long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. In the 1957 speech on contradictions among the people, he further explained that like a person a party needed to hear different opinions. In addition to accepting the supervision by the working people and the masses of party members on the basis of considering those people to be the main source of supervision, the Communist Party of China, as the leadership force of our country, should also be supervised by the democratic parties. Of course, such supervision should be mutual supervision, that is, that parties should make suggestions to each other and criticize each other and should use the method of combining unity and struggle, the method of unity-criticism-unity, to resolve contradictions between them, so as to achieve unity based on socialism and to arouse enthusiasm on the part of all sectors, thereby serving socialism. The putting forward of this policy marked the beginning of the forming of a party system with Chinese characteristics. This policy was also different from the Soviet Union's policy, and has been proven to be better for the party, the people, and socialism in later years. The final, and also the most important point concerned the goals and ideas with regard to the political scene in socialist society. In proposing such theories and policies as those concerning contradictions among the people and the double-hundred policy, Mao Zedong paid great attention to dialectics. He once said that China should be a country where dialectics would develop. The series of policies proposed by him at that time were proposed mainly in view of Stalin's erroneous practices which had been exposed in a preliminary way and in view of the Soviet Union's ideological and cultural policies and political system which had been highly centralized, rigid, despotic, and lacking in democracy and freedom. Consequently the focus was put on emphasizing handling well contradictions among the people, emphasizing the development of the people's democracy, protecting the people's freedoms and rights, and making the party and state lively and vibrant. He hoped that China's socialism would not be rigid, inflexible, and frightening as in the case of the Soviet Union, and hoped that through the implementation of the series of policies mentioned above, literature and art as well as science and technology would be prosperous and developed, that the party would always maintain its vitality, and that the people's cause would be prosperous. But he did not forget the other side of the matter. Although contradictions among the people had emerged in large quantities and had become the main theme of the country's political life, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy still existed, ideas and forces opposed to the CPC's leadership and socialism still existed, and thus the dictatorship function of the state power of the people's democratic dictatorship had not lost its role, as the new China had been established not long ago. Although it was necessary to advocate and protect the people's ideological and political freedoms and to develop democracy among the people, China which was so large could not exist without discipline or without centralization and unity. Although various ideas and political views and various academic schools and artistic styles could all manifest themselves and could all "bloom" and "contend," Marxist guidance and education should not be relaxed and the leadership role of Marxism must be maintained. There were many such discussions. The most concentrated discussion was his following statement made in July 1957: "Our goal is to build a lively political situation where there are both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, and both unified wills and the ease of mind on the part of individuals, so as to facilitate socialist revolution and socialist construction, to make it easier to overcome difficulties, to build up China's modern industry and modern agriculture more quickly, and to make the party and state strengthened and more able to stand turbulence and storms." All this, from the relevant theories and general and specific policies to the political situation which would be created through the implementation of those theories and general and specific policies, that is, the target states of affairs of the social, political, ideological, cultural, and other spheres of the new socialist society that we wanted to build, provided an encouraging direction and blueprint.
