This inevitably leads to an exacerbation of the situation, complicated as it already is. In this regard, the Ukrainian president expressed his point of view on this issue. Now, when the Ukrainian people are building their independent and unified state under extremely difficult political and economic conditions, each and every citizen must realize that the state-building process should be conducted based on democracy and normal human relations, regardless of convictions or creed. The state guarantees equal rights and freedoms to all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. According to present Ukrainian legislation, interference on the part of any state institutions or political groupings in the internal affairs of the church is inadmissible. Particularly dangerous for all of society are attempts by illegal military groups to resolve interfaith problems using violent methods. Unfortunately, such cases were reported in the past and included among others, forcible takeovers of temples and their property. This kind of illegal action should be controlled by relevant state institutions responsible for applying resolute actions to head off and stop conflicts. One should understand that the church performs very special functions which cannot be performed by any other state or public institution. It instills the most fundamental human values -- spirituality, compassion, sensitivity, and love for our fellow man. This is what its unique role in society is all about. The present religious strifes, kindled by certain political forces, destabilize the situation in Ukraine. And all this is happening at an historic time, when we are in so much need of unity, consolidation of all patriotic forces, and civil accord. This cannot help but worry the president, because peace among religions is an important condition for peace in society and a successful state-building process. Relations between church and state should be based on present Ukrainian laws and take into consideration the canonical teachings of all churches. The president instructed local executive bodies to ensure strict compliance with all Ukrainian laws regarding the church, and held them responsible for the consequences of any illegal actions on the part of separate individuals and political groupings that stir up religious strife and increase tensions in society.
