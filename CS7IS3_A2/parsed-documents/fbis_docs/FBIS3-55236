Do you agree with this? [Dobrovolskiy] After my recent trip to Poland, I unexpectedly realized that not only is our people's life much worse, they also think in a different way. For example, they wouldn't move a finger to make their life any better. Poles, by contrast, seek to achieve Western living standards. The effects of economic reforms in Poland are easily seen -- storeshelves are always full, and even low-paid workers can lead a decent life there. Our Republic found itself in a bind not only because of the ineptness of its government, but also because of people's apathy. In a society undergoing economic reforms, ordinary workers participate in changes. There will be no more tranquility -- one will have to work better to earn a good salary or simply to retain his workplace. [Malakhovskaya] So we should adopt an American style of living. Is that correct? [Dobrovolskiy] Mired in an old habit, we are waiting for someone to pass some good law and settle our problems. We must take the initiative and change our society, so that the government and parliament consist of reform-minded professionals. A famous saying has been borne out: People have leaders that they deserve. To change something in life, one should change himself in the first place. [Malakhovskaya] What should we expect from the new year then? [Dobrovolskiy] First of all, a shift in public sentiments. Life itself will force us to be more active. Our neighbors -- perhaps with the exception of Ukraine -- have left us far behind. If no resolute measures are undertaken, we will end up in limbo. The economic situation will worsen. God help us avert a collapse. We have long proposed creating a free banking zone in Belarus. This would allow us to finance Belarusian, Russian, and other enterprises. We should also try to ram our refrigerators, automobiles, tractors, and television sets into foreign markets.
