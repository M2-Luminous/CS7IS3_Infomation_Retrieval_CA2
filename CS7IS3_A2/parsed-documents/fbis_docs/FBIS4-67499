International environmental groups have revealed that forests in the area have been severly damaged due to poor afforestation by the North Korean logging camps, the official said. Russia will therefore push for a provision toughening environmental regulations as well as human rights protection in its new logging contract with North Korea, he said. Pyongyang and Moscow are negotiating renewal of the contract, which expired at last year's end, but North Korea's unwillingness to accept the human rights protection provision is posing a hurdle. ``International environmental groups are warning that if logging continues in Siberia, there will be major environmental problems since the Siberian forests are one of the world's major oxygen suppliers,'' the official said. Greenpeace International says more than 15,000 North Korean workers at the logging camps randomly kill wild animals, including bears. The current North Korea-Russia logging agreement has a provision on afforestation after logging, but Moscow wants to toughen regulations, the official said.
