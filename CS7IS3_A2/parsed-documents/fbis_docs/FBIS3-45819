Often, news of success does not come without statistical figures. A series of figures illustrates the brilliant achievements our country has made in socialist economic construction since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, especially since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his talks during his South China tour and since the 14th National CPC Congress was held. Figures are most eloquent. Comparing figures is revealing. Longitudinal comparison shows us how much progress we have made in real terms, while lateral comparison reveals how much we are still behind the developed nations. To help our broad readership understand the rich contents of figures, we open a new column, "Review and Prospects," today. In this column, we will use past data and current statistics to illustrate how difficult it has been for us to achieve what we have achieved and to throw some light on the arduous nature of our future tasks. We truly face heavy tasks and have a long way to go. We trust that such comparisons will spur us further ahead in reform and opening up with full confidence and to strive for new victories in the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics in a down-to- earth manner. We also hope our readers will make requests and offer suggestions so that we can run this column well together. In order to promote iron and steel production, the people of our country went through an arduous journey full of twists and turns. Most of our comrades aged 40 years or above can vividly remember how we strived to produce 10.70 million metric tons of steel in 1958. At that time, almost everybody, regardless of age or sex, joined the effort. In the end, actual output was only 8 million metric tons. The victorious newspaper stories printed on the right carry the distinct signature of those time. The 35 years between the 8 million metric tons of 1958 and last year's 88.676 million metric tons span two significantly different periods. In the first 20 years (1958-1978), iron and steel production of our country had slow growth. It took 12 years to bring output from 10 million tons to 20 million tons; then it took a further eight years to increase output from 20 million tons to 30 million tons. The novel "The Water Margin" tells a story about "conquering Zhu's Village after three battles." In our iron and steel production front, we also had the experience of trying to "conquer '26 million' with three battles." For three years in a row from 1974 to 1976, we planned to increase steel output to 26 million tons, all to no avail. In the second period of 15 years (1978-1993), with ongoing reform and opening up and a spurt of vitality in our national economy, it took five years to increase steel output from 30 million metric tons to 40 million metric tons, three years to go from 40 million tons to 50 million tons and another three years to go from 50 million tons to 60 million tons, two years for output to reach 70 million tons from 60 million tons, and only one year to grow from 70 million tons to 80 million metric tons! In these 15 years, not only has iron and steel output increased at dramatic rates, progress in variety, quality, and technical advancement has also been very fast. In the 1950's and 1960's, China could only smelt ordinary carbon steels, but in the late 1980's, we could produce all kinds of carbon steels and high- temperature, precision, and other kinds of alloy steels. Varieties of steel have increased to more than 1,000. Smelting techniques and technology have also undergone great changes. Before 1974, China's continuous casting ratio was zero, but it reached 34 percent last year. Naturally, however, although China has become a big producer of iron and steel, we are far from being a competitive producer. Annual steel output per worker in our iron and steel industry is only 24 metric tons, while the comparable figure in such countries as Japan and the ROK is two to three times higher than ours. Energy consumption per metric ton of steel in our country is 1.5 metric tons of standard coal, which is 50 percent higher than the advanced international level. There are even greater gaps in terms of variety and quality. Only half of the crucial varieties needed by key areas of the national economy are supplied internally, and the others still need to be imported. Our country's iron and steel industry is now making efforts to optimize its structure and narrow the above-mentioned gaps as soon as possible.
