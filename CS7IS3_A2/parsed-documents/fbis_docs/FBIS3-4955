The report, which contains information and analysis of the sources and uses of external assistance to the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] for 1992, estimates a total of U.S. $167.3 million -- 6 percent less than the amount of U.S. $177.3 million development assistance registered the year before, indicated the UNDP press release. It is estimated that approximately 55 percent of the total government budget for 1992 was funded through external assistance inflows. The bulk of this development assistance, U.S. $88.6 million or 52.9 percent, originated from multilateral sources, mostly in the form of concessional loans. UNDP or UNDP-administered funds, amounting to U.S. $11.9 million or 7.1 percent of the total, provided the largest multilateral source of outright grants. Among the bilateral donors, Japan and Sweden were the major sources of aid, each disbursing over U.S. $22 million or 13 percent of the total. The 24 non-governmental organisations engaged in development and humanitarian activities in the Lao PDR in 1992 reported a total disbursement of U.S. 6.3 million (3.8 percent). In 1992 the transport sector became the top aid recipient (23.7 percent of the total), followed by economic management (19.9 percent) and agriculture, forestry and fisheries (16.8 percent). The communications sector also received a substantial share with 10.4 percent.
