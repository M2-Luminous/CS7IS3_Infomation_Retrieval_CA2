Your foreign minister was reminding me of a smart saying: "Romania's only sure neighbor is the Black Sea." What are your feelings about this Yugoslav drama, an issue on which I believe you are more on the side of the Serbs than of the others? [Iliescu] We are "pro-Yugoslavs." Talking about our neighbors, we could say that, throughout history, Romania's best neighbors were the Serbs and Yugoslavs, regardless of the type of state that existed on their territory. We have never fought against each other throughout history. On the contrary, we have been on the same side of the barricade. We suffered the same foreign occupations, that is the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian occupations, and fought the same two world wars. There has always been a feeling of solidarity and mutual sympathy that dominated in our relations. From this point of view, we have regarded all this process that is currently taking place in Yugoslavia as a tragedy, a tragedy of a heroic people. During World War II, there were feelings of respect for the Serbs, for the Yugoslavs. They had the most important resistance movement in Europe against German occupation. They resisted the Stalinist pressure in the fifties and enjoyed great prestige. It is appalling for us to see that after those historical events that consolidated their unity, this form of state is collapsing in the most tragic possible way. I have often visited Yugoslavia. In the seventies there were already problems, mainly in the economic and social areas. There were economic differences and discrepancies between the north, that is Slovenia and Croatia, and the south. There was a difference of one to six in the proportion of national product between the population in Montenegro and Slovenia for example. There were even certain disputes in this respect. I was in Montenegro in the seventies when there were discussions about the investments of Slovene capital, regarded as a means to exploit manpower through Slovene capital. The Slovenes in turn were asking themselves why should they export their capital to less-developed republics, that is, why export the surplus capital achieved by them, and so on and so forth. This was the period in which Kardelj (Edvard Kardelj, Broz Tito's closest associate] sought, with the help of certain amendments to the Constitution, to establish a federal fund for the assistance of less-developed republics. This means that, as early as that period, there were problems and friction that were probably triggered by economic problems. What is currently happening in Bosnia is mainly a religious conflict, because, generally speaking -- although in a different manner -- the Croats and Serbs basically speak the same language. I believe that they belong to one and the same nation that was separated by history. There were hundreds of years of Austro-Hungarian occupation for some of them and Ottoman occupation for others. The Croats became Catholics while the Serbs remained Orthodox. The Croats are using the Latin alphabet, while the Serbs use the Cyrillic alphabet, but in any event, they understand each other very well. In Bosnia, there are the Muslims. What does it mean -- Muslims? It does not mean Turks, because they are also Serbs or Croats who converted to Islam. They had a Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the consensus of the three ethnic groups. The referendum was based on the principle of majority, which was contradicting the constitutional principle of the republic, since that was based on the principle of consensus. Then, the Bosnian conflict emerged. Before 1990, the Croats and Slovenes advanced a proposal to turn the federation into a confederation. Maybe that would have been a political solution to avoid this breach. But I believe that all sides showed a rigid attitude toward these political problems that triggered the conflict. It is a pity, because, as I have previously said, we are talking about a nation with a quite troubled history, and there is a human tragedy taking place there. Therefore, we are in favor of all possible solutions that would facilitate the accord between the interested sides in Yugoslavia. [Mirot] Do you view the economic embargo as an effective method of reestablishing peace? As you know, you are suspected of violating the embargo on the Danube River. [Iliescu] I know that, and this is not true. There is a permanent Western European Union commission that is cooperating with us. We endorsed a decision of the United Nations, and as far as it is concerned, we showed a correct attitude in implementing it. If some incidents have taken place, this can happen anywhere. However, from the viewpoint of the state, we have taken all possible measures and there is international cooperation in supervising and making sure that these measures are respected. But, talking about the embargo, I do not believe that it is an efficient measure, as practice has demonstrated, just as military measures are not sufficient to solve disputes and conflicts. On the hand, military conflicts have worsened the climate and reduced the potential for dialogue, because other aspects appear that make it even less possible to hold dialogue after military conflicts. Therefore, I believe that the only possible, acceptable, and effective method is to make all possible efforts to facilitate communication, ensure dialogue, and search for political solutions. [Mirot] After the example of Yugoslavia, the Hungarian minority in Romania seems to be complaining about the violation of their rights. Is there a risk that at one point "a Milosevic" might gather all the Hungarians who live here in Romania under the same banner? [Iliescu] We are constantly prepared. We have held talks and carried out certain comparative studies regarding the rights of minorities in Romania, especially the rights of Hungarians and the rights of minorities in Hungary and in any other European countries. I do not believe that in the whole of Europe there is another country where the ethnic minorities enjoy all those rights that the Hungarians currently enjoy in Romania. And we can approach all aspects of this issue. The Hungarians represent 7 percent of Romania's population, that is, they number 1.7 million people. The majority of them live in Transylvania, but also in other regions, and there are over 30,000 Hungarians in Bucharest. [Mirot] And the majority of these 1.7 million are Serbs. [Iliescu] Serbs? [Mirot] Yes. [Iliescu] No. Hungarians. Most of them are living in Transylvania. The Serbs are something else. There are other nationalities in Romania, who represent 3 percent. We have representative of the small groups of ethnic minorities in our parliament. We have stipulated in our Constitution that all national minorities will be represented in parliament regardless of the direct results of the elections. Thus, the representation of all minorities in parliament is ensured. There are small groups of minorities such as Italians, and even they have their representative in parliament. The same can be said of Armenians, Greeks, and others. However, the Hungarians represent the largest group, thus they have 39 representatives in parliament, I mean senators and deputies. They have representatives in all municipality, town, and regional councils in areas where they live in a larger number. There are only two counties where the Hungarians represent the majority of the population. And this majority is represented in councils that function in these areas. They have education in their mother tongue at all levels, starting with elementary school and ending with university. They have their press, radio stations, television, and every possibility to assert themselves in all areas. You will find nothing like that in Hungary. Their reply to this is that you will not find such a large minority in their country like the Hungarians in Romania. But this is not an issue of numbers, but of principle. They made a big fuss about the law on their minorities, but no ethnic minority has a representative in their parliament and their parliament rejected this idea. There is no school where the teaching is in the mother tongue of ethnic minorities. All minorities in Hungary study their mother tongue as a foreign language, while they play the champions on the issue of minorities' rights. From a psychological viewpoint I can understand the attitude of the Hungarians. This is a remnant, a vestige of imperial nostalgia and all countries that had empires before have the same manner. You can see the attitude of the present Russia toward all republics that have become independent states. They regard the rights of Russians as a fundamental problem. This was also the case with the French, with their departments oversees, wasn't it? [Mirot] Certainly. [Iliescu] This was the case with the British when they lost their empire. Thus, it is natural that the Hungarians have the same feelings and this is the core of sensitivity on both sides. The Romanians are one of the oldest nations in Europe. We have lived here for thousands of years. When the Roman empire started expanding, they found here an organized state of the Dacians, our ancestors. For years on end, our ancestors had commercial and economic relations with the Greeks and they had an organized state. When the Hungarians came to Europe and when the Germanic and Slav tribes came to Europe, they found the Romanians in their place. Transylvania was the political center of the former Dacian state and during the Roman colonization it was the political center of the Roman colony, that is Roman Dacia. Throughout history, even in the statistics compiled by Hungarians or Austrians, the majority population in Transylvania was Romanian, but the feudal law included this principle of "unio trium nationum" which meant that on the political plane the Romanians were not recognized as citizens but as serfs and the only ones who had the right to be represented in the Transylvanian Diet were Hungarians, Germans, and Secklers. There were different statutes for them. This was quite a long period in history when Transylvania was an autonomous principality. There was a period when Transylvania was subordinated to Vienna and there was also a short period of 67 years when it was subordinated to Budapest. In all these periods of time, only the Germans, Hungarians, and Secklers -- these last ones are a people of Hungarian origin, but an older one that was settled on the boundary of the empire; today they form the majority population in two counties in Romania -- thus only these three nations had the right to be represented in the Diet, but not the Romanians. Thus, you can understand the feelings of the Romanians, who fought for centuries on end for their national liberation. In 1918, after World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed, the national Romanian state was established. That was the moment of the liberation of Romanians, of self-determination, and of union with the other historical provinces that were formerly, that is in the last century, liberated from the Turkish domination and Bessarabia from the Russian domination. For the first time, a united state of Romanians was established. Therefore, on the one hand, there are these feelings of the Romanians toward those who wish to contest this historic reality, but, on the other hand, we understand the Hungarians, too. They were the dominant nation -- although they were the minority -- and suddenly became a national minority. It is certainly a feeling that we can understand. However, we should also understand.... [Mirot] On the other hand, we have learned that in Moldova, which was part of Romania, a referendum took place and those who wished the unification with Romania -- which is a natural feeling -- were defeated. Do you believe that one day this unification with Moldova will be achieved? [Iliescu] Today, the problem of unification of the two states is not a topical issue because it is a more complicated problem. This territory was for the first time occupied by Russian in 1812, when Turkey was making preparations for the campaign against Napoleon. At that time, Russia was waging a six-year war with Turkey. It halted the war with Turkey. This was a period when Turkish diplomacy was quite weak and the Russians, without winning, succeeded in obtaining a territory from the Turks, namely Bessarabia. That was half of the historical province of Moldova. Bessarabia became a Russian "province" for 100 years, until World War I. After World War I, Bessarabia was integrated into the Romanian sate. In 1940, through the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, the Soviets not only occupied "tsarist" Bessarabia -- a territory occupied by the tsars -- but also occupied another territory, namely North Bucovina, which has never belonged to Russia. Before World War I, this was a land occupied by Austria for 150 years. It was included in the Austrian Empire, but it did not belong to Russia. However, they occupied this land, claiming that it was a sort of "compensation" for the 20 years of occupation of Bessarabia by Romania. There was also an interesting event. In 1965, in North Bucovina, there was a movement of the Romanians who said: The 20 years have passed, we should return to Romania. There was a certain motion and I was in Suceava [northeastern Romania] near the border and I was told that there were many families with relations on the two sides of the border and those families said: Our people say that it is high time for the return of our land. But certainly, when the Russians occupy a land, they never withdraw. They did something else, something that the Tsarist regime had never done before. They divided the land into three parts: They incorporated the southern and northern parts in Ukraine -- this was carried out by Stalin and Khrushchev who was first party secretary in Ukraine -- and they also attached a territory, the Dniester, which did not belong to Romania. but which was also created by Stalin in 1942, as an "autonomous republic" of Moldova, probably having the idea of annexing the other part of Moldova, too, that is, Bessarabia. Then, they created a situation that is more complex today, when we can no longer talks about a whole land. The Republic of Moldova was proclaimed on the territory of the Soviet Republic of Moldova. This includes only a part of the territory occupied by the Soviets and, before then, for one century by the Russians, and another territory, that is, Dniester. There is a movement of Russians there who claim that if Moldova unites with Romania, they want guarantees that they are going to stay outside Romania's borders. This is the Dniester conflict. Thus, from this point of view, the situation in Moldova is quite sensitive, with pro-Russian movements and with the quite-complex feelings of the Romanians who live there and represent the majority of the population; 65 percent of the population are Romanians. However, there is also the problem of the other territories. We have always approached these problems in a realistic manner. We believe that in politics one should take into consideration current historical realities. Otherwise, there will be no peace in Europe, because there are innumerable border problems such as the problem of Germans in Koenigsberg and the other territories, the Poles with their border problems, and even the French and the Hungarians and all the others have such problems. Therefore, one should take into consideration the current realities, with the current borders, and we believe that the only criteria to be considered are the post-war understandings, treaties, the Helsinki documents, and the Paris Charter. Thus, we recognized the independent Moldovan state. We regard it as the second Romanian state, but only history can tell what will be the fate of this state. There is no need to create new tension now. This is not in Moldova's interest, it is not in the interest of the Romanian state, and of peace in general to stir this issue. One should take realities into consideration. We will have to support the development of direct relations and this is already a gain. Previously, during the rule of the Soviet Union, we could have no direct relations with Chisinau and with that region. All problems had to be discussed with Moscow. But today we have another situation, because we can have direct contact and human contact. We do have this possibility now. We believe that the only solution is to take concrete steps and develop economic, cultural, spiritual, scientific, and human relations and to establish an unhampered system of communication. [Mirot] I have a last question, so that I do not take up too much of your time. Bucharest used to be called the "little Paris"; you speak excellent French, and it is true that we, the French, feel somehow at home here. I hope that this feeling will be mutual when you are in Paris. However, we are a little worried about the Francophony and the strong offensive of the English language. Your generation speaks French excellently, however, under the Ceausescu regime, obviously there was a lapse in the use of the French language. What do you do currently to relaunch Francophony? [Iliescu] First of all, I would like to stress a few fundamental ideas. Regardless of the political orientation, political groups, or personal orientations, I believe that there is a unanimous feeling among Romanians as far as relations with France and the attitude toward France are concerned. This is not only a sentimental issue. This is connected with our Latin origin -- because we are situated on the eastern side of the Latin world and we are also an island of Latinity in a Slav world -- but also because throughout history we have had direct connections with France and all Romanians could feel the support granted by France as decisive in certain tragic moments or decisive moments for our country. On the one hand, France discharged a spiritual influence in the past because it was at the forefront of modern changes in Europe -- the French revolution and the enlightened ideas of the French realism -- and many Romanian intellectuals were educated in France. During the 1848 revolutionary movement, there was a direct link between the French and Romanian revolutionary movements. Our struggle for national assertion and for national independence were constantly supported by France. During World War I, the time when the Romanian united national state was established, the political support granted by France was decisive -- Trianon was a decisive moment for us from this point of view -- and, as a result of it, all these historical ties created a general feeling in all Romanians for France, feelings of sympathy and solidarity throughout history with France. Therefore, the establishment of privileged relations with France have always been a constant and dominant part of our foreign policy. This is also a constant feature of our current foreign policy as well. However, we have a certain feeling of apprehension regarding the official position towards an interest of some circles in France to sustain and support the political wish of Romanians. This feeling of apprehension is also caused by the fact that even the French mass media sometimes expresses attitudes that are not always friendly toward the processes that are currently taking place in Romanian society. If you wish, I can tell you that, in a way, the Romanians expect France to play a role toward Romania that is similar to the role played by West Germany toward East Germany. Maybe, in this case, the ties are less strong. In case of Germany we are talking about a completely united community, but we would like France to show the same feelings. Certainly, we are not denying the constant support that France granted to Romania after the revolution -- immediately after and throughout this period -- in European institutions such as the Council of Europe and the European Union. We have greatly appreciated this support. Our relations are generally good but, since you started discussing this subject, I would like to use this opportunity to tell you that the Romanians expect a more open attitude. I cannot deny that we feel France's friendly attitude toward us, but we would like to see a greater interest, mainly coming from business circles. We are in the middle of a very dynamic period of economic development and Francophony is not only a sentimental issue. If it is not supported with fundamental relations, through economic activity, it might suffer, even if we take into consideration the current feelings and the feelings that we will always nurture for France. [Mirot] We hope that your official trip to France.... [Iliescu] I hope too. Even if the Germans are busy with the territories in the east, are much more dynamic. They make less noise and less fuss, but are very efficient and active. The Italians are more active, too. They have political difficulties but, as businessmen, they are more dynamic than the French. [Mirot] This is true. You are right. You are criticizing us in the mass media for the attitude that we show for Romania, maybe also for a certain worsening of the situation, which is no doubt connected with the revolution. The French mass media showed some reticence when reporting about your country, but we can assure you that we continue to love Romania. [Iliescu] I think that the French can understand better now the "miners incursions" [in Bucharest in 1990]. [Mirot] Absolutely. [Iliescu] I do not believe that there can be anybody who believes that young people's movements are manipulated by the presidents of the republic. [Mirot] Absolutely not. [Iliescu] But as far as the "miners incursions" are concerned, the French mass media took over the slogans that were disseminated in our country. [Mirot] Mr. President, thank you very much.
