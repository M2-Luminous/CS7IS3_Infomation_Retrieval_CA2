The upper house eventually approved the move. Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists that the absolute majority in the upper chamber voted for conducting the peace-keeping operation in the region". "To me, this is an order to act," Grachev said. "As soon as the mine-clearing operation is reported over, we will get down to the peace-keeping operation proper, including posting sentries and setting up checkpoints," he said. The defence minister said that the operation will begin with the relocation of two battalions from Batumi and paratroopers from Gudauta. Later, two more battalions will be airlifted from the Leningrad and Privolzhskiy (Volga) Military Districts to reinforce the group. A total of 3000 men will take part in the peace-keeping mission in Abkhazia. Grachev said preparatory work was done over the past few days, particularly as concerns the mine-clearing operation which defused a great amount of explosives and bombs in the area. Control points were set up, communication lines laid and material and other resources were stocked. Asked about the funding of the peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, the defence minister expressed the hope that the deputies would soon adopt a decision on funding the mission from sources other than the ministry's budget. He said the mission would require the outlay of 10 to 11 billion roubles until the end of this year. It is not yet clear whether other Commonwealth member states will take part in the mission, Grachev said. But the question about it will be raised at the Commonwealth summit in September, the minister said.
