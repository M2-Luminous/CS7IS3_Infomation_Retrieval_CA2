A. Izrael Was Elected an Academician''; the first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] At the last General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences, by 230 votes ``yea,'' 88 votes ``nay,'' with 14 ballot papers deemed to be invalid, Yuriy Antoniyevich Izrael was elected a Russian academician. The election did not go off smoothly. The stumbling block was the behavior of Yu. A. Izrael during the Chernobyl catastrophe. He then headed the USSR State Committee for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Goskomgidromet; Gidromet]. Here are several fragments of the stenographic record of the discussion (the shorthand record is incorrect, but the essence of the accusations and the counterarguments is conveyed rather precisely). I know not about the number of new writings by Izrael, nor about his expeditions; I can look that up for myself. I would like to know the number of victims, the number of unfortunate there were due to the Chernobyl catastrophe, and after that, how Izrael concealed the true character of the radiation and the first days when no one visualized what this involved. Approximately how many of these victims were there, surely, at least what was the order of magnitude, the scale of the criminality?" Academician S. T. Belyayev: ``The basis for taking the necessary measures after the Chernobyl accident should have been the numerous data on radiation conditions from different departments. Those data from the Goskomgidromet warrant the highest evaluation. The reliability and trustworthiness of the information collected by it were later checked by various international organizations and intercalibrations were carried out. The yearlong work of the enormous body of specialists of the international project of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which did not find any serious flaws in the data presented by Gidromet, is known to everyone. Now about the role of Yuriy Antoniyevich himself. He relied only on scientifically dependable information, not giving in to any pressure on the part of the administrative and political agencies, which initially was especially strong. With respect to the information which was suppressed, that is, what was not published in the newspapers, that is not Izrael's fault. That he insistently required the dissemination of all information to the local agencies which were responsible for all measures carried out on the spot, I myself was a witness to that. You know that the Chernobyl problem was closely intertwined in all political problems and ambitions, a situation which also is continuing to this time. Here it was necessary display firmness and persistence based on scientific information and not yield to pressure from any other groups which were whipped up into a frenzy. And from what were there more victims later on: from the mass stress to which an enormous number of people was subjected, or from the specific radiation situation which actually prevailed? "I think that I can speak of this because I observed Yuriy Antoniyevich during the course of all these events. And after 1986 I was first a deputy of Anatoliy Petrovich [Academician A. P. Aleksandrov -- editor's explanation], who headed the Interdepartmental Coordination Council of the Academy of Sciences, responsible for all the scientific problems related to Chernobyl. An enormous number of nonprofessional organizations were involved in all kinds of measurements. And in each case it was necessary to analyze the methodological errors. All this work also was organized by Gidromet; there was a scientific council which examined all the measurements, all the data which were collected by all organizations whatsoever. And such data were never released until the reasons for discrepancies were clarified. That's all that I want to say: the merits of Yuriy Antoniyevich as an administrator, as a scientist at the time of the Chernobyl accident, were manifested very clearly, as was noted, among others, by many international organizations.'' Academician V. L. Maslov: ``I asked a specific question: what were the numbers, what was the scale? With respect to whether Izrael was involved in the misinformation, I did not ask that question. I know the answer to it. I also was engaged in the liquidation of the Chernobyl accident. But I think that everyone saw Izrael on television when he gave the people incorrect radiation information. That the Gidromet did a good job, I know very well; I also know that it gave correct information. I say only that the people were given (and everyone knows this) incorrect information. I saw a videofilm, I saw how the children ran and looked at the fire there, in Chernobyl. I saw a pregnant woman who pushed a small child in a wheelbarrow, rather than in a carriage. But what was of importance to me was: what was the scale?'' Next several of our respected academicians spoke out in defense of Yu. A. Izrael. There was mention of the first press conference on Chernobyl on 5 May 1986 where Shcherbina, citing Izrael, gave low figures on radioactivity. These were precise data, but applying to regions in a 30- km radius from the accident site. However, Shcherbina was silent that the Goskomgidromet also gave precise nuclear power plant figures for Pripyat. In the opinion of the academicians, Izrael could not then publicly refute the accusations that he concealed information because until May 1989 all precise data on Chernobyl were kept under the strictest secrecy. But at the first opportunity he published his charts, prepared in 1986-1987. The verification commission of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed his data. One of the international scientific centers awarded Izrael a gold medal with the inscription: ``For Chernobyl.'' Then he was awarded prizes by the UN and the International Meteorological Organization. Conclusion: the guilt of the designers, the guilt of the government, three years concealing the true data about Chernobyl, cannot be shifted to Yu. A. Izrael, who from the very first day gave precise data on the scale of the catastrophe. From the hall: ``A question, please, for Yuriy Antoniyevich relative to the discussion which arose. I fully trust those data which were presented here. But I have a question: why then did Yuriy Antoniyevich, at that time knowing that falsified data were being given in contradiction to the information which he gave, not resign from his position?'' Yu. A. Izrael: ``No one forced me to present any incorrect data or to falsify them. As proof I can say that Mikhail Sergeyevich (M. S. Gorbachev -- editor's explanation) and Gromyko at a Politburo session asked me questions like: what is a `curie,' what is a `roentgen per hour'? Do you think that people with such a scientific background can force any particular figures to be given? Such people cannot give such and such a figure, you understand? All the solid information was given to the leadership -- higher and local. Unfortunately, really, the matter of publication widely in the newspapers could not be solved by me, but we supplied objective information. I flew directly through the Belarus and Ukrainian countryside and in those regions which had been subjected to the greatest pollution I personally explained to the people why they had to leave their native villages. Many of them did not want to depart, they even shot back, can you imagine that? I did not receive and we did not receive even a single professional negative comment with respect to our data. With respect to the question which was posed last, I must once again assert that my task was to pass on all the data, insofar as they were objective, to those people who had need for them. These were the people who suffered from the pollution and those who made decisions. We do not have such a book, but in France a book has now been published under the name ``The Chernobyl Incident: A War of Rumors.'' On this question there are so many different, generally inadequately checked rumors which sometimes result in a complete distortion of the physical truth. I emphasize once again that I am answering and am ready to answer to any commission for the correctness of the cited data, for the fact that our team and I personally did everything for this information to reach the people. And I give my word of honor to all present that my conscience is clear.'' It is the business of scientists to argue about the accuracy of scientific data. It is the business of politicians and philosophers to argue about the degree of guilt of an individual under conditions of absolute state authority. However, there are questions which go beyond these limits. Chernobyl remains painful and troublesome in the conscience of each of us, all the people and the country. And therefore it is too early to consider the doubts expressed at the general meeting to be the last word. In actuality, what can a specialist do who knows the truth under conditions of total censorship? But today, when the letter of P. L. Kapitsa has been made public, both in defense of the arrested L. D. Landau and against the suffocation of Baykal and against other antihuman deeds of the supreme authority, the question about resigning does not seem rhetorical. Who is a scientist -- he is only a supplier of new knowledge or data or a person whose conscience cannot be at peace with respect to what will become of this knowledge, especially if it affects everyone, whether it will be made available to the public or will be turned into a state secret? We had two principal secrets -- military and ecological. And Yuriy Antoniyevich, having available the totality of the precise ecological truth, faced with the impossibility of passing it on to the people, did not protest and did not resign. He beautifully went along with the government in covering up this truth. Moreover, he took upon himself the role of an ecological czar. Without the permission of his department the press was given access to not a single document relative to the alarming state of our environment, facts and figures were mercilessly stricken out so as ``not to sow panic among the population.'' It is true that in speaking and writing about Chernobyl it is necessary to separate clearly the scientific facts from the phantasmagoria of rumors and wild tales. But indeed the primary source of the wild tales themselves was precisely the concealment of the truth. One of the arguments was: if the truth was told the number of victims -- from panic -- would be still greater. How clever. In any case until now there has been no direct and honest answer to the question posed by V. P. Maslov: what is the price of concealing the truth when reference is to what is most important: the life and health of man?
