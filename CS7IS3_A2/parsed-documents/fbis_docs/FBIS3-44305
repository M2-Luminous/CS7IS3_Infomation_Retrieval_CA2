Both sides agreed: The United States will stop conducting the annual "Team Spirit" joint military exercise with the ROK; in return, the DPRK will accept the nuclear inspections necessary to guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safety agreement. Both sides also agreed to hold a third round of talks between high-level officials on the basis of this agreement. The progress is important and is catching the attention of the world. As everyone knows, the Korean Peninsula is a hot spot followed with interest by the world. Revolving around the nuclear issue, all parties concerned have gone through the three stages of confrontation, dialogue, and deadlock over the past year. The confrontation stage was largely manifested in a resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in February on the need to conduct "special inspections" of the DPRK's nuclear facilities, and in the latter's decision in March to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and declare a "state of quasi-wartime nationwide" against the "Team Spirit" joint military exercise held by the United States. Later, in May, the DPRK announced it had rejected a resolution by the UN Security Council, saying that the imposition of sanctions against it would be regarded as a "declaration of war." The most conspicuous point of the dialogue stage was the start of talks between the U.S. and the DPRK. In June and July, Pyongyang and Washington held two rounds of talks between high-level officials aimed at resolving the nuclear issue, and some progress was made. The two sides issued a joint statement. DPRK renounced its decision to temporarily withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily. The deadlock stage was exemplified by the fruitless consultation between the DPRK and the IAEA in early September, and in the interruption of contact between its work delegation and the ROK's aimed at dispatching special envoys to each other's countries. The DPRK has always maintained that the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula must be resolved through bilateral talks with the U.S. and that sanctions and other pressure would only serve to make the situation more complicated and tense. Though the United States sometimes talked tough, declaring that it would impose an "oil embargo," "economic sanctions," and so forth against the DPRK, it never gave up efforts to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and maintained official contacts with the DPRK. The 18th contact between the DPRK and U.S. work delegations finally achieved progress on the eve of the New Year. The DPRK said the progress finally enabled the talks to "enter a normal orbit once again and was a matter for rejoicing" [ling ren gan dao qing xing 0109 0086 1949 0451 1987 1630].
