He seemed rather pleased with the outcome of his visit to Ankara. It was obvious that Prime Minister Ciller's statement to the True Path Party parliamentary group meeting two days ago that "the principle of the TRNC's political equality and sovereignty will not be abandoned" came as a relief to Denktas. He said: "Prime Minister Ciller's statement has given us courage." Making no effort to conceal his admiration, Denktas added: "I have observed that Prime Minister Ciller maintains a very positive approach to the Cyprus problem. She has taken up the issue seriously and she knows the content of her file on the problem." Denktas is convinced that he has removed Ankara's anxiety about his approach.... He said: "We have ascertained that we are no longer regarded as officials who want to create difficulties. Officials in Ankara are now far more aware of our difficulties in the negotiating process." Those remarks highlighted the most important outcome of Denktas' visit to Ankara. Let us explain: The visit removed the mutual anxiety of the two sides and renewed the confidence between them for the future... Within that framework, Ankara received a guarantee from Denktas that "he will remain at the negotiating table and not abandon the talks" despite his anxiety and his not trusting the new process. In return, Denktas received a guarantee from Turkey that Ankara would maintain a "steadfast approach" and support him on the problems he may encounter when the talks begin. Denktas explained the possible problems during the meeting called by President Suleyman Demirel in the presidential palace on Monday evening [21 February]. Each time he mentioned a problem, he asked whether Ankara would support him if he adopted this or that approach. For example, he asked: "Will Ankara support me in having a particular number of TRNC citizens settle in Maras [Varosha] when that area is transferred to the Greek Cypriots?" Denktas received a "yes" to all his questions. The "yes" given to Denktas' question on the transfer of Maras within the framework of the UN package on confidence-building measures was the most important of all. Denktas' question was related to the UN view that "the opening of Nicosia Airport will take time. So let us not delay the transfer of Maras until Nicosia Airport can be opened. Transfer Maras to the UN officials and issues relating to the airport can be resolved later." Denktas was relieved when Ankara promised to maintain a "steadfast approach" toward the simultaneous settlement of the two issues. Denktas' visit to Ankara has revealed a striking reality: Each and every technical issue in the package of confidence-building measures is directly linked with the two sides' basic views on the essence of the problem. Therefore, they must unavoidably move out of the framework of the minipackage and take up the main problem. Considering that, Denktas outlined his anxiety and asked several questions in Ankara, questions that may create a deadlock in the negotiating process at any time. They are as follows: a. What will be the nature of the administration established in Maras when it is placed under UN jurisdiction? b. How will the sides share authority in the law courts that will be established? c. What will the TRNC citizens use as passports or travel documents when they wish to fly out from Nicosia Airport, that is, when the airport is opened for the use of the two sides? Denktas' questions enabled the officials in Ankara to better understand his problems in the negotiating process. He made an important request in connection with the possibility that the UN officials might adopt an approach in favor of the Greek Cypriot side when the talks begin. He asked that Ankara should move to contact the countries concerned, the United States in particular, to establish a balance. What remains to be done is for Prime Minister Ciller to move to effectively explain to the high-level officials in the United States every issue on which she and Denktas have agreed.
