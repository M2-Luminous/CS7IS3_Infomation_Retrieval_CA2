What are the reasons? [Al-Liddawi] The progress achieved by Hamas, especially in the occupied territories, coincided with a clear decline in the PLO leadership's popularity. The PLO leadership did not like it. Through an alliance with Israel, it presented several complaints to the Americans against Jordan, where the Hamas representative and its official spokesman reside. Hakam Bal'awi's visit to Jordan and his talks with the Jordanian prime minister on the need to dwarf Hamas' role came within this context. The visit took place 15 days ago and it was followed by another visit to Jordan by Yasir 'Arafat, who tried to drive a wedge between Jordan and Hamas. The other reasons given are not true; they are not the real reasons behind the threats to Jordan by Rabin and Peres. Statements by the Hamas official spokesman and representative in Jordan concerning the 'Afula and Hadera operations were made after the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam groups inside the occupied territories announced their responsibility for the two martyrdom operations. The operations were used as a pretext to implement this conspiracy against fraternal Jordan, to blackmail it, especially after Jordan's recent position toward the blockade of the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah and Jordan's link between its continuing participation in the bilateral talks and the lifting of the blockade. On top of this comes the painful impact of the martyrdom operations on the occupation government. [AL-'AHD] It was said that Ibrahim Ghawshah and Muhammad Nazzal's passports were withdrawn. What information do you have on this? [Al-Liddawi] We do not say that the Jordanian Government withdrew their passports. But after the news conference that King Husayn held in Amman following the Israeli threats to Jordan, the Jordanian foreign minister summoned Ghawshah and Nazzal to explain developments and the government's position on them. After listening to the two, the minister asked their permission to keep their passports with him. [AL-'AHD] Many observers expect relations between Hamas and the Jordanian regime to become tense. [Al-Liddawi] We do not expect such a thing. Our relations with the Jordanian Government remain good, despite what happened. Jordan appreciates that the Palestinian cause is important for it. There are many reasons leading it to create good relations with Hamas, which in turn appreciates Jordan's importance for the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people in general. We also deeply respect all the Arab and Islamic countries, especially those where we have an information, political, or charitable presence. We want their security to be stable, especially Jordan's. Hamas has no organizational infrastructure or armed presence outside Palestine. It is not our policy to embarrass Jordan or any other country. We believe that relations with Jordan will not be harmed by what happened. The government's recent measures against Hamas will not last. [AL-'AHD] King Husayn's recent statements indicate that his regime recognizes only the PLO as the Palestinian people's legitimate representative. How do you view these statements? [Al-Liddawi] This stance is not new. It has long been the Jordanian Government's official stance. So what is strange in the king's statements? He has said nothing new. As for our stance on the legitimacy of 'Arafat and his organization's representation of the Palestinian people, we believe that neither the PLO nor Hamas represent the entire Palestinian people. In our view, the party that legitimately represents the Palestinian people is the one that will be brought forward by honest Palestinian elections in which all Palestinians participate, wherever they are. This is what we are calling for. [AL-'AHD] Muhammad Nazzal told AL-'AHD two weeks ago that Hamas would hit the Israeli settlements with rockets. What is your comment on this? [Al-Liddawi] That's what I and brother Muhammad Nazzal read in the statement issued by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions in the occupied territories. It threatened the Zionists with more military operations against the enemy's soldiers and settlers in retaliation for the massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. We are expecting more painful operations against the enemy by the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions. [AL-'AHD] Does this mean that the target of these operations will be the settlements built in the territories occupied in 1967 or the ones throughout Palestine? [Al-Liddawi] This question should be put to the Martyr 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions operating in occupied Palestine because all the planning, preparation, and implementation of all the military operations is carried out in the occupied territories. [AL-'AHD] How do you envisage the relations between Hamas and Fatah in the event of the implementation of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and the entry of 'Arafat and the Palestinian police force into these two areas? [Al-Liddawi] We yearn to maintain good relations with all the sides in the occupied territories. Fatah enjoys support in the occupied territories and any fighting between Hamas and Fatah would trigger the fire of civil war in Palestine. We must avoid this as far as we can. Any struggle between the two inside the occupied territories would be bloody and destructive to our people. We must, therefore, try hard to avoid any explosion of the situation. Proceeding from this perspective, we hold meetings with all the forces in the occupied territories, including Fatah and others. Hamas will not take part in the Palestinian force that will be established in Gaza and Jericho. We hope this force will support our people and will not be a tool in the hands of the occupation authorities. [AL-'AHD] Are you afraid there will be sedition, especially as many people predict there will be? [Al-Liddawi] We are confident that sedition and infighting are an Israeli dream. Israel is paving the way for them. If there is sedition it will only serve the Zionist interests. It will be devastating for the people. We hope that everyone will realize the dangers and ramifications of sedition. We also hope that the people are aware of this and will do all they can to avoid it and undermine the objectives of the conspirators. [AL-'AHD] How do you view the arms phenomenon in Palestine? Is the Mosad involved in supplying the arms? [Al-Liddawi] Weapons are being distributed inside the occupied territories. Everyone is collecting the weapons for his own goals. Some people gather weapons for the sake of the resistance and jihad, while others store them for self-defense. But other people are collecting weapons with the help and planning of the Mosad to see that things flare up and any sedition worsens. We all know the objectives of the Israeli intelligence in stirring problems among the various parties. For this purpose, the intelligence service is exerting every effort and using its agents.
