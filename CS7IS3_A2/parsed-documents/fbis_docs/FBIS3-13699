In a speech during the UNSC's review of the sanctions imposed on Iraq last night, he expressed the hope that the Special Commission will be able to put in force the mechanisms to monitor the Iraqi weapons industry. Merimee added that the effective participation of French experts in the Special Commission's activities proves France's commitment to the implementation of long-term monitoring plans. The French envoy said his country believes it is very useful that the Special Commission chairman faces the UNSC in order to accurately explain preparations concerning the implementation of Resolution 715, and to establish a timetable defining the beginning of the probation period. He said that four months after Iraq recognized its obligations under Resolution 715, his country believes that the Special Commission should know when it will be prepared to begin long-term verification if Iraq continues its cooperation satisfactorily. The UNSC president pointed out that after the termination of the six-month probation period, his country will then believe that the time will be appropriate for the UNSC to announce its position toward the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. In his speech, Merimee said that France emphasizes two points. The first is that the progress that has taken place leads France to the conviction that the UNSC cannot continue the same course. He indicated that his country is of the view that it is appropriate for the UNSC to change the routine formula in accordance with which it ends its review of the sanctions. He said that such a change would be through an explicit UNSC indication that progress has actually taken place. Regarding the second point, the French ambassador to the United Nations said: We now hope we will have a clear idea about the timetable in accordance with which the probation period will commence. He added: As soon as Iraq officially accepts its commitments in accordance with Resolution 715--and this is what has happened since 26 November 1993--we hope we will obtain clarifications from the Special Commission on its intentions regarding the timetable. Reports coming from New York indicate that the dispute among the UN Security Council members on the language of the traditional statement issued by the council every two months is still intense. Some UNSC members are demanding that the statement refer to the progress that has been achieved with regard to the implementation of the provisions of Resolution 687 and Iraq's approval of Resolution 715 concerning future monitoring. This statement is expected to be issued tomorrow, Friday.
