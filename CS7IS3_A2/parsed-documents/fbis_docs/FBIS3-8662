At a meeting with Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of the Bulgarian Committee on Power Supplies, they discussed the situation and adopted a decision that Mr. Shervashidze will now explain to us: [Begin Shervashidze recording] Mr. Atasoy told me that Russia has declared that it is delivering the contracted amounts of gas to the Ukrainian border, and I have no reason not to believe this. He said that the amounts of gas delivered have to be divided between Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, and --the fact is that, according to Mr. Atasoy, no gas is arriving at the border with Turkey, the last consumer in the line. There is no reason for me not to believe this. [words indistinct] The simple fact is that if the amount of gas delivered is reduced and the gas pressure falls to a point that we are able to monitor, a switching valve automatically comes into operation that reduces the amount of gas sent on to Bulgaria or to Turkey. However, owing to the peculiarities of the system, Turkey gets a larger share of the gas than Bulgaria does. As we assured our Turkish colleagues--and we also wrote to them to avoid being accused of not fulfilling our promises--that we will take measures, including restrictions, I regret to say, to ensure that we each get a fair share of the gas and that we divide the available gas like good neighbors. [end recording] With a view to dividing the quantities of natural gas arriving more fairly between Bulgaria and Turkey, Bulgaria will take technical measures. Our country is already restricting the consumption of natural gas by enterprises in the chemical industry. Because of force majeure conditions, as Nikita Shervashidze described them, we will suffer losses that are not our fault.
