A little more than a year after proposing the idea in his general policy statement, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur opened the Conference on Stability in Europe in Paris yesterday, which has the aim of establishing a preventive diplomacy on the Old Continent. In a brief opening speech, Mr. Balladur argued for a "pragmatic and preventive diplomatic method," which he contrasted with the "big institutional maneuvers or arrangements which are often ephemeral." Although the conference, which is being attended by 53 delegations, seems inevitably haunted by the Bosnian conflict, the French prime minister expressed the desire to make every effort to ensure that minority or border conflicts in East Europe do not turn into open conflicts like the war in the former Yugoslavia. This war, in which Europe has displayed its powerlessness to restore peace, is "a real lesson of what we can no longer tolerate," Edouard Balladur said. Referring to the criticisms of those who think that the proposed Pact for Stability is not "ambitious enough," he said that "we have experienced too many good intentions in the past which were not followed through." Mr. Balladur recalled in this connection the Kellog-Briand Pact concluded after World War I to "outlaw war," or the "very complete range of provisions made by the League of Nations at the same time to deal, unsuccessfully, with minority questions [quotemarks as published]. The prime minister also argued for a "different European society," adding that we must "start by eliminating old quarrels, by dispelling old fears." He also stressed that "nobody would be made to do anything he did not wish to do" during the negotiations, implicitly rejecting the criticism that the Pact on Security could reopen old disputes in East Europe. The French Government chief reaffirmed, in this connection, the principle of "territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders." With regard to national, ethnic, and religious minorities, the rights of the individual must be accompanied by a "duty of loyalty" toward the country of which they are nationals. The prime minister also addressed his remarks to Russia, which expressed once again yesterday its reservations about the Pact for Stability. This plan, he stressed several times, is not intended to push Moscow to the fringes. The desire of many Central and East European countries to join the European Union [EU] must go hand-in-hand with the development of "very close relations with Russia," he said, adding that the "future big Europe" should maintain "preferential partnership relations" with Moscow. However, Russia yesterday gave a cool reception to the Pact for Stability in Europe at a time when Paris and Bonn are proposing to strengthen ties between the Twelve and the countries of the former Soviet bloc which want to be anchored more firmly in the West. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that his country gave preference to the CSCE process, which has involved all the continent's countries since 1975. "It is clear that the process launched in Paris on the basis of the Twelve plus nine formula (EU and the East European countries likely to join it) is unique. It does not create a precedent for the future," Mr. Kozyrev warned. Russia has several times expressed its anxiety at being pushed to the fringes faced with the EU's power of attraction for its former satellites. In Edouard Balladur's view, the "objective" is to see the Pact for Stability signed "by the beginning of next year, in February for instance." However, the prime minsiter took the precaution of adding that it might "possibly take longer." Indeed, in European circles, some diplomats are casting doubt on the ability to finalize the pact before mid-1995, and especially before the [French] presidential election. Furthermore, this is a period in which France will take over the presidency of the EU. Mr. Balladur also stressed that the proposed pact had "immediately received the president of the Republic's approval" and thanked Alain Juppe, his foreign minsiter, for the efforts he has made to ensure its success. In addition, in an interview with LE MONDE, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the French prime minister jointly suggested "inviting the heads of state and of government of the candidate countries once a year" to a meeting with the EU members to discuss "questions of common interest and thus extend cooperation." The two heads of government think that "the Union has the historical duty and common objective of helping the Central and East European countries which are implementing reforms to rejoin the European family." This initiative aimed at involving the candidate countries in the EU's work is, it must be stressed, a German initiative. In practice it should result in the presence of the four members of the Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovak Republic) at the next European Council meeting in Essen next December.
