The conference was devoted mainly to relaying and implementing the spirit of a recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work conference, studying a new train of thought for the province's propaganda and ideological work, formulating relevant propaganda and ideological work measures, opening up new vistas for the province's reform and development, and pressing ahead with the province's economic growth. Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu delivered an important speech at this morning's conference in which he stated: Giving full scope to propaganda and ideological work has remained one of the party's basic experiences and one of its traditional superiorities. Now that Yunnan's reform, opening up, and economic development have entered a new historical period, we are confronted with a new round of strategic transformation. Should we fail to strengthen the party's propaganda and ideological work; enable the broad masses of the people to comprehend and master the party's line, theories, principles, and policies in the new historical period; and consciously join hands with the broad masses of the people in deepening the on-going reforms; we will find it impossible to complete the second-round strategic transformation successfully. Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: In carrying out the party's propaganda and ideological work, we should adhere unswervingly to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a basic guiding principle; should submit to and serve the overall interests of emancipating the mind, grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability; should subject propaganda and ideological work to these overall interests; and should secure a correct political orientation for propaganda and ideological work. In addition, we should make unreserved efforts to publicize the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the overall interests of the entire party and country, with a view to turning spiritual strength into material strength and to pressing ahead with reform, construction, and development. Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: Arming the whole party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is now a basic task of the party's ideological and theoretical building and of its propaganda and ideological work. In order to accomplish this basic task, in the near future the provincial party committee should directly and successfully organize four clases for principal leading cadres at and above the county level to study the 'Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three. Various areas across the province should effectively organize more than 0.9 million office and enterprise cadres to study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three, and should continue to successfully carry out annual rotational training of grass-roots party members. Secretary Pu Chaozhu said: An important task facing the party's propaganda and ideological work at the moment is to guide public opinion correctly. We should firmly grasp key links, such as the mass media; make redoubled efforts to correctly guide the mass media; make the mass media contribute to continued reform, opening up, socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and legal system building; and make the mass media more capable of encouraging and mobilizing people to contribute to national prosperity, nationality solidarity, and social stability. To this end, we should energetically further reform in news and the mass media; strengthen news and mass media management; keep a firm grip on the mass media; give full scope to the principal mass media; make continued efforts to develop modern mass media; and step up foreign-related propaganda work. Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: At present, we should orient the party's propaganda and ideological work to training a new generation of socialist people with lofty ideals, moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and sense of discipline; step up ideological and ethical education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; further prosper socialist culture; work harder to meet the growing cultural demands of the broad masses of people; produce more healthy, beneficial, rich, varied, and strongly appealing spiritual products for the broad masses of the people. The propaganda, culture, and radio and television departments; literature and art federations; writers' associations; and social sciences academies at all levels across the province should meticulously organize the production of cultural products that reflect the theme of the times so as to enable the broad masses of the people to enjoy lots of excellent movies; television programs; plays; and musical, dance, fine arts, literary, and theoretical works every year. In conclusion, Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: Propaganda and ideological work has remained a crucial component of party building work. Party committees at all levels across the province should attach great importance to and earnestly enhance leadership over propaganda and ideological work; place propaganda and ideological work high on the agenda; acquire a profound understanding of the importance of propaganda and ideological work from the high strategic plane of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and of implementing and carrying out the party's basic line; provide this year's reforms with ideological guarantees; and energetically promote two civilizations in a coordinated fashion. This morning's conference was presided over by Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and attended by a number of provincial leaders, including Zhao Shumin, Li Jiating, Zhang Baoshan, Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Bao Yongkang, Zhao Tingguang, Li Jing, Li Linge, Qiu Chuangjiao, and others. More than 2,000 people attended this morning's conference, including the leaders and propaganda department directors of autonomous prefectural, prefectural, city, and county party committees; leaders of provincial departments, commissions, offices, bureaus, people's organizations and leading party groups; party committee leaders from institutions of higher learning; leaders of enterprises party committees; and participants in the on-going provincial higher education work conference, provincial foreign- related propaganda work conference, provincial cultural work conference, the eighth provincial radio and television work conference, provincial literary and art federation meeting, and provincial news and publication work conference.
