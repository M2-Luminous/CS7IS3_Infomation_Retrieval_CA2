FBIS4-22766 "jpusr045___94014" FBIS-USR-94-045 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 31 March 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS Zhirinovskiy Launches Libel Suits Zhirinovskiy Launches Libel Suits 944F0570B Moscow KOMMERSANT DAILY in Russian 31 Mar 94 p 14 944F0570B Moscow KOMMERSANT DAILY Russian CSO [Article by Andrey Kobich: "Lawsuits by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy Against the Mass Media: The Deputy Denies His KGB Connection"] [Text] Yesterday Deputy of the State Duma Vladimir Zhirinovskiy filed all at once five lawsuits for protection of his honor and dignity against various mass media at the Savelovskiy, Ostankinskiy, and Presnenskiy Courts of Moscow. The deputy priced the moral damage he suffered at 1.5 billion rubles [R] (the amounts of the lawsuits range from R100 million to R500 million). Meanwhile, three other lawsuits by the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] are already being considered by the courts. Mr. Zhirinovskiy is demanding compensation for the moral damage inflicted on him by unsubstantiated accusations of being a fascist and cooperating with the state security organs. According to Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attorney, Sergey Belyak, his client brought the first lawsuit for protection of honor and dignity against the POSTFACTUM agency, the newspaper MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, and former LDPR comrades-in-arms Yevgeniy Smirnov and Vladimir Bogachev. As early as 1990 they disseminated a leaflet in which they called Mr. Zhirinovskiy "a KGB secret associate and adventurer." MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA published, quoting POSTFACTUM, an interview with Mr. Bogachev in which similar expressions were used. However, in January 1993 proceedings in the case were postponed indefinitely. Zyuzinskiy Court Judge Galina Rodina was unable to evaluate the meaning of the words "seksot" (secret associate) and "adventurer." The records of the case were submitted to the Institute of the Russian Language for expert review. In the opinion of Mr. Belyak, rumors about Mr. Zhirinovskiy being a KGB agent started at that moment. Mr. Zhirinovskiy has already collected through the courts R20,000 from the STOLITSA magazine and R50,000 from the newspaper ROSSIYA over such charges. At present, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is defending his honor and dignity in two other courts. On 21 March proceedings were postponed in a case instituted against MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, which had accused Mr. Zhirinovskiy of having a KGB connection since his college years. Sergey Belyak stated that the case may be resolved amicably if the newspaper publishes a refutation. On 25 March proceedings were postponed in a case instituted against the newspaper MOSCOW TRIBUNE because of the failure of the author of the article, Colleen Sanders, to appear. In a report on his visit to the LDPR, Mr. Sanders stated that there were people wearing SS uniforms in Zhirinovskiy's entourage who were "cocking automatic rifles." The attorney maintains that the LDPR Statute does not call for armed units and fascist symbols. Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed a lawsuit at Ostankinskiy Court against the RGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company] Ostankino and Oleg Kalugin, who stated in the documentary "Hawk" shown on the eve of the elections to the State Duma that Zhirinovskiy was a recruited agent of Soviet special services. Moral damage to the LDPR leader was evaluated to be R300 million. Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed two lawsuits in Savelovskiy Court: against the VIP magazine and Anatoliy Sobchak (the amount of the lawsuit is R300 million), who believes that the LDPR "is a typical creature of the KGB," as well as against the VTRK [All-Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting Corporation], and Yegor Gaydar, who said in one of the broadcasts that Zhirinovskiy reminded him of "Hitler in 1929." Two lawsuits by Mr. Zhirinovskiy were lodged with Presnenskiy Court. The first is against the TV company NTV [Independent Television] and Andrey Kozyrev (for R300 million), who attributed to Mr. Zhirinovskiy the phrase "Russians above all" and on this basis accused him of being a fascist. The second lawsuit names the newspaper KURANTY (the amount of this lawsuit is R100 million), to which Mr. Zhirinovskiy allegedly stated that "clan and tribal societies" (the Balts, Tajiks, and Uzbeks) should starve rather than live at the expense of Russians. Sergey Belyak noted that the General Procuracy has instituted a criminal case against his client for war propaganda (see KOMMERSANT, 27 January 1994) on the basis of this publication, as well as the book "The Final Thrust Southward."
