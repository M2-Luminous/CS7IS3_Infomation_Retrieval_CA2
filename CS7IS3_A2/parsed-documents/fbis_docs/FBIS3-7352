The news analyst says: By "strong retaliation," he meant to unleash a nuclear war against the North in conspiracy with outside forces, and by "making use of an event of contingency as an opportunity to achieve unification," he meant to "unify the country by prevailing over communism" through a war with the help of outside forces. This was an open provocation against the North and a declaration of confrontation. His provoking words against the North such as "strong retaliation" came after the entire puppet Armed Forces were placed in readiness for attack on the North at a time when the U.S. imperialists' aggression forces including nuclear carriers were moving close to the Korean peninsula. No one can dare act and speak like that, but those who are anxious to ignite a war. However, the puppets' attempt to undermine the socialism of the North where the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind is as foolish as trying to break a rock with a rotten egg. If the puppets dare ignite a war to destroy our system like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, we will deal a heavy retaliatory blow at them.
