"The Security Council is empowered to prevent attacks on safe havens (in Bosnia-Herzegovina), which can be done by taking any action necessary, including air strikes," the embassy said in a statement published Sunday after a mortar attack on a Sarajevo market Saturday killed 66 and wounded 200. The Bosnian capital is one of six UN-designated "safe havens" in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic. "The international community has also pledged to prevent any further strangulation of the city of Sarajevo," the statement added. "It stands to reason that by not using its full powers and commitments, the Security Council in fact supports the aggressor and encourages his crimes." Differing with the UN, the embassy went on to say that an attack on a food line in the suburb of Dobrinja on Friday killed 12 people and wounded 40. Latest figures from the UN Protection Force in Sarajevo put the number of deaths at 10. It added that the mortar shells which exploded at Dobrinja "were fired in a precise way at the line of people waiting for humanitarian aid." The statement confirmed that 66 people were killed when a shell hit the Markale marketplace in Sarajevo on Saturday.
