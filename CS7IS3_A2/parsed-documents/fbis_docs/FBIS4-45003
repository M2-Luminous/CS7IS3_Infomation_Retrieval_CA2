Its rational management requires investments... In that context, and for the year under way, the Hydraulics Directorate has decided on an action plan that includes strengthening the potable water system (AEP) and capturing and mobilizing more water resources. Specifically, the plan involves 19 projects either already launched or soon to be started, which among other things will increase water resource mobilization capacity in the locality of Ammari and bring potable water from the Theniet El-Had AEP to the communes of Guisba, Laayoun, Ferradj, and Khemisti. The latter project, which has been entrusted to the Hydro-Projet company, is already under way. Another project in this sector involves bringing potable water for the locality of Lardjem from wells in Rechaiga (Tiaret wilaya) via Tissemsilt. This operation has finally put an end to the problem of potable water supply for the daira's chief town, which is situated about 40 km from Tissemsilt. Previously, potable water was brought to the town in tank trucks. The system is operated by by the Tissemsilt Water Production and Management Enterprise. However, while this project has finally brought relief to Lardjem, inhabitants of the daira of Bordj Bou-Naama and its 12 attached localities must be patient, since it will be awhile before they enjoy a regular and adequate supply of the precious liquid. Water resources being sparse in this part of the wilaya, water use in the daira is strictly controlled under a potable water distribution program. According to the director of hydraulics, a definitive solution of the problem will require building a dam with a storage capacity of 80 million cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]], at the site known as Koudiat-Frarsfa. Studies for this water project have been designed and carried out. Under the heading of AEPs, it may be opportune to note also that work has begun, in the chief town of the wilaya, on a water tower with a storage capacity of 1,000 m[.sup]3[/]. This water project will increase potable water storage and distribution capacities in the town, which is experiencing rapid growth, especially on the northern outskirts. On the drainage front, three large AEP projects have been approved, one of them adding 14 km of pipe in seven zones in the chief town of the wilaya. The other two projects involve building a 2-km concrete conduit for transporting waste water. Realization of these two projects has been entrusted to Hydro-Technique, an Algiers-based company that specializes in the field and has a contract to build a small dam with a storage capacity of 4 million m[.sup]3[/]. That's in addition to another project, the dam at Bougara, which has a storage capacity of 14 million m[.sup]3[/]. The dam has not been exploited since going into service in 1991. A study of irrigation possibilities has just been completed. Water from the Bougara dam will be devoted exclusively to irrigation of an agricultural perimeter, according to the hydraulics directorate.
