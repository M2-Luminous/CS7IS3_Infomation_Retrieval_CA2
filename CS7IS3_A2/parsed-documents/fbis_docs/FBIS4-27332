Among these measures, those concerning the timing and necessary conditions for ordering "the mobilization of troops for defense [boei-shutsudo]" are most noticeable. North Korea has a special force composed of about 60,000-100,000 troops, of which 2,000 allegedly specialize in infiltration and subversive activities. It has been argued that if the U.S. Forces make a bombing raid on North Korea from Japan in the case of a contingency, some of these specially trained soldiers might infiltrate Japan with the aim of blowing up or attacking nuclear power plants, Shinkansen bullet train lines, airports, military bases, and government offices. However, if they take off their coats and show uniforms of the Korean People's Army just before they attack, Japan has to treat them as prisoners in some cases in line with international law. The prime minister can order mobilization for defense "when Japan is attacked by a foreign country" and "when there are signs of armed attack against Japan." But as a rule, he needs to obtain a prior Diet approval. In an emergency, he is allowed to obtain the approval immediately after ordering mobilization for defense. Without the order for mobilization for defense, the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] cannot take defensive actions outside bases. In this case, police carry out defense duties. But it is impossible for police officers to fight against specially trained soldiers just with guns and billy clubs. This is the reason that the government stresses the need for studying mobilization for defense in its documents on the DPRK issue. Once mobilization for defense is ordered, Japan makes combat preparations. The SDF is allowed to use force. Meanwhile, the Defense Agency [DA] is authorized to control private hospitals and clinics through prefectural governors, expropriate land and houses, and give orders to people busy in medicare, construction, and transport. The SDF can also take over duties from police to maintain public law and order. The Maritime Safety Agency falls under the control of the DA director general. Local governments, police, and fire fighters are obliged to cooperate with the SDF. Procedures for wartime preparations and compensations will be stipulated by government ordinances, which the government is scheduled to issue when an emergency occurs. The phrase "when there are signs of armed attack against Japan" does not mean if there is the least probability of attack, but means when there is high probability. This is the interpretation of this phrase. However, it is difficult to know the movements of a foreign special force. If the DA asserts "various kinds of information show a high probability of attack," the Diet will not be able to rebut it. Some DA officials note that because the actions of special forces are tantamount to criminal acts, the mobilization of troops to maintain public peace and order [shian-shutsudo] is more appropriate than mobilization for defense. However, shian-shutsudo is ordered by governors and does not require a Diet approval. Thus, it is feared that in a tense situation, shian-shutsudo might be ordered easily.
