The requirements are coming as part of the agreement by the North Sea nations to reduce by half the leaking of nutrients into the sea by 1995. The contribution by agriculture to the overfertilization of the sea became a controversial subject on Wednesday [8 December] at the ministerial meeting in Copenhagen on the nations' efforts to restore the ecological balance in the North Sea. England and France refused to join an agreement that by 1990 [as published] or no later than 1992 [as published] agriculture must have switched to what is called balanced fertilization. Exactly what such fertilization means has not been specified, but the purpose is to reduce the excess nutrient salts in the sea to a minimum. This goal is in line with the European Union's so-called nitrate directives, which take effect with the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. Overfertilization As a foundation for the agreement in Copenhagen, each of the eight North Sea nations has indicated which areas are most sensitive to overfertilization. The excess nutrient salts cause abnormal algae growth and disturbs the entire marine ecosystem. England regards itself as not having any problems of overfertilization at all along its coasts. As for the rest of the North Sea, the British Government believes that it could be a matter of "little bits here and there." "We cannot sign a decision to solve a problem that does not exist," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Earl Howe, who headed the British delegation to the Copenhagen conference. He also was not of the opinion that it has been scientifically proven that leakage of nutrient salts and pesticides from British agriculture can cross the North Sea and affect other countries' marine areas. France admits that there is a transitional problem to deal with, but does not want to agree to a deadline for measures. Reactionaries Sweden's Agriculture Minister Karl Erik Olsson tells DAGENS NYHETER that on this point the British can only be described as "stubborn reactionaries" in environmental cooperation. Karl Erik Olsson believes that Sweden, for its part, has a chance of being able to cut its nitrogen emissions in half by 1995 "or about then." He reveals that he will shortly submit a proposal for stricter environmental requirements for the way Swedish farmers handle fertilizer. "We must reduce emissions of ammonia to the air from fertilizer plants as well as the handling of the fertilizer in the fields. We can do this by, among other things, using better spreaders for liquid fertilizer and by mixing it into the soil faster." The stricter requirements apply primarily to the farmers of southern and western Sweden. Since, according to Karl Erik Olsson, this will mean expensive new investments by the farmer in new equipment, he promises a generous transition period before new regulations take effect. Strong Words At the conclusion of the Copenhagen conference with a news conference on Wednesday [8 December], Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken in harsh words condemned "the refusal by some large and prosperous industrial nations to deal with their wastewater treatment." One-third of all the wastewater flowing into the North Sea is untreated. Svend Auken did not mention any countries by name, but it is well known that France, Belgium, and England are the principal ones. Their wastewater contains very large amounts of by and large every environmental poison which affects the North Sea.
