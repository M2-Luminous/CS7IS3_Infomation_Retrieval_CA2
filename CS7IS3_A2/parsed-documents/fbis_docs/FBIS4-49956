Regional party, government, and military leaders who attended the meeting included [provincial party Secretary] Zhao Fulin, [provincial Governor] Cheng Kejie, [congress head] Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li Zhenqian, Peng Guikang, Li Enchao, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, Zhi Zhaotang, Chen Ren, Huang Yuyang, Mao Guobin, Rui Qingkai, and others. The meeting was presided over by regional party Deputy Secretary Ding Tingmo. Regional Chairman Cheng Kejie first relayed the spirit of the Fourth Central Discussion on Family Planning Work and made arrangements for family planning work in our region this year. He pointed out: Leaders at all levels must fully understand the current population situation in our region and further grasp family planning work in a firm and effective manner. Last year, thanks to the concern and leadership of the party committees and governments at all levels, our region fulfilled the population control plan assigned by the state. This was not an easy job. However, we must realize soberly that the present population situation in our region is still grave as is mainly reflected in the following: 1. Our population base is large and comprises many young people with a rapid population growth rate; 2. Our foundation for family planning work is weak; 3. There are new situation and problems arising in family planning work in the course of establishing a socialist market economic system; in particular, an increase in the floating population in cities and towns has made our family planning work more difficult. We must seriously deal with these problems. We must persistently and unswervingly treat control over population growth as a fundamental task in economic development. Cheng Kejie continued: Our region's targets for population control this year have been examined, discussed, and approved by the Second Session of the Eighth Regional People's Congress. In other words, our natural population growth rate must be controlled within the range of 14.04 per mill. The birth rate, population natural growth rate, and additional births rate must be lower than last year. The birth control rate must be increased to over 80 percent. To fulfill the abovementioned targets, the regional people's government urges leaders at all levels to truly grasp family planning work. This problem must be handled seriously. Leaders must do a solid job of paying attention to the grass-roots levels, laying a good foundation, and constantly helping to enhance grass-roots units' capability to control population growth. It is necessary to strengthen the building of the family planning contingent at the grass-roots level and put effort into improving the quality of the cadres' contingent and closely linking propaganda and ideological work with management according to law. It is necessary to compile population statistics properly. Starting from this year, regional authorities will organize forces to examine and check population statistics. In places where population statistics are grossly inaccurate, the relevant leaders and the specific persons in charge will be held accountable in a serious manner. Under the new situation, we must persist in carrying out reform, explore the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth manner to raise our region's family planning work to a new level. At the meeting, Secretary Zhao Fulin aired his views on grasping our region's family planning work properly this year. He stressed: Leaders at all levels must conscientiously study and resolutely implement the spirit of the central discussion on family planning work. They must make an overall analysis of the population situation and family grasp planning work in a strict and unshakable manner. At present, we must particularly grasp family planning work in rural areas. We must assign cadres responsible for family planning work and their remuneration, duties, and responsibilities must be clearly defined. Births not covered by the state plan, or additional births, must be resolutely banned. Additional births must be controlled within the range of less than 5 percent. In addition, we must attach importance to family planning work in areas inhabited by minority nationalities. Zhao Fulin pointed out: Under the new situation of establishing our socialist market economic system, we must actively explore and expand new methods of family planning work. The foothold of family planning work must be shifted to the center of serving economic construction. In this regard, the Guilin area has accumulated some excellent experiences. Facts prove that the three-way combination in family planning work is beneficial to coordinate the development of the population, economy, and society. The whole region must sum up and popularize the advanced experiences of the Guilin area. As far as strengthening leadership is concerned, we must insist that those number one men in the party and government personally grasp family planning work and take full responsibility for it. They must put family planning high on their important work agenda and personally preside over party and government meetings to specially discuss family planning issues. They must listen to work reports regularly, investigate implementation of the population plan, and ensure that work is carried out in a planned way, arrangements are properly made, investigations are conducted, and plans are implemented. Prefectural, city, and county leaders must include a population plan in the local overall plans for economic and social development and see to it that the plan is implemented. Family planning work must be regarded as an important factor determining party and government cadres' achievements, awards and commendation, and promotion. In a word, as long as those number one men in the party and government truly attach importance to family planning work, and grasp it personally, family planning work can definitely be carried out well. Lan Siqi, chairman of the regional family planning commission, briefed attendees on the family planning situation in our region last year and on work plans for this year. At the meeting, the Guilin, Yulin, and Nanning areas and Beihai City passed on their experiences in three-way combination, helping counties attain their targets, and carrying out family planning work well. Party and government leaders from various prefectures, cities and counties, as well as relevant departments directly under the regional authorities also attended the meeting.
