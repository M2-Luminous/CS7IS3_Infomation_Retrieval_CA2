This was announced by Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah who also said that the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries in Abha yesterday was not cordial toward his country, and does not help in implementing the UN Security Council resolution. After criticizing any outside interference in Yemeni affairs, Basindwah said he hopes that the neighboring countries will review their stands as it is in these countries' interest to be on the side of legitimacy, or at least to adopt a stand of neutrality. He said that the Gulf stand will encourage the southerners not to respect the international resolution. In reply to a question on a possible Saudi military intervention in Yemen, Basindwah said he believes that it will not reach the extent of military interference. He added that he has summoned the GCC ambassadors to inform them about Yemen's indignation at the Abha statement. As for what Sanaa will do if the proclaimed Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] wins recognition, Basindwah said that Yemeni unity was attained by the Yemeni people, and recognition will not change anything with respect to the existence of a legitimate Yemeni state. Basindwah said that the Yemeni officials held no contacts with any Gulf country since the decision [proclaiming the establishment of the DRY] was issued. [passage omitted]
