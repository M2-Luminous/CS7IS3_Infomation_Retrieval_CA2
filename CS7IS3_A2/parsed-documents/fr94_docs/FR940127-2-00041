FR940127-2-00041 FR940127-2-00031 [FRL&hyph;4829&hyph;6] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before February 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION OR A COPY OF THE ICR CONTACT: Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response Title: Land Disposal Restrictions No-Migration Variances. (EPA No. 1353.04; OMB No. 2050&hyph;0062). This ICR is a renewal of an approved collection. Abstract: Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, prohibits land disposal of hazardous wastes beyond specified dates unless the owner/operator of a hazardous waste storage or disposal facility demonstrates to the Administrator of EPA that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the land disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The regulated community can petition for a variance from statutory prohibitions or treatment requirements promulgated under section 3004, to continue land disposal of specific hazardous wastes at specific facilities. The requirements for obtaining these variances and the associated costs are discussed in detail in the ICR. The Permits and State Programs Division, Office of Solid Waste, will review the petitions and determine if they successfully demonstrate no migration. Granting of a variance will be based upon successful demonstration that hazardous wastes can be managed safely in a particular land disposal unit, so that no migration of any hazardous constituents occurs from the unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The statutory requirement for an application by an interested person is intended to place the burden on the applicant to prove that a specified waste can be contained safely in a particular type of disposal unit. Burden statement: The respondent burden for the no-migration petition is estimated to be 9,240 hours for each facility planning to request a variance. Respondents: Owners/Operators of Hazardous Waste Storage or Disposal Facilities. Estimated number of respondents: 2. Estimated number of responses per respondent: 1. Estimated total annual burden on respondents: 18,492 hours. Frequency of collection: As needed. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspects of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (PM&hyph;223Y), 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 and Jonathan Gledhill, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th St. NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: January 17, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1733 Filed 1&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
