We want to respectfully inform our readers: 1. ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO is run by the Ministry of Justice of the PRC, and accepts subscriptions through post offices throughout the country. The postal issuance code is 1-198. 2. Because ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO was founded relatively recently, it has not been listed in the nationwide newspapers and journals subscription catalogue. For this reason, the Publication Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in Beijing has sent telegrams to the publication bureaus of post offices in provinces and municipalities throughout the country, asking them to accept subscriptions on behalf of ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO. Therefore, various post offices and stations please perform subscription formalities for readers according to the above-mentioned notice. 3. According to information, at present, there are readers in quite a lot of places who still cannot subscribe to ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO at post offices. In order to promptly solve this problem, apart from requesting post offices to actively accept subscriptions, ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO will accept direct subscriptions from readers. The specific method is: A reader may send subscription money (6.6 yuan for a quarter, 26.4 yuan for a year) directly to the distribution department of ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO before 31 December 1993 (do not send remittance by wire). Using the name and address on the remittance notice, the distribution department will send newspapers to the reader once every two issues. 4. ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO will also publish bound volumes. One volume will be published every six months, the price is 30 yuan; a total of two volumes will be published every year, and the price is 60 yuan (including postage).
