The Israeli attacks on the citizens led to the destruction of numerous houses and the death and wounding of a number of victims as a result of the rocket bombardment by the special units without concern for the lives, safety, and possessions of the civilians, the blood of whose brothers at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has not dried up yet. The brother President Abu-'Ammar pointed out that these kinds of Israeli practices would reflect negatively on the peace process and cause concern at this sensitive stage of the development of the situation in the Middle East. The brother President Abu-'Ammar asked Secretary Christopher for an immediate intervention to put an end to this aggression against the secure citizens, who are being besieged as a result of the curfew imposed by the Israeli occupation forces since the brutal massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.
