This was the last day in Rome for the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] floor leader, who is to begin his electoral campaign as a "red" candidate in Gallipoli. In the area of traditionally Catholic Puglia, the PDS starts from a support level of 15 percent. He was packing his belongings, looking through a bundle of letters, most of them handwritten. "I got thousands of them," he said, "following Craxi's accusations. Some of them are very moving, wonderful -- a mirror of Italy, a civilized country." [Marroni] In which now a right-wing wind is blowing, according to Umberto Eco. [D'Alema] It is undeniable, and a reason for concern. But I do not believe the Right has won yet. I disagree with the bitter tone of Eco's closing remarks in the interview. The Right has no idea how to govern Italy. The Right means disintegration, and people are aware of this. [Marroni] Certainly not the people -- Eco would say -- who are not used to a strict fatherly figure, but rather to collusive uncles and understanding mothers -- and who this time might decide to vote for "Uncle Berlusconi"... [D'Alema] True, the Right does adhere to a certain Italian ethos, an opportunistic ethos that rejects the state, not because this ethos abhors social-democratic statism -- which we have never had in Italy, anyway -- but rather, because it abhors the very idea of legality. What does this Right amount to, apart from a jumble of particular interests? They have mustered all the areas of privilege, great and small. As a result, however, their messages are contradictory: ultraliberal in the North, welfarist in the South... [Marroni] Therein lies the strength of the [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi operation. [D'Alema] But also its weakness. Only the DC [Christian Democratic Party] managed to keep together such disparate interests. However, it had the anticommunist binder on its side and, above all, it made use of the public expenditure flywheel: Both of these elements are now missing. Berlusconi will have to choose which promises to keep; but whatever his choice, he will be unable to keep Italy together. You will see: In the end, the fear of a Yugoslavia-type process will act on citizens' consciousness. We often hear talk of a new 1948. It is true. However, international public opinion is now becoming the first to realize that the roles have been reversed. Today it is the Left which is offering the prospect of progress with no adventurism. [Marroni] [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti is taking care of that. [D'Alema] Bertinotti should keep quiet. The Left is the force of possible and necessary change. It will win if it reassures people, not if it frightens them. What is disconcerting, however, is the demise of the Center. [Marroni] Do you miss the old DC? [D'Alema] Not at all. The risk that the PPI [Italian Popular Party] may have to pay a very high tribute to the electoral law, without however stemming the drift toward the Right, results precisely from its shortsighted attempt to repropose the DC's centrality. [Marroni] Would you have liked [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli to have joined the Left? [D'Alema] Of course. He would have endowed the progressives with a greater ability to persuade the moderates. Alternatively, he should have taken on the leadership of the conservative front, together with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, rather than leave it in the hands of disquieting characters... [Marroni] It often looks as if the Left is annoyed that there should also be a Right. [D'Alema] The problem is not the Right in itself, but rather, this Right. Someone like Thatcher would have been useful in Italy. Instead, we are confronted by a heterogeneous aggregate, which lacks an experienced leadership. A dangerous aggregate. [Marroni] Dangerous? [D'Alema] I am not afraid for democracy. I am frightened by the government vacuum which can be inferred from the ambiguity of the Berlusconi-Bossi-Fini threesome. There is [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini who is saying that he is not [League Secretary] Bossi's ally, and there is Bossi who swears he will never join the fascists in government. So, either the Right has no idea how it intends to govern the country, or it is attempting some trick or other. [Marroni] Are you not perhaps painting the Right as the devil? [D'Alema] It was not us who opened the "civilized debate" with a call to arms to fight communism. The progressives joined forces "for" something, around a platform. The Right joined forces "against" something, with hatred for the Left as its sole unifying element. [Marroni] You yourselves, however, disparage Berlusconi's proposals, calling them "promises." Conversely, the fact that you are making no promises could mean that you are not in the position to assume any obligations. [D'Alema] I also believe that the Left must abandon a purely defensive position. It will win if it emphasizes its positive proposals for government and gives assurances. We must put forward more forcefully our own distinctive position on decisive issues. We must commit ourselves -- to begin with, on the economic front, by closely linking recovery to a policy that is capable of ensuring sustained development and create jobs. We must address the tax issue in this light, not by promising the impossible, but by promising fairness. [Marroni] Do you still bear Berlusconi a grudge? [D'Alema] Well, personally I see no reason why I should. On the contrary, I should be joining Forza Italia. With my salary, combined with the 30 percent flat IRPEF [personal income tax] contribution and the scrapping of compulsory enrollment in the health service, Berlusconi in government would allow me to earn an extra 16,200,000 lire every year. On the other hand, all those workers earning 1.5 million lire a month would lose 1.5 million lire a year. Then they have muddled things up with the story of the deductions. However, the basic fact remains that either this platform amounts to something -- in which case its social costs will be enormous -- or else it is just so much hot air, in which case it is obvious that a right-wing government would fuel inflation, and take us farther away from Europe. [Marroni] A few evenings ago, [PDS Secretary] Occhetto rebuked Fini for joining forces with Berlusconi. I would have expected you to do the opposite. [D'Alema] I think no one can doubt that Fini is more reliable, and less involved in the old establishment. The MSI is what it is, but as a party it has some political dignity, and some sort of base. However, it is the most corrupt sectors of civil and political society that have given birth to Forza Italia. It is an agonizing prospect to think that this country may have gotten rid of Craxi only to put his buddy in his place. [Marroni] What about Bossi? [D'Alema] Bossi made a historic mistake. By siding with the recycled elements of the old establishment, the League has completely lost its combat force characteristics. More than any other party, the bandwagon [League nickname] should have recognized a danger in Berlusconi -- a trump up the sleeve of the old establishment. The League is now paying for the lack of experience of its leadership, which was bamboozled by TV, money, daydreaming. "These guys will enable us to seize power because they will win in the South." But, as a matter of fact, the only ones who have the courage to speak to the man in the street in the South are the progressives and the MSI. [Marroni] In people's homes, however, it is TV -- big brother -- who does the speaking. [D'Alema] Yes, Big Brother has appeared in people's homes -- and he does have an impact. If you think of all the trash the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] networks have inflicted on us in the last couple of months. [Marroni] Are the progressives not exaggerating the extent of the Knight's TV power? [D'Alema] I will limit myself to reminding you that, in a country with a majority-based electoral system, it is essential that everyone gets the same amount of coverage. This is not the case in our country. Nowhere else would a broadcasting tycoon have been allowed to found his own party. [Marroni] However, you also know how to use television. Have you followed special courses, like Forza Italia's candidates? [D'Alema] Of course not. I only try to say things clearly, and occasionally I try to have a witty reply ready. [Marroni] As a matter of fact, it was during a television appearance, a few weeks ago, that you spoke of a constituent government being set up after the elections. You no longer mention this now. Were you just bluffing? [D'Alema] This issue inevitably looms in the background, in a campaign such as this. I am glad to see that Martinazzoli is aware of this, but if the Right wins, his speeches will just be speeches. We can only pave the way for a constituent, caretaker government -- a national reconstruction government which is not, clearly, a left- wing government -- if the progressives manage to stop the Right. If we do not succeed, one of two things will happen: Either the country becomes ungovernable, or a government bringing together Bossi, Fini, and Berlusconi will in fact be formed. And I really hope I will never have to witness what those three are capable of doing together.
