There has been no amendment to the party progamme, despite significant changes in the political situation both within the country and abroad. The redrafting committee, which includes Mr Jyoti Basu and Mr Anil Biswas, editor of GANASAKTI, as representatives from West Bengal, met last month in New Delhi but is reportedly yet to come out with any concrete proposals. In fact, senior leaders say that the CPI(M) finds itself in a dilemma over the policy that it should follow. Sources say that the 1964 party programme, which borrowed heavily from the Chinese line of the Progressive Democratic Front, now seems anachronistic considering the momentous changes in Beijing which, of late, has been cosying up to the International Monetary Fund. This ideological crisis has been deepened by the break-up of the Soviet Union and the current political instability in Russia. However, the State CPI(M) has apparently little time to deliberate on these theoretical issues as its leaders are reportedly busy suppressing internecine conflicts and charges of corruption against party leaders. Veteran leaders say that the conflicts within the party can be gauged by the demand for State plenums. Such demands have been raised in Kerala and Tripura, two strongholds of the party. Some time ago, such a demand was raised in West Bengal by the former State Education Minister, Mr Partha Dey. Dissident leaders in the State CPI(M) say that corruption has been pushed to the top of the party's agenda in the State. They allege that it has become so rampant and widespread that even the Chief Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu, who earlier preferred to gloss over the complaints has reportedly expressed serious concern. Sources said that Mr Basu was informed by the Centre of the involvement of local CPI(M) leaders in the alleged pilferage of Metro Railway property from Noapara stockyard and Railway property from Kancharapara. Responding to this, Mr Basu reportedly asked his party secretary, Mr Sailen Dasgupta, to probe the matter. However, sources say that the party hiearchy now finds the situation beyond its control. Mr Dasgupta reportedly called a meeting of the local committee of the party at Baranagor to look into the complaints of Metro Railway contractors. However, sources said that he could not attend the meeting owing to stiff resistance from a section of the party. Dissidents allege that in North and South 24-Parganas, the party is virtually split between haves and have nots--"those who can make money and those who cannot." The CPI(M) leadership is allegedly unable to take drastic action as corruption has reportedly spread its network far and wide. Disgruntled CPI(M) leaders allege that in South 24-Parganas a bitter confrontation is being witnessed over several bheris where a strong lobby--headed by a State Minister and close associates of the party leadership--calls the shots. Many in the rank and file of the party complain that the party leadership does not take action against the people at the top but take disciplinary measures against those at the bottom of the hiearchy. This has been indicated, they allege, by the relatively light punishment meted out to the Calcutta district committee members, who were allegedly close to the satta don, Rashid Khan. Members of the inner circle of the party say that in the context of the crisis looming over the party, Mr Basu is now looking for a relatively easy way out. Sources say that, therefore, an early election cannot be ruled out.
