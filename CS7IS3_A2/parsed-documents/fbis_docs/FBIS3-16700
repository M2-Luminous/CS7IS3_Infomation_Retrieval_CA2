Our correspondent reports from the congress. [Correspondent] The representatives of the various youth organizations, in particular, the organizations of the higher schools, plants, enterprises, oblast youth amalgamations, and representatives of all the regions of the republic are taking part in the congress. [passage omitted] Emomali Rakhmonov, the head of state and chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Tajikistan spoke at the congress. In particular, he said the following: [Begin Rakhmonov recording] Dear brothers and sisters, it is pleasant that this meeting and the youth congress are taking place on the eve of Navruz [Tajik New Year Day, 21 March]. I can see the representatives of the youth of all parts of our Republic in this hall and I am encouraged by the fact that the unity and integrity of the independent Republic of Tajikistan is being further strengthened. I am happy that the representatives of all nationalities living in our beloved country who are working for the prosperity and development of our country are sitting in this hall. It is a pleasant thing that the youths have gathered here after the completion of the severe examinations of life with the hope of planning for a good future. Life itself is a real master [words indistinct] and opens the real image of the politicians and those people who are fighting for positions. Those people who argued about democracy until recently [words indistinct] and considered themselves as patriots and leaders of the nation have exerted pressure on the legitimate government and committed murder, robbery, and persecution of the representatives of certain rayons and regions of Tajikistan. Instead of honest labor during the sowing season they [politicians] involved the people in long-term rallies, they did not spare the lives of youths who were deluded, they began the distribution of positions and properties, and violated the law and political behavior. They insulted, murdered, and robbed representatives of other nationalities who had worked and lived with us Tajiks for a long time. Reminding you of this, I want to warn the youths. Youth has to learn from past mistakes. They have to be united in the future and should follow the [way of] unity and solidarity because the youths are the future political figures, leaders of parties and movements, ministries and departments, and so on. Now that we are pursuing the road to a democratic society, we have to get used to tolerating multiparty and political pluralism and recognize it. [end recording] [Correspondent] Following the afternoon break, the congress continued its work and its participants discussed a number of issues that are included on the congress agenda. The first congress of the Union of Youths of Tajikistan will continue its work tomorrow.
