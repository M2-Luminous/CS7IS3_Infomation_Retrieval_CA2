FR940216-0-00156 FR940216-0-00010 IX. Anti-Dumping Compliance and Enforcement Requirements for Conventional Gasoline The final rule implements section 211(k)(8) of the Clean Air Act which provides that beginning January 1, 1995, average per gallon emissions of specified pollutants from non-reformulated or conventional gasoline use must not deteriorate relative to emissions from 1990 gasoline on a refiner or importer basis. This could occur, for example, if fuel components or properties that cause harmful emissions and that are removed from or limited in reformulated gasoline, are ``dumped'' into conventional (non-reformulated) gasoline. As a result, the ``anti-dumping'' program limits the emissions of specified pollutants from conventional gasolines, and under certain circumstances from blendstocks (based on EPA's authority under section 211(k)(c) of the Act). The final rule differs from the earlier proposals primarily in the area of blendstock accounting. These changes are discussed in greater detail below. Refiners and importers must establish individual 1990 baselines in order to compare the emissions characteristics of gasoline they produced or imported in 1990 with the emissions characteristics of conventional gasoline produced or imported in 1995 and later. See section VIII for a discussion of the methods required for development of an individual baseline. The baseline for refiners who were not in business in 1990, and in certain cases for other importers and refiner-blenders, is the statutory baseline found at ยง80.91(c)(5) of the regulations. Refiners who operate more than one refinery have the option of demonstrating compliance with the anti-dumping provisions for each refinery separately, or the refiner may group its refineries and show compliance for each group separately provided that each refinery's performance is accounted for either separately or as part of a refinery group. The refiner's refinery-grouping election may not be changed after the initial election. Blendstock tracking and accounting as discussed below, must be determined in accordance with the same refinery grouping as chosen for compliance purposes. The final rule has three separate sets of compliance standards for determining compliance with the anti-dumping requirements, however, only one set applies to a refiner or importer at any one time. These are the Simple Model standards and Optional Complex Model standards, that apply in 1995, 1996, and 1997; and the Mandatory Complex Model standards that apply in 1998 and thereafter. All three sets of standards require refiners and importers to average certain properties of conventional gasoline and demonstrate compliance with prescribed standards, which in some cases are actual fuel properties and in others are emissions products calculated from specific fuel properties. 79 79 For a discussion of issues concerning which properties or pollutants are covered in the federal anti-dumping program, see section VIII of this preamble and the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, published July 9, 1991 (56 FR 31219&hyph;31222). Under the Simple Model standards, a refiner or importer is required to demonstrate on an annual basis that average exhaust benzene emissions of conventional gasoline do not exceed the refiner's or importer's 1990 compliance baseline for exhaust benzene emissions, and that average sulfur, olefins and T90 each do not exceed 125% of the refiner's or importer's 1990 average levels for each of these parameters. Under the Optional Complex Model standards, annual average levels of exhaust benzene emissions, volume weighted for each batch as determined under the applicable model, may not exceed the refiner's or importer's 1990 average exhaust benzene emissions calculated in the same manner. Under the Mandatory Complex Model standards, annual average levels of exhaust toxic emissions and NO X emissions, volume weighted for each batch as determined under the applicable model, may not exceed the refiner's or importer's 1990 average levels for exhaust toxic emissions and NO X emissions calculated in the same manner. Refiners and importers are required to determine the emissions performance for each batch of gasoline in either the applicable summer or winter model based on whether or not the batch has been designated to comply with EPA volatility requirements. The final rule provides that in 1995, 1996, and 1997, refiners and importers may determine compliance based on either the Simple Model standards or the Optional Complex Model standards, at their option. However, a refiner that produces reformulated gasoline under the Simple Model must use the Simple Model anti-dumping standards, and a refiner that produces reformulated gasoline under the optional complex model must use with the Optional Complex Model anti-dumping standards. Refiners and importers are required to include the following products, which are produced or imported during each averaging period, in anti-dumping compliance calculations: conventional gasoline; non-gasoline petroleum products if required under the blendstock accounting provisions (discussed below); and gasoline blending stock which becomes conventional gasoline upon the addition of oxygenate (discussed below).
