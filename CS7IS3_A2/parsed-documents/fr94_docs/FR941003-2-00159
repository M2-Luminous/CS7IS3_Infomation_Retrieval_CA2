FR941003-2-00159 FR941003-2-00052 Privacy Act of 1974; Amendment to Existing Notices of Systems of Records AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Notice of updates to existing systems of records. SUMMARY: OPM proposes to rescind routine uses recently added to two existing record systems. DATES: The changes will become effective without further notice on date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register (October 3, 1994). ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to C. Ronald Trueworthy, Chief, Information Policy Branch, Room CHP 500, Plans and Policies Division, Office of Information Resources Management, Administration Group, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leslie Crawford, 703&hyph;908&hyph;8550. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published changes to four existing system notices (59 FR 30817). The routine uses added to OPM/Central&hyph;10 (Directory of Federal Executive Institute Alumni) and OPM/Central&hyph;11 (Presidential Management Intern Program Records) by that publication allowed disclosure of names and home address of participants and alumni of the programs to other program participants and alumni. It has been determined that the Federal Executive Institute already obtains consent for disclosure directly from the individuals involved, and the Presidential Management Intern program will establish a similar procedure for release of such data. Therefore, routine uses to cover disclosure of the information are not necessary, and routine use ``m'' added to OPM/Central&hyph;10 and routine use ``n'' added to OPM/Central&hyph;11 are hereby rescinded. Lorraine A. Green, Deputy Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24288 Filed 9&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6325&hyph;01&hyph;M
