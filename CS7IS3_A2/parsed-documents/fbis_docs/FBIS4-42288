The Liberals are well placed for a good result. Barely four weeks before the election to the European Parliament on 9 June, the Gallup Institute conducted a poll for BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on current support for competing parties and their candidate lists. The poll shows that every seventh eligible Danish voter is still not clear about the fact that an election is to be held for the European Parliament on 9 June. This is a remarkably large proportion of the population, and it must be expected that this will become significantly smaller when the vote placards go up and the campaign begins in earnest. Every Third in Doubt Another interesting result of Gallup's poll is that every third voter (35 percent) is in doubt as to what he is voting for. At the same time, every 11th voter (9 percent) has already decided not to vote on 9 June. This proportion can be expected to rise somewhat. In any case, the three previous European Parliament elections have had very low voting percentages. At the present juncture, every second voter (51 percent) has decided how he is going to cast his ballot, and -- viewing the vote distribution among this half of the electorate -- one sees several clear tendencies. Liberal Party Ahead In comparison to the last European Parliament election, the Liberals are in position to have a good election, with 28 percent of the voters, while the Center Democrats (CD) look as if they will lose so many voters that the CD will get no seats in the new European Parliament. At present the Radical Liberals are poised to gain 6 percent, and if this result holds, then the party will have a possibility of getting its first seat in the European Parliament. The People's Movement Against the European Union [EU] is poised right now to lose two-thirds of its support, and got only 6 percent, while The June Movement [also opposed to the Union] would now get 9 percent among those who have made up their minds, and this means that this list currently has larger support than the People's Movement. Together these two anti-EU lists have support of only 15 percent of those who have made up their minds, which is less than many had expected. Gallup would like to emphasize, however, that this is a very early survey, so that the final vote result may turn out quite differently, since electoral alliances may play a role. In addition, many people are simply not aware there is going to be an election, and the election campaign has hardly started.
