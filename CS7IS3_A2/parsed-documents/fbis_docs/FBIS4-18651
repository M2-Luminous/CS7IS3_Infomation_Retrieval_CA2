A report from the Federal Police Office (OFP), published on Saturday [2 April] by several German-language newspapers, came to this conclusion. It was confirmed by a spokesman from the DFJP [Federal Department of Justice and Police]. In the case of sufficient evidence, the divisional courts would be competent to start proceedings. The analysis was commissioned in mid-February by the Federal Council. The aim was to determine what exactly the situation was from the legal viewpoint. The OFP handed its report to Arnold Koller, the head of the DFJP, just before the Easter weekend. The eight-page report comes to the conclusion that military justice is competent to open criminal proceedings against war criminals, even if they are civilians or are of foreign nationality, and if they committed their crimes in another country. DFJP spokesman Viktor Schlumpf, confirmed this interpretation to ATS [Swiss Press Agency] on Saturday. It is based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions which Switzerland has made an integral part of its military law. In the case of a justified suspicion with regard to a presumed war criminal or on denunciation, military justice would conduct the proceedings in cooperation with the DMF [Federal Department of the Military], the DFAE [Federal Department of Foreign Affairs], and the DFJP. The accused would, in theory, be extradited to the country in which he committed his crimes. In the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, this extradition would only be carried out with the guarantee that the death penalty would not be used. If extradition proved impossible, the army's chief auditor would refer to matter to the civilian justice and police authorities in order for them to conduct the military criminal investigation because military justice does not have its own investigation bodies. If necessary, a charge would be submitted to the divisional court responsible for the case. If found guilty, the war criminal would serve his sentence in a Swiss prison. The sentences for the various crimes are established by the military criminal code. According to the press, Bosnia's embassy in Bern knows of at least 10 cases of war criminals currently in Switzerland. It is basing this on the eye-witness reports of Bosnian refugees who say they have identified their persecutors. The Bosnian mission in Switzerland is shortly expected to present its documents to the Swiss authorities. If there is a case, the stipulated procedure will be followed, DMF spokesman Daniel Eckmann told ATS. However, the evidence must be sufficiently specific and clear. Hitherto no case of this kind has yet been submitted, he stressed.
