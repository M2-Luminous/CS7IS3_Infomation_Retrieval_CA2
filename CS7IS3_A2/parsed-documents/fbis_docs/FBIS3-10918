Commenting on Fujimori's remark in Santiago, Chile, saying "the territorial issue between the two countries is a settled matter," Duran-Ballen said: "There are two viewpoints on the territorial issue between Ecuador and Peru." According to a communique released in Quito today, Duran-Ballen said: "Dialogue can help us attain the greatest possible rapprochement and understanding between the respective positions of both countries." The Ecuadoran president is in Santiago to attend Chilean President-elect Eduardo Frei's swearing-in ceremony. Peru says the territorial disputes between the two countries were settled through the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, but Ecuador questions the protocol's validity due to the special circumstances under which it was signed in January 1942 and because the protocol is nonexecutable as the result of its inherent geographical errors. Duran-Ballen and Fujimori were scheduled to meet in Lima by late 1993, but an alleged disagreement on the agenda prevented setting the date for Duran-Ballen's trip, which is still pending and which would be the first one to be made by an Ecuadoran president to Peru in the two countries' nearly two centuries of independent existence.
