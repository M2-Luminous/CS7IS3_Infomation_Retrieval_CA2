"The cabinet listened to the reports with satisfaction and expressed... gratitude," Klaus told journalists, adding that the issue had been also discussed at the session in a matter-of-fact manner. Asked about a meeting of the presidents of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Poland, and Austria reported yesterday to be planned for on April 14-15 in the east Bohemian city of Litomysl, Havel said "such a meeting was under preparation and would be held as an unofficial one on the occasion of some cultural event." However, Havel said that for the time being nobody was capable of saying anything specific about the planned meeting. The meeting was preliminarily planned during a similar meeting in July in Salzburg, where Czech, German, Austrian, and Hungarian Presidents Vaclav Havel, Thomas Klestil, Richard von Weizsaecker, and Arpad Goncz met on the occasion of the Salzburg musical festival.
