Muslim brothers and sisters everywhere: A glance at the history of Islam shows that the results of pressure by Islam's enemies run counter to their expectations and serve to boost Islam's promotion and progress. And injustices have drawn people's attention to it. This is why Islam has made its way and assumed its position in the world. The Karbala' incident took place in the first century of the hegira. This is the first proof of what we say. Then there were the crusades in the middle ages and today we have the Serbian crimes and their savage war and ethnic cleansing. The other issue to which we draw the attention of the Islamic world is this: Had the events of Karbala' not occurred and the corrupt ruler not committed those crimes against the followers of the prophet, smearing the history of Islam, the world would not have needed an advocate of culture, freedom, democracy, and human rights. The world, particularly Europe, today claims to be very civilized and to have progressed. But disregarding international organizations, the Serbians are committing the ugliest and most tragic crimes against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including killing, torturing, burning, destroying, and slaughtering women, old people, and children. These acts shame humanity. Members of the United Nations and the Security Council have been turning a blind eye to these crimes and even supporting them in practice in a manner that pains the human conscience. What do you think? Is the result what the enemy wants or is it in favor of Islam? Islam is spreading against their will. They usurped Palestine, displaced its people, and tortured and killed its people. What do you think will happen ultimately? Will the enemy achieve his objective or will he force the Muslims to get ready to regain their strength over their enemies? History shows that when the Muslims became aware of the reasons for their weakness and defeat and followed the path of struggle, they triumphed over the enemy. When they did not care what happened to them, they remained for years the prisoners of the enemy. Muslim brothers and sisters: The conditions in the world today are not the same as before. We must today defeat the enemy through unity, new methods, and information. Meetings and decisions by officials are useless these days. The oppressed Bosnian and Palestinian peoples stood fast in the face of the Serbs and the Zionists. In doing so, they dealt a devastating blow to the United Nations and the Security Council. The Islamic Conference Organization intervened. Work is continuing secretly and openly. 'Arafat's treason and his recent signing of the disgraceful agreement in Egypt have escalated the wave of strikes and armed confrontation. General mourning was declared. The signing of the agreements in Washington and Cairo had no effect, thanks to the Palestinian resistance. This is the age of peoples, not governments. It is time to regain the people's rights and defend virtues, not time for laziness and indifference. We are confident that we will triumph ultimately, thanks to the vigilance and unity of the Muslims, God willing.
