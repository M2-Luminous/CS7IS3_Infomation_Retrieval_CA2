[Baku Azerbaycan Radio Televiziyasi Television Network in Azeri at 1600 GMT on 12 January, in a similar report adds: "The Azerbaijan president's decree conferred on her the diplomatic rank of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary."] A number of analysts from opposing political currents consider this appointment exclusion from power, as the former secretary of state has not been agreed with the personnel policy. The same analysts suppose that Minister of Foreign Affairs Gassan Gassanov and chairman of the National Independence Party of Azerbaijan Etibar Mamedov are two possible candidates to the state secretary vacancy. Gassan Gassanov is known as president's comrade-in-arms, and the national harmony might be the major factor dictating Etibar Mamedov's appointment. The state secretary position was offered to Etibar Mamedov last summer.
