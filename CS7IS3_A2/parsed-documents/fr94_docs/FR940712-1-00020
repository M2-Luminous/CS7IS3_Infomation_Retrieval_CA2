Rulemaking Analyses and Notices All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable, but the FHWA may issue a final rule at any time after the close of the comment period. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file relevant information in the docket as it becomes available after the comment closing date, and interested persons should continue to examine the docket for new material. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The FHWA, at 23 CFR 637, currently has regulations covering sampling and testing. The proposed revisions would merely update these regulations to accommodate contractor-performed sampling and testing and reinforce existing policy. Therefore, it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal and a full regulatory evaluation is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this proposal on small entities. The FHWA concluded that this action would in fact provide some small testing firms with an opportunity to perform more work than was allowed by the previous regulations. Although the regulation would have a positive impact on these testing firms, the number of firms affected would be small and the amount of additional work would be insignificant. Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities apply to this program. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520. National Environmental Policy Act This rulemaking does not have any effect on the environment. It does not constitute a major action having a significant effect on the environment, and therefore does not require the preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq .) Regulation Identification Number A regulation identification number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each year. The RIN contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.
