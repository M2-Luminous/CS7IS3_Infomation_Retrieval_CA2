Mr. Kingibe who was addressing reporters in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, felt that problems between Nigeria and Cameroon, which, according to him, are only "bilateral", should remain as such. The same day Nigerian Information Minister Jerry Gana had already told AFP in Lagos "to be aware of the implications of French participation." He had expressed "reservations" about a French intervention in the border conflict, but expressed the hope that French military intervention "was going to bring peace and not escalate the crisis."
