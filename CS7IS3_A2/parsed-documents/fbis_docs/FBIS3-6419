In the course of the session the Mongolian parliament members are to discuss a package of draft laws concerning urgent issues of the country's socioeconomic life. At the opening of the session the chairman of the State Great Hural N. Bagabandi made a speech. The parliament leader pointed out, in particular, the importance of the draft laws to be discussed and adopted at the present session of the State Great Hural for deepening of processes of reforms, development of market relations, formation and consolidation of judicial power and realization of the tasks of renewal of the Mongolian society. Further strengthening of political stability in the country is a vital issue affecting the present and future interests of Mongolia. In this cause great is the role of all political forces, including the political parties, members of which are working in the parliament, noted N. Bagabandi. Bilateral and multilateral relations and cooperation with the two neighbours Russia and China, donor countries and all states are effectively developing and strengthening at different levels. An example to this was the recent official visit of the president of Mongolia to four countries of Asia. The negotiations and talks held at the high level and the joint documents signed during this visits are of great importance not only for development and deepening of relations and cooperation of our country with these four countries of Asia on the basis of new principles and new ideas under present international conditions, but also for strengthening of peace and stability in the Asian and the Pacific region, noted the Mongolian parliament leader. Then president of Mongolia, P. Ochirbat, made a speech at the session. In his speech the president criticized the parliament, mentioned about its bad tradition, when the issues, on discussion of which great efforts were exerted and attention was paid, have been ending without any result. As the president said, only a part of questions raised by him at the opening of the parliament autumn session has been considered and solved by the law-makers, and the fate of the rest of the issues still remains obscure. The president gave a short information about his official visits to four Asian countries, valuing their outcome as important and successful. Then the president spoke about process of legal reform in the country, criticized the law-making activity, which in his view, is still being carried out without any definite conception and without any strategic line. In connection with this he made 4 proposals to speed up measures on carrying out legislation in accordance with the Constitution, create a system of legal information, raise to a qualitatively new level the law-making activity and double the parliament control over realization of laws, provide for a higher level training of specialists. As, addressing the law-makers, the president of Mongolia noted, withdrawal of their party representatives in the State Great Hural by the Mongolian National Democratic and the Mongolian Social Democratic Parties does not meet the national interests of Mongolia. On the basis of his consultations on this issue with leaders of political parties, chairman of the parliament, prime minister, the State Great Hural members from the opposition, and also on the basis of agreements between leaders of parties, P. Ochirbat made a number of proposals, in particular, on making amendments and additions in the law on elections, on introduction of clarity into the status of the parliament majority and minority, their powers and rights in the law on State Great Hural. Besides that, the president suggested to elaborate principles of covering of activity of the parliament, including rights of the minority, by the state mass media, make amendments and additions in the law on elections in the current year. Then Prime Minister P. Jasray, the representative of the parliament opposition T. Elbegdorj made speeches. After that the law-makers set to consideration of the draft law on statistics. But six representatives of the parliament opposition walked out at this moment, protesting against the decision of the State Great Hural chairman to postpone consideration of the president's proposal on making amendments and additions in the law on parliament.
