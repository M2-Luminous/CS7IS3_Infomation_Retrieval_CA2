Saying that no one in his right mind could accept this either in a military or a human sense, Gvero stressed that immediately after the withdrawal Muslim forces would take the Serb positions. This is why he has demanded a sensible agreement in the direction of peace. "We must have guarantees that, if our army withdraws by a single kilometer, the Muslim army will do the same and that their infantry will not advance by a single inch. If there are no such guarantees we are dutybound to remain where we are now, because of the bloodshed and the people," Gvero added. In his words, there is a false image in the world of Sarajevo as a Muslim city. This is a territory which is Serbian in every respect, so the term siege is inappropriate and at odds with the facts. The demand to tilt the balance of force to the detriment of Serb forces is unrealistic and unfulfillable. In Gvero's view, this is a criminal attitude to our territory, our people, and our army. General Gvero stressed that NATO's ultimatum was a consequence of the emotions created by the Sarajevo massacre, and it is a fact that the massacre was staged. Asked to comment on President Clinton's statement that one should not fear the Bosnian Serbs' air defense, which is allegedly totally outdated and in poor repair, Gen. Gvero said: "If someone attacks us for no reason whatever we will, just as always in the past, find a way to neutralize the attacker. No one should speculate as to what weaponry we possess. We have enough weapons for effective defense. I believe that reason will prevail, but if insanity prevails it will be met with an appropriate reaction."
