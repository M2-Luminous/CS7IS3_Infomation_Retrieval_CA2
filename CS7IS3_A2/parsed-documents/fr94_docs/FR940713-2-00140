Relating to the Listing and Trading of SCOR Securities on the Exchange July 7, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on June 2, 1994 1 and July 7, 1994 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;92&hyph;42 2 as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the amendment to the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 The Exchange subsequently filed Exhibit 1 to the Amendment (form of notice for Federal Register ) with the Commission on June 15 and June 22, 1994. 2 The proposed rule change was published for public comment in Exchange Act Release No. 32514 (June 25, 1993), 58 FR 35496 (July 1, 1993). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The PSE is amending its proposal to list and trade Small Corporate Offering Registration (``SCOR'') securities on the Exchange. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Exchange is amending its proposal to list securities under the SCOR designation. The amendment is partly based upon discussions the Exchange has held, subsequent to the initial filing, with committees of the North American Securities Administrations Association, Inc. (``NASAA''), 3 the California Department of Corporations, and leaders from the small business community. The Exchange believes that the proposal, as amended, satisfactorily addresses the mutual concerns of these individuals and organizations. 3 The Exchange consulted extensively with the Small Business Capital Formation and the Small Business Sales Practices committees of NASAA. Inclusion of Preferred Stock The Exchange notes that many companies, particularly in the high-technology sector, have a capital structure consisting of two classes of capital stock, i.e. , a single class each of common and preferred. The class of common stock is privately held by insiders and, generally, is not transferable, while the preferred stock is issued to qualified public investors. Under this structure, holders of preferred stock have preference over common shareholders in the event of liquidation. The Exchange has determined, accordingly, that it would consider listing a company's preferred stock under the SCOR program if the company's overall capital structure and corporate governance policies were sufficiently designed to protect the interests of public investors. Initial Listing Requirements The Exchange's initial filing proposed that each issuer of a SCOR security have a public float of at least 200,000 shares and a market capitalization of $1 million. Since the $1 million market capitalization requirement also represents the maximum offering amount allowable under Rule 504, the Exchange is proposing to lower the effective market capitalization threshold to $750,000, with a corresponding reduction in public float to 150,000 shares and in net worth to $750,000. This reduction would provide a viable range of $750,000 to $1 million for SCOR offerings, making allowances for potential costs associated with the offering. The Exchange believes that, with these modifications, the SCOR listing program will be more viable in enabling bona fide companies to raise capital pursuant to Rule 504. The Exchange also believes that these proposed changes to the initial listing requirements for SCOR securities will continue to ensure adequate public distribution, and will not inhibit the growth of the trading markets or negatively influence specialists' abilities to maintain fair and orderly markets. The public float requirement of 150,000 shares exceeds the NASDAQ Small Cap initial listing standard of 100,000 shares. Moreover, the Exchange's calculation of public float is more stringent than that of the NASD in that it excludes any concentrated holdings of 5% or more. 4 Finally, because certain SCOR offerings may be ``integrated,'' 5 it is conceivable that the applicant issuer may have a greater public distribution than initially expected and, therefore, would further exceed the minimum requirements. 4 The NASD excludes concentrated holdings of more than 10 percent. See NASD By-Laws, Schedule D, Part II, Sec. 1(c)(7). 5 Factors to be considered in determining whether offerings should be ``integrated'' are whether the offerings: (1) Involve the same class of security, (2) involve the same type of consideration, (3) are part of a single plan of financing, (4) are made at or about the same time, and (5) are made for the same general purpose. See Securities Act Release Nos. 4434 (1961) and 4552 (1963). Net Worth and Net Tangible Assets To prevent a company that has no tangible assets net of liabilities from being listed, the Exchange will apply both net worth and net tangible assets as a test. Accordingly, proposed Rule 3.2(t)(2) would require that a company have both net tangible assets of at least $500,000 and a total net worth of at least $750,000. Audited Financial Statements Proposed Rule 3.2(t)(4) provides that, at the time of its application, the issuer must provide the Exchange with audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year-end (and unaudited interim financial statements), and that such statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Qualitative Listing Requirements Proposed Rule 3.2(t)(6) sets forth additional qualitative requirements in determining a company's listing eligibility. The fact that an applicant may meet the numerical requirements does not mean that its application will be approved. The Exchange recognizes the potential for investor risk in SCOR securities; however, the Exchange is confident that through a rigorous merit review process, it can attain the mutual goals of supporting small business capital formation while providing sufficient protection for the investing public. Preferred Stock_Anti-Dilution Clause The Exchange is proposing in Commentary .04 to Rule 3.2(t) to provide that it will not list convertible preferred issues containing a provision that permits the company, at its discretion, to reduce the conversion price of its stock other than in accordance with the terms of the company's articles of incorporation or any amendments thereof made contemporaneously with the offering under which the issuer is applying for listing. Representations of Approval for Listing The Exchange has added language that clearly prohibits a company or broker-dealer from misrepresenting SCOR securities as having been approved for Exchange listing when, in fact, they have not been approved. Accordingly, the Exchange is proposing to add Commentary .05 to Rule 3.2(t) stating that any reference to this Exchange made either by the issuer or the underwriter of the issuer in any prospectus, offering circular, or similar document that reasonably implies endorsement or listing approval by the Exchange, and which is made without the prior consent to the Exchange, is prohibited. 6 6 If the Exchange finds that a company or broker-dealer has engaged in such conduct, it will immediately report the matter to the appropriate state regulatory agency and to the Commission. Delisting Proposed Rule 3.5(r), Commentary .01, has been revised to incorporate specific times required for compliance with certain maintenance requirements once a deficiency has occurred. The commentary now states that a company with a deficiency in either market value of public float or minimum bid price for ten consecutive business days shall have 90 days thereafter in which to comply with the maintenance requirements. It further states that, should the deficiency continue beyond the prescribed period, the Exchange shall delist the security. 2. Statutory Basis The proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.
