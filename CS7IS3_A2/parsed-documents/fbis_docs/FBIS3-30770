[Klaus] Two things: On the one hand, the feeling that people know about the Czech Republic and that what they know about it are positive things. And, on the other, the observation that puts my previous statement into the correct context: that we are not at the center of the world, that there are a great many extraordinarily interesting and stimulating things going on in the world, and that it is necessary to listen carefully to other people. [Danes] In your speech in Davos, you emphasized the differences between the individual countries in Europe before their current integration. According to some observers, including those in the West, by placing such an emphasis on the differences, you are damaging our republic's starting position for its gradual incorporation into the European Union. Are they not right? [Klaus] First of all, I do not know if the formulation of your question--"emphasized the differences"--is correct. I emphasized something else. I said that, if we analyze Europe's current development--when I say "Europe," I do not mean the abstract continent but the flesh-and-blood people who live in it--we have to be careful that we adjoin its success or failure to factors that really gain recognition for it and that, on the contrary, we do not adjoin factors to it that do not gain recognition for it. I said that the fundamental reason for West Europe's success in recent decades has been the social system in these countries and not this or that supranational institution that lumps Europe together. I cited the example that our tragedy was not CEMA but the communist regime. This is also valid symmetrically vice versa. [Danes] This is valid symmetrically vice versa for what? [Klaus] Even in West Europe, the dominant factor was not the influence of the European integrative process but maintaining a free system based economically on private ownership and so on. This conclusion applies to the past, the present, and certainly the future--that is, I was not reproaching anyone in my speech. It was merely an attempt to analyze the factors that influence the current situation in Europe. We can then discuss what percentage share this additional influence--that is, the establishment of external integration--has had, apart from the aforementioned dominant influence, in Europe's success. [Danes] Nevertheless, our state certainly desires integration with the European Union.... [Klaus] Our state, in any case, wants to integrate with Europe and merge with Europe in all possible structures. Undoubtedly, to achieve this, it is necessary to enter into European institutions and organizations. However, I can integrate myself institutionally and noninstitutionally. For example, I can do so economically by abolishing customs barriers and all sorts of obstacles to trade. Another possibility is that I will integrate myself on an organizationally institutional sphere, but this is only one method. [Danes] According to press reports, in Switzerland you also admitted to the possibility of our budget policy's transition from a neutral to an active one. In your opinion, when should a change of this order take place? Is it intended to take the wind from Milos Zeman's sails before he had even gathered it? [Klaus] No, I must disappoint you. I never said anything of the kind. This was merely a figment of the imagination of some editor or commentator concerning my speech to Swiss bankers on Monday [31 January] evening in Wolfsberg. Perhaps this editor got hold of the German text of my speech. It contained a written addendum, which I did not refer to in my speech. This was a theoretical analysis of the kind of economic situation in which budget policy has to be restrictive, neutral, and expansive. It says there that no East European country has yet reached the stage at which it could transfer to an expansive policy, regardless of whether this makes any sense at all. It is still my opinion that an expansive budget policy does not make any sense. [Danes] As chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, are you worried about competition from the right? I am referring to the newly evolving party, whose ranks include, among others, the publisher of CESKY DENIK, Josef Kudlacek. [Klaus] I am really not worried about this competition. These people are not interested in integrating the right wing, as they falsely dub their political venture. They are merely interested in making a name for themselves and in asserting their very extreme view of our current situation. If they succeed for a while in uniting a couple of people from various political parties, people who in our already maturing political spectrum have always remained ostentatiously in lilliputian parties of absolutely negligible significance, let them do so. I have absolutely nothing to add to this. [Danes] Do you think they have any hope of getting into parliament? [Klaus] In my opinion, certainly not.
