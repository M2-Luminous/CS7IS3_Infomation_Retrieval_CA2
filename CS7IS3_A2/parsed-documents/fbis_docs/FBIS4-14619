The president said that the draft text was ready and had already been forwarded to the State Duma and the Council of the Federation. Now "work will be started with the parties in order to reach final agreement on some points." "Not a bad document has been drawn up," the president noted. In Yeltsin's opinion, the draft agreement on civilian peace would not be published for the time being, because "there may be suggestions by this or that party or group." This is why, Yeltsin believes, "it would be unethical to publish the document now." Yeltsin also said that he would probably discuss the draft agreement during his meeting with Yegor Gaydar, expected to take place in the Kremlin today.
