FR940412-0-00036 FR940412-0-00007 The specific restrictions authorized by this rule will be issued in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) by each affected FAA region when any information indicates the barometric pressure will exceed 31.00 inHg. Paragraph 7&hyph;531 of the FAA Airman's Information Manual contains the procedures that will be put into effect by NOTAM when the pressure is above 31.00 inHg. These restrictions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. All aircraft: Set the altimeter to 31.00 inHg for en route operations below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). Maintain this setting until the aircraft is beyond the affected area or until reaching the final approach segment. At the beginning of the final approach segment, set the altimeter to the current barometric pressure, if possible. If not possible, leave the altimeter set at 31.00 inHg throughout the approach. Altimeters on departing aircraft or on aircraft on missed approach will be set to 31.00 inHg before the aircraft reaches any mandatory/crossing altitude, or 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), whichever is lower. 2. During preflight, altimeters shall be checked, to the extent possible, for normal operation. 3. If the aircraft is being operated into or out of airports with the capability of measuring the current barometric pressure and the aircraft is equipped with an altimeter that has the capability to be set to the current barometric pressure, no additional restrictions apply. 4. For aircraft operating under VFR, there are no additional restrictions; however, extra diligence is essential in flight planning. 5. Airports without the capability for accurate measurement of barometric pressures above 31.00 inHg will report the barometric pressure as ``in excess of 31.00 inHg.'' Flight operations to and from those airports are restricted to VFR weather conditions. 6. For aircraft operating under IFR and equipped with an altimeter that does not have the capacity to be set at the current barometric pressure, the following restrictions apply: a. To determine the suitability of takeoff airports, destination airports, and alternate airports, increase ceiling requirements by 100 feet and visibility requirements by 1/4 mile for each .10 inHg of pressure, or any portion thereof, over 31.00 inHg. These adjusted values are to be applied in accordance with the requirements of the applicable operating regulations and operations specifications. b. On approach, 31.00 inHg will remain set on the altimeter. Decision height or minimum descent altitude shall be deemed to have been reached when the published minimum altitude is displayed on the altimeter. c. These restrictions do not apply to authorized Category II and Category III ILS operations, nor do they apply to certificate holders using approved QFE (absolute altitude) altimetry systems. 7. The Regional Flight Standards Division manager of the affected area is authorized to approve temporary waivers to permit emergency resupply or emergency medical services operations. The NOTAM issuing the temporary restrictions will incorporate a reference to the rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this rule. Regulatory Evaluation Summary The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized below. For more detailed economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket. The rule involves additional costs to aviators through delays in flying to airports experiencing extremely high barometric pressure. The cost of the rule varies by the number of hours of delay, by the level of activity at the restricted airports, and by the type of aircraft delayed. Data from the National Weather Service (NWS) was used to estimate the amount of time airports will experience extreme high pressure. The discounted 10 year cost of this rule due to delays resulting from the restrictions is estimated to be $3.0 million.
