"blue helmets" into "green" ones. Around 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani and 1,200 Bangladeshi troops are expected to arrive in Bosnia next summer. When all the planned troops have arrived, UNPROFOR will have soldiers from as many as six Islamic states -- Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Egypt, Jordan and Bangladesh. The current situation indicates that this may not be the final figure becuase some other Islamic countries have showed great interest in sending their own peacekeepers to Bosnia. Those who know the situation in Bosnia claim that massive arrival of troops from Islamic countries had been initiated by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic. He needs peacekeepers from Islamic countries for two reasons. The first one is that they would give him an additional military power under the current conditions of the arms embargo. The other one is connected with the attempt to Islamize Bosnia. Izetbegovic's intentions are clear. Well-informed sources believe he will try to use Islamic peacekeepers for strengthening the influence of Islamic fundamentalism in the Bosnian Moslem enclaves. Some analysts in the West claim that most of the Moslem population in Bosnia is not inclined to Islamic fundamentalism. Izetbegovic must therefore be backed by a real power in his effort to `persuade' his own people that it is necessary to accept Islamic fundamentalism. So-called holy warriors from Islamic countries, who have been fighting alongside Bosnian Moslems since the beginning of the civil war, have not had much success so far in helping Izetbegovic implement that ideology. On the contrary, their behaviour has turned many Bosnian Moslems against them. Izetbegovic therefore needs `fresh forces' with the image of peacekeepers and he has found such troops in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. There is an impression that the world's most powerful factors involved in the the settling of the Bosnian conflict are indiferently watching the arrival of troops from Islamic countries to Bosnia. Such a stand can be understood only as yet another in a series of expressions of support to the Bosnian Moslem side since the beginning of the war. U.N. Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali has found himself in an awkward position because Western countries are not ready to send fresh troops to Bosnia. On the contrary, the most powerful countries are indicating the possibility of withdrawing their peacekeepers. On the other hand, Islamic countries have no problems in financing their peacekeepers serving as part of UNPROFOR. Under the circumstances, Butros-Ghali has no other option but to accept what is offered. Consequences of such an attitude, however, do not seem to be considered.
