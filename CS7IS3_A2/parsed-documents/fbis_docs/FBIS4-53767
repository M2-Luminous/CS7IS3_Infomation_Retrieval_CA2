It said its exporters had shipped 48 out of the 70 waste checked containers through the port in Rotterdam. Six of the 48 containers were found containing dangerous and toxic wastes while the others solid plastic wastes probably from households and industries. It denied that its exporters had shipped 14 containers to Indonesia through several ports in the Netherlands. Based on an existing Dutch act some of the wastes manifested no signs of danger and therefore checks had only been made upon samples taken from the outer part of the containers. It also said the wastes had been solidified into bales so that their recycling process would depend much on importers' technical expertise. An expert team from the Netherlands had been in Indonesia from May 2 to 19 to meet the importers and check plastic recycling methods in the country. This team would report the results of their examination to the Dutch Ministry of Environment for legal scrutiny to avoid any posible recurrance in the future.
