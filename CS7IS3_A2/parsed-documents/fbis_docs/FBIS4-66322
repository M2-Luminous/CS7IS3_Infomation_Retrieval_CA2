Box 525, Chengdu, 610003; MS received 20 Oct 92, revised 20 Aug 93] [Text] Abundant nonlinear processes may be produced in submillimeter-size hohlraum targets by 1.053 �m laser light with duration of 1 ns and energy of 300-600 J. In experiments, Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) were directly measured, and Resonance Absorption (RA), Two-Plasmon Decay (TPD), and Ion Acoustic Decay (IAD) were observed indirectly. The experimental results show that SBS and SRS are the dominant nonlinear processes in cavity; they can scatter about 40 percent of the incident laser energy. Electron plasma waves stimulated by nonlinear processes such as SRS, TPD, RA, and IAD are the sources of suprathermal electron generation. Our research indicates that SRS is the chief process for electron plasma-wave generation in hohlraum targets, and it can produce suprathermal electrons with a total energy about 10 percent of incident laser energy. Because spectra of nonlinear process scattering light are closely related to the plasma state, we can obtain information about the plasma state through intensive measurement and analysis of these spectra of the scattering light.
