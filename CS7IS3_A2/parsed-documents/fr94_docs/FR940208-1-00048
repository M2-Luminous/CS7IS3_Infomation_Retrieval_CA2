FR940208-1-00048 FR940208-1-00011 Through contacts with one State control agency, the Agency discovered a system that provides additional control of vapor losses from cargo tanks. In this system, a negative pressure is created in the vapor collection system during loading, ensuring that vapors will not be forced out into the air through any leakage points. This ``vacuum assist'' system is in use at a few bulk gasoline terminals (in addition to Method 27 testing) in Texas, so it meets the Act requirement to consider the best controlled similar source in establishing the floor level of control for new terminals. Since less than 1 percent of terminals use this vacuum assist system it is not considered the floor for tank trucks at existing terminals. Annual vapor tightness testing using Method 27 is the next highest or best emission level and therefore represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources as specified in the Act. Therefore, annual vapor tightness testing using Method 27 is considered the floor for tank trucks loading at existing terminals. Industry sources have expressed concerns regarding the operational reliability of a vacuum assist system, especially under extreme cold weather conditions. These commenters also believe that the system could present a safety hazard if excess negative pressures were developed within a tank truck fuel compartment. To the Agency's knowledge, the systems in operation have not experienced any significant problems, and one of the systems has been operating for over 2 years. These systems contain safety pressure relief devices in combination with the pressure-vacuum vents already installed on each tank truck compartment. However, safety concerns are important to the Agency. The Agency specifically requests comment, including technical documentation and data where available, on the reliability, effectiveness, safety aspects, and any other issue concerning vacuum producing equipment for bulk terminal vapor collection systems. On the basis that this technology has been demonstrated, the Agency has selected the vacuum assist system for the loading of tank trucks and railcars at new bulk gasoline terminals (in combination with the 10 mg TOC/liter emission limit and continuous monitoring of the vapor processing system) as the floor level of control for fugitive cargo tank leakage at new facilities. c. Equipment leaks. The control of emissions from equipment components leaking liquid or vapors at pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals has never been specifically addressed by the Agency in a federal regulation or in a CTG. The Agency has determined, based on information obtained on site visits and from various industry contacts, that many facilities conduct periodic visual inspections to identify leaking components, and a few (less than one percent) perform leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs with a portable organic vapor analyzer. Therefore, the existing facility floor for the control of emissions from leaking equipment components at both pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals was determined to be periodic visual inspections, or no formal (federally enforceable) inspection procedure. The control of emissions from leaking equipment components at other facilities with similarities to pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals has been studied extensively. LDAR programs to conduct periodic monitoring of these components are in effect for many types of sources, including equipment in VOC service at petroleum refineries (40 CFR part 60, subparts GGG and VV) and equipment operated in volatile hazardous air pollutant (VHAP) service (40 CFR part 61, subparts J and V). These programs include monthly inspections of pumps and valves involving the use of a portable organic vapor analyzer to identify leaking components, a protocol for tagging leaking components, and a time limit for performing repairs. In determining the frequency of monitoring that would reflect best control of these emission sources, the Agency found that some bulk gasoline terminals are already carrying out equipment leak monitoring with a portable organic analyzer. Some of these programs involve quarterly monitoring, while others involve monthly monitoring. Bulk gasoline terminals co-located with or within the contiguous area of refineries are performing LDAR under 40 CFR part 60, subparts GGG and VV and 40 CFR part 61, subparts J and V. Since these similar source control requirements are achieved in practice the Agency has selected an LDAR program based on 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV as the floor level of control for equipment leaks at new bulk gasoline terminals and breakout stations. The proposed standards require monthly leak monitoring of pumps, no detectible emissions from pressure relief valves (after overpressure release to insure proper reseating of valve), barrier fluid systems for compressors, closed-purge or closed-vent systems for sampling collection systems, and caps or plugs for open-ended valves or lines. Requirements for valves are that they be monitored monthly, with provisions allowing the monitoring frequency for valves that do not leak for 2 successive months to be relaxed from monthly to quarterly. Additionally, an alternative standard for valves allows for equal to or less than 2 percent of all valves to leak above the detection limit, and contains procedures that allow monitoring frequency to decrease from monthly to either quarterly or to annually.
