The Muslims used 82-mm mortars, anti-aircraft and infantry weapons. The defense lines have not changed, but several Serb fighters were wounded. Members of the Srpska republic army responded to the fire, after which the firing stopped. This report also denies yesterday's news broadcast by Croatian and Muslim media that their units reached a position one kilometer from the center of Srbobran. Serb military sources also deny that combined Muslim and Croat units took part in the attack, saying that this is a propaganda trick. They stress that the attack on Serbobran is conducted mainly by Muslims who earlier escaped from the town and also members of the 370th Donji Vakuf Brigade of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army.
