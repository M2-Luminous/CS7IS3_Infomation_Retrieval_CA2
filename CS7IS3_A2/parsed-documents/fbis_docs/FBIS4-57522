Thirteen urban transportation buses were burned and 10 cars destroyed when autonomous University of San Luis Potosi students clashed with bus owners and gang members. The incident started in the morning when the students, led by their leader (Ramon Puron Cir), seized about 20 public transportation buses and kept them inside the university campus to protest the large number of people killed by buses and the humiliating treatment afforded users. The bus owners, accompanied by gang members, stoned buildings and cars owned by professors and burned a car. The students responded by burning 10 [figure as heard] of the seized buses. [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Our stand is to hold talks and do our best to ensure that they pay for the damage, which is quite considerable. Things like this should not happen at a university. [end recording] All this transpired as public forces watched from a nearby street but did not intervene, arguing that they could not violate university autonomy. The Red Cross treated at least 12 people, most with minor head injuries. Governor Horacio Sanchez Unzueta, who marked his first year in office yesterday, said the violence was provoked by people not affiliated with the university. He added that this incident will be fully investigated and those responsible will face the full force of the law.
