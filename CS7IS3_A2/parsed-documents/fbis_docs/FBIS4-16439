In [Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy's words, it was difficult to work there because the French authorities limited his itinerary to three points: Charles de Gaulle airport, Strasbourg airport, and the city of Strasbourg. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] They could have just shown me the toilet and told me where to piss, and where I should eat, and where I should sleep. That is all that remained to be shown. Otherwise, I might use the wrong toilet. [end recording] Another example of Western inhospitality was the fact that the French do not speak Russian, which Zhirinovskiy considers essential even a long way from Russia. [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] It is only us Russians that mostly have to talk to them in their own languages. I spoke French, but I preferred to talk to them in Russian. All the more so because you cannot swear in another language. When they really made me angry, I found it easier to speak Russian, because you just cannot say it in French -- especially when those Jews attacked me at the consulate. Well, what can you say in French? All the words are so soft and nice. [end recording] Zhirinovskiy said at the news conference that Russia should under no circumstances join the Council of Europe, which wants to make war on us using our own money. [passage omitted]
