"We are aware of how hopeless and fatal can be any attempt to try to resolve by force controversial issues relating to a popular drive for self- determination", its appeal adopted late on Wednesday says. This was approved without discussion on Speaker of Parliament Ivan Rybkin's proposal. The Duma speaks of "perceiving with hope a report on the first moves" for dialogue and consensus that Ukrainian and Crimean deputies made during talks in Kiev. The Russian deputies expect their counterparts on both sides not to allow irresponsible politicians to endanger public peace and security because of their one-off considerations. For its part, the Duma is prepared "with the delicate situation being taken into account" to do all it can to help towards the searches of compromise on the basis of the Russian-Ukrainian treaty of November 19, 1990. "For the past two centuries, Crimea has served and we are sure, will continue to serve the interests of the fraternal nations of Ukraine and Russia", the appeal says.
