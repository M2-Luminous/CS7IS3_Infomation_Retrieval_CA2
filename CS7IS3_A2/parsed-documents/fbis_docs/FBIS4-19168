"Turks are a brave, civilized and independent people. Who can say that Turks do not know how to elect the right leaders?" Baqeri told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. "These results should be of concern only to Turks. They, themselves, can talk about it. Iran is respecting the expression of the Turkish people's free will. Some comments concerning the election results can be attributed to the enemies of Turkey. They are trying to distract the Turkish public. The Turkish press has to prevent this plot," Baqeri said. Regarding his visit to the newly elected RP mayor of Erzurum, Baqeri said that he traveled to Erzurum on a regular basis in order to visit the Iranian Consulate in that city. "I went to Erzurum two years ago and I visited the mayor, the governor, local press representatives and the university, just as I did during my last visit. But the Turkish press preferred to focus on my visit to the mayor. I have no particular interest in visiting mayors from the RP. For example, I have no plans to visit the (newly elected RP) mayors in either Istanbul or Ankara," said Baqeri. "Turkish authorities and the press are aware of my activities here so there should be no question as to the purpose of my visit to Erzurum," Baqeri noted, stressing that with his four-year presence in Turkey, he is no newcomer to the country. "Are there any suspicions raised when other diplomats travel to Southeast Anatolia? Iran and its ambassador bring nothing but good intentions to Turkey," Baqeri stated. Meanwhile, the Iranian ambassador also said that with 60 million Muslims living in Turkey, the RP could not claim to be the sole representative of Islam in the country. His statement was made in reference to claims that Iran has taken a special interest in the success of the pro-Islamic RP. "Can you say that people from the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) are not Muslims? I know so many people from True Path Party (DYP) who pray regularly. There are ministers among them. Consequently, those who place these issues on the agenda do not have good intentions," he said. However, he also mentioned that it would not make sense for Iran to distance itself from the newly elected RP mayors either. When the mayor of the Iranian city of Tabriz visited Turkey two years ago, Baqeri pointed out, he held a meeting with SHP Chairman Murat Karayalcin. At the time Karayalcin was a mayor from the SHP. "We established a good dialogue with him. But now, the new mayor comes from the RP. Should we not establish a dialogue with him simply because he is from the RP?" Press Reports False On another subject, Baqeri disputed press reports claiming that he had proposed a solution to the Kurdish question, branding them as false. "The question proposed to me concerned the situation of minorities in Iran, especially the Kurdish minority. My response was that they do not present a problem for us. I also explained Iran's policies concerning its minority populations. My intention was not to advise Turkey. Either there was a misunderstanding or the false interpretation of my statements was done intentionally. My response was in no way related to Turkey's problems. I have no interest in them," Baqeri said. PKK Question Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that his country had cooperated with Turkey since the very beginning of its problems with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). "This cooperation is not new. We have been handing over to Turkey people in Iran who have been acting against them. We will continue to implement this policy. With the signing of a security agreement between the two countries, we have just stressed this cooperation one more time. But our stance has remained the same since the very beginning of the problem," Baqeri pointed out. He also criticized anti-Iranian reports related to the PKK issue that have appeared in the Turkish press in the past. "We confronted the Turkish authorities about these reports and they told us that these articles are created by the press and that their own positions do not reflect the views expressed in the news reports." Baqeri said that relations between Turkey and Iran were very good. He also voiced Iran's pleasure on the cooperation between the two countries on issues concerning security. "I hope that our relations on security issues will serve as an example for other neighboring countries," he said. He also mentioned that the general manager of Turkey's security forces, Mehmet Agar, would visit Iran soon as an official guest of Iran's security and disciplinary forces commander, Gen. Reza Seyfullahi. Common Enemies Baqeri also claimed that Turkey and Iran shared many common enemies, forming even closer bonds between the two countries. To demonstrate this point, he displayed a map illustrating the borders of a Kurdish state which extended into Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi and Syrian territories. He explained that the map had been published in Europe last week, and said: "Who are our enemies? Who is supporting the establishment a Kurdish state? This is a plot of those who are falsely claiming to be close to us. Is the exaggeration of news about Iran an attempt to cover up these dangerous intentions?" Baqeri also noted that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, while he served as prime minister, had shown a similar map to Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and had reportedly said during the meeting, "Look what they want to do." Baqeri stressed that "it is obvious that some people intend to tear away parts of Iran and Turkey. We must be awakened," Baqeri stressed. Israel, Enemy of Muslims In a reference to the development of closer relations between Turkey and Israel, the Iranian ambassador stressed that Iran considers Israel to be untrustworthy. "Turkey makes its own foreign policy. We cannot comment on this. But, we do not see them (Israel) as an honest society. There is a verse in the holy Koran: It says that they had tried to cheat even Allah. They definitely hate Muslims. They are the enemies of all Muslims. You can see it in their policies," Baqeri said. Cooperation on Central Asia Meanwhile, Baqeri stressed that the two countries were also cooperating on the issue of Central Asia. Despite the propaganda emanating from the Western press which claims that Turkey and Iran are competing over the newly independent countries of Central Asia, the results of the cooperation are beginning to bear fruit, Baqeri said. "Turkmen natural gas will be transported over Iran to Turkey and to Europe by pipeline. The Western and Turkish press have written much propaganda, but the realities (of the cooperation) are obvious," Baqeri stated. Turkey and Iran also share common views concerning the Caucasus, he said. "The two countries are opposed to the Armenian invasion. Furthermore, we both have requested that Armenia withdraw its forces from the Azeri territory it has occupied. Both Iran and Turkey have been providing humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan. And, both are helping the Caucasian and Central Asian republics within the framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). There are many examples like these." Moreover, he indicated that Iran was prepared to cooperate with Russia and Turkey in an attempt to resolve the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. "We informed Moscow and Ankara about our readiness to cooperate. We are ready to cooperate with any side that is willing to take steps to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh question. Turkey, Russia and Iran are influential countries in the Caucasus. Therefore, there is a need for intensive dialogue. We are ready for this." Baqeri also mentioned that Iran and Turkey have already conducted consultations at the levels of foreign ministry general directors, department chiefs and experts. "These kinds of consultations are necessary. Ministerial level meetings, alone, are not enough. For example, the Turkish Foreign Ministry's general director of Caucasia and the Balkans, Omer Ersun, visited Iran and their Iranian counterparts have visited Ankara--all over the past few months. After discussing the issues, we realized that our views were similar." The Iranian ambassador also expressed his government's pleasure over Turkey's participation in the Bosnian peacekeeping force, known as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. "We are happy about the decision that foresees the presence of Turkish peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The placement of the Muslim Turkish soldiers in Bosnia is a situation that is very pleasing to Iran." Meanwhile, Baqeri disclosed that there were 48,723 displaced Azeris living temporarily in Iran who were receiving aid from the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS). According to information provided by the IRCS, seven tent camps have been established for Azeri refugees in the border areas of Pars Abad in Imishlinskiy, Bileh Savar, Saberabad and Saatlinskiy regions since September 1993 and there is an urgent need for increased international participation and support for them. Iran Overcomes Economic Troubles Baqeri said that Iran, currently involved in a period of reconstruction, was experiencing no economic problem that could not be overcome. We are reconstructing the areas that had been damaged during the time of the Shah and in the Iran-Iraq war, Baqeri said. He disputed the reports that claimed Iran was immersed in great economic difficulties, saying that they were untrue and were only made to disseminate political propaganda against Iran. "It is normal to experience economic problems. Just look at other countries. Although they did not conduct a revolution against a regime connected to the United States, or fight an eight-year-long war or resist U.S. attempts at political domination for 15 years, all of them still are experiencing economic problems, including Europe and the United States," Baqeri noted. The Iranian ambassador stressed that the current regime in Iran represents the first implementation of an Islamic government and is now in a period of experimentation in the economic field. "We want a state that depends on its own resources. Our goal is not to depend on foreign resources. However, foreign pressure does have an impact on the Iranian economy. ``The United States does not want the Iranian system to be successful. To place pressure on the Iranian economy is among their leading priorities. By reducing the prices for crude oil, they want to negatively affect the Iranian economy so that they can say that the Iranian system is unsuccessful,'' Baqeri claimed. He said that the United States was "trying to place pressure on the countries that were having economic relations with Iran. Yet, they are always calling on Iran to establish economic relations with them while trying to prevent other countries from having economic relations with Iran," he said. [quotation mark as published] Baqeri also said that Iran was beginning to implement second five-year developing plans in which the main goal was to develop the country's very rich natural resources. ``Iran has very rich resources along with its reserves of crude oil. Iran's natural gas stocks are the second largest in the world. ``We also have other resources. We have prepared an economic plan that is not as dependent on crude oil export revenues. We are now preparing to pass the plan, but obstacles still remain. The Iranian nation is prepared to make sacrifices. In the period of economic trouble, we eat and drink less,'' Baqeri stated. Meanwhile, Baqeri said that Iran had offered a proposal to Turkey related to increased cooperation in the area of the automotive and spare parts manufacturing industry. "In one or two months, we are expecting a delegation from the Turkish Ministry of Industry and Trade to investigate the opportunities for cooperation. We are hopeful about this issue because there are many opportunities," Baqeri said.
