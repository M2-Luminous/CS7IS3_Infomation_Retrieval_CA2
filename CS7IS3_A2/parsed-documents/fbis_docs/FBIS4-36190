The committee members were briefed by senior Northern Command officers about the reasons for the Air Force attack on a Hizballah training camp in the Ba'labakk area. They were also briefed about possible terrorist attacks. MK Or said that if Lebanon disarms Hizballah it will be possible to speak about evacuating the security zone. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu expressed support for the IDF operation in Lebanon and voiced total support for the government's decisions in this regard. Meanwhile the state of alert on the northern border continues. Senior military sources said despite the fact that no Katyushas have been fired by Hizballah since Friday they are continuing their activity in the security zone. The sources say that the terrorists are trying to plant explosive charges, to attack outposts, and to kidnap soldiers. The terrorists are also trying to smuggle suicide squads into the security zone for attacks against IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] forces. "We are convinced that Hizballah will try to carry out a spectacular attack in retaliation for the Air Force attack," said a senior Northern Command source. Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, will today brief the General Staff about recent developments in Lebanon.
