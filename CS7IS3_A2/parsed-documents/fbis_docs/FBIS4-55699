Speeding up the rate of trade with the East is regarded as especially important. KERM adopted a program entitled "Principles of Economic Cooperation Policies With Countries of the East and East Asia," which is an integral part of "Programs Supporting Eastern Policies," which is being recommended to the Council of Ministers. In recent years, our trade exchange with countries of the former USSR and some countries of the East has suffered a substantial decline. According to the principles adopted by KERM, at least a partial reconstruction of our economic relations with the East is to become an important element of Poland's trade policies (this applies also to the fast-growing countries of the Pacific region and China). As Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said, Polish exports in that direction should be increasing at a clearly faster rate than exports to the remaining countries of the world. The deputy prime minister insists that we should continue trading despite the fact that sometimes transactions are dangerous and that there are problems with payments, while barter constitutes a significant portion (35 percent) of the exchange. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's assumption is that Poland's economic growth will be occurring through increased exports. He said he believes that growth will continue at a level of approximately 4.5 percent. But, for exports to be "the motor" of general economic growth, the rate of development of exports must exceed by half the rate of development of the economy in general. The structure of our exports should be changed toward greater participation of investment goods. A negative balance of payments in merchandise and monetary exchange (which is in the range of $700 to $800 million) is also a disadvantageous phenomenon. Kolodko expects trade exchange with that region of the world to reach the amount of $7.6 to $7.8 billion by 1997 (as compared with approximately $5 billion currently, which is 40 percent of the amount from 1990). In the assessment of KERM, direct reserves of increases in exports eastward have already been exhausted. It was announced that a review of procedures applied in returning taxes (VAT [value-added tax], customs duties, investment breaks) associated with financing cooperation with that region shall be implemented over the next five weeks. Interest rates on credits in investment exports shall be subsidized. Principles of payment with Eastern partners will also be put in order. Systemwide protection of the exchange is being prepared (setting in motion guarantees provided by the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance). A fund for state-provided guarantees in this kind of trade is said to reach the amount of $1.1 billion.
