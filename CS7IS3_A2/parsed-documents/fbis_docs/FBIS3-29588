It is noteworthy that both internal and international disputes have been solved through peaceful negotiations, and the world is on the road to peace. Various methods have been applied for the resolution of seemingly insurmountable disputes such as apartheid in South Africa, the PLO and Israel, and the Cambodian civil war. The All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) warmly welcomes all these achievements. If a comparison has to be made between these international problems and the Burmese crisis, we sadly discover that the former were negotiated in a freer atmosphere than the latter -- the most significant point being that bilateral views can be expressed and exchanged freely under the watchful eye of international observers. In the case of Burma, let alone allowing these internationally-accepted norms, Slorc (the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which rules Burma) has not created an atmosphere of hope or sincerity, not to mention a spirit of compromise. Instead, it has set unwritten conditions, such as the venue must be in their controlled areas, etc. The ABSDF has always accepted the peaceful solution of political problems through political means. However, there must be: -- A broad-based discussion on the current political problems -- The creation of a harmonious atmosphere, and -- The presence of international observers. Slorc has deliberately ignored such conditions, without which chances of the talks' success are slim. If we were to examine Slorc's overtures there is practically no chance of addressing the most important aspect -- the political problem -- which is the crux of the conflict, the ulterior motive being that it will be discussed only at Slorc's orchestrated National Convention. At its talks with the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), it repeated that unconditional surrender is the only way to political discussions. By insisting that this is an internal problem and talks could be held only inside the country, choosing insignificant towns instead of cities, clearly shows that it wants only its own version to be known. At the same time, it will restrict the movement of any negotiating party to prevent contact with the populace. [passage omitted] Despite their loud rhetoric, it is evident that Slorc is not heading towards a multi-party democracy. Instead, it is: -- Curbing fundamental freedoms, -- Liquidating some political parties and adopting multifarious methods to maim others, and -- Preventing people from participating freely in the political process. The farcical National Convention aims to legalise the leading role of the Burmese army. Among other signs that the military has no intention of giving up power are: -- Nullification of the 1990 general election, which was a manifestation of the people's desire for democracy. -- Expansion of repressive measures, which continues unabated. -- Monopolisation of the economy through both long- and short-term projects. -- Expansion of the armed forces and purchase of huge amounts of weapons. As the agenda for peace, all repressive measures must be revoked or abolished, such as martial law, extrajudicial killings, kangaroo courts, torture, concentration and interrogation camps, the secret Military Intelligence Service. All political prisoners and prisoners of conscience must be released, and forced labour and forced eviction must be stopped. Human rights must be protected and personal security guaranteed. Press freedom, freedom of assembly and freedom of expression must also be allowed, so as the rights of the workers and freedom in agronomy. The military mechanism has to go. This means Slorc must reduce the number of the combat forces and prevent further coups d'etat from taking place. Further, it is imperative that the army be subordinated to a civilian government. In regards to the ethnic minorities, equality and self-determination for them must be guaranteed. The right for them to freely participate in the political process is a must. Also, measures to promote the cultures and improve the living standards of ethnic peoples has to be implemented. Compensation must be paid for losses caused by atrocities and civil war. Destroyed villages must be reconstructed, forcibly-evicted villagers must be relocated to their original homes, violators of human rights must be brought to justice, and rehabilitation programmes for refugees must be set up. And finally, Slorc must transfer power to the duly-elected people's representatives. ABSDF's perspective on the ongoing negotiations between ethnic groups and Slorc is that it understands and sympathises with the difficult situation of the ethnic nationalities which have forced them to enter into the peace talks. The ABSDF regards them as allies until final victory. The ABSDF urges the nationalities: -- To consider the whole national issues, -- Not to confine themselves to bilateral economic issues but to highlight democracy and their rights, -- To adhere to DAB policies, and -- To strive for the unity of democratic forces and ethnic nationalities.
