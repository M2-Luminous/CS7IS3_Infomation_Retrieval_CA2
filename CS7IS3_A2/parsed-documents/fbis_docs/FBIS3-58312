Dust was everywhere. Smog made it hard to breathe. Then, after almost half a year of drought, the Attic sky opened up for three days in November. The floods destroyed houses, swept away cars, and put the streets under water. "We are not prepared for something like this," was the excuse that one Athenian gave. Many think that this is similar to the rain of money from Brussels: for years huge sums have been flowing to Europe's poorest member country but it has not really helped. About 6 percent of the Greek national product comes from the budget of the European Union [EU]. That is equal to approximately half of all Greek tax receipts. Every year Brussels pays every Greek household the equivalent of 4,000 marks [DM], and the trend is rising. It must have been quite a shock for the Greeks when in the early summer of 1992 Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, reproached them for their lack of success: "Greece must have a voice in Europe but not just to present its demands." The Greeks are not catching up with their partners. When they joined the EC 12 years ago, they were richer than Portugal and now they are last. They have the lowest per capita income, the lowest productivity, and the highest inflation. Stefanos Manos, conservative minister of economics until the election defeat in October, already fears: "We are lagging so far behind that we are endangering the solidarity of our partners." "Nonsense," others retort, "we are richer than the British, not to mention the Portuguese." One ought to add at least 40 percent to the national product to reflect reality. For the policeman drives a taxi after his shift is over, the civil servant has a second job at half past three, the teacher with his salary of DM1,000 gives private lessons at home, and the craftsman refuses to write out a bill. There is illicit work and tax evasion in Western Europe as well but nowhere in the EU is the shadow economy nearly as strong. Athen does not have beggars. Instead, the streets are full of large limousines. No where are there as many BMW's registered per capita as in Greece. Every day the traffic in the capital nearly comes to a standstill. But behind this facade is Greece's backwardness. It is still often impossible for days to call abroad during office hours. Important highways are in a deplorable state. Private industry provides only 12.5 percent of the national product. The banks earn a lot of money but the payments system is archaic. The Greek is forced to pay social security contributions, doctor fees, and electric or telephone bills with bundles of cash. For a long time, Athens handled the billions from Brussels as though it did not have to account to anyone. Here a church roof was patched, there a health center was opened, and somewhere else a superfluous congress palace was built--and for years no one pointed out where the money was coming from. Only lately did the Commission notice that its money benefited mostly the political friends of those governing. It was being said in Athens that foolish spending and the giving away of money were a thing of the past and that projects performed as favors no longer had a chance. Certainly Greece's unfavorable geography, its peripheral location, and the countless islands raise the costs of any plans for regional development. And the Greeks always add another argument: unfortunately one must reserve 7 percent of the national product for military expenditures on account of Turkish aggression, more than in any other country in NATO. But what has long been known in Athens and what they are reluctant to change: the greatest obstacle on the way to a modern state is the state itself. Everyone mistrusts it and cheats it, but they all want to be civil servants. The most frequent assessment of the work of the bureaucracy is that it is omnipresent and inefficient. That applies not only to the agencies but also to state enterprises and public institutions such as hospitals or schools. "No reasonable Greek sends his children to a public school," asserts an Athenian. Vasso Papandreou, member of the Brussels commission until the end of 1992, points out a no less paralyzing effect: the state apparatus is firmly in the hands of the respective governing party. The socialist deputy, not related to the head of the government, demands: "We must first make the state independent of the parties. Otherwise we cannot do it." But it would be the task of the century to get rid of the established clientele system, which also involves a good deal of nepotism. It is not just friends who are supported shamelessly, but above all one's own family is fed. When the conservative Premier Konstantin Mitsotakis entrusted his wife and daughter with government offices, the Left cried out in protest. But hardly was the socialist Papandreou in power when he brought his wife into the outer office and his son into the government. "Other countries will become party states before we develop in the opposite direction," thinks the political scientist Dimitris Charalambis from the University of Athens. In addition, many see the Orthodox Church as hindering the development. In principle, it is not a state church. But religion and the state are closely interwoven in Greece, not only because almost every Greek professes Orthodoxy but also because it provides a good deal of national identity. The church is a pillar of the state; it freely makes deals with the powerful. Athenian Archbishop Seraphim defended the colonels at the time of the military dictatorship with the same matter-of-factness based on the Bible as he now does the socialist Papandreou and the deputies. When it came to a mass demonstration against recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia last year, the Orthodox bishops marched at the front of it and incited nationalistic feelings. Critics also find fault with the lack of reality and antimodernism of a clergy that is paid from the state treasury. Do the Greeks know what they have in Europe? "We have a historical relationship with Europe," declares Thanos Lipowatz, "that is characterized by attraction and repulsion." The professor for political psychology points out Greek fears of losing their own identity in Europe. At the same time, however, the economic imperative is in effect and it appears that it more strongly influences public opinion. Meanwhile, everywhere in the country there are blue signs with the 12 golden stars indicating a construction project financed with money from Brussels. The funds for the huge construction site for the Athens subway come largely from the community pot. The farmers have never had it so good; 80 percent of agricultural produce is subsidized and the production of olive oil was never so profitable. It is no wonder that in surveys the Greeks are ahead of everyone in their positive attitude toward Europe. The socialist deputy Papandreou also asserts: "The people here feel that they belong more to Europe than to the Balkans." But Greece does not have a common border with any other state of the EU. Despite its proud history, the feeling that the West sees it merely as an appendix of Europe hurts. It is certainly more than a coincidence that the friendly passer-by at the airport asks: "Are you staying in the country or are you flying to Europe?"
