FBIS4-20767 "jpnea019___94029" JPRS-NEA-94-019 JPRS Near East & South Asia 12 December 1993 NEAR EAST REPUBLIC OF YEMEN Al-'Attas on Economy, Union, Security, Violence Al-'Attas on Economy, Union, Security, Violence 94LH0016A Sanaa AL-MUSTAQBAL in Arabic 12 Dec 93 pp 8-9 94LH0016A Sanaa AL-MUSTAQBAL Arabic CSO [Interview With Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas by AL-KHALIJ in Sanaa; date not given] [Excerpt] Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has noted that the situation in Yemen is difficult, that any clash could turn into a catastrophe, and that each province or tribe can move on its own. He has called for dialogue on all opinions, regardless of how disturbing, until the ideal unity formula is developed. Speaking of Salim Salih's statements on "federalism," al-'Attas said that before unity, the north demanded federalism, whereas representatives of the south demanded merger. Even though al-'Attas reasserted that Yemen is well and that it can overcome its ordeal if the will and the desire are there. However, he has expressed his concern for the absence of frank dialogue and over "things hatched in the dark." Al-'Attas has also warned that a continued crisis could lead to an end of all the coalition forces. Al-'Attas has revealed the details and secrets of the kidnaping of the U.S. information attache and of other acts of violence to which he personally and other party leaders have been subjected. He further revealed the details of proposals and timetables that he personally, and other party leaders, have submitted to end the crisis, including practical measures to prevent revenge and the use of revenge politically, to apprehend those responsible for violence, and to evacuate armed forces from the cities. The Yemeni prime minister has also noted the presence of forces determined to engage in sabotage and of organizations opposed to unity. But he reaffirmed that he is confident that the union will continue and that Yemen can deal with the ordeal. He also touched on details of the financial issues and on the economic and social problems. All this is contained in a lengthy interview which AL-KHALIJ conducted with al-'Attas at his home in Sanaa. Following are the details. Economic and Political Crisis [AL-KHALIJ] Yemen's economic and social crisis seems to be extremely severe. The riyal has been sliding so swiftly that a dollar is worth 56.5 riyals now. Development seems to be suspended, and even normal growth seems to be nonexistent. Even though land development in the capital continues, the manifestations of poverty seem to have grown worse for somebody who visited Yemen a few years ago. Is this a reflection of the ongoing political crisis, or are there other reasons? ['Attas] The economic crisis is not caused by the current political crises but is an old crisis. Many wagered in the past on the collapse of the united Yemen. But the government has made very great efforts in recent years, especially in 1991 and 1992, and it gained strong control over the economic conditions. In 1991, the government was able for the first time to control the general deficit of the general state budget, reducing that deficit from 15 billion to five billion riyals, a figure that aroused a great deal of optimism among us. The 1992 budget was drafted on the basis of that success, and an investment program was drawn up for the first time. We held a joint meeting with the Presidential Council at the beginning of 1992, in the wake of political tensions that surfaced at the end of 1991. A number of economic measures capable of improving the conditions and of neutralizing the negative effects of the political developments were taken. But regrettably, political tensions and security violations increased, and those developments swept away numerous aspirations. The crisis climaxed in December 1992, thus forcing the government to address a strongly worded message to the political leaders. We also discussed the crisis at the House of Representatives. What happened during those crises could have been overcome if it had not been for the absence of a united political will at the leadership--an absence which led to exploiting the conditions and manipulating the economy. Even if professional merchants respect their trade and operate in a sound economic manner, intruders corrupt everything. The fluctuating prices that we are experiencing are the result of the activity of these intruders and corrupters. Fabricated Operation [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that the drop in the value of the national currency is a fabricated thing that does not reflect the true economic conditions? ['Attas] Yes, it is fabricated. It is also tantamount to exploitation of the crisis for illicit gain. Last December, we started organizing a currency exchange rate list compatible with our tendency to move toward a free-market economy. But even that list has been nullified. However, we continue to try to implement it. I met with the Central Bank management a few days ago. The unsound approach to exchange rates and to currency should be ended by the end of this current month (November). Severe penalties will be imposed on any illicit transactions violating the official list. Regrettably, there are large numbers of merchants who are engaged in the money-changing trade. [AL-KHALIJ] Frankly, can merchants play such a serious game without being backed in one way or another? ['Attas] I will emphasize that good merchants, including the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and well-known merchants, have taken a good position. They are opposed to what is going on in the market. But intruders are exacerbating the crisis. There are also responsible citizens who, regrettably, engage in the money-changing trade in a faulty manner. Fearful Spending [AL-KHALIJ] More frankly, I have learned that the people's hardship has reached such a phase that people are disavowing the coalition, unity, and democracy. ['Attas] The economic condition is the main issue, of course. All political accomplishments mean nothing if the citizen experiences problems in his daily life. This is why, when drafting the 1992 budget, we were eager to curtail inflation and the economic problems. A main cause of inflation is the general state budget. It so happens that I was talking to the finance minister a short time ago. Vast sums of money are spent without even consulting the prime minister. A short time ago, I was reminding the finance minister that he is not entitled to spend such immense sums, even if he receives instructions from any other authority. State spending is fearful, especially the military establishment's spending. I do not believe that all that is spent in the name of this establishment is used for its benefit. [AL-KHALIJ] It is normal that the military establishment's spending grows under the circumstances of the political crisis and when the conflicting forces rely on their own military forces. ['Attas] The truth is that this spending is not a consequence of the crisis. The volume of spending on the military establishment has been a subject of dispute since 1991. At the outset of 1992, we tried to curtail this spending, but to no avail. In July this year, prior to the crisis, I held a meeting with the finance minister, defense minister, and the military establishment, and the focus was on the problem of food supplies and on spending on personnel. [AL-KHALIJ] What are the figures that can be made public in the military sphere? ['Attas] Our armed forces are 246,000-strong. But we have taken an official decision that they will not exceed 150,000. Smuggling Problems [AL-KHALIJ] Why has Yemen's currency not been unified to date, despite the announcements on such a step? ['Attas] To begin with, I would like to say that the economic situation can be brought under control, that the riyal can regain its strength, and that the standard of living can be enhanced if two things are achieved: first, control over state spending and, second, control over state revenues. A total of 50 percent of the state revenues are not collected, and smuggling is growing by bounds and leaps. Whenever we move to seize smuggling cases, our movement is thwarted. [AL-KHALIJ] I have heard merchants and sellers say that high prices in interior towns are due to the fact that merchants are forced to pay large sums of money, which are levied on them between the coastal towns and the interior. ['Attas] Those who guard smuggling are the people who collect these enormous sums. [AL-KHALIJ] Does not a part of these sums end up in the state budget, in the form of official taxes? ['Attas] No part ends up in the state budget, and this is one of the most significant problems. [AL-KHALIJ] But we have heard that the people who make the collection are people in an official capacity? ['Attas] These people use some facilities; they permit smuggling; they gain and the country, the economy, and the government lose the revenues to which they are entitled. What is more important is that the majority of the imported goods are outside the program adopted by the Council of Ministers. This importing increases the demand for dollars puts more pressure on the national currency. But in spite of this, I emphasize that Yemen has the resources to control the economic situation. Oil revenues are increasing. If the other resources are brought under control, there will be no deficit in the Yemeni budget. Unified Currency [AL-KHALIJ] A lot of reports were disseminated prior to the latest crisis, indicating that the disbursement of salaries would be held up by numerous state institutions. At times, these reports led to strikes and demonstrations staged in the face of an unconvincing explanation which used the lack of printed currency as an excuse. What is the true explanation concerning this issue? ['Attas] This confirms the opposite of what some brothers allege, namely that the crisis is the result of the current circumstances. During the 1992 crisis, these brothers hoarded money in their homes and kept it away from banks because of some steps taken by the Central Bank to counter speculation in riyals. It was especially noticed then that large-scale bank credits were acquired not to import, set up plants, or invest in agriculture, but to speculate in currency. This is why the Central Bank hastened to suspend the credits, thus causing a reaction among speculators and a liquidity problem. This was a temporary problem, which we tackled promptly. Beyond this framework, the problem also materialized due to administrative reasons, considering that the paperwork is heavy and saddles the administration. We seek to eliminate this paperwork. [AL-KHALIJ] Both currencies of Yemen have collapsed. But relatively speaking, the dinar has collapsed by a much greater degree. Why? ['Attas] The exchange rate has been set at 26 riyals per dinar. But sellers and merchants deal on the basis of an exchange rate of one shilling per riyal. [AL-KHALIJ] How? ['Attas] (With a laugh) Just like that. They even try khat [to set the exchange rate]. But citizens in the southern and eastern governorates have been affected by this drop. [AL-KHALIJ] Which means that the people are more determined than the government to unify the currency. ['Attas] This is why we have decided to withdraw the dinar, why we have actually decided that the riyal is the state currency, and why we have printed enough riyals to meet the need throughout the republic. [AL-KHALIJ] We know that there has been a decision to unify the currency. But both currencies continue to be in circulation. ['Attas] Yes, the decision to unify the currency was made in 1991. But the 1992 liquidity crisis forced the Central Bank to put the dinar, which it had begun to withdraw, back in circulation. The consequences of this problem have persisted in spite of the decision to adopt the riyal. Now, we are actually thinking of adopting a new currency. Here we would like to remind those who accuse the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] of seeking to secede that this party is the party that demands a new currency, which represents the united state. How could a party demanding a single currency adopt secession? A party that wants secession does not try to abolish its own currency. Conflict and Sedition [AL-KHALIJ] Thank God that you are the one who has brought up the subject of secession. Perhaps you are aware of brother Salim Salih's message, which has been circulated by fax throughout all parts of Yemen. This message calls for a federalist formula, which some people, especially in the GPC [General People's Congress], have considered a test balloon to probe the consequences and possibility of backing away from unity. ['Attas] The fact is that in crises like these, all are supposed to have enough wisdom and steadfastness to deal with all developments, except backsliding and confrontation. With opinion and intelligence, dialogue can be held on everything. If the leadership itself prohibits discussing any issue, it denies itself the means and the possibilities of developing the right position. A lot is, of course, being said all over Yemen and in Sanaa itself. What brother Salim Salih has said is personal and does not represent the [YSP] party. Currently, things a whole lot more serious than this are being raised in Sanaa. Such things can be concluded from the campaign against the YSP. Last month, a statement was distributed by the GPC, entitled "YSP Provocations on the Path of Secession." Those words were an intelligence report, fundamentally, and we familiarized ourselves with that report when the Political Bureau acquired a copy prior to the Central Committee meeting. The whole statement is nothing but lies. The more serious part of that statement is the second part, which contains the recommendations. Whoever reads this statement can see what the premeditated plans are. The statement says that the YSP sells weapons and military equipment and vehicles, and that it seeks secession. Can this be true? What kind of contradictions are these? Does one who seeks secession sell his strength and get rid of it, or does he insist on maintaining it? These are contradictory and irrational words. [AL-KHALIJ] Unless money becomes more important than weapons in the conflict. ['Attas] (Laughing) Of course, all weapons are used in conflicts. But not insofar as we are concerned. What I meant by citing this instance is to point out that there are things that fan the fires of conflict and sedition and that do not bring people together and unite them. In light of brother Salim Salih's statements, I had an appointment yesterday to meet with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani and with brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi. Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim didn't show up. He then called me and said: Have you seen Salim Salih's statement? I said: No. He then came and brought the statement, which I had not read, with him. So, I said to him: Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim, have you contacted Salim Salih and others and told them we "either hold together on equitable terms, or separate with kindness" [Koran 2:229]. When I talked to Salim Salih, he responded: 'Abd-al-Karim says such things, so why do not you protest against him? Frankly, I personally am not worried by any opinion expressed openly to be debated. I worry when things are hatched in the dark. Confrontation Is Catastrophic [AL-KHALIJ] There are those who see that the most significant reasons of the crisis are the conflicting opinions within each of the coalition parties. They also believe that internal conflicts within each party, whether the YSP, the GPC, or the YGR [Yemeni Grouping for Reform], paralyze dialogue and reflect on it negatively and that all these parties include forces that support unity and forces that oppose it. What is your opinion? ['Attas] This is a fact. If you examine the pre-unity positions, you would find that there were anti-unity forces in the parties. I believe that many of those forces have not changed their positions. [AL-KHALIJ] But does not this mean that should, God forbid, conditions move in the direction of confrontation and secession, then not only the two parts that existed in the past will be brought back into existence, but a hundred catastrophes will arise? ['Attas] This is a foregone conclusion. We are aware of it, and we all work to prevent such a development, because nobody will be able to control any military confrontation. Numerous forces will enter into the conflict. Each province or tribe will be able to move on its own and all will be destroyed. This is why we are eager to control matters and to prevent any conflict. Let people carry on with the dialogue until they develop solutions to all problems. [AL-KHALIJ] What point has the joint Council of Ministers-House of Representatives Committee reached in its work? ['Attas] In the latest meeting, the committee's concern was to prevent an escalation of the crisis, to contain this crisis, and to create the conditions for dialogue. The House of Representatives really planned to take steps to deal with the crisis. The house protested a statement I made against this tendency when I was in Aden. I reiterate now that such a decision is tantamount to a war declaration [as published]. It would be a positive step on the house's part to back away from this line, to understand its responsibility, and to realize the dangers that would emanate from this tendency. I intended my aforementioned statement to clarify matters. But it "upset" the House of Representatives, and it would have behooved the house not to get upset. It has been proven to it now that this line is destructive and that it may actually lead to secession. Unity and Federalism [AL-KHALIJ] Do we understand from your words that the joint Cabinet-House committee has stopped its effort to solve the crisis? ['Attas] No, it continues to work to contain the crisis. I believe that the best way is to continue the dialogue and to put everything, regardless of how disturbing, on the table. Yesterday (Saturday), I advised the brothers in the coalition not to be provoked by Salim Salih's statement and not to respond to him inappropriately. Otherwise, they will contribute to the escalation. Permit me to say that the media have played a fundamental role in this issue and that we have to discuss everything now. It is true that when we discussed the unity issue, the plan of the brothers here (meaning the former North Yemen) was a plan for a federal union. But the south demanded a merger, and the brothers here acknowledge this fact. It is true that it seems that we did not study the conditions in Yemen carefully and that we could have embraced the procedure gradually. But emotion had its influence, and there actually was a rush to accomplish unity when the accord was signed in November 1989, with the determination to accomplish unity the following November. [AL-KHALIJ] Do you mean that problems were carried over to the united Yemen and that you agree with those who believe that the YSP and the GPC rushed to unity in order to escape from their regional problems, thus trying to gain the sympathy of the unity-minded Yemeni public, and that, consequently, the preparations necessary for unity were not made? ['Attas] Yes. [AL-KHALIJ] But observers of the situation in Yemen believe that it is no longer possible to back away from the unity formula. ['Attas] This is one of the problems facing us. I have no decisive opinion on how to deal with issues. But one is forced to swallow a bitter pill at times. [AL-KHALIJ] But every force in the coalition wants the others, but not itself, to swallow the bitter pill. ['Attas] Yes, this is the problem. If it persists, they will all perish. Brink of Abyss [AL-KHALIJ] Even the dialogue is about to come to a halt. Dialogue sessions have been postponed repeatedly. Meeting dates have been announced repeatedly. But no meetings have been held by the committees or between the president and his vice president. ['Attas] We do not know who schedules these meetings! The meeting between the president and his vice president is something else. Let me reveal to you here a dialogue program which we (the YSP) presented but which was rejected by the GPC. It is a three-part program: The first part deals with the constitutional amendments and calls for abolishing them for the time being. The second part concerns the Presidential Council election, and the third deals with controversial issues. We have made this proposal: We cannot discuss all issues now in a tense climate. So let us define and list the issues and then commit ourselves to discuss them two weeks after the crisis eases. Now let us focus on one issue, namely the security issue. Three things emanate from this issue: suspicion; revenge, which must be outlawed; and the armed forces' presence in cities. We delivered this proposal to them [in the GPC] but they rejected it. Now, they want to return to the proposal. But frankly, we find that its time has passed. So, let us ask: Does he who submits these proposals want to solve the problem or not? I asked them this question and delivered to them the program in the YSP's name. I, Jarallah, and Dr. Yasin debated with them. I personally wrote the minutes of the meeting when I noticed that the debate was getting complex and that things were being done outside the committee to obstruct the committee's work. At times, one wonders about their logic and about how they could reject such proposals. What is more, they come now to tell us: We agree to the 18 points! Why did they not agree to them when they were announced? I cannot understand what is going on. [AL-KHALIJ] It is obvious that what has happened to date between the coalition forces is a dialogue of the deaf. Despite the small degree of relaxation created by the U.S. statements and by the U.S. definition of the controls of the conflict, the question that persists is: Until when will Yemen be able to withstand the brinkmanship policies? Is it logical to wager more on outside forces than on internal dialogue? ['Attas] I answered this question with a public address I delivered at the conclusion of the conference of the Nasirite Popular Unionist Organization. I said no solutions will come from abroad. We are the ones who should tackle the problem. It is futile to wager on the outside world. This problem can only be solved by Yemen's sons, by the responsible among them, and by the coalition in particular. There is no justification to waste time any longer. The most difficult thing facing us is rejection of reality and the refusal to deal with it soundly. [AL-KHALIJ] What is the role you envision for the political forces that are outside the coalition? ['Attas] They can play an assisting role. But the decisionmaking is in the coalition's hands, particularly hands of the YSP and the GPC. They are the two parties that can make the decision. They are confronted with a historic responsibility. They are the two parties that made the unity, and they are the ones that can preserve it. Honesty and Confidence [AL-KHALIJ] With the unity declaration, people ignored all the negatives that had preceded the declaration, and the two parties were crowned as champions of unity. Do not the two parties consider this fact now, and do they not realize the dimensions of the danger and the defacement that will afflict them if any setback is suffered? ['Attas] Certainly. But what we lack now are the honesty and the confidence to overcome difficulties. The Gulf War was the first tremor to hit Yemen's unity. Many questions remain unanswered. After the war, people sensed danger, and they united. But then the problem resurfaced. Since the middle of 1991, we have been confronted with successive crises. We formed the first joint YSP-GPC committee to solve this problem in November 1991. But we continue to suffer, and this is amazing. Note: at this moment, an employee arrived with a big envelope. The prime minister asked Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim al-Sawsawah, the Information Ministry undersecretary, to read passages from the program, and then said: "She will read so you can hear the text from her." But Amat-al-'Alim said, "I have memorized it. I do not need to read it." Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas responded, "No, they have not distributed this to you." After pointing out that the passage is from an official proposal which he, al-'Attas, submitted on 10 October to deal with the crisis, she read: "Proceeding on basis of the accord signed by the party [YSP] and the grouping [YGR], which states that introducing the constitutional amendments is one of the tasks that must be accomplished; considering that the time available has not helped the parties to the coalition to accomplish this task in the period since the Presidential Council's term was extended; and in order to provide the proper period of time to complete and pass the amendments; to underline the coalition's eagerness to reassert the democratic march which was launched on 27 April 1993; to cement national unity and the trust between the coalition parties; and out of concern for this pioneer experiment, the allied parties have agreed on the following: "First, the parties to the coalition will carry on with the dialogue to develop an agreed formula for the constitutional amendments during a maximum period of three months. The formula agreed on for the constitutional amendments will be submitted as a plan for general discussion. A national committee will be formed of the ruling coalition parties, the opposition parties, university professors in Sanaa and Aden, ulema, and social figures and submit draft amendments to be approved and passed by the House of Representatives within a maximum period of two years. "Second, the Presidential Council will be elected in accordance with the current Constitution, on the basis of the coalition, and through agreement among the parties to the coalition: the GPC, the YSP, and the YGR. "Third, in view of shortness of the time available to debate the issues raised by the YSP, as well as the issues raised by the coalition parties, on developing the state and on the citizens' problems, and in view of the approval attached to this accord and its supplements (1, 2, and 3), the parties to the coalition have agreed on the following: "1. Continue the dialogue to unify the coalition's vision of the issues that have been raised and that are attached to this accord so as to help the government implement this accord. "2. The coalition will undertake to complete this task within two weeks. "3. The coalition will require its members in the government to implement the contents of the cabinet statement. "In view of the importance of some issues and of their impact on security and on the stability of the citizens' living conditions, the parties to the coalition have agreed on the following: "1. The coalition declares its adoption of a general truce among the tribes. In accordance with this truce, the practice of revenge shall be prohibited. Whoever engages in taking revenge shall be considered an outlaw, and the state agencies concerned shall take strict legal measures against him. A national committee shall be formed to survey and deal with cases of revenge occurring prior to the declaration. The government shall incur any expenses required by this step. The truce shall be declared within two weeks. "2. The coalition shall assign the government to take the steps necessary to arrest suspects whose names have been mentioned during investigations of the assassinations and assassination attempts, highway robberies, and of other security violations within a maximum period of six weeks. Whoever harbors a suspect shall be considered in violation of the law, and legal steps shall be taken against him. "Army forces shall be evacuated from major cities in accordance with the unity accords. The Presidential Council shall ratify Council of Ministers decree No. (....) on the temporary administrative division of the republic. "4. Monthly reports shall be submitted to the coalition leadership by the authorities concerned on the implementation of the contents of this accord and on adoption of the necessary measures." Credibility Crisis Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to add, "This is a copy of the letter that was not approved on 10 October. Now all 18 points are accepted. How come?" [AL-KHALIJ] The GPC feels that the YSP is pushing in the direction of escalating the conflict and is calling for involving the opposition forces in the dialogue so as to broaden its political base. What is your opinion? ['Attas] Numerous documents developed by the GPC and the YSP met their end before they were signed. We have had discussions with each other, we have met repeatedly since last September, and we have had discussions within the coalition. When we submitted this proposal to the dialogue committee in the YSP's name, it was a realistic and responsible proposal to overcome the crisis and then to deal with issues calmly. Now top-level GPC circles say that they will accept whatever the YSP accepts. There is an issue that has escaped many, namely the issue of confidence. Because of the crisis, confidence exists no longer, and herein lies the problem. The president has told me: I state explicitly and say that I have accepted all 18 points. I responded: It is no use now. We discussed all the details in your presence, so why did you not say this? The problem is that I doubt that the statements by the GPC circles are sincere. In truth, the more important problem is: How do we restore confidence? Yesterday I received a report from the party in Ta'izz indicating that the plan to assassinate (Anisi?), a parliament member representing the YSP, and the party organization secretary goes on. I sent the report today, Sunday, to the interior minister and to the security agency chief to be investigated. There are forces determined to engage in sabotage. Even in the latest operation in which a U.S. information official was kidnapped, the kidnapper used a car that carried a forged license plate attributed to Aden. Security Secrets [AL-KHALIJ] What are the secrets behind the kidnapping? ['Attas] This person is an army colonel named Mubarak Salih Mashan al-Zayidi. He had previously carried out an act that caused an oil pipeline to rupture and production to be stopped for 48 hours. We decided to send a force to arrest al-Zayidi. But tribal chiefs intervened to solve the issue. However, here he is, persisting in his acts. By the way, he is not the only one to engage in such acts. Before him, another man kidnaped French tourists in the same province of Ma'rib. We said: Let us punish this man. They responded: We will settle the issue tribally. The man demanded a salary and some other things. An offense against Yemen is something easy to these people. [AL-KHALIJ] It seems that for the YSP, the security problem is the most urgent problem. ['Attas] Not just for the YSP, but for all of Yemen. [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has held the Jihad Organization responsible and has asserted that there are 15 Jihad members in jail and that efforts are being made to arrest the others, totaling nearly 60 in number. ['Attas] Jihad is one of the forces involved. These forces were determined some time ago, and we embarked on a conflict over arresting them and bringing them to trial. Even the interrogation reports have been altered. This is amazing. The security agencies and this alien organizations cross paths, and perhaps the organization is used. What offends the YSP even more is that after each incident of the sort, some GPC leaders say that it is the result of conflict within the YSP. This has offended the YSP greatly. If the GPC has such information, then it should seize those who are responsible for the incidents, even if they are from the YSP. When I received the first threat about a mine planted near my home, I was meeting with the deputy prime ministers. Suddenly, the mine exploded and soldiers rushed to the explosion site. There they were able to apprehend two people. The traces of TNT were still showing strongly on the hand of one of the two men, because he had planted the explosive and connected it to a fuse, hence the traces on his hand. We apprehended the man and the report, photographs, and all interrogation requirements were prepared. The next day, security forces took the evidence and altered the report at their laboratory. They said that the traces the man had on his hand were those of qat, as if qat contains TNT. They also said that the mine was not an antitank mine but an anti-personnel mine, even though we know that the mine was an antitank mine, and this is supported by photographs and data. The interior minister presented this modified report to the Council of Ministers. We also discovered that the young officer who had prepared the original report had been dismissed from his work. At the Council of Ministers, I said, "O interior minister, there is a crossing of paths in your agencies." They then said that the suspect, a 28-year-old man, is insane. This is how an incident aimed against the prime minister has been handled, and the prime minister cannot learn the truth! This incident occurred in 1992. Afterward, assassinations were perpetrated with the purpose of pressuring people. All this happened after the security plan was drafted. This is why we want to establish security first, and then the development and reform program will follow. The threats continued by phone. One day, I was sitting here and I had the interior minister, his deputy, and some Interior Ministry brothers with me. The telephone rang and the caller said that Dr. al-Maqalih wanted to talk to me. So I took the receiver to speak to al-Maqalih, but what I heard was a different voice. So, I said to the caller, "You aren't al-Muqalih." He said that he was and that his voice was different because of qat. I gestured to the interior minister to do something, if he could. Suddenly, the man started threatening me on the phone. This happened in May, and they exploded the mine afterward. What is surprising is that the voice was familiar to me and that it rings in my ears. But I could not identify it. Premeditated Violence [AL-KHALIJ] An observer notices that acts of violence were perpetrated prior to the elections, were stopped during the elections, and resurfaced prior to the latest crisis. How do you understand this condition? Are the acts premeditated? Who is behind them? ['Attas] They are premeditated. It is as if they proceed "on command." As to who the planners are, only God knows. [AL-KHALIJ] The interior minister has told us that he will announce all the facts very soon. ['Attas] God willing. I had an appointment with them regarding this issue for today, Sunday. But they have not finished. There is a lot of information on violence, especially by the Jihad Organization and by some other elements. Agreement was reached on this issue, and we decided to arrest a group of people, some of them residing in the southern governorates and some here. Orders were issued to police stations. The brothers in the southern governorates arrested the individuals wanted immediately and brought them here. But here, the wanted, who include officers, enter and leave Sanaa, and nobody dares arrest them. When I said that the wanted included officers, they asked: Who? One of them is Najib al-Salahi, an officer in the first armored division. When we raised his name, they said: We can bring this one at any time. When I sent a message to the interior minister to arrest them, no answer was given. A lot can be said about this issue. The important thing is that security concerns all people and that nobody can live without security. In wake of the accord, acts of violence were premeditated, and they "erupted and stopped" with some sort of intelligence. While main elements of the YSP have been targeted directly, some explosions have been staged near the homes of some GPC leaders. Explosions have been staged near the homes of 'Abd-al-Karim al-'Arshi and of al-Lawzi. But one feels that they are for coverup so people will not say that the blows are aimed against the YSP alone. There is a difference between shooting to kill and shooting for some other purpose. On 5 September, I went to discuss the security issue and to debate Yemen's conditions with brother 'Ali al-Bid. I arrived in Aden and during my meeting with brother 'Ali, the telephone rang and I was told that it was the interior minister. He told me not to worry about the bomb that had exploded near my home and said that he was investigating the issue. Okay, who exploded this bomb, and why? It is as if whoever did it wanted to say to me: Why are you going to Aden? Leave the issue alone. Why do you tackle it? Foreign Forces, But.... [AL-KHALIJ] What are your reports and your information on this issue? ['Attas] There are parties hostile to the Yemeni people's true aspirations. Jihad is just a part of the process. Even Jihad is used by others. Our party has expressed its opinion, and I have personally sent a message to the Presidential Council on the issue. We want to deal with the problem. We know that there are foreign forces working against unity. But the executors are Yemeni citizens. We want to tell Yemeni citizens: Break the ties with the foreign forces. We talk to these people clearly, but we do nothing else to them. What more can we do? I offered several proposals to end this issue: We can arrest those responsible for what has been done, but we do not harm them. We just tell them: Here are the facts, and here is where you stop. Or else we can relieve the Interior Ministry leaders, because they are unable to end this phenomenon. Or the Council of Ministers can resign and a new government can be formed. They responded: We will end the issue. We reviewed all the names, and all they did was to arrest the famous poor young man (al-Fadli) in Shabwah. He revealed all the names, but they have done nothing important to end the crisis. [AL-KHALIJ] In an interview with AL-KHALIJ two months ago, brother Anis Yahya raised the issue of the escape of prisoners from jail. When I raised this issue here in Sanaa, people pointed out to me that the jail is under the control of officers and officials from the YSP. What do you say? ['Attas] I addressed a committee of the House of Representatives and said that the mistake that the brothers here made and whose negative consequences we are reaping now is that the brothers here believed that everything in the south, including people, land, and institutions, belonged to the YSP, even though this is not true. (Here, Mrs. Amat-al-'Alim interposed to say, "Thank God.") (Al-'Attas went on to add:) We have been saying this for a long time. But this mistake and others have caused the people in the south to react, making them all insist that the YSP is their representative in the unity. In the latest election, all people in the south voted for the YSP, which was even the reason behind the two GPC candidates who won in the south. (Again, Mrs. al-'Alim interposed to say, "Regrettably, this is not good for the country." The prime minister said Amen to her words). (Al-'Attas further added:) Even we in the YSP did not expect more than 50 percent of the southern vote. But because of this position, people reacted, and they all considered the YSP their true representative. We did not want this thing to happen. Regrettably, there are many who have begun pondering unity in its current form. Numerous mass organizations have begun to rise and to move in this direction. [passage omitted]
