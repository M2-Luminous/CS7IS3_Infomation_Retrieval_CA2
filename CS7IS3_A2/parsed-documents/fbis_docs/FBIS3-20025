He asserted that the crisis has begun to be surmounted, but did not hazard dates for reflecting growth in job creation. He condemned the leading opposition party's stance as "defeatist," because it asserts that "we will not emerge from the crisis because the government is incompetent. This argument will turn against them when people realize that we are emerging from the crisis." "We will emerge from the crisis without the People's Party," the prime minister said. Gonzalez described the situation by asserting that the crisis bottomed out a year ago, and now we have begun the upturn, thanks especially to a number of very realistic economic measures -- lowering of interest rates, a new peseta exchange rate, combating the deficit -- which provide a more favorable framework for investment, and hence for job creation. Gonzalez made these statements during the interview he granted to Radio Nacional 24 hours before his party held its congress, which is intended precisely to give an impetus to the government policy aimed at economic recovery. On this issue, the prime minister adopted a very down-to-earth approach, not expressing great expectations, but demanding of society in general and his party in particular that they understand the absolute value of competitiveness as the sole springboard capable of ensuring not just economic recovery, but the welfare state's very survival in the medium-term. The Socialist leader also mentioned the importance of structural measures, and emphasized the need to broaden the country's production base, an aim to which the current labor reform is geared. Gonzalez spoke emphatically in this part of the interview, trying to be especially persuasive, aware of the opposition to these changes, which was most forcefully expressed in the 27 January strike. In the opinion of Gonzalez, it is clear that unemployment remains the country's main problem. In order to combat it, it is necessary to "break down the barriers" impeding access to the labor market and find new approaches to work. Broadening the production base, having more people working, should make it possible to "maintain solidarity programs," including pensions. Gonzalez tried to reassure current pensioners by asserting that they are guaranteed "a decent income." Nevertheless, he added that a debate on possible ways to maintain these benefits in the future should not be ruled out. To this end, he stressed, it is necessary to ensure "growth" and "competitiveness" -- a word which he repeated. The prime minister maintained that thes debate on the future of the welfare state should be governed by "seriousness" and "responsibility," especially in a ruling party. Here there was a very direct appeal to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to renounce all dogmatism in the reformulation of Socialist doctrine. The values to be defended are still, he argued, freedom, solidarity, and social justice, embodied in services such as the education and public health systems and pensions. In order to embrace those principles and safeguard these systems, however, it is necessary to act with "realism" and with "imagination." Therefore, the PSOE "cannot undertake to do something for which (the country) later cannot pay." Spain needs, he also said, "lively enterprises," able to compete on international markets. Our country needs to win the "confidence" of investors and consumers daily, since it operates in an open economy. This year, "tourism, the construction industry, and the external sector will fare well." This situation must be viewed without the People's Party's "defeatism" and "alarmism," but with "concern" in the sense that "we cannot set all the bells ringing." In the opinion of Gonzalez, wages must not "soar," nor must inflation be allowed to revive. He described as "wishful thinking" the alternatives of the People's Party, which, in his view, "is spinning yarns." He said he regrets that this is the stance "of a party with possible government responsibilities, because it has over 8 million votes." On political dialogue, Gonzalez stressed that the dialogue with Convergence and Union -- a force with which there is a "fluid and serious" relationship, characteristics not shared, however, by "the opinions some people express on this" -- is going "quite well." He also stated that he retains the "hope" that there will be no blocking with respect to the democratic impetus -- filling vacancies in institutional bodies. If this is not achieved, however, the government will adopt "measures." Gonzalez reiterated: "I am interested in the Spanish Government and European building viewed from Spain," not in playing a leading role in it from Brussels. He said in conclusion that he will stay on "as long as the public puts up with me."
