The associated bureau, a powerful machine-building base, is proud of being a "powerful enterprise" enjoying deep trust of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. He gave highly important teachings to the bureau, guiding it on the spot on several occasions in order to develop it into a large-scale modern machinery production base. Comrade Kim Chong-il called at the bureau in May 1984. Watching the 3,000-ton press operating, he assigned it the task to manufacture a 10,000-ton press suited to the expanded economic scale. Upholding this task, the workers there worked out designs of the large machine made up of 70,200 parts of some 3,000 kinds in a few months and successfully built in a little more than one year a 10,000-ton press which would have taken four or five years at ordinary pace. Upon receiving a report about the completion of the 10,000-ton press, Comrade Kim Chong-il visited the bureau again in March 1986 and praised the workers and officials of Yongsong repeatedly, saying they had done a big thing, they ere admirable and the bureau is, indeed, a powerful enterprise. The bureau was a small machine plant which supplied parts to factories in the Hungnam area shortly after liberation. It made a fresh start in its development after the war. It was widely known as "a hero factory" by making a 510 mm rolling machine frame and a 1,500 HP speed reducer with highly efficient single-purpose machines made by it for itself at the end of the 50s in response to the slogan of the Workers' Party of Korea "iron and machinery are the king of industry [word indistinct]." The bureau, later on, made large machine tools including a combined processing line of large materials, a 20-metre lathe and 18-metre turning lathe to reinforce its own processes. And it greatly contributed to the building of an independent national economy by producing such complicated and modern ordered equipment and large machines as a 3,000-ton press, 6,000-ton press, a 10,000-ton press, a 40,000 cubic metre centrifugal compressor, a 4,000 HP compressor and a large wheel press. Now the bureau is pulling full weight on the production of equipment for accomplishing the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture on a higher level, large blower of sulfuric acid and other equipment for fertilizer production, equipment for the modernisation of light industrial factories and large machines including Yongsong lathe no. 3 in hearty response to the decisions of the 1st plenary meeting of the 6th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.
