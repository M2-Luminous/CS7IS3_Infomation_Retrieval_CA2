Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet wants everybody to be happy. He reaffirmed yesterday in Singapore that, on 12 January, France did not undertake to cease selling weapons to Taiwan altogether, but only those weapons "deemed offensive for mainland China" or "likely to threaten its integrity or its security." This is a way for Mr. Longuet to expand on statements made by Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who insisted last week on the fact that Paris reserved the right to continue selling "nonoffensive" equipment to Taiwan. However, choosing to do it from Singapore was no accident. France, which will supply 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft and their weaponry to Taiwan, knows that it must give up hope of selling it three assault submarines worth 20 billion francs. Making Up For Lost Time However, France has not given up its intention of selling assault armored vehicles as well as Roland missiles, since such equipment can very well be considered as defensive weapons. And above all, France does not want to lose other customers in the region, including Singapore. "The agreement signed with Beijing is likely to open markets which were hitherto closed to France, but it also creates a risk of destabilization for noncommunist countries, including Southeast Asia's `dragons,'" says a weapons manufacturer. This analysis applies not only to the defense industry, but also to civilian sectors. And, as reaffirmed yesterday by Gerard Longuet, France wishes to position itself in Singapore so as to be better placed in Malaysia, India, and Vietnam. France did not prove active enough in this region. It needs to "make up for lost time," insists Mr. Longuet. As for manufacturers, from Aerospatiale to Thomson to Alcatel-Alsthom, if the government works toward smoothing things out, so much the better. Improved relations between Paris and Beijing are expected to help Airbus Industries sell its aircraft in China. However, this does not justify ignoring other countries, which would immediately turn to the United States anyway. Minister Seeks To Reassure Singapore is one of them. Its influence in the region is substantial. Accordingly, Gerard Longuet waxes reassuringly toward those who fear France might focus on China to the detriment of everyone else.
