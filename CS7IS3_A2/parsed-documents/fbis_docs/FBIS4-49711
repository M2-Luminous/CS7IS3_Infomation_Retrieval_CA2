With a sound economic foundation, the Chang Jiang Delta generates 40 percent of the nation's industrial and agricultural output value and 50 percent of the state revenue each year. In December 1985 the governments of Shanghai, China's largest economic center; Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province; Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province; and Chongqing, a populous city in southwest China, sponsored a Chang Jiang Valley economic coordination association. The association, with 23 member cities, has been playing a big role in opening further to the outside world, with Shanghai's Pudong new area, China's largest economic and technological development zone, as the leader since 1992. In line with its geographical conditions, the valley has formed five economically coordinated zones: the Chang Jiang Delta economic co-operation zone headed by Shanghai, the lower reaches economic co-operation zone with Nanjing as the leader, the middle reaches economic co-operation zone with Wuhan as the center, the upper reaches economic co-operation zone led by Chongqing, and the Panxi-Liupanshui development zone at the juncture of the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and the Jinsha Jiang. The 23 major cities in the valley have set up 10 special co-operation groups in the fields of science, funding, navigation, tourism, posts and telecommunications, material supply, trade, environmental protection and social science. Last year saw these cities lend and borrow a total of 231 billion yuan among themselves. The special co-operation group for environmental protection has set up a monitoring network consisting of 150 stations along the Chang Jiang to protect the local ecological conditions. The gross domestic product of Pudong increased by 30 percent last year, thanks to the accessibility of funds, materials, talented people and information from the Chang Jiang Valley's Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan Provinces.
