However he said, in a statement to the MOROCCAN NEWS AGENCY before leaving Cairo, that the agreement in itself is insufficient and that it must be followed by other steps until a comprehensive peace is achieved and the rest of the occupied Arab territories are liberated. He added that the world is waiting for a comprehensive solution to all the problems of the Middle East. Mr. Filali also said he hopes that what was agreed in Cairo yesterday will be implemented because the rapid implementation of the agreement will facilitate the resolution of the other outstanding problems.
