In a plenary session held before the end of the meeting, the provincial party committee adopted two resolutions, namely "Resolutions on Implementing the `Decision' of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee" and "Resolution on Convening of the Ninth Provincial Party Congress." A member of the Standing Committee of the provincial party committee presided over the plenum of the provincial party committee yesterday. Addressing the closing session, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou put forward demands on relaying, implementing guidelines of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and current work. Chen Huanyou said: For the past four days, attending delegates have been conscientiously studying guidelines of both the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the National Economic Work Conference; hearing reports from the provincial party committee; and enthusiastically taking part in discussions after taking realities into consideration and sharpening minds. With further unification of understanding, better understanding of the guiding thoughts for work to be carried out next year and various work and missions, and a clearer way of thinking in respect to reform and opening up, a good foundation has been laid for the successful implementation of next year's programs. Chen Huanyou emphasized: Various localities and departments should conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and have their current jobs well done. Although leaders may spend more energy in carrying out extra activities during New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, we should not loosen our economic work even under these circumstances. We should make use of the favorable, brisk business conditions prevailing in the festive seasons to promote operational and sales activities in the markets. We should appropriately handle the circulation of funds for energy, transportation and major enterprises and make early arrangements to facilitate the transportation of passengers during the Spring Festival. We should attach greater importance to safe production by strengthening fire prevention, in particular, and eliminating hidden dangers to avoid major accidents; vigorously embark on winter irrigation construction; truly do a good job in work relating to year-end distribution and cash payments; and speed up preparations for next year's spring farming and production. In improving price management and market supply, various localities should closely watch the price movements in the markets and conduct timely studies before formulating measures and plans for containing commodity prices. It is necessary to strengthen guidance and coordination over prices of the daily necessities of the people, including grains, oils, porks, fowl eggs, and vegetables to prevent the people's costs of living from rising. Various localities should make greater efforts to ensure adequate supply of festive goods in the markets and show concern over the livelihood of the masses, especially that of exceptionally poor families. We should attach greater importance to the question of social order and continue to take stern actions to prevent the crime rates from going up. For public places having complicated problems of social order, a concerted, special crime- screening exercise should be conducted to wipe out all sorts of ugly social phenomena. We should continue our efforts to severely crack down on highway bandits, railway robbers, and local evil forces. Deadlines should be set for solving problems in certain stretches of roads and localities to help create a better social environment for economic development and people's livelihood. Chen Huanyou pointed out: It is necessary to firmly and effectively carry on the anti- corruption struggle, making sure that undesirable practices will not make a comeback during the festive seasons. Currently, special efforts should be made to simply various meetings, celebrations, and commendation activities and vigorously promote civilized and thrifty habits. We should strictly implement the guidelines set by the circular issued by the General Offices of the party's Central Committee and the State Council "On Strict Banning of Offering Foods, Drinks, and Gifts With Public Funds and Extravagance and Waste During 1994 New Year's Day and the Spring Festival." Leading cadres at various levels should take the lead in practicing honesty and self-discipline and continue to do well in anti-corruption struggle and building party style and clean government, making sure that New Year's Day and the Spring Festival will be celebrated in a clean and honest way amid festive joys. We should draw up plans to help the troops and family members of the armymen solve practical problems and further promote army-people joint effort in building material and spiritual civilizations and "double support" activities. Chen Huanyou urged various localities and departments to appropriately relay and implement guidelines of this meeting and make concrete arrangements for work to be carried out in 1994, after taking into consideration realities of their own localities and departments and clearly identifying their objectives and ways of thinking.
