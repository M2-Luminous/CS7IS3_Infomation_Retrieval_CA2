FR940524-0-00003 FR940524-0-00001 The TDA requested the committees to specify that TDA personnel are the proper authorities for reviewing inspection certificates or shipment release forms at road guard stations. Therefore, the committees recommended that handlers be required to surrender either the appropriate inspection certificate or shipment release form to TDA personnel at road guard stations. This rule enables the TDA to determine whether onions and melons shipped from the respective production areas meet order requirements and should help ensure compliance with the two orders' provisions. The interim final rule was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13430). That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended April 21, 1994. No comments were received. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB No. 0581&hyph;0074 for onions and 0581&hyph;0076 for melons. This rule does not entail additional recordkeeping on the part of the handlers because the shipment release form is not a new form. After consideration of the committees' recommendations and other relevant information presented, it is found that finalizing the interim rule, without change, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects 7 CFR part 959 Marketing agreements, Onions, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 7 CFR Part 979 Marketing agreements, Melons, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
