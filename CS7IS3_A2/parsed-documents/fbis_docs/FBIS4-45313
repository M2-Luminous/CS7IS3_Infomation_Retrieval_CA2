Highland families in particular not only use opium for barter but also as a palliative for all ailments causing addiction at a very young age, says the report made available to BERNAMA Wednesday. It was the first workshop organised here last week to equip Vietnam's communist party key cadres nation-wide with communication skills to create public awareness of the country's drug problem. The report says that although Vietnam is making progress in reducing domestic poppy cultivation, such efforts are frustrated by increased smuggling of opium from neighbouring countries. It says the area under poppy cultivation had been reduced to 3,000 hectares last year from 19,000 hectares in 1985 and opium production to 10.5 tonnes from 53.9 tonnes during the same period. Now 87 percent or 2,630 hectares of the remaining area under poppy is in Ky Son in Nghe An Province bordering Laos. A good number of students in that province had been opium addicts since their younger days, the report adds. It also shows that there is still no other lucrative cash crop better suited to the area's climate, terrain and soil than poppy, it says. (poppy plants produce the base to make heroin). Dumping of psychotropic drugs, high relapse rate (80 percent) among treated addicts and lack of funding for sustained campaigns are among the other problems Vietnam is facing in fighting drug abuse, it says.
