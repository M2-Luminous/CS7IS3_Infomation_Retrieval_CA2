The IAEA adopted a resolution calling on the UN Security Council to work out means for applying sanctions against North Korea. Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: [Begin Cha recording] This is the second resolution referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, following one in April last year. The resolution calls for working out measures for applying sanctions regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, which is still pending in the UN Security Council. The key point in the resolution adopted at today's special meeting of the Board of Governors on North Korea clearly expressed the restricted position [hangyejogin ipchang] of the IAEA that it cannot verify North Korea's diversion of nuclear materials and stressed it is urgent that the Security Council work out countermeasures. This resolution, however, keeps the door open for dialogue by urging North Korea to allow additional full-scale inspections. The report on the results of the inspection submitted to the Board of Governors special meeting before the resolution was adopted revealed that the inspection team inspected nuclear fuel rods which were (?used) in the five-megawatt nuclear reactor. Thus, experts observed that North Korea might have replaced some nuclear fuel rods in the nuclear reactor during the past one year. In addition, the report listed in detail the six radiochemical laboratory facilities that North Korea refused to allow inspections, thus leading to the conclusion that internal construction work in the reprocessing facility had advanced more than the already-known 40 percent. The report also pointed out that the continuity of the recent inspection can be maintained only if another inspection of the nuclear reactor is conducted within one month and 15 days. Thus, the period of one month and 15 days will be the time limit for the Security Council to discuss practical sanctions against North Korea. [end recording]
