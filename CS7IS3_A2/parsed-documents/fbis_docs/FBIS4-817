[passage omitted] Following this week's crisis, a Commonwealth mediating team has flown in to Lesotho. On the line to Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked Max Gaylord, director of political affairs in the Commonwealth secretariat, whether he thought this latest crisis was in fact an army revolt: [Begin recording] [Gaylord] It's not that. In fact we have just come from a meeting with the delegation of 25 soldiers, the people that we dealt with last January. They have sought to reassure us of a couple of things. One is that the Royal Lesotho Defense Force is still united notwithstanding the rogue elements who perpetrated the events of last Thursday. They pledged again through us their loyalty to the Government of Lesotho, the democratically elected government, and have reiterated they want to be a professional army. [Ecott] So, what do you have to do this time? [Gaylord] Well, I think the principal purpose of our coming here, we have already been asked: Are you going to solve the crisis, whatever it is. Well, we are not doing that. We are here to help the Basotho. The government and the people of Lesotho are going to solve the crisis (?such as it is). But I think what we have been able to do is take a reading of the army through the 25 representatives. Of course, we will be passing that on to the government. In fact, we have already done so. And I think that is reassuring in itself. But certainly at one stage a couple of days ago, I think the international media was talking of a coup. Well, there is no evidence of that. [Ecott] Can you say though what the incident actually revolves around because the government didn't seem to be too sure. They said it was a good guess that it was related to a pay dispute. [Gaylord] I don't think our guess is any better than theirs at the moment, Tim. In fact, the investigation process is now under way and I guess it will have to be left to the commander and the authorities, but it is certainly to early for us to cast any sort of opinion on it. [Ecott] Is the situation, however, volatile? Have the people you have spoken to given you the impression that this was a flare up that can be contained or will be contained? [Gaylord] Well, I think it can say to you that I believe it can be contained. I believe it will be contained because as I say it looks very much like -- I used the term before -- rogue elements within the defense force. Certainly there is no hint of anything in the officer corps from, say, the rank of lieutenant and above. The deed appears to have been done by soldiers. So, it certainly can be contained, although it would be fair to say there is tension in the town. I think the civilians are probably (?heartily) sick of this sort of thing. Most of the soldiers or all of the soldiers we spoke to this afternoon are absolutely dismayed by it (?as well as they) might be. Some tension, but containable. [end recording]
