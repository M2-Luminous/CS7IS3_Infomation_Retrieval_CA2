It also proposed that a modern enterprise system, characterized by distinct relations between ownership and management and between power and responsibility, the separation of government functions from those of enterprises, and scientific management, be gradually instituted. This important move shows a certain depth of theory and is a very significant act. I. The Basic Characteristics of the Modern Enterprise System The "decision" pointed out the five basic characteristics of the modern enterprise system as follows: 1) The distinct relations between ownership and management of an enterprise with entire corporate property rights [fa ren cai chan quan 3127 0086 6299 3934 2938] formed by the investment of all investors, including the state. 2) The right of independent operations in accordance with the law, as well as the obligations of assuming sole responsibility for its own profits and losses, paying taxes according to regulations, and undertaking to preserve and increase the value of assets contributed by investors. 3) The limited rights and responsibilities of the investors. 4) The ability of organizing production and operation in light of market demands. 5) A scientific leadership structure and an organizational management system. These characteristics are integrated, but the most important are the explicit corporate property system and the limited liability system of an enterprise. The institution of a modern enterprise system calls for a perfect corporate property system in an enterprise. Under the traditional planned economic structure, state-owned enterprises, being subsidiaries of state administrative organs, did not have independent legal person status. In the course of practicing the planned commodity economy a few years ago, although the state instituted a legal person system in enterprises through legislation, it was still incomplete. In name, state-owned enterprises had legal person status, but in reality they lacked independent property rights that legal persons must possess, so they found it difficult to establish a restraining mechanism for properties, and the state still had to assume unlimited liabilities for them. Meanwhile, enterprises were not real independent legal persons because they also found it difficult to operate independently and assume responsibilities for their own profits and losses. To state-owned enterprises, the essence of the enterprise corporate property system is the confirmation of ownership belonging to the state and the independent corporate property rights belonging to enterprises. On this basis, enterprises can enjoy civil rights, undertake civil responsibilities, solve the problem of having someone to bear responsibilities in enterprises, and unify enterprises' capacity to exercise civil rights and capacity to dispose of business, so that enterprises can really become a legal entity capable of operating independently and assuming responsibilities for their own profits and losses. To define enterprise corporate property rights, the crucial point is to straighten out relations between ownership and management (chiefly, to draw a clear demarcation between ownership and management, diversify the main bodies of ownership and management, and to make the trading of ownership and management convenient and the operation of ownership and management effective, and so on). In addition, the ownership of an investor (referring to the state) should be separated from the property rights of a legal person (referring to an enterprise). Under certain conditions, the ownership of an investor is manifested by his possession of shareholder's rights. That is, he can take benefits derived from the assets as a shareholder according to the law, participate in making major policy decisions (generally including enterprise's operating principles, long-term investment plans, fiscal budgets and final accounts, examination and approval of plans to distribute profits and redress losses, increase or decrease of authorized capital, major changes in ownership and management, and others), and select managerial personnel. The investors can neither exercise direct control over all corporate properties nor those parts belonging to themselves. They can use the rights vested with shareholders to exert influence on enterprises' actions, but cannot directly interfere in enterprises' operational activities. When an enterprise goes bankrupt, the investors will only assume limited liability on the enterprise's debts according to the capital amount they have contributed to the enterprise. The corporate property rights are demonstrated by the enterprise's right to own and use the corporate property, obtain initial profits, and punish relevant personnel, as well as the enterprise's responsibility for its own operational activities. The ownership of the investors and the corporate property rights are confirmed and protected by the law and are, therefore, sacred and inviolable. Another characteristic of the modern enterprise system is shown in its scientific organizational structure, clear division of duties, and sound checking, balancing, and restraining mechanisms. A company system has been practiced in the course of reorganizing state-owned enterprises, under which a company is constituted according to its corporate property, and new leading bodies including a general meeting of shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and so on are set up in accordance with the law. The chairman of a board of directors is the corporate representative of an enterprise, and the managers are appointed by the board of directors and should be responsible to it, which is different from the former factory director (or manager) responsibility system. Various independent but interacting ties with clearly stipulated powers and responsibilities are formed between the operators and producers through the company's power organs, decisionmaking organs, and supervisory organs, and are defined and realized in line with the law and the articles of corporation. Its core is to establish a power structure of the shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and managerial personnel at different levels, and to form a restraining, checking, and balancing mechanism to coordinate the relations among shareholders, corporate representatives, operators, staff, and workers, through the operation of the company's organizational system including the shareholders' general meeting, board of directors, executive body, board of supervisors, and so on. In the meantime, modern management methods and means will be adopted to improve and enhance the specialized and comprehensive management of an enterprise in various areas. The three reform measures of the enterprise system will be carried out in light of the requirements on enterprises in practicing a socialist market economy, while the enterprise's administrative rating will be canceled and the bounds between cadres and workers broken. The organizational system of a company in Western, developed countries has a different characteristic. In the composition of shareholders, shares are mainly held by a corporate body. Like Japan and Germany, corporate shareholders are mainly banks or other enterprises. In Britain and the United States, however, they are mainly retirement funds, insurance companies, and so on, rather than banks or other financial institutions. U.S. law prohibits banks from holding shares. Owing to different compositions of shareholders, there are varying management structures in the companies of various countries. The board of directors in a Japanese company has more internal directors who are members of senior management nominated by the general manager (or president), and shareholders play a comparatively limited role. In the United States, about two-thirds of the company directors are from shareholders, because the law provides that external directors must hold a certain proportion of a listed company, and some committees of the company must be constituted by external directors. In Germany and some northern European countries, a dual board of directors system is practiced, under which the board of supervisors makes strategic policies and exercises supervisory functions, while the board of directors acts as an executive managerial department composed of senior administrative personnel. The German law also provides that one-third or one-half of the members of a board of supervisors must be elected from staff and workers so that they can participate in decisionmaking. There is a new development trend in the corporate management structure in some large international companies. For example, the ownership has undergone an extensively diversified and decentralized transformation, the shareholders have no longer exercised a direct control over enterprises, the board of directors has changed its functions from management to supervision and policymaking, the power in operation and management has been shifted to enterprise operators, and the operators' limits of authority have been enlarged. These different organizational systems relating to companies are constantly changing and making adjustments in various countries and at varying economic development stages. Although they have disadvantages as well as advantages, on the whole, they are effective and relatively scientific and reasonable. The "company law" promulgated by China and various implementation measures now being formulated have drawn in some useful parts of the systems practiced in Western companies. China has also worked out relatively clear stipulations on company's organizational system in light of the national situations. In future experiments and operations, we should repeatedly have it revised and refined to meet the emerging problems. II. The Company System Is a Major Organizational Form of the Modern Enterprise System Under the traditional planned economic structure, the organizational forms of enterprises in China were differentiated by their ownership nature. In fact, it was an operational mode of unified state control over revenue and expenditure. But, according to the requirement of a market economy, the modern enterprise organizational forms are differentiated by the organizational forms of property and the legal rights and responsibilities that are undertaken. In most cases, a company system is adopted as a form of the modern enterprise organizational systems and is a main legal form of such systems under the market economic structure. Under this structure, the systems of enterprises are numerous and varied. Distinguished by properties, they can be wholly owned enterprises, partnership enterprises, cooperative enterprises, enterprises with a company system, and so on. The state-owned enterprises can also be in many forms, which chiefly include state wholly owned limited companies, state-owned companies with limited liability (whose shares are held by legal persons), and state holding limited companies. The "company law" promulgated by China also includes an exclusively state-funded company as a form of limited liability company -- a state wholly owned company. In recent years, such state wholly owned companies have also been legally approved in some Western countries and have attained relatively good results. The advantage of a "state wholly owned company with limited liability" is that investor can really represent the interests of the state, which is conducive to exercising macroeconomic regulation and control, optimizing product mix, and playing a backbone role in economic development. A limited liability company and a joint-stock limited company are the principal forms of reorganizing state-owned enterprises to practice a company system, and both cover operations which are aimed at earning profits. With regard to a limited liability company, the liability undertaken by a shareholder to the company is limited to the amount of capital he has paid, and the company undertakes limited liability for its debts with its total assets. With regard to a joint-stock limited company, its total capital is divided into an equal amount of shares, a shareholder undertakes his limited liability to the company with the number of shares he holds, and the company undertakes limited liability for its debts with its total assets. At present, the establishment of joint-stock companies in China has just begun, and the procedures for setting up a joint-stock limited company are strict, because its articles of corporation should be standardized and accounts publicized. Hence, many enterprises can hardly meet the requirements. Relatively speaking, a limited liability company has the general advantages of enterprises with a company system. As shares are only subscribed internally, they have relatively fewer shareholders and simpler procedures. Therefore, at the initial stage of practicing a company system in state-owned enterprises, it is suitable to reorganize them into one-share or multi-share limited liability companies first. Some of them can be reorganized into joint-stock limited companies, which only absorb the staff and workers of the enterprises as shareholders. As to some exceptionally large state-owned enterprises, they can also be reorganized into enterprise groups controlled by companies with limited liability or companies limited by shares. A listed joint- stock limited company means that the stocks issued by this company can be listed in a stock exchange for trading provided that it has been approved by the state administration for securities. The procedural requirements for its incorporation are relatively strict. Internationally, the general requirements for a listed company and the listing of its stocks are chiefly as follows: 1) Whether it accords with the country's law on the trading of securities and the capital amount for a listed company as stipulated by the stock exchange; 2) the operational performance and major profit-making capabilities; 3) the capital structure -- the composition of self- possessed funds and borrowed funds; 4) the capability of debt repayment; 5) the standards for distribution of stock rights and the maintenance of adequate liquidity; 6) the market prices of stocks to be listed for trading; and so on. The "company law" promulgated in China sets out similar requirements and pertinent stipulations on the temporary suspension of trading and termination of listing. Because stock trading involves the public interests of investors in society, only a small number of enterprises with high returns, steady growth, and a good reputation will be established as this type of companies according to the law. III. The Points for Attention Concerning the Practice of a Company System in Reorganizing the State-Owned Enterprises The "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee pointed out: "The practice of a company system in the state-owned enterprises is a useful exploration for the institution of a modern enterprise system." The company system is an effective form of realizing the modern enterprise system. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises into those with a company system should proceed from China's actual conditions. We must be aware that the transformation of enterprises from the previous "factory system" to the present "company system" is a major change in China in respect of the enterprise system, which is of vital significance to emancipating and developing the productive forces and ensuring the success in enterprise reforms. This is why we must make great efforts to do the work well. 1. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises to practice a company system is aimed at thoroughly transforming enterprise operational mechanisms and forming a new modern enterprise system. During experiments with the joint-stock system and enterprise groups in the past few years, some enterprises placed the transformation of operational mechanisms in a secondary position, while others thought that the establishment of joint-stock companies simply meant turning property rights into stocks and listing them on the stock exchange for trading, regarding this as a short cut for raising funds and setting up new businesses. Still others only engaged in setting up "renamed companies." As a result, few changes were made to the operational mechanisms so that enterprises still lacked vitality. Therefore, we must be clear that the purpose of setting up enterprises with a company system is neither for simplistically changing their names nor for raising funds. Rather, it is aimed at genuinely transforming their operational mechanisms and instituting a modern enterprise system. In other words, it is aimed at straightening out the relations between ownership and management with regard to the state and enterprises through reorganization so that enterprises will be able to extricate themselves from their status as subsidiaries of government organs and to cut off the umbilical cord that integrates government administration with enterprises. In this way, enterprises will really possess corporate property rights, achieve unified capacity to exercise civil rights and dispose of business, and become a genuine legal entity and main body in market competition in name as well as in reality, which is characterized by "independent operation, assumption of sole responsibility for profits and losses, self-development, and self- restraint." 2. It is necessary to persistently maintain the position of public ownership as a main body to ensure that public property is not infringed upon. In the course of reorganizing enterprises to practice a company system, the establishment of corporate property rights in enterprises on the basis of distinctive relations between ownership and management does not mean changing the state's ownership status. It is only the management mode of state assets that has been changed. That means the form of managing the assets in kind has been changed to that of managing the assets in value. Here, the state still controls the ownership, and the total amount of state assets has not reduced or lost because of the change. Moreover, through the trading of property rights, the holding of shares by legal persons, and the diversification of share rights, rational circulation of state assets and effective allocation of resources can be achieved, the stock of state assets in enterprises can be revitalized, and the preservation and increase of the value of state assets can be guaranteed. After the company system is practiced in enterprises, public assets will still account for an absolutely advantageous portion of total social assets, and the state-owned economy will still control the lifelines of the national economy, which will exercise an leading role in social economic development. It is necessary to screen assets, settle claims, clear debts, and draw a demarcation between ownership and management according to relevant laws and regulations. For this purpose, first and foremost, it is necessary to make a realistic evaluation of assets, appraise and fix the amount of property held by legal persons in enterprises, prevent stocks from being broken down and sold at low prices or even occupied by individuals without compensation, and avoid state assets being nibbled away and embezzled, so as to ensure that state assets and their rights and interests are not encroached upon. 3. It is necessary to strictly abide by the pertinent laws, regulations, and policies of the state. We must strive to achieve the principal objectives of separating the duties of enterprises from those of the administration, clarify the relations between ownership and management, intensify the checking and balancing mechanism, shake off the unreasonable burdens, and so on. To this end, we should conscientiously conduct feasibility studies and demonstrations, set up a rational and explicit structure of share rights, conduct strict evaluation and auditing of assets, and formulate articles of corporation. In particular, we should establish a standardized institutional and management structure of a company, give scope to the institution, overcome artificial interference, and properly perform the work of convergence before and after reorganization. Relevant departments are now studying and working out implementation measures to enforce the "company law" and the "regulations on supervision and management of properties in state-owned enterprises" which will be promulgated very soon. On the basis of the above, the reorganization of enterprises should be brought into line with legal standardization. The question of which pattern enterprises will be reorganized should be guided by the terms and procedures stipulated in the "company law." 4. It is necessary to persistently proceed from actual conditions and avoid rigid conformity. The reorganization of enterprises to practice a company system is a momentous change of the enterprise system in China and is therefore an arduous as well as complicated task. In working out measures for implementation and operation, we should proceed from the present conditions of our state-owned enterprises and put them into practice by stages, in groups, and according to different categories through experiments. The conditions of enterprises in China differ greatly. That is why we must proceed from the reality to resolve the problems that exist in different kinds of enterprises accordingly. The general situation of the state-owned enterprises in terms of performance is: One-third of them are earning profits, one-third are making profits by a narrow margin, and one-third have been sustaining losses for a long time. Hence, we should draw up reorganization plans for different kinds of enterprises in accordance with the state's industrial policies and in line with the requirements to ensure the leading position of the public economy, so as to reorganize all sorts of enterprises into different company patterns with respective equity structures in light of their trades, scope, degree of involvement in the market, and position in the national economy as a whole. The reorganization of the existing state-owned enterprises should be carried out by stages and in groups. Enterprises which are more competitive in their trades for better performance, lighter burdens, and stronger leadership should be selected for experiments, and their experience should be summed up as soon as possible and then disseminated deliberately. We should try our best to select enterprises for experiments from the existing companies and those which are practicing a joint-stock system, and should not spend too much time on the experiments. In addition, we should also select some enterprises which correspond to the state's industrial policies, or which have better economic results and hold a relatively important position in the region or trade, or which have associated operations with other enterprises. Except for those in some specialized trades, which will be reorganized into state's wholly owned limited liability companies, most of the state-owned enterprises should be reorganized into limited liability companies whose stocks are held by a number of shareholders so that share rights are controlled by different investment units. Those limited liability companies which have made profits for three consecutive years, whose targets of economic results have reached a certain level, and which have met the requirements stipulated by the law can be transformed into joint-stock limited companies according to legal procedures. Only a few joint-stock limited companies reorganized from ordinary enterprises can have their stocks listed for trading. Moreover, only those large enterprises of the state's backbone industries with excellent performance and steady growth will be selected as listed companies strictly in line with the conditions required by the law. In practicing the company system, it is necessary to screen the historical "burdens" of state-owned enterprises. Owing to various reasons, there are a wide range of enterprises which have suffered losses for a long time, and the amounts of their losses have been very large. Some of them have been deep in debts and found it very difficult even to survive, which have become heavy burdens of society. With their backward productive techniques and outmoded equipment, their products are unmarketable and overstocked so that they find it difficult to enter the market to participate in competition. Therefore, in the course of reorganizing enterprises, it is necessary to eliminate a number of enterprises which lack sound operation and management, suffer losses for a long time, fail to offset their debts with assets, and show no signs of turning from deficits to profits, in the principle of market competition wherein the superior ones will prosper and the inferior ones will be eliminated, (but in formulating concrete measures for implementation, consideration should be given to the tolerance of various quarters). Of course, meticulous work should be performed in dealing with various kinds of loss-making enterprises, which should be appraised, differentiated, and handled according to varying circumstances. With regard to the enterprises capable of revival with their own efforts and a certain external assistance, they should be given opportunities to strive to shake off their historical "burdens" and reverse their losing situation. The State Economic and Trade Commission has proposed that the unreasonable debt burdens of state-owned enterprises should be handled on a case- by-case basis. We should resolutely work according to this proposal.
