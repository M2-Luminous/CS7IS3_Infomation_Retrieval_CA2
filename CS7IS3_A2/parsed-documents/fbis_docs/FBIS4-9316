FBIS4-9316 "dreeu079_i_94014" FBIS-EEU-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1995 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA UN Envoy Akashi Issues Warning to Serbs UN Envoy Akashi Issues Warning to Serbs LD2504100594 Belgrade TANJUG in English 0948 GMT 25 Apr 95 LD2504100594 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- U.N. chief for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi has warned the Bosnian Serbs that a NATO ultimatum to withdraw their heavy weapons near Gorazde and other U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina would not at all be interpreted in a flexible way. REUTERS quoted Akashi as giving this warning at a press conference in Zagreb late on Sunday. The ultimatum, demanding that the Bosnian Serbs pull out their heavy weapons 20 km from the centre of Gorazde, Tuzla, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, U.N.-designated "safe areas", is due to expire on Wednesday at 3 A.M. (0100 GMT). Akashi said he hoped that the Bosnian Serb military and political leadership would consistently observe the relevant terms and stressed that the Bosnian Serbs could expect no flexibility in complying with the terms set by the ultimatum. Drawing attention to the fact that, late on Saturday ahead of the expiry of the NATO's first ultimatum on the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces to 3 km from Gorazde, NATO asked for a permission to bomb Serb artillery positions near that Moslem enclave in the east of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Akashi refused to issue, REUTERS quoted a Western diplomats as saying that it was quite obvious that strong pressure had been put on Akashi and adding that many wanted air strikes. The United Nations issued a statement early on Sunday specifying that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and not Akashi, would have the final word in deciding whether air strikes should be launched or not. NATO circles maintain that this change has most probably resulted from the pressure by NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, who spoke sharply on the phone with Akashi late on Saturday, but, nevertheless, failed to persuade the Japanese diplomat to change his stand. Diplomatic sources say that Akashi caused indignation in NATO when he refused to approve air strikes on Saturday, explaining that the Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing in line with the terms, although they were not completely observing the set deadline.
