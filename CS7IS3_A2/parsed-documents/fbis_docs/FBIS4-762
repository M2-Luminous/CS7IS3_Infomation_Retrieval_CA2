Speaking at a press briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Buthelezi said it would be sad if South Africa moved in that direction. Asked what he would do now that mediation had failed to settle constitutional differences, Mr Buthelezi said he would have to discuss the matter with the IFP Central Committee. Mr Buthelezi said he was disappointed that mediation had failed, but added the African National Congress and government had never favoured it. He said the ANC and government had wasted an opportunity by which the IFP could have returned to the electoral process and the elections. Claims that the IFP had spoilt the mediation effort were nonsense, he said. The election date may have come up in discussions at some stage, but Mr Buthelezi denied the IFP used the issue as a hidden agenda. Mr Buthelezi did not want to commit himself to taking part in another planned leaders' summit, but said negotiations could continue because he would leave no stone unturned to find a solution. Reacting to a question on whether Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini would accept a new package offered to him by government, he said "if people think they can buy him (the king) with packages, they do not understand him". The king was only concerned about his people and his land, not himself, he said. Mr Buthelezi predicted violence would increase in the province in spite of troops being deployed there. Only Zulus were killed in taxis or while protesting, he said. "The catastrophe is here." But elections in kwaZulu would be held because he did not have the option to stop them. It was a democratic right for all South Africans to choose whether to vote or not, he said. Regarding the provision of polling stations, he said the kwaZulu government had offered the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] use of its buildings. Mr Buthelezi said he had even offered IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler "to put a word in" so the commission could use buildings which fell under the control of tribal chiefs. The process of mediation, which was to have been led by former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and British Politician Lord Peter Carrington, came to a halt on the question of whether the election date should be included in the terms of reference. Both Mr Kissinger and Lord Carrington agreed to mediate on a draft version of the terms which had not mentioned the date. A later draft, revised when government joined the mediation, specifically excluded the election date. Mr Buthelezi said he had received a message from Lord Carrington through the British Embassy that Lord Carrington wanted the terms of reference consolidated. Mr Buthelezi said he still did not know the status of this document which was sent to him and others on Tuesday night.
