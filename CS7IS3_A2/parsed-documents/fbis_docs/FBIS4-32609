[Muftic] Yes, it is working well. The fighting between the two armies has been reduced. It is not easy to defend Bosnia because the destruction was well prepared. But we believe in Bosnia. [KURIER] In the United Nations' plans, the Federation is based on 51 percent of the territory. But you have only 30 percent.... [Muftic] Bosnia does not mean 51 percent, but 100 percent. [KURIER] The Federation only includes the Muslims and Croats. Would you consider yourself represented by it if you were a loyal Serb? [Muftic] Yes. The Serbs must understand the political realities. The Federation is a political process that has stabilized the situation. Now Karadzic's Serbs cannot make any more conquests. The war has turned from a war of defense into one of liberation. The army is getting larger every day, morale is high -- but logistics are lacking. [KURIER] The Bosnians want to achieve a lifting of the arms embargo. Would this not mean another outbreak of war? [Muftic] It was the imbalance of forces that led to the war. Without the embargo we could have stopped the aggression right at the beginning. [KURIER] Do you want to liberate the territories occupied by the Serbs? [Muftic] The Serbs only understand the language of violence. Either the aggressor's army withdraws -- or we will liberate ourselves. If the international community does not stop the Serbs, we will have no other choice. [KURIER] Is there a Bosnian ultimatum to the international community? [Muftic] That is top secret.
