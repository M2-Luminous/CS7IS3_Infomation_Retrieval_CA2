[Hawatimah] I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will not work out. It is completely and essentially different from the Camp David accords, which gave Egypt all of Sinai, including Taba, in return for its recognition of Israel within borders that are thus far unclear. As known, we have been and still are against Camp David, because it did not achieve what it promised. The accord opened all the roads to the Israeli aggression and expansion in the Palestinian and other Arab territories. The settlement activity prospered all over the occupied Palestinian territories until the settlements now cover 22 percent of the lands occupied in 1967. Settlements now spread all over the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They threaten to cover 60 percent of these areas. That is our stand on Camp David. The Gaza-Jericho agreement does not even rise to the level of Camp David, which caused all these crimes. The agreement gives only limited self-rule to the inhabitants of Gaza and the town of Jericho, with no sovereignty over a single inch of Gaza and Jericho. It also legitimizes the redeployment of the Israeli occupation troops all over Gaza and Jericho after the evacuation of the densely-populated areas. I can say clearly that Taba talks that were held in Cairo involved an agreement on the redeployment of the Israeli troops in Gaza and Jericho, while keeping the settlements and dividing the Gaza Strip into four sectors, three of which are Israeli: The northern settlements, the central settlements, and the southern settlements. All these settlements are linked to Israel and the bridges and crossing gates remain in the hands of the occupation troops. [passage omitted] [AL-SHA'B] You said that the agreement will not work out. What if its provisions are applied for some time and self-government elections are held? Will you boycott the elections? [Hawatimah] We distinguish between legislative elections that elect a legislative council (a parliament) through which our people can determine their own destiny and the election of an executive council in accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement to implement the agreement and legitimize it. That is why we will not take part in the elections of the executive council, because its task is to implement the agreement and the exchanged letters of recognition. Such a council would legitimize the occupation of our country for a further five-year period. [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the Palestinian situation after the self-government elections? [Hawatimah] I can say now that Israel will withdraw its recognition of 'Arafat as a representative of the Palestinian people, because Israel, the United States, and the EC will deal with the executive council as the elected representative of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. Hence, 'Arafat will be there to represent Fatah only or abroad to resume negotiations concerning the five-year period. [AL-SHA'B] In your current position you rely on Syrian opposition of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What if Syria supports the agreement or signs a peace agreement with Israel? [Hawatimah] That possibility exists. This is one of the interests of Syrian policy. So far, Syria has announced that it favors a comprehensive peace and solutions and opposes independent bilateral agreements. Syria declares that it favors full withdrawal from the Arab and Palestinian territories in return for full peace. This has been the declared Syrian stand so far. The Madrid negotiations and the Gaza-Jericho agreement have shown that the Syrians are sincere in their statements. [AL-SHA'B] How can inter-Palestinian fighting be avoided? How can the campaign against the agreement be prevented from becoming a struggle over the figure of 'Arafat himself? What is your view of the fact that international balances of power impose certain conditions on the Palestinians? [Hawatimah] The DFLP, the unified central leadership of the DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the 10 Palestinian factions [who reject to Gaza-Jericho agreement], and the Arab Liberation Front -- which has not yet joined the 10 factions -- all have a unified position on the issues. The masses of our people might very well join this broad-based stance. Some other forces might also join the struggle against the Gaza-Jericho agreement. We in the DFLP have declared that the major conflict is between our nation -- represented by all its forces, factions, personalities, and streams -- on the one side and the occupation and the settlement policy on the other. Although inter-Palestinian differences are no longer minor, we must always put our conflict with the occupation before any differences among ourselves. All rifles, all stones must be directed against the occupation and the settlement activity. We must solve inter-Palestinian differences through recourse to the people themselves via sound democratic methods. That is why we are proposing a referendum on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. If the majority of the people accept it, we will comply and respect their wishes. If the majority reject it, then those who signed the agreement must retract and comply with the will of the majority. [passage omitted] We oppose all forms of killing and political assassination. We submit to the people's wishes. If you are democratic, you must submit to the popular will. We have always opposed operations outside the occupied territories that were merely individual acts of showmanship because we believe that the people can liberate themselves through organized collective action. No matter how important an individual's role is, it remains limited if it does not have a social and political base. If it has such a base, it becomes much more important. [passage omitted] [AL-SHA'B] Judging by your current disagreement with the leadership of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, are you thinking of establishing an alternative PLO or a parallel National Council? [Hawatimah] We are against having two PLO's. At the same time, we do not wish to hand over the PLO as a gift to Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO is not any person's private fief. We have blazed a path of political and armed struggle for 25 years now. The PLO's program since 1968 has asserted that the organization is actually a broad-based coalition. 'Arafat's wing, however, ruined the coalition and tore apart the unified national front that existed within the PLO. We call for rebuilding Palestinian national unity and the PLO's broad-based national coalition on democratic, electoral grounds that will restore the organization's legal and popular character. Its historical legality is no longer sufficient. In this connection, we demand the election of a united national conference that will include representatives of our people inside and outside the occupied territories. We have begun preparatory steps with the hope of doing this by 13 January. The work of this conference must focus on the following three basic issues: 1. We must formulate a collective political program for the Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories. To ensure a return to legitimacy, representatives of all the factions opposing the Rabin-'Arafat agreement must take part, in addition to representatives of opposition groups within Fatah itself. 2. Local leaders and subsequently a unified leadership of the people inside and outside the occupied territories must be elected. This leadership will head the unified national front that will be formed by the united national conference. 3. The united conference inside and outside the occupied territories must elect a unified committee to lay the groundwork for rebuilding the PLO's institutions, notably the Palestine National Council.
