Speaking of the problem of Russians in Estonia, Zatulin said that "it is very important to us to see that human rights are observed not only in South Africa but in Estonia as well." Tumanov said it was wrong of Estonia to allege that 7,000 Estonian citizens reside in Russia's Pechora district. According to him, it has been established that there is one hundred Estonians residing there. Tumanov believes that the Pechora district with a population of 30,000 is Russian from time immemorial and must remain part of Russia, no matter how the government of Estonia may treat this. In his view, the conclusion of an Estonian-Russian Treaty on Contiguous Areas is the first step towards resolving controversies.
