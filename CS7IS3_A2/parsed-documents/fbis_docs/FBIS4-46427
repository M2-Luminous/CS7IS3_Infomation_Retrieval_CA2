[passage omitted] BKA department head Manfred Klink will be responsible for the Terrorism and Protection of the State Main Department, which will be based in Meckenheim near Bonn in the future. Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy that is to be introduced between the BKA president, the vice president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with all modern findings concerning control and organization, the chairman of the GdP group in the BKA, Arno Falk, stressed. The appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong consequence from Bad Kleinen." [passage omitted]
