According to the communique, "the sides will withdraw all armed units with arms and military hardware from the Inguri river and other possible lines of active confrontation within five days after the arrival of the peace-keeping force.... At the same time, international observers and peace-keeping troops will move into the areas from which armed units are withdrawn." The communique pointed out that both the Georgian and Abkhazian sides "have recognised that the main task is to achieve a full-scale political settlement of the conflict, and all efforts should be concentrated on attaining this goal." They agreed to continue the discussion of the problem of Abkhazia's political status, taking into account the interests of both sides. The next meeting of experts on this issue will be held in Moscow on February 8. Following the adoption of the Geneva communique, Georgia asked to convene the Security Council for discussing a possibility of sending a U.N. peace-keeping force to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.
