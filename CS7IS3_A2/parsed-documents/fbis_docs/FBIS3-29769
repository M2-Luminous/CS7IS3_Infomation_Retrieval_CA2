He said that Japan should set up "effort targets" on condition that "failure in achieving such targets should not be subject to sanctions," thus showing a flexible attitude toward setting up some kind of numerical figures to measure progress in opening the Japanese market. This has been reported by news agencies. Since Mr. Ozawa was deeply involved in past Japan-U.S. negotiations on economic issues, his remarks have invited negative reactions from those concerned with negotiations saying: "Since term `targets' will be taken as a pledge, numerical targets should not be set." In dispatching reports on Ozawa's remarks, such news agencies as the AP News Agency and KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS INC used the term "targets." According to their dispatches and participants of Ozawa's meeting with foreign correspondents, Mr. Ozawa reportedly said that: "Japan and the United States should make mutual efforts while keeping mutual reliance. It is good for Japan to set up targets for Japan's effort to promote market opening if the targets are not subject to sanctions." Moreover, he reportedly said that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks "should be concluded by the end of March," thus showing confidence in settling the issue at an early date.
