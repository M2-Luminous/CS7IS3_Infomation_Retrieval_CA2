However, the real consensus on this strategic goal does not guarantee that there will be the same agreement on tactics, which deal with how to bring about a downsizing process. Many other questions on this issue may have answers that do not always agree. For that very reason, they are an important topic of debate at the Workers' Parliaments being held in workplaces. In these discussions, however, it is wise not to exaggerate the impact of an overlarge work force on the inefficiency of some workplaces. Payroll is, of course, an element to be considered in seeking efficiency, but not the only one, and in our present situation it is possible that it may not even be the most important factor in a great many places. We want to make this clear and apply a remedy before it is too late, so as to keep administrative reports from dragging this out with excessive analyses of this aspect of a complex solution, while rejecting other approaches that might well have a greater impact on inefficiency, and which could be introduced quickly without having to engage in consultations. As an example, let us take the case of workplaces with massive quantities of missing items, items that are not paid for and workers that do not pay for their sales and purchases; workplaces where workers squander raw materials and fuels without respecting or even considering consumption regulations; workplaces where workers produce very low quality goods; workplaces with workers with high absenteeism rates, etc., etc., etc. In summary, we believe it is better to analyze thoroughly other possibilities for improving efficiency, before seeking immediate solutions by downsizing payrolls. We say this, among other reasons, so as not to forget that the sensitive downsizing process cannot tolerate improvisations or local measures not in full compliance with our state policy, and with the decisive participation of the union movement. "No downsizing process can be carried out without the unions. This is a requirement, an essential condition for it to be done with quality. It is an orderly and managed process," stated Carlos Lage, vice president of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, speaking at the recent session of the National Committee of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation]. Lage also explained that the guiding principle continues to be to transfer surplus personnel to other activities or to create new, economically justified functions within the same workplace. It is clear that the ministries and their sector and business institutions can and must study and suggest solutions, but their actual application will depend on a general policy approved at higher levels with the input of the CTC and its unions. We maintain that the payroll downsizing process should be done gradually, avoiding traumatic consequences in any sector, area, or activity of labor. We agree that labor restructuring should proceed quickly in workplaces whose products are essential for our economic revitalization, and which currently have difficulty performing their functions. In general, the view that downsizing and its dynamics are related to the potential for existing jobs or jobs that may be created in the territories or in enterprises and sectors should take priority; an active policy of training and retraining must be included. It is our view that future decisions on payroll downsizing should be based on case-by-case analyses, not on one-size-fits-all formulas. In the Workers' Parliament sessions, the most informative and educational thing may be payroll analyses to determine what salaries paid inefficiently mean in terms of the actual cost per peso of production. This might serve as a basis for finding solutions for the problem. That cost breakdown must be prepared so that the cost per factory, per shop, per shift will be shown. If these data for the enterprise are available, but the workers do not know them, the current effort to improve efficiency loses one of its best weapons. We also wish to speak out against simplistic views that consider the mobilization of personnel for agricultual activities, microbrigades, or defense work, like building people's tunnels, as sources of workplace inefficiency. These personnel, said Lage at the meeting mentioned earlier, cannot be considered surplus, for their work is useful to the nation. Now that the parliaments are being intensified at workplaces, it is worthwhile for the problem of surplus personnel to be analyzed everywhere without embellishing or concealing anything, with the certainty that there is no room for discouragement or confusion. The solutions are in the hands of the workers. We must make sure that any future decision on employment and relocations will reconcile the interests of the nation and social justice.
