The document was signed by Fernando Zarama, Colombian director of national civil aviation, and Argimiro Ojeda Vives, vice president of the Cuban Civil Aeronautics Institute (IACC). The agreement specifies that airlines from the two Latin American nations may offer passenger, cargo, and mail services regularly and independently from the current weekly charter flights. The agreement was the result of negotiations between delegations from the two countries with the participation of representatives of Cubana de Aviacion and the Colombian airlines, namely, SAM, Avianca, Intercontinental, Islena, and Transportes Aereos Mercantiles Panamericanos (Tampa). Also present at the talks were Manuel Leal, representing the Association of Colombian Air Transporters, as well as other IACC and Cubana de Aviacion officials. During the signing ceremony, Zarama described as important the agreement that established bilateral aeronautics relations, which reflect the friendship and solidarity that exist between the two nations. Meanwhile, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba Ricardo Santamaria underscored the coincidence between the conclusion of the negotiations, a visit to Cuba by the Colombian Navy's school ship "Arc Gloria," and the conclusion of a visit to Havana of a delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island. Santamaria said the happy conclusion to the negotiations was the product of the Cubans' constructive attitude. He said that Cuba can count on Colombia as a loyal and friendly partner. Ojeda underscored Cuba's satisfaction with the agreements and the need for unity and cooperation between the region's airlines from underdeveloped countries in order to survive and offer the services that their peoples require. He said the ceremony took place on the 65th anniversary of Cubana de Aviacion and pointed out that it contributes to the development of relations between Colombia and Cuba.
