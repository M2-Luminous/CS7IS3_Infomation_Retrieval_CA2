FR941025-2-00134 FR941025-2-00072 [Release No. 34&hyph;34851; International Series No. 731 File No. S7&hyph;8&hyph;90] Options Price Reporting Authority; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Amendment to the National Market System Plan of the Options Price Reporting Authority October 18, 1994. Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on September 26, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an amendment to the Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and Quotation Information (``Plan''), extending until January 1, 1996, the pilot program providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations on selected foreign currency options (``FCO's'') to vendors outside of the OPRA system. OPRA has designated this proposal as concerned solely with the administration of the plan permitting it to become effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendment. I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment OPRA requests an extension of the pilot program that was the subject of an amendment previously filed on May 14, 1992, 1 providing for the dissemination of certain implied volatility quotations in FCO's directly by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``PHLX'') through selected vendors, rather than through the OPRA network. This pilot has been extended twice, first until September 1, 1993 pursuant to a letter amendment dated March 26, 1993, 2 and then until November 1, 1994, pursuant to a letter amendment dated August 12, 1993. 3 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30906 (July 16, 1992), 57 FR 31546. 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32154 (April 21, 1993), 58 FR 21481. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32771 (August 19, 1993), 58 FR 44865. The purpose of the pilot program is to permit PHLX to accommodate those institutional investors in foreign currency options who desire to receive indications of the current state of the FCO market expressed in implied volatility quotations. These quotations serve only as indications of the state of the market; actual trading in FCO's continues to be conducted through bids and offers expressed in terms of the prices at which options may be bought or sold which continue to be disseminated over the OPRA system. Because the existing specifications of the OPRA system were not designed to accommodate implied volatility quotations, OPRA has consented to PHLX's arranging for the transmission of this information through selected vendors. OPRA plans to extend the pilot once more until January 1, 1996, the date proposed for the unbundling within OPRA of market information services pertaining to FCO's. Prior to that date, a decision will be made concerning the continued availability of implied volatility quotations in FCO's.
