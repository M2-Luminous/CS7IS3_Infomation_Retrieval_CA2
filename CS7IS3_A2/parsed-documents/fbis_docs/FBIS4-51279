"They had an extensive review of the state of play and all four of the tracks of the Middle East peace process," Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said at a regular news briefing. They reviewed the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement and discussed some of the multilateral negotiations, McCurry said. After meeting with Christopher about 50 minutes, Peres had a working lunch with Undersecretary Peter Tarnoff and some other officials. Peres and Tarnoff discussed a range of global issues such as democratization efforts around the world, some aspects of the new U.S. criteria on participation in U.N. peacekeeping and non-proliferation, according to McCurry. They also discussed "East Asia as a region and some efforts that we both have in common as we pursue interests in East Asia," he said. Asked about recent statement by Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on "holy war," McCurry said that "the important thing is that the parties need to talk to each other and not surprise each other." He also said they need to keep the commitments that they have made to each other and to use the consultative mechanism that they have established to resolve any questions that arise.
