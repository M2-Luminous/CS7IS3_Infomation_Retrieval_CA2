He noted that quite recently Polish representatives had signed a declaration regarding Poland's admission into NATO. "Well, what happened? How long was it in force? It lasted just a few weeks. So no one should wonder about our mistrust," Walesa said. "The West is offering us today the Partnership for Peace. That sounds nice. A partnership is a union of independent and equal countries, which strive for established aim. They are equal at any desk, not only at the one whose documents are signed. And this initiative lacks this equilibrium," he added. He said in his address that Poles did not conceive admission into NATO as changing sides. "Therefore, we believe that NATO must remain open also for new members," Walesa stated. He stressed that he felt uneasy when "thinking about the fate of our continent, its unity and solidarity." The idea that "the fall of communism bring the world of the East closer to the West and will make the two worlds into one" has not materialized, Walesa said. As far as security and economy are concerned, no progress has been achieved either, he stated. "The preservation of this situation seems to be in the interest of the powerful of this world. The vision of a common house is gone. The idea of a divided, confrontational Europe is being born again. There is blackmailing Russia which is afraid of NATO expansion, in which it sees an enemy. There is the hesitating West. And there is us who say: Do not be afraid, do not let us accept the logic of the military staffs. Let us get rid of confrontational thought," Walesa stated. At the end of his address, Walesa expressed the hope that today's talks would bring closer the horizon of "our way to NATO."
