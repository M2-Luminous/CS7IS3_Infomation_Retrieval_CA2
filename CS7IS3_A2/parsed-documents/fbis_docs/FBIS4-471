Mr Mandela played what he hoped would be his ace. He offered King Goodwill powers as a constitutional monarch with sway over the whole Natal province. But Chief Buthelezi scuppered the proposal by insisting that the offer could not be considered unless all Inkatha's other concerns were handled at the same time. [passage omitted] The 13-hour meeting at Skukuza began badly for the ANC, which had hoped Mr Mandela and King Goodwill could meet in private. However, despite two attempts by Mr Mandela to meet the king privately, the king's advisers, Frank Armstrong and Mario Ambrosini, insisted that the king should be accompanied by his full delegation. Sources at the meeting said that the king then read out in Zulu a hard-line, 12-page document which referred to perceived past insults from the ANC and attacks on his supporters. Only when he had finished was Mr Mandela able to table for discussion his proposals for a Zulu monarch. [passage omitted] King Goodwill, sources at the meeting say, responded by asking 30 minutes to consult his advisers. Royal household member Prince Vincent Zulu returned to the meeting with the blunt message: "The king has examined your proposals and finds them unacceptable."
