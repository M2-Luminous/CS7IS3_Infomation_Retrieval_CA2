Speaking about the probability of a group of deputies blocking this election because they fundamentally disagree with electing a government before the presidential election, Vitaliy Masol noted: "We are always searching for something -- to begin with, how to block the election of people's deputies, then [how to block] the elections to local bodies of power and the presidential election. If the reason for the protests is my candidacy, then I, unlike many people, am not striving for power, because I know what it is and what state the economy is in now." Vitaliy Masol is convinced that the government should be elected without delay, because it is possible that a president will not be elected on 26 June, and the situation could be repeated in the second round as well. He agreed with the reasons of some politicians who believe that the election of a prime minister now is a risky affair, because a candidate could be proposed by Leonid Kravchuk, but Kuchma could come to power. But he is convinced that it is not permissible to delay the formation of the government for another two months. In Vitaliy Masol's opinion, the prime minister should head the government, and not the president. "If we truly want to have an independent legal democratic Ukraine, then we should not do what we did in the last two years: We lost power and the governance of the state, and no one knows who is responsible for what." Vitaliy Masol declined to assess the actions of the government, led by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, observing that "the newspapers publish everything anyway." Vitaliy Masol maintained that he will not be taking part in the 14 June discussion of the report by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy on the government's activity for moral and ethical reasons, because he does not want to repeat the mistaken practice of those who, while approaching power, criticized their predecessors. With regard to an action program, he observed that it is the affair of the government as a whole, and it will have to be elaborated together, and not with one person governing, "as happens now." "In the event that I am elected, I will rely above all on balance and predictions, as is the practice throughout the world. The government must know how much breadgrain it has and whether it will be able to feed its people. Those who are against a planned economy have evidently never worked in such a system. I have devoted many years to this and know that there really is much in it which is not required, and if I were asked to head the state planning now, I would not agree to do it," Vitaliy Masol said. In answer to a question about whether he would include in his team any of those whose candidacies for this post have recently been discussed, Vitaliy Masol replied that it is possible, and maybe even more than one of them, but he maintained that above all this would proceed from the point of view of their professionalism, experience, and understanding of the situation. He also expressed the conviction that young people should enter the government.
