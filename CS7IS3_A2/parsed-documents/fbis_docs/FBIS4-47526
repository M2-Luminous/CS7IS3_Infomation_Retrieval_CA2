ATR measurements were complemented by a sounding of the optical and microphysical parameters of the cloud cover. The experiments were carried out in the fall of 1988 and the spring of 1989 in the area around the Typhoon Production Association's high-altitude weather station near Obninsk. Twelve series of measurements under different types of cloud cover were carried out. The laser radiation source was carried on board an Ilyushin-14 aircraft and had a wavelength of 0.532 �m, a beam divergence of 10�, a pulse length of 10 ns, and a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The plane, which flew above the clouds at an altitude of 2-4 km, was guided to the observation point by a Meteorite-2 meteorological radar station. The propagated radiation was recorded by a ground-based 4-channel lens system with a focal length of 160-300 mm, an aperture diameter of 120 mm, and receiving angles set at 5 and 20�. The time resolution of the transmission/receiving system equaled 30 ns. Comparison of the ATR data with numerical calculations performed using the Monte Carlo method showed that a cloud stratification model constructed as a set of homogeneous layers with a scattering indicatrix typical for stratified clouds allowed for a satisfactory interpretation of the experimental data. The fundamental parameter determining ATR is the optical thickness of the cloud cover. The variations in ATR observed for different optical thicknesses (_t_ � 25) were attributed to the combined effects of various geometrical parameters such as distance from source to receiver, cloud ceiling altitude, thickness of the cloud strata, and so forth.
