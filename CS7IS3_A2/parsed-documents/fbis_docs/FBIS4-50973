Officials apparently hope to distract attention from soaring city prices, which could exacerbate unease in the weeks leading up to the fifth anniversary of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests. The cost of living in 35 cities rose by 23.3 per cent in April, down from 24.5 per cent in March, according to sources at the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) in Beijing. But, in announcing inflation figures last week, officials released only the national urban-rural average. Regarding the cities, the bureau said only that the rate of big city inflation had slowed. The unpublished April urban figure was the second consecutive monthly drop from the peak of 25.9 per cent in February, but the moderate rate of decline was a blow to the State Council's much ballyhooed price inspection campaign carried out in March and April, which officials had hoped would bring the urban figure below 20 per cent. "These big cities are a special situation. They are not representative of the overall success of the campaign," an SSB official said. The overall picture showed national consumer price inflation slowing to 21.7 per cent in April, from 22.5 per cent in March. Beijing has set a national inflation target of 10 per cent for the year, which many officials have already publicly discounted as unrealistic. SSB sources said administrative measures had been largely ineffective in controlling prices, both in big cities and in small towns. The State Council team sent to Guangdong reported in mid-April that "price hiking momentum is relatively grim" after inspecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Dongguan. Hubei's vice-governor, Chen Shuiwen, reported at the end of April that "the progress of the general price inspection has been uneven". "Price increases in some localities have not been effectively controlled. The prices of a few commodities have even bounced back up again," Chen said. [passage omitted]
