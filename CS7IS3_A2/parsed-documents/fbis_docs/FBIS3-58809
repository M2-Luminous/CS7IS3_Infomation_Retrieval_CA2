EC negotiator Joern Keck, who chaired the January 18-21 talks, said the draft memorandum of understanding should lead to cuts in overproduction of aluminium, which amounts to up to two million tonnes annually on a total of 18 million tonnes. Details of the accord were not released, pending a response from the EC nations, Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the United States, which were asked to make their views known by next Friday. The participants to the talks here agreed to meet again in Canada at the end of February, an EC spokesman said. The Brussels talks finished on Friday, but it took two days to prepare the memorandum, he added. The European Commission, the executive arm of the Community, said that participants at the Brussels talks were "conscious that transparency and the availability of full and comprehensive data are essential for sound commercial decisions." They agreed that the International Primary Aluminium Institute (IPAI) offered the "most effective mechanism" and Russia, in particular, had begun taking steps to cooperate fully with the IPAI, furnishing data with a view to membership, the statement added. Other participating nations expressed readiness to help Russian industry in the process of integration into the world aluminium market on the basis of fair competition and high environmental standards, the statement said. Overproduction of aluminium, especially following a massive rise in Russian exports, has led to a sharp decline in world market prices for the metal and an increase in stocks, which currently amount to more than three times world consumption. Between 1990 and 1993, Russian exports grew five-fold from 300,000 tonnes a year to 1.5 million at particularly low prices. The EC has decided to limit imports from Russia to 180,000 tonnes per year, including 45,000 tonnes for the period November 30, 1993, to February 28, 1994. At the negotiations, the Russians called for the threshold to be raised to 320,000 tonnes, but agreed to revise their figures in exchange for financial and technical aid to restructuring and modernising the industry. The talks here followed two previous rounds in Moscow and Washington at the end of last year that failed to lead to an agreement. On Friday, U.S. trade representative Mickey Kantor called on the European nations to show more flexibility with regard to imports from Russia.
