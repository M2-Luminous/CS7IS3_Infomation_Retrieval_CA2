I will invite Mr. Li Luye, spokesman for the session and vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee Foreign Affairs Committee, to give you a news briefing. [Li Luye] Ladies and gentlemen, friends, comrades: I give this news briefing today at the request of the secretariat of the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference. The second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Conference is scheduled to open ceremoniously at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing at 1500 [0700 GMT] on 8 March. The session will last 12 days. The session's main agenda is: Examining the work report of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee; attending the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] as observer; hearing and discussing the government work report and other reports; examining and approving the motion of revising the CPPCC constitution; examining and approving the report about the handling of motions submitted since the first session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee; electing additional vice chairmen and standing committee members of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and electing a new secretary general; and examining and approving all resolutions to be made by the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee. During the closing session, Chairman Li Ruihuan will give an important speech. During the fifth session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee, which closed on 5 March, 30 additional members of the CPPCC National Committee were elected; and the session also nominated Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping to deliver the work report of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee. Over the past year, people of all nationalities in the country, earnestly implementing the guidelines laid down by the 14th National CPC Congress and its third plenary session, continued to march forward along the course charted by Comrade Xiaoping of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. New successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. In that year, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, the CPPCC National Committee, as the broadest patriotic united front organization of the Chinese people, rallied all democratic parties, mass organizations, democrats without party affiliations, and people of all nationalities in all circles to earnestly implement the basic line characterized by one center and two basic points, and to work hard in exploring a new course for CPPCC organs' operations. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee, focusing on the state's central tasks, earnestly performed its functions of providing political consultation and democratic supervision, and participating in and discussing state affairs. Consequently the CPPCC National Committee's operations in all fields continued to develop on the basis of the experiences accumulated by the previous committees, thus contributing positively to promoting reform, opening up, and social stability. Although the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee is an annual regular meeting, it is a very important meeting to be held at a crucial time when China is accelerating the pace of building a socialist market economic system. During this meeting, the committee members will seriously sum up the work accomplished since the previous session, and will freely express their views on reform, development, stability and other major issues having a bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood. I believe that, under the current gratifying situation -- exemplified by rapid economic development, stable political situation, solidarity among people of all nationalities, and social progress at home -- this session certainly will be a democratic, truth-seeking, united, and morale-boosting meeting which will expedite China's socialist modernization and socialist democratic construction. Now all the preparations for the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee have been made. As of the afternoon on 6 March, 1,265 of the 2,097 members of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee had reported their presence to the secretariat of the session. To assist Chinese and foreign reporters in their news coverage, a CPPCC National Committee office has been set up in the information center of the CPPCC and NPC sessions. Now I would like to take up your questions with regard to the session that will soon be held. [Li Xiaomin] I am Li Xiaomin, reporter of the ZHONGGUO [word indistinct] BAO, I have a question to ask: How many major parts of the CPPCC National Committee Constitution have been revised? What are the major improvements the CPPCC National Committee has made with regard to its participation in administration and state affairs discussions? Thank you. [Li Luye] I will ask Mr. Zhao Weizhi [deputy secretary general of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee] to answer your first question. I will answer your second question. [Zhao Weizhi, reading from paper] The current CPPCC National Committee Constitution was adopted in 1982. It is a good Constitution. Only some parts of the Constitution will be revised and the revision will be based on the actual developments and changes over the past 12 years. The principle of revising the Constitution is based on the guidelines of the 14th National CPC Congress to come in line with the newly revised PRC Constitution in some important wordings and to stress the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the basic line of the primary stage of socialism, the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultations under the CPC's leadership, and the socialist market economy. At the same time, the new Constitution will also incorporate the new experiences and new successes China has gained and achieved in socialist democratic construction and in developing CPPCC operations since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. In the new Constitution, some of the provisions with regard to CPPCC organs' functions in providing political consultations and performing democratic supervision will be enriched. It states, for example, that the CPPCC National Committee is an important multiparty organ providing political consultations under the CPC's leadership; the CPPCC National Committee's principal functions are to provide political consultations and democratic supervision, and organize member parties, mass organizations, and people of all nationalities in all circles to participate in administration and state affairs discussions. Moreover, the CPPCC National Committee will provide political consultations before decisions are made on major state and local policies and on major political, economic, cultural, and social issues. It will also provide political consultations on major issues when decisions are being carried out. The motion of revising the Constitution to be submitted to the second session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee for discussion and adoption was drafted and redrafted many times on the basis of the views expressed by persons in charge of all democratic parties, industrial and commercial federations, and local CPPCC organs, as well as relevant central authorities. [Li Luye, reading from paper] With regard to participating in administration and state affairs discussions, the Eighth CPPCC National Committee did so in many ways. I will briefly describe some major one. On participating in administration and discussion of state affairs, the Eighth CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee held a total of five plenary sessions in 1993 to discuss issues concerning the state's economic problems and solutions, international situation, the establishment of a socialist market economic system, ethical construction, and crackdown on corruption. Leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council who reported at the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee included Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, and Wei Jianxing. Standing Committee members have presented very good opinions and suggestions on major state affairs. The Standing Committee meetings have made new headway in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs. In other respects of participating in administration and discussion of state affairs, special committees under the CPPCC National Committee presented 24 important investigation reports in 1993. These reports were about stabilizing grain and cotton output, rescue and preservation of historical relics which can be destroyed by the construction of the Three Gorges Project, the construction of high-tech industrial development zones, and projects that minority areas can carry out to eliminate poverty and develop their economy. The CPC Central Committee and relevant departments under the State Council have attached great importance to these reports. Many views expressed in the reports have been adopted. [Liu Hanzhen in Mandarin] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. You just mentioned that the CPC National Committee was involved in fighting corruption in 1993. What conclusions have you come up with? How corrupt is the Chinese Government? What kind of work has to be carried out? Have there been any CPPCC National Committee members who have been investigated or found to have committed corruption? [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee not only gives the CPC Central Committee and the State Council its all-out support in their fight against corruption, we have also taken an active part in the fight. Six investigation groups, with CPPCC National Committee members as heads or deputy heads, have investigated the anticorruption struggles waged by four ministries under the State Council and eight provinces. The fifth session of the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee also specially discussed the anticorruption issues, and promptly reflected the views and requests of people in all circles. During their discussion on fighting corruption, CPPCC National Committee members unanimously agreed that the struggle was an important matter having a close bearing on the survival of our state. The anticorruption struggle will continue to be a formidable and protracted mission. With regard to whether any CPPCC National Committee members have been investigated for having committed corruption, I can tell you that recently the National Committee's Standing Committee adopted a decision to dismiss Liu Huanzhen from his posts as a Standing Committee member and as a CPPCC National Committee member because of his involvement in fraud. [Unidentified Reporter] I am reporter from China Central Television. Spokesman, since 1993, China has come up with many measures and plans for reform, such as reform of the financial and taxation systems. Which of these measures and plans are based on proposals presented or drawn up by the CPPCC National Committee for Reform? [Li Luye] The proposal presented by our Economic Committee on the state's economic situation and solutions to the economic problems -- the proposal on intensifying macroscopic regulation and control and curbing inflation -- has been adopted by the CPC Central Committee and relevant departments under the State Council. [Huang Zhikuan] I am Huang Zhikuan from the CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY in Taipei. Does the CPPCC National Committee have any new plans for its Taiwan operations? And how does the CPPCC National Committee view the efforts made by the Taiwan authorities in fighting for international space for activities [sheng huo kong jian]? Thank you. [Li Luye] The CPPCC National Committee has been making positive efforts in supporting the national cause of achieveing peaceful reunification. In 1993, the CPPCC National Committee received many countrymen from Taiwan. With regard to promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the CPPCC National Committee thinks that it is significant to promote mutual and common understanding in this regard. We will continue to intensify our work in this regard. With regard to your question about Taiwan's fight for survival space [sheng cun kong jian], I think that this is not a problem about fighting for survival, but a move attempting to create two Chinas or one China and one Taiwan. [Moderator] This news briefing has now come to end an end. There will be several news conferences. You are welcome to attend. Thank you all.
