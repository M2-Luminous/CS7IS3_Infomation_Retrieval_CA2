FR940503-1-00064 FR940503-1-00012 A. Establishing Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines In order to establish an individual baseline for a foreign refinery under this proposal, a petition would have to be submitted to EPA in a manner analogous to the baseline submissions required for domestic refiners. The petition would have to contain the Method 1, Method 2, and/or Method 3 data, collected and evaluated in the same manner as is required of domestic refiners under §80.91. The baseline data would have to be submitted in the same manner as is required of domestic refiners under §80.93, except that EPA is proposing to modify the requirements in §80.93 related to the dates by which baseline submissions are due. Under §80.93 domestic refiners are required to submit data collected before December 15, 1993 by June 1, 1994, or by September 1, 1994 if data is collected subsequent to December 15, 1993. As a result of the timing of this proposal, these dates are not reasonable for baseline petitions for foreign refiners. EPA is therefore proposing that any petition for an individual foreign refinery baseline would be required to be submitted to the Administrator within six months following the date the individual foreign refinery baseline final regulation is signed. This approach is analogous to the lead time afforded domestic refiners in the final rule for baseline submissions. Another departure from the baseline submission requirements of §80.93 is that baseline data for foreign refineries would have to be submitted in such a manner that EPA could determine the quality and quantity of the gasoline produced at the foreign refinery during 1990 that was used in the United States. Baseline submissions by domestic refiners are not required to focus on the 1990 U.S. market share of refinery production, because it is assumed that all gasoline produced at a domestic refinery is used in the United States, unless the refiner shows certain gasoline was exported. This proposal that foreign refinery baseline petitions would be required to establish U.S. market gasoline quality and quantity is critical, because the quality of a foreign refinery's U.S. market gasoline in many cases would be different from the quality of the refinery's overall gasoline quality. Under the proposal, if EPA is unable to determine both the quality and quantity of the gasoline that was produced by any foreign refinery in 1990 and used in the United States, the individual foreign refinery baseline petition would be denied. The accuracy and completeness of the data and conclusions contained in the individual foreign refinery baseline petition would have to be verified by an independent EPA-approved auditor, in the same manner as is required of domestic refiners under §80.92. Thus, the auditor would have to be approved by EPA according to the criteria, specified in §80.92, which include approval of the auditor's independence and technical ability. EPA is proposing that a petition for an individual foreign refinery baseline must be submitted by the foreign refiner. EPA believes the foreign refiner is the most appropriate person to submit such a petition, because it is the foreign refiner who will possess most or all of the information that would support such a petition. EPA also is proposing that the petition must contain a declaration by the owner or president of the foreign refiner business that the information submitted in the petition is accurate and complete. EPA is further proposing that the foreign refiner owner or president would be required to affirmatively declare that EPA auditors and inspectors will be given full and immediate access to all refinery premises, for purposes of compliance with the EPA inspection requirements EPA has proposed in §80.84(f). The declarations by the foreign refiner owner or president would be mandatory conditions for EPA approval of any foreign refinery baseline petition. EPA is proposing this declaration requirement in order to ensure that in each case of a foreign refiner seeking an individual baseline, refiner officials at the highest levels of the business are aware of the refiner commitments that are necessary for use of a foreign refinery's baseline. B. Establishing the Refinery-of-Origin EPA is proposing regulatory requirements that would, for any batch of imported gasoline claimed to be subject to an individual foreign refinery baseline, establish the identity of the foreign refinery at which the gasoline was produced. The proposed requirements would include the testing of samples of the gasoline in question collected subsequent to loading into the ship at the port serving the foreign refinery, but before the ship leaves that port. These test results from the foreign refinery loading point would then be compared with test results of samples of the gasoline in question collected when the ship arrives at the United States port of entry. Sampling and testing of gasoline at the U.S. port of entry is required by the final rule, at §§80.65(e)&hyph;(f).
