FBIS4-312 "drafr068_d_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola Government Reacts to Statement Government Reacts to Statement MB0804073994 Luanda TPA Television Network in Portuguese 1930 GMT 7 Apr 94 MB0804073994 Luanda TPA Television Network Portuguese BFN [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], the acknowledged winner of the first Angolan elections and, therefore, responsible for the formation of this country's first democratic government, today reacted to the statement of the 14 parties making up the so-called Democratic Civilian Opposition. MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco has granted an interview to the People's Television of Angola in which he commented on that statement. [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The statement issued yesterday by the self-styled Democratic Civilian Opposition is absurd, to say the least. That is because we do not understand how a country that has existed for some 20 years can remain forever in a state of transition. What the so-called Democratic Civilian Opposition parties want is for the present institutions, which emerged from the 1992 elections, to be scrapped. That is absurd. It cannot be accepted. That would be tantamount to betraying the large majority of Angolan people who cast their votes in September 1992. The people turned out at the polls to vote for the party they regarded as being the best and the one best equipped to defend their aspirations. It is necessary that the electorate's choice of the MPLA be respected in full. [Unidentified correspondent] Would the MPLA be in the position to make concessions? For instance, those parties have asked for the demilitarization of all forces. They also asked for a greater number of blue helmet forces to be sent over. Would the MPLA be willing to make concessions regarding those points? [Lourenco] It seems to me that the so-called Democratic Civilian Opposition is beginning to behave irresponsibly, to put it mildly. It does not even have an idea about what its responsibilities should be. It is true that the country is going through a crisis. There is a fierce conflict between the government and a political party that is illegally armed. That party has begun a war throughout Angolan territory and that war has had serious consequences, meaning that the opposition parties should act in accordance with the laws in force in this country and demand that the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which is contravening the law, be the only party to be disarmed, so that UNITA can start operating in accordance with the Constitutional Law and other laws in force in this country. So, if any side is to be disarmed, that side should be the one with an illegal army. To my knowledge, the sole illegal army in this country belongs to UNITA. In view of that, only the UNITA army should be demilitarized and disarmed. We believe that it would be at the very least suicidal to disarm the Angolan Armed Forces and the Angolan Police. We believe such measures would place in jeopardy the very existence of the Angolan State. [end recording]
