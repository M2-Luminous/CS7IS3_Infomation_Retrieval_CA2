Aninat said Chile would have to wait to see how events develop before a proper decision is made on this issue. Aninat also said that while according to several studies neither of the two possibilities have trade advantages of any great significance, an agreement would in any case eliminate the different levels of tariffs, which would produce relatively larger profits for our exports of nontraditional products which have a large added value. Aninat also said that joining NAFTA or signing a free trade agreement with the United States would give prestige to the country, and could be very important in terms of attracting investments, giving more stability to national economic policy and boosting the Chilean reputation abroad. Aninat added that many people believe that simply signing a free trade agreement with the United States is almost enough in itself, as that country is very strict and demanding in its standards and this would benefit the Chilean economy. Aninat, who today attended a meeting of the Chilean-U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said it is important to place a free trade agreement with the United States within its real setting and dimensions. He added that future negotiations should be put into their proper context, as neither a bilateral trade agreement nor joining NAFTA should be considered the more successful measure, nor should one or the other be considered a total failure or put at the highest levels, which might wear down the issue of our relations with the United States. He concluded by saying that our bilateral relations with the United States are very complex, have profound historical roots, and involve many aspects that go way beyond economic issues.
