The criminals continue to employ their surprise tactic of sudden shelling, usually at times when the population is most relaxed. Their sole objective is to kill as many innocent people as possible. A general alarm signal was sounded at 1300 [1200 GMT] because some 10 120-mm mortar shells were launched at the town center in a relatively short period. The shelling of civilian targets is still in progress. We do not have any information on the killed and wounded, but we do know for certain that there are casualties.
