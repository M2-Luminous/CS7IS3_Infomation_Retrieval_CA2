The toll could climb as reports from far-flung rural settlements only reach police liaison officials days later. Natal unrest monitor and academic Mary de Haas on Tuesday reported 16 additional weekend deaths in northern Natal townships and rural areas which police have not yet confirmed. Police reports put the toll at 88 since last Thursday -- a staggering average of 14 killings a day under emergency rule. Violence in Natal has reached unprecedented levels with 300 deaths reported in March -- the highest in the province in several years. [passage omitted] The confirmed death toll following violence in kwaMashu near Durban on Sunday night has risen to 12, the KZP [kwaZulu Police] reported on Tuesday, adding seven to the earlier report of five hostel dwellers killed. Capt Zakwe said the latest killings were linked to the ongoing political feud which erupted in the township after "Zulu royalists" occupied the venue of an African National Congress rally three weeks ago. In other recent reports, kwaMashu police said another person was shot dead in the township on Monday night. Four youths were gunned down at Folweni south of Durban, also on Monday night. The badly decomposed body of a man was found in Esikhawini on the north coast on Sunday night. [passage omitted] Pietermaritzburg police spokesman Maj Henry Budhram said two people were killed after a "kangaroo court" hearing on Saturday. He said both men were tied to a chair and set alight at Maphumulo near Greytown. The KZP also reported the killing of a man in Mpumalanga near Durban at the weekend. He was shot.
