The Deputy Director, Xie Zhiqiang, of the Tarim Petroleum Prospecting and Development Directorate, announced that during four years of prospecting in northern and central Tarim, covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers, over 95,000 kilometers of two-dimensional digital seismic prospecting, and 2,200 kilometers of three-dimensional prospecting have been completed, 169 exploratory wells have been drilled, totalling 970,000 meters of drilling footage, and industrial-grade oil and gas flows have been found at 81 wells. Six oil fields that have been confirmed or basically confirmed and ready for exploitation are the Lunnan, Sangtamu, Donghetang, Jilake, Jiefang Qudong, and Tazhong-4 oil fields. Three hundred million tons of oil reserves and about 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves are basically confirmed and under control. What is especially satisfying is that the Tazhong-4 oil field, which has 130 million tons of reserves, has the resources to assure the construction of a 5-million ton crude oil production capability. This year, the Tazhong-10 and Tazhong-6 wells have each produced high-output flows of oil and gas, demonstrating that central Tarim is an area of large-sized oil fields. Important gains have also been made in development and construction. Construction of crude oil production capabilities of 1.4 million tons was begun at Lunnan, Sangtamu, and Jiefang Qudong oil fields last year. The production capacity of Donghetang oil field was expanded from 750,000 tons to 2.15 million tons last year. One hundred and sixty five kilometers of the 230-kilometer Taklimakan desert highway have been completed, and it is expected to be open to the Tazhong-4 oil field by the end of June next year; 140 kilometers of the oil-field pipeline have also been completed this year. Petroleum exploration will be further accelerated during the next three years. It is estimated that by 1995 confirmed and controlled petroleum geology reserves will be 800 million tons, and in 1996 the annual output of crude oil will be 5 million tons. The US$500 million loaned by the Xinjiang Branch of the Bank of China for petroleum exploration and development in Tarim will be used over the next two years to buy facilities, precision instruments, and desert transportation vehicles needed for the oil field.
