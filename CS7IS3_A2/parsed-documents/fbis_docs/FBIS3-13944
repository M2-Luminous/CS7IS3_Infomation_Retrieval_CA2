In an interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states. Al-Bid called for confronting this plan by discussing it on a pan-Arab level. He also called for confronting the backward mentalities which want to impose their will on the Arab and Islamic nation. He welcomed any Arab effort to help Yemen avoid the specter of civil war, continue the democratic and peaceful march of unity, and adhere to the pledge and accord document. Al-Bid renewed his call to President Mubarak and to eldest sister Egypt to play an influential role in the Yemeni arena, given Egypt's relations with Yemen and its past sacrifices for Yemen's sake. Egypt must play a pan-Arab role because there can be no strong Arab nation without it. This is what he proposed to President Mubarak during their recent contacts. He said: Our recent meeting with him was greatly reassuring because it showed that Egypt pays great attention to Yemen's problems. Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for exporting terrorism to Egypt because this hurts us and runs counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to offer terrorism instead of loyalty. On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said that despite events he is optimistic and will remain optimistic about realizing the grand design of Yemeni unity, which was always an excuse for fraternal warfare. In the 1972 and 1979 skirmishes, we used to stop after battles and call for unity. In 1989, we called for a united Yemeni state with a peaceful spirit, a democratic basis, and with the logic of the modern age. However, a short time after the march of unity began we faced some obstacles. The most important thing was not to resort to fighting, especially as violence is not the road to unity but a completely different road. The road to unity is peaceful and democratic and is based on convictions and goals. Unity must not be exposed to farces and vituperations. He explained that with time it turned out that the proper conditions and the proper leadership to accommodate the aspirations for unity and achieve a common vision and goal were lacking in Yemen. Al-Bid said that the existence of disagreements between the two leaderships in Yemeni, the fact that this subject in all its political dimensions was not submitted for discussion, and the fact that no attempt was made to pinpoint the mistakes and negative manifestations placed the unity plan in a predicament. This happened despite popular consensus on unity and determination by the various sincere sons of the Yemeni people to achieve it. Al-Bid said: During our short experience, we have discovered that a reactionary terrorist plan is being prepared against the Arab nation with a view to returning us to the Middle Ages and perhaps excluding us, as Arabs and Muslims, from the modern world. All the plots and sedition being concocted against the Arab nation are also directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are suffering from this terrorist plan opposing unity. We discovered in time that there are several terrorist acts and assassinations aimed at jeopardizing the march of unity. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt a stand against terrorism and those who support it, to protect the Arab nation's unity and solidarity, and to find a logical formula to confront this plan. The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the unity of Yemen. He wondered about the reasons for the success of some fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic religion--which in fact has nothing to do with them--did not gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply in the Arab world. He affirmed that the most important problem impeding a state of unity is the fact that a number of leaders have not quite assimilated this great pan-Arab development. This is why the document concentrates on establishing a unified state and its mechanism. Unfortunately, the search for a state that would subsume such competition and development in the various fields in these circumstances was unsuccessful during the transitional period. The situation then deteriorated into assassinations, explosions, and military confrontation instead of dialogue. The Yemeni vice president then discussed the developments that took place after signing the Pledge and Accord Document in Aden [place as published]. He clarified that hours after the signing ceremony, clashes erupted between the Yemeni Army units, which was the first time this had happened on this scale and in this way. For the first time since unity, orders were issued to soldiers of the Yemeni Army to kill their own brothers in the Army. Despite this, I issued orders not to respond with violence in order to avoid the shedding of innocent Yemeni blood, because the victor in this kind of battle is the loser and such fighting would push Yemeni unity into a new dark tunnel. Fighting is not our method, because it kills unity. This is why we adhere to the Pledge and Accord Document. But when we proposed the implementation of the first article in it, the reaction by the other side was to fight harder to silence us. Al-Bid confirmed the need to try those accused of the recent assassinations in Yemen. He said: We all have to work hard to implement the agreement, which enjoys national consensus from the various groups of people. At the same time, we need Arab efforts alongside the Yemeni efforts. Al-Bid said that unfortunately we have encountered narrow-minded people who cannot think logically and try to take over the institutions. They were not up to the standard of the grand national project for unity. Regarding the deadlock Yemeni unity is facing in implementing the Pledge and Accord Document as a result of the differences between the YSP, which is demanding that the defendants be arrested and the first article of the document be implemented, and the People's Congress, which is insisting on uniting the state institutions before anything else, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that some people had believed that signing the document would end the crisis. This was wrong. The truth is that by signing the document we recognized that there was a crisis and established all the conditions for resolving it. The situation requires that we move toward implementation under the appropriate circumstances. The document's seventh article calls for several security and constitutional guarantees that should have been annexed to the document. The prime minister, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al- 'Attas, made a lot of efforts over the past month to persuade the brothers in Sanaa to offer or implement security guarantees, but his efforts bore no fruit. In Amman we submitted a YSP paper that explained our views on how to implement the agreement, beginning with gradual normalization and following up with clear steps and maintaining the earnest drive to implement the accord. The vice president explained: Wanted suspects were not pursued, the country became involved in a crisis, and we had to leave Sanaa. There were officials in the state's institutions protecting well-known criminals. When we feel that some officials are linked to killings, how can we feel safe? I want to say this frankly: Some people are opposed to the document, and for this reason I hesitated before signing it as I did not want to be hasty. I was afraid that the signing of the document would inflame the security situation; and this actually happened. Regarding fears of a possible military confrontation, the vice president said these fears are real and the Military Committee must get help from the Arab countries. He added: We support the expansion of Arab participation, particularly by our Egyptian brothers, and cooperation in bringing the views closer. We are seeking to avoid a civil war and to pursue our democratic process. If we are dragged into a conflict, this will bring destruction to Yemen. We call for the supremacy of law and demand an investigation into the serious events that have occurred to determine who was at fault. Despite our efforts four brigades have been mobilized in al-Bayda' in the north against one brigade in the south. We draw comfort from the fact that the citizens are opposed to infighting. Furthermore it is difficult for any one party to control Yemen by way of killings and terrorism. Sit-ins and civil disobedience have begun in various areas. This happened after my call to the citizens to abide by the document. I expect popular support for the democratic process to grow until we are able to build one state. Civil disobedience is a legitimate action, particularly because some officials are exploiting the state to promote their own personal interests. They are pointing the state in the wrong direction. Hence our only possible course of action is to go to the people and encourage democratic struggle. What is important is not to let the guns speak. Al-Bid affirmed that it was his awareness of the existence of sizable oil reserves in the south that made him hasten to promote unity with the north. He declared that this resource must belong to a united Yemen, adding: We did our utmost to promote unity. Our reward was assassinations and threats. Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some al-Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details will become known in due time. This cooperation with the terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the support of some people in power and some Army units. When they are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege them and get rid of them.
