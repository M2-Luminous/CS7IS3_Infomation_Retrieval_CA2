Nobody, it seems -- at least when it comes to chemical weapons. Russia was one of the first countries to sign the convention to abolish chemical arsenals (on 13 January 1993), but the suspicions remain. Every other week the United States accuses it of having no intention of eliminating the arsenals but of in fact planning a superweapon. The decree with which Boris Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy Kunzevich, chairman of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs Committee, was not very reassuring. "He authorized the shipment of a dangerous load through an inhabited area," spokesmen explained. That was a mere pretext. Kunzevich (formerly director of the military laboratory at Shikany, which we discuss below) pointed out that the administrations of the places where the arsenals are located are refusing to grant the Army permission to get rid of the substances on the spot, so it is impossible to eliminate them. Even the Russians no longer trust Russia. There are many "converts" among scientists (we interviewed engineer Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov), and many local communities are prepared to mobilize. Meanwhile 40,000 tonnes of toxic substances lie in arsenals all over the country. Apart from nuclear weapons, they constitute the most colossal accumulation of means of destruction that exists on Earth at present. The chemical history of Shikany -- an ancient possession of the Orlov-Denisov nobility in Volskiy province in the region of Saratov -- begins in 1924. [passage omitted] After the war, Shikany, which has a population of 12,000, was divided into two parts. Shikany 1 is assigned to the Industry Ministry. It is the location of the State Institute for Organic Synthesis Technologies, housed in a small building. For the past 30 years it has been one of the main research centers into the most harmful substances for civilian applications. Shikany 2 is the location of the Scientific Experiments Institute and the Defense Ministry's test range for weapons and chemical and radioactive defense methods. After decades of experiments, nobody can say what has been absorbed by the grass and trees of this area, which covers almost 400 square km, nor what kind of deposits have formed at the bottom of the lake that is the source of the Bagayka stream, which debouches into the Volga. With regard to the Volga, which crosses the area, it should be kept in mind that on the opposite bank from Shikany 1 and 2 there lies the village of Gornyy, where the Army has located deposits containing over 1,000 tonnes of toxic substances. Although the military carries out regular checks, the conservation of these toxic substances has now become extremely dangerous; the deposits are old, the containers are no longer secure, and although the construction of a terminal to reduce the toxicity of the substances has been announced, it will take a long time yet. All this information has emerged gradually from the population. After the statements by Vil Mirzayanov, a number of "betrayers of state secrets" emerged, some of them within the local authorities and among the technicians of the Shikany laboratories. The first was Vladimir Petrenko -- reserve major and member of the local council -- who recounted how in the past he had allowed the effects of certain substances to be tested on himself; he was followed by Vladimir Uglev, a chemical engineer at Shikany, who defended Mirzayanov. Then the inhabitants of the area formed a movement "Against the Chemical Threat," to protest their position of hostages of the military industry. All this brought about a new awareness among the Russian public which, though more than justified, ultimately rebounded against us members of the Environmental Committee. As well as in the Saratov region, there are major deposits of chemical substances also in Chuvasha and Udmurtia. It seemed clear to us that these substances must be rendered harmless or eliminated in their present locations and that such a burden could not be transferred to others. However, the republics of Chuvasha and Udmurtia have banned any elimination of chemical weapons on their own territory. So all that was left to the Saratov region was to dictate the conditions drawn up by the local authorities together with the regional environmental committee and a group of experts: to eliminate only the substances already present in the region; to draw up a plan for the social development of Gornyy and Shikany; to compensate all the inhabitants for the threat of environmental damage; to create a regional center to monitor work carried out against any pollution. These proposals were sent to the government and to Parliament, but no reply has yet been received. The inhabitants of the Saratov region remain alone with their anxieties. Meanwhile, the experimental scientific center at Shikany has also fallen victim to the economic crisis. In February it ceased its activities, offering its staff a choice between seeking another job or taking an enforced vacation. Since staff had not received their wages since December, there was an immediate "exodus": Of the 2,500 staff, there are now only 1,500 left. Apart from unemployment, the inhabitants of Shikany have also discovered that they are "prisoners" of the Defense Ministry, which owns almost one-third of the entire province. It is therefore forbidden to privatize either the land for farming or the apartments. For the same reason it is forbidden to construct private factories or workshops that could provide employment. "Thank God," Nadezhda Saratov, mayor of Shikany, said, "the Defense Ministry still has the money to pay the wages of the staff at Shikany 2. But it is impossible to distinguish the two halves of the town, even though they are in the charge of different ministries: The people are the same and so are their problems, and they all share the same anxiety about how the elimination of the chemical deposits will take place." Last summer many inhabitants of Shikany and the surrounding area reported skin infections, especially those who were outdoors when it rained. In February six soldiers serving at Shikany 2 were admitted to hospital with pulmonary edema. Fortunately they all survived. It may be just a coincidence, but the inhabitants of Shikany are now accustomed to being suspicious. They therefore immediately connected these events with the fact that the "chemical friendship" with the Germans has been revived. A new agreement has been signed between Russia and Germany, and Germany has already sent to the area a mobile laboratory and complete equipment for eliminating the toxic substances. Many years ago the Germans helped us to create chemicals for death, and now they want to help us to eliminate them. In 1915 they tried to use gas on the river Ypr, now it seems that all toxic substances must end up on the banks of the Volga. According to incomplete data, along the banks of our great river there are 29 centers for the production of chemical weapons, nine test ranges, and 24 deposits. Who will help us to eliminate this evil force?
