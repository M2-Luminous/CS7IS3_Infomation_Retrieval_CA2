If Ciller can provide proof to back her allegations then this may prove to be the reef that the RP actually flounders on, colliding head on with the concept of "Islamic purity." If, however Ciller cannot prove her allegations then this could be the last straw in terms of her overall credibility, with disastrous effects on her True Path Party (DYP) politically. While Ciller and the government remained silent on the subject on Thursday [24 February], Sevket Kazan, a leading member of the RP, tried to disprove the allegations by producing bank dockets he claimed showed the money had gone to its rightful destination. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Ambassador to Ankara Hayrudin Somum, for his part, confirmed to the Turkish Daily News that he had personally witnessed the transfer of DM 50,000 (approx. TL 540 million) and $60,000 (approx TL 1.08 billion) from the RP to Bosnia President Alija Izetbegovic, for which he said a receipt has been issued. Somum said the transfer took place at Istanbul airport on June 20 last year, as Izetbegovi was leaving Turkey after one of his many visits. Ambassador Somum indicated however that he was not aware of any other transfers and "could not say anything for sure on this subject." There have been some suggestions that the recent petty corruption charges the RP has faced, and especially those concerning its mayoral candidate for Istanbul Tayyip Erdogan, may in fact have rebounded as sympathy for the party. Some analysts have argued that the great manner in which the media has focused on relatively small corruption charges against the RP when the other parties are currently accused of much greater graft may actually translate into sympathy for the Welfare camp. But Ciller's claim this time carries the potential of doing the party a lot of damage if it can be substantiated. Ciller reportedly claimed to deputies of her True Path Party (DYP) during a party group meeting on Tuesday in Parliament that the RP had not sent the money it collected for Bosnia and that she had proof to this effect which she would disclose later. This claim was leaked to the press by deputies attending the meeting which was closed to journalists. State Minister Necmettin Cevheri confirmed reports of the claim when he announced on Wednesday that there were indications that of the TL 26 billion collected by the RP, TL20 billion was unaccounted for. He added that the prime minister's office had started an investigation concerning allegations that this TL 20 billion had been diverted. Cevheri suggested that such an investigation would also be good for the RP because it would prove, as the party's leading officials were claiming, that nothing irregular had taken place. Bosnian Ambassador to Ankara Hayrudin Somum was quoted in the Turkish press on Thursday as saying that they had been exhorting organizations gathering funds for Bosnia to cooperate with the Turkish Red Crescent Society, the Directorate for Religious Affairs and their embassy in Ankara in order for aid to reach its goal effectively. Somum appeared to be saying in this way that if all of the money in question had been sent as the RP was saying, this had not gone to Bosnia through his embassy. The general director of the Turkish Red Crescent Society, Unal Somuncu, was also quoted in the press on Thursday as saying that "not a penny had come to them" from the Welfare Party for Bosnia. The deep concern in the Welfare camp in the face of these developments was more than apparent in the statements of the party's leading figures on Wednesday and Thursday. Analysts say that if the government can prove a serious case of corruption involving the RP and that funds gathered for Bosnia had indeed been diverted--presumably for campaign purposes--then this could do the party immeasurable damage in terms of its image as a "clean Islamic party." What makes this charge worse than the charge of having houses built illegally on land belonging to the ministry (which RP Istanbul mayoral candidate Tayyip Erdogan is facing) is that this charge is a direct affront to one of the deepest and holiest tenets of Islam: namely "thou shalt not steal the orphans' share." To do so, according to Islam, is something that even Allah cannot forgive. Addressing deputies from his party, Kazan, the deputy chairman of the RP's parliamentary group, on Wednesday accused the government as well as other sections of society in Turkey of trying to do all in their power to prevent his party from coming to power. "They would even get rid of democracy if they felt it necessary to prevent the RP from coming to power," Kazan had retorted angrily. Going on the offensive against the charges leveled at this party, Kazan said it was during President Demirel's term as prime minister that money had actually been diverted. He said that of the TL 12 billion that had been collected, TL 3.9 billion had been used to buy clothes and TL 215 million had been used to buy wheat and sugar to send to Bosnia. Kazan alleged that the remaining money had been seized by the government while it was in a special account in Vakifbank. This allegation was strongly denied on Thursday by President Demirel's office which said in a written statement that the TL 12 billion mentioned here had been presented by the director of religious affairs to Demirel who had immediately handed it over to the representative of the Turkish Red Crescent Society in front of press cameras. Talking to the press later on Wednesday, Kazan had distinguished between his party and members and sympathizers of the party who he said had collected funds for Bosnia. Maintaining that none of this money had entered into the party's safe, Kazan said he did not know how much money had been collected by party members and sympathizers. Kazan added that they did not use banks to transfer the money which they handed to the Bosnians directly on certain occasions. He claimed that a representative of the Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic had always been present on these occasions. During a press conference on the subject on Thursday, Kazan contradicted his statement of the previous day that no bank had been used in the transfer of the money and produced bank dockets to prove that transfers had been made. These appeared to go some way in allaying the accusations leveled at his party and left the field open to its accusers to produce the proof they claim to have. The bank dockets he produced covered an estimated DM 2.5 million as well as $73,000. When asked why the money had been sent to a bank in Germany Kazan pointed to the name of the bank and asked reporters to investigate the matter for themselves. He suggested that this was a bank account used by the Bosnians, although he did not clarify whether it was the Bosnian government he was referring to or other Bosnian groups. Repeating that his party had no direct connection with the gathering of funds for Bosnia, Kazan indicated that some members of the party had merely presided over the gathering of and transferring of funds for Bosnia as "observers." He appeared to try and explain why it was that his party had these dockets if it was not directly involved in the gathering and transferring of aid as it claimed. Kazan also distributed letters of thanks from Bosnian officials to the press in which the RP was thanked for aid that had been sent to Bosnia. The Bosnian Ambassador Hayrudin Somum will hold a press conference this morning to clarify the situation from their side. Following Kazan's disclosures on Wednesday eyes have now turned to Ciller and her government, who first leveled the accusation against the RP, to prove that their charges are correct. Analysts say that if the prime minister cannot prove the allegation against the RP, this could be disastrous in terms of her image and could harm her party's prospects in the upcoming local elections.
