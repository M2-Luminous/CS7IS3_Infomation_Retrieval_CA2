Because these people had once obtained permanent resident status in Hong Kong, they are different from those newly arrived in Hong Kong and applying for the right of abode. He said: Furthermore, we welcome persons of ability from various countries to Hong Kong, which is an international economic city, and we should provide them with some conveniences. Lu Ping answered reporters' questions this morning and afternoon on the issue of the status of permanent residents. Lu Ping said that the Preliminary Work Committee is studying the issue as to what conditions will cause former permanent residents of Hong Kong to lose their right of abode and what requirements they would have to meet in order to regain their right of abode after losing such right. He thought that for the former permanent residents of Hong Kong who want to regain their right of abode, a more lenient policy should be adopted. Lu Ping pointed out: "The issue of nationality and the issue of right of abode are two different matters. After 1997, foreigners can also obtain the right of abode in Hong Kong as well as the status of permanent resident." But Lu Ping added: "After non-Chinese nationals obtain permanent resident status, if they return to their own countries to live or emigrate to other countries then they might lose the status of permanent resident of Hong Kong because they have given up Hong Kong as a place of permanent residence."
