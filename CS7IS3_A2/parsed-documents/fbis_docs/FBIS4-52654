In a statement May 2 Cilreco hailed and fully supported the important peace overture made by the DPRK to defuse confrontation and tension on the Korean peninsula and eradicate the danger of a war. It urged the United States to affirmatively respond to the DPRK's important peace overture without delay and called on the regional and national committees of Cilreco, organizations for disarmament and peace and anti-war, anti-nuke peaceloving forces across the world to launch an extensive movement in support of the overture. The Dar es Salaam Provincial Committee of the Tanzanian Youth Union in a statement May 1 said the United States has persistently rendered the situation of the Korean peninsula strained, violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzed the armistice supervisory machine for nearly half a century. It demanded that the United States immediately put into effect the statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry, withdraw from South Korea at once, taking along more than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons and Patriot missiles, stop joint military exercises and come out to the talks with the DPRK. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a statement on May 3. Noting that it has become an urgent matter to take practical steps for a durable peace on the Korean peninsula today when the Korean Armistice Agreement has been paralyzed, the statement strongly demanded that the United States accept the proposal of the DPRK Government unconditionally.
