"It's such an approach that we're guided by in building relations between Tatarstan and the Russian Federation." Mr. Shaymiyev said problems of Tatar-Russian relations are central to the republic's political life. He stressed that the treaty on delimiting the subjects of supervision and mutual delegation of powers by Tatar and Russia state power bodies is based on the coordination on the two constitutions and unconditional respect for human rights, irrespective of nationality, sex, and religion. "...an absolutely new, hitherto unknown in practice document is coming into being," pointed out Mr. Shaymiyev. "It highlights the competence of Russian and Tatar state power bodies and will evidence Russia's reformation and renewal on democratic principles and become a guarantor of Tatarstan's statehood." Touching upon his January meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Shaymiyev said the sides agreed on the completion of preparations of other intergovernmental agreement concerning foreign economic activity, the combating of crime, as well as budgetary, taxation, military, and banking problems.
