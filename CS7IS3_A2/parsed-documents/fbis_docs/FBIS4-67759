On the occasion of the current parliamentary discussions on the renewed amendment to the Foreign Economy Law, FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) noted in a position paper, which became known on Wednesday [13 April]: "The greatest success consists in catching the main German supplier for the nuclear program of a foreign country and uncovering his acquisition organization in Germany and Western Europe." According to industrial circles, the country could be Pakistan. In four of the 11 cases involved intentional violations of the Military Materiel Control Law and one case involved the planned delivery of military goods to Iraq. In the other cases there was "the suspicion of planned subcontractor deliveries for nuclear and missile programs of various sensitive countries." With these explanations Rexrodt wanted to justify his stricter legal stipulations in the field of telecommunications secrecy and fines. The Bundestag Economics Committee, however, postponed its deliberations on this matter at short notice. [passage omitted]
