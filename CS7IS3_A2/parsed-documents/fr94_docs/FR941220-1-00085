ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commission is proposing today amendments relating to the safe harbor provisions of Rules 138 and 139 under the Securities Act of 1933. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify the availability of the safe harbor provisions of Rule 138 relating to broker-dealer research reports on individual companies and the availability of the safe harbor provisions of Rule 139 for broker-dealer industry research reports which include sizable, first-time foreign registrants. DATES: Comments should be received on or before January 19, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comment letters should refer to File Number S7&hyph;36&hyph;94 and be submitted in triplicate to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. The Commission will make all comments available for public inspection and copying in its Public Reference Room at the same address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Annemarie Tierney, (202) 942&hyph;2990, Office of International Corporate Finance, Division of Corporation Finance, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As described in detail below, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 138 1 and Rule 139 2 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''). 3 1 17 CFR 230.138. 2 17 CFR 230.139. 3 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. I. Availability of Research Report Safe Harbors A. Rule 139 Safe Harbor Rule 139 under the Securities Act provides safe harbor protection from the registration requirements of that Act for the distribution by broker-dealers of information, opinions or recommendations concerning issuers in the process of registering securities under the Securities Act. Prior to April 1994, reliance on the safe harbor for research reports concerning a foreign private issuer were conditioned on eligibility of the foreign private issuer for use of Form F&hyph;3. 4 On April 19, 1994, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 139 that make the rule available for offerings by foreign private issuers that would be eligible to use Form F&hyph;3 but for the 12-month reporting requirement if the issuer meets an alternative offshore trading history test. 5 Under the alternative test, a foreign private issuer must have been listed or quoted on a designated offshore securities market 6 for a period of at least 12 months. 4 17 CFR 239.33. 5 Release No. 33&hyph;7053 (Apr. 19, 1994), 59 FR 21644. 6 ``Designated offshore securities market'' is defined in Rule 902(a) of Regulation S (17 CFR 230.902(a)). In adopting these amendments, the Commission intended that broker-dealers would be able to rely upon Rule 139 for sizable foreign private issuers with respect to which there is a stream of corporate information available in the marketplace, including qualifying foreign issuers registering securities with the Commission for the first time. As drafted, however, the amendments did not make clear that the elimination of the reporting history requirement included the elimination of the requirement that a foreign issuer be previously reporting pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') 7 and have filed at least one annual report. 7 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. The amendments proposed today revise Rule 139 to make clear that the special provisions adopted last year for sizable foreign issuers are also available for those issuers' initial public offerings in the United States. 8 8 In order to make the rule available to first-time sizable foreign registrants, the Commission is proposing to amend the first sentence of the rule to provide that a foreign private issuer that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of the Rule need not previously have been reporting pursuant to the Exchange Act. In addition, language would be added to paragraph (a)(2) to provide that such foreign private issuer need not have filed an annual report as a condition of eligibility for the rule.
