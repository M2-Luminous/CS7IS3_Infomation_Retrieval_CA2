FR940725-1-00082 FR940725-1-00010 (b) Utility category airplanes . A utility category airplane must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and §23.807(b)(7) must be met if approval for spinning is requested. (c) Acrobatic category airplanes . An acrobatic category airplane must meet the spin requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and §23.807(b)(6). In addition, the following requirements must be met in each configuration for which approval for spinning is requested: (1) The airplane must recover from any point in a spin up to and including six turns, or any greater number of turns for which certification is requested, in not more than one and one-half additional turns after initiation of the first control action for recovery. However, beyond three turns, the spin may be discontinued if spiral characteristics appear. (2) The applicable airspeed limits and limit maneuvering load factors must not be exceeded. For flaps-extended configurations for which approval is requested, the flaps must not be retracted during the recovery. (3) It must be impossible to obtain unrecoverable spins with any use of the flight or engine power controls either at the entry into or during the spin. (4) There must be no characteristics during the spin (such as excessive rates of rotation or extreme oscillatory motion) that might prevent a successful recovery due to disorientation or incapacitation of the pilot. 38. Section 23.233 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §23.233 Directional stability and control. (a) A 90 degree cross-component of wind velocity, demonstrated to be safe for taxiing, takeoff, and landing must be established and must be not less than 0.2 V SO . * * * * * 39. Section 23.235 is revised to read as follows: §23.235 Operation on unpaved surfaces. The airplane must be demonstrated to have satisfactory characteristics and the shock-absorbing mechanism must not damage the structure of the airplane when the airplane is taxied on the roughest ground that may reasonably be expected in normal operation and when takeoffs and landings are performed on unpaved runways having the roughest surface that may reasonably be expected in normal operation. 40. A new §23.237 is added to read as follows: §23.237 Operation on water. A wave height, demonstrated to be safe for operation, and any necessary water handling procedures for seaplanes and amphibians must be established. §23.253 [Amended] 41. Section 23.253 is amended by removing paragraph (b)(1) and by redesignating paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) as paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2). 42. Section 23.562 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: §23.562 Emergency landing dynamic conditions. * * * * * (d) For all single-engine airplanes with a V SO of more than 61 knots at maximum weight, and those multiengine airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight with a V SO of more than 61 knots at maximum weight that do not comply with §23.67(a)(1); * * * * * 43. Section 23.1325 is amended by revising paragraph (e) and removing and reserving paragraph (f) to read as follows: §23.1325 Static pressure system. * * * * * (e) Each static pressure system must be calibrated in flight to determine the system error. The system error, in indicated pressure altitude, at sea-level, with a standard atmosphere, excluding instrument calibration error, may not exceed # 30 feet per 100 knot speed for the appropriate configuration in the speed range between 1.3 V SO with flaps extended, and 1.8 V S1 with flaps retracted. However, the error need not be less than 30 feet.
