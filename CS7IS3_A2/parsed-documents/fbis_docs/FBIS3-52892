According to a report by the Central News Unit, he considered the trend of the movement of the state economy as being towards a planned economy, and he described the advances of the state economy as outstanding during the first state economic, social, and cultural development plan, and he said: During the years when the First Development Plan was being implemented, while the international economy was facing a recession we were one of the five countries which advanced its economy at a relatively high percentage. He said: While in 1993 the world economic growth has been estimated to be 1.2 percent, our economy in the current year [Iranian year beginning 21 March 1993] has enjoyed a growth of 7.7 percent. On investment in various economic sectors, the minister of finance and economic affairs said: During the First Plan we spent more than one third of our foreign currency earnings on investment in development plans and production projects. Ninety percent of our debts are connected with that type of investment. He pointed out that more than 50 percent of the state foreign currency earnings during the years when the First Plan was being implemented were used up on investments in development projects. In the field of the domestic GNP, Mohammad-Khani said: In 1367 [year beginning 21 March 1988] the GNP was 7 percent. It reached 14 percent in 1371. He continued: On average the added value [as heard] in the agricultural sector during the period of the First Plan grew by 5.9 percent. That is 0.3 percent more than envisaged in the plan so that the volume of the added value of the sector compared to the beginning of the plan has increased four fold. Announcing that non-oil exports grew by 28.7 percent in the First Plan period, he described one of the most important objectives of the First Plan to be replacing imports. He recalled the role of non-oil exports in reducing the state foreign currency requirements and said: At the moment the increase in domestic products in the field of oil refining, petrochemical, intermediate, and consumer industries is satisfactory so that our domestic products have grown to such an extent that they can reduce the country's foreign currency requirements to one third of those in 1367. That indicates the success of the economic move in that field. The finance and economic affairs minister said that the forecast in the First Plan for the annual growth rate of the public sector spending was 24.4 percent and added: Nevertheless the forecast of the public sector spending growth rate in the Second Development Plan amounts to 43.2 percent. The reason for that is the growth of the government's development expenses. Referring to the high volume of investment in the production sector, the reduction of the state foreign currency requirements for importing capital-intensive goods as well as the arrangements made in the past few weeks to regulate the currency market, Mohammad-Khani considered the effect of oil price reductions in the trend of the state economic movement to be little. He considered the combination of implemented policies in support of domestic products, creating employment, supporting the national currency and regulating the state economic structure as significant and said that at the moment inflation and consumerism are two of the worst of the country's fundamental problems. On inflation, Mohammad-Khani said: The rapid growth of the economic structure, international recession, population growth, and a tendency toward consumerism in the community, have beset the regulation and coordination of economic and social development with difficulties and directed the greater part of the pressure resulting from that growth toward the salaried stratum. Therefore the government is duty bound to pay more attention to reduce that pressure on the vulnerable strata. The rate of inflation as well as the pressure on the low-income strata will be reduced through the start of commissioning production projects -- in which investment has been made -- as a result of increased supply, government support for vulnerable strata and a reform of the tax system. Continuing, the finance and economic affairs minister said: the annual rate of consumption during the period of the First Plan was forecast to be 5 percent. We have now reached a figure of 10 percent. That is why it is necessary for the public and private sectors to act to reduce consumption and cooperate to adjust the state economic status. He added: One of the policies of the government in the First Plan was to pave the way for investment in the Second Plan in the private sector, and the government intends to bring about increased investor confidence by supporting domestic investments.
