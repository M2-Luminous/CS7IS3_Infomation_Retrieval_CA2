A new government, whatever its composition, offers a new opportunity for a dialogue, which we have always encouraged," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said in Turin on Sunday [20 March]. Jeszenszky, who attended a series of events marking the death centenary of 1848-49 Hungarian freedom fight leader Lajos Kossuth (1802-1894, died in Turin), spoke to MTI about Hungarian-Slovak links after the Bratislava government crisis, and the future of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. "When Hungary congratulated the newly-independent Slovakia, it stressed that the good wishes are also for the ethnic Hungarians living there. We feel reconciliation between Slovakia and Hungary is possible, but only if preceded by a compromise between Hungarians and Slovaks in Slovakia," Jeszenszky said. He recalled his repeated negotiations with the new Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, who was then foreign minister, on the minority problem. "I hope that the new Slovak Government will strive to create friendship between the two countries and their peoples in keeping with its original program, instead of fabricating artificial enemy pictures and enemies," the foreign minister added. Regarding Saturday's rock concerts held in several large towns of the world at the call of Sarajevo Radio to protest against the raising of a new "wall" in the Bosnian capital, Jeszenszky -- who visited Sarajevo early this week -- pointed out: "Everything possible should be done to prevent repetition of the Berlin Wall, and to promote unification of still divided towns in Europe and elsewhere. Administrative borders must be freely crossable: They can separate certain communities, but they must not separate the people.
