The announcement that a commission is to be named to appoint other members of the court has, however, been greeted with caution. The legal organization [not further specified] says the appointment of Mr. Chaskalson, a respected senior advocate from Johannesburg, is a blessing, and the commission represents a fine legal balance which will guarantee the appointment of independent members of the constitutional court. The National Party has welcomed the appointment of Mr. Chaskalson, but has pointed out that nine of the 13 members of the commission are ANC sympathizers. The Democratic Party has also welcomed it, but also pointed out hat Mr. Chaskalson had close links with the ANC.
