He made the statement when meeting with a delegation from the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), headed by its secretary- general, Kubo Wataru, here today. Jiang, who is also China's president, said: "I have met with leaders of your party many times in Beijing and Tokyo," adding that constant contacts between leaders of the two parties are important for enhancing understanding and friendship. He hoped the SDPJ can further bilateral relations. Jiang noted that the development of good-neighborly relations and cooperation was not only in the interests of the two peoples but also beneficial to peace and development in Asia and the world, and so the two countries should further develop such relations. Jiang spoke highly of the SDPJ's efforts during the past years to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that the SDPJ had made important contributions to the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the healthy development of bilateral relations. Wataru said that his party attaches great importance to the ties with China, and the treatment of history is a big issue in bilateral relations, adding: "We have all along advocated that Japan should take a road of peaceful development, and maintain and promote friendship between the two countries." He said that the main purpose of their current China visit was, through celebrating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of relations between the SDPJ and CPC, to further bilateral friendly relations. Jiang said that not long ago, there were inharmonious tones in Sino-Japanese relations, which was denying history and against the will of the two peoples, and should be condemned. He continued that only rightful treatment of the past and advocacy of Sino-Japanese friendship could make the two peoples maintain friendship from generation to generation. Wataru said that the SDPJ, in power or out of power, would continue to conduct friendly exchanges with the CPC and the Chinese people, so as to make efforts for peace and development in Asia and the world. Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, was present at the meeting.
