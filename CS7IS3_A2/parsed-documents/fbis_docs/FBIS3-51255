The airplanes began flying at low altitudes over the cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena at approximately 0900 (1400 GMT) and after noon they were still flying. Up until late afternoon no Colombian authority had reported any reasons for the flights, which caused concern among residents of these Caribbean cities, which are visited by large numbers of tourists. Unofficial sources have informed DPA that within the next few hours the government of Cesar Gaviria will release an official statement explaining the presence of the airplanes in Colombia's air space. It seems as if the airplanes are conducting routine flights between several bases, within the framework of agreements signed between Colombia and the United States to wage war on drug-trafficking gangs. This situation has emerged at a time when Colombia is facing a huge controversy over the presence of U.S. troops who are working on various fronts. The most controversial case has been reported in the western town of Juanchaco, where U.S. troops are building a school, health center, and highway, to which several political sectors are opposed. Detractors say the foreign troops are taking advantage of their stay in Colombia to conduct intelligence tasks and other unclear activities that violate Colombia's sovereignty. Gaviria's government has insisted that the U.S. aid is legal and a noble gesture, because the projects they are carrying out are for the benefit of the country's poor sectors.
