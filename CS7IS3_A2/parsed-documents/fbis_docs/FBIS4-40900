And this means that in the remaining six to eight weeks every necessity, from tacks to fuel, will have to be brought to the northern garrisons of the Transbaykal Military District. The lion's share of freight for the "God-forsaken" polar region is conveyed by ship along the Lena river. The waterway is virtually the only route into these regions. At the very least, it is the cheapest. "A great deal of work rests on the servicemen's shoulders. We will have to ship around 55,000 tonnes of fuel and lubricants, over 2,000 tonnes of food, personal equipment, medicines, and much much more. In all, this represents 60,000 tonnes of cargo," Colonel General Valeriy Tretyakov, commander of the Transbaykal Military District, told me in conversation. "On top of all that, the river workers have sprung an unpleasant `surprise' -- prices for conveying cargoes have shot up." But although they have managed somehow to cope with the transportation payments -- Moscow allocated some money -- the fact is that everyday welfare problems are somewhat more pressing. It is no secret to anybody that Northerners are abandoning their local areas and moving away. They are moving to the former Union republics and to the richer cities. Their actions are understandable. The wage, for instance, of a kindergarten teacher stands at 150,000 rubles. Officers' and ensigns' pay is just 50,000 rubles more than for their colleagues in other regions. Priority provision of consumer goods is a thing of the past. Food products and fruit and vegetables are two or three times more expensive than "on the mainland." Add to this the climatic conditions.... There is a dire shortage of experienced specialists and highly skilled workers readying the garrisons of the Far North for the long winter. A similar picture can be seen in the troop collectives. Things are particularly difficult when it comes to filling jobs for enlisted men and NCO's. Every draftee tries by hook or by crook to serve just that bit closer to home. The soldiers who remain are those from among the handful of Arctic peoples. But they are too few in number to "plug the gaps" in personnel numbers. The conditions being generated by the military leadership should also be mentioned. Among the most important is the reduction in the number of small garrisons lost in the tundra or deep in the taiga. An agreement has been reached with welders and workers in other trades from Belorussia [Belarus]. They will be traveling to Yakutia soon to help prepare the military camps for the winter. Officers from all the district rear services in the okrug and the people responsible for shipping military freight along the "lifeline" route are out working on the spot. ...The shipping season looks set to be difficult. But it is better for the shipping to season to be hard than the forthcoming winter.
