Our correspondent, Aleksandr Karpov, interviews a member of the Tajik delegation at this meeting -- Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in the CIS. [Karpov] Why did the negotiations process on the Tajik problem begin with, of all things, the opposition meeting with the Russian political leadership? [Latifi] It is our deep conviction that negotiations with current Tajik authorities are impossible without first discussing the Russian factor. Russia, which alternately supported either one or the other side in the confrontation, found itself moving willy-nilly, directly involved in this conflict. Today, the official regime in Tajikistan is holding up only because of the presence of the Russian army, which in its actions transcends the boundaries of peacekeeping tasks and constantly interferes in the internal affairs of a sovereign independent state. This has been acknowledged by international experts, Russian analysts, and the Russian press. One of the important results of the meeting in Teheran is the general understanding that peacekeeping forces in our Republic may even be represented by Russia's 201st motorized rifle division, but on the condition that it will be authorized by the United Nations. [Karpov] Opposition leaders' statements at various times often mentioned Russia's special geopolitical interests in Tajikistan. What specifically do they have in mind? [Latifi] The economy; it is the uranium industry in Leninabad Oblast. Do not forget that the first Soviet atomic bomb was built using uranium ore mined around the city of Chkalovsk. Many among our enterprises also have direct ties with plants and factories in the Russian Federation. In the political sphere, Tajikistan has always been and remains a gate to the East for Russia; Russian positions in Iran, Afghanistan, and India depend to a considerable extent on relations with Tajikistan. Anyway, how can one discard ties that go back more than 200 years? [Karpov] For a long time, Tajikistan's official authorities kept saying that they could not sit down at the negotiating table with the opposition, whose "hands are in blood up to the elbows." The opposition, in turn, maintained that they have nothing to discuss with a puppet government... [Latifi] Most such mutual accusations are a thing of the past. During his latest trip to Tashkent, Emomali Rakhmonov said that he is willing to sit down at the negotiating table with any official representative of the opposition forces regardless of his political views. As to blood on the opposition's hands, I want to remind that opposition in Tajikistan had never been in power. Right now, however, the important point is that there is an opportunity to reach a sensible solution, in which there should be no place for ambitions. [Karpov] Criminal proceedings, which are investigated by the Republic procuracy, have been initiated against many opposition leaders in Tajikistan... [Latifi] One of the terms of truce is that all these proceedings will be terminated. [Karpov] Probably the first round of negotiations between the opposition and the representatives of Tajikistan's official authorities will take place soon. What proposals will the opposition forces leaders bring to this meeting? [Latifi] Tajikistan's authorities more or less control the situation in Dushanbe, but certainly not in the republic as a whole. Therefore, a period of transition to stabilization must be defined. During this time, in our opinion, a state council of national accord should be set up, which will be comprised of new, absolutely neutral people. Over the period of two or three years they will have to make a tremendous effort to return all refugees to the Motherland (about a million people); conduct a population census; disarm all -- both opposition and government -- illegal armed formations, and only then draft and adopt a new national constitution and conduct elections to the supreme bodies of authority. The opposition does not thirst for power. All we want is national accord.
