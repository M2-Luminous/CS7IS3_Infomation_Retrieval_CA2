It went into high gear following its second plenary session in the middle of December after the British Hong Kong authorities decided to submit an electoral bill to the Legislative Council there. So far, all the five specialized groups under the preliminary working committee have fulfilled their work plans and will get down to substantial work early next month. Starting January 5, 1994, the five specialized groups of the working committee, namely the groups on political affairs, economy, law, culture, and society and security, will hold their meetings in Beijing to discuss concrete problems, and make suggestions and proposals.

Financial issues such as the handing over and administration of land funds, and the issue of social insurance for retired workers will also be discussed. Priority will be given to the issue of the new airport. The group on political affairs will focus its discussion on the principles for the formation of the first Legislative Council and district boards in Hong Kong.
