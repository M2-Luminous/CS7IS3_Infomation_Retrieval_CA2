It is the fourth government since multiparty politics was instituted in the country in 1990. [passage omitted] Concerning this cabinet, let me add that Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane, the man appointed minister of state control and parastatal reforms, has turned down his appointment. He has declined Casmir Oye-Mba's offer. What are the reasons for this turndown? Jean- Francois Ntoutoume Emane spoke a short while ago with Raphael Mbadinga. As you will hear him pointing out, his rejection of the post was not a last minute one. He disclosed his stand to the head of government on 31 March, adding that he was not consulted before the appointment. Here is Jean-Francois Ntoutoume Emane. [Begin Emane recording] I am not an opposition figure. I am in the presidential majority. I am and will remain a member of the Gabonese Democratic Party. You are fully aware of developments in my constituency. I (?proved my worth) by barring the way to Father Paul Mba Abessole of the National Lumberjacks Rally in the 1991 parliamentary elections. I did the same at the last presidential elections in which my constituency gave the president 15,900 votes, a score second only to what he obtained in Haut-Ogooue Province. I believe if they wanted me to return to the government, they should have consulted me first. Thereafter, proposals could have been made to me and I should have been given time to consider those proposals. Concerning the idea of making me minister of state control, let me state, first, that I am against the regionalization and tribalization of ministerial appointments. For some time now, the state control portfolio has been held by indigenes of the Estuaire Province. While offering me the state control portfolio they have taken away its substance by transferring the parastatals and privatization portfolios elsewhere. They rather tagged me with the decentralization portfolio. From the intellectual standpoint, I would have loved to handle that department but while entrusting decentralization to me they assigned the local government portfolio to someone else. How can you talk about decentralization or promoting a decentralization policy without enjoying the [words indistinct] and without a base, which local government areas precisely happen to be? It means I would find myself constantly at loggerheads with the minister responsible for local government areas. I was assigned the territorial development portfolio but one cannot talk of territorial development or promote territorial development without a base. They added regional integration to my tasks but given the present state of the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa where [words indistinct] have not been paid for the past two years, given the difficulties facing the Economic Community of Central African States. The point is not that I am against the composition of the government but as a Gabonese, I wish all the same that a smaller government had been formed during this time of crisis. I was a minister for a long time. For me, it is not a [word indistinct] to enter the cabinet. Let those who have never been ministers do so. As far as I am concerned, when one is a minister, one must be prepared to work but I cannot work in an inconducive atmosphere with poorly defined functions. I cannot head a ministry made up of knickknacks, namely a ministry that is haphazardly constituted. [end recording]
