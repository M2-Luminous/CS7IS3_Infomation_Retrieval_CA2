Greece gave some sign of observing that convention last week when it allowed the EU and NATO to adopt resolutions threatening air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. But on Tuesday [15 February] it threw presidentialism to the winds by banning The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] from using the Greek port of Thessaloniki, which had become its main lifeline since war and sanctions cut off access to the Adriatic. Such unilateral interference with the EU's external trade by a member state is of dubious legality, and should be challenged in the European Court of Justice. Politically, it is an affront to Greece's partners, which are unanimous in wanting to help Macedonia, and thoroughly misguided even from the point of view of Greek national interests -- as indeed Greek policy has been ever since Macedonia declared its independence two years ago. Greece insists on seeing the use by a neighbouring state of the name "Macedonia" and of symbols derived from ancient Macedon as a threat to its territorial integrity. Unlike Bulgaria (which has much better reason to feel unnerved by the emergence of a state whose national "language" is in fact a dialect of Bulgarian, spoken by a significant minority of the Bulgarian population), Greece has failed to see that the stabilisation of Macedonia is very much a Greek interest, since its collapse would bring the war of Yugoslav succession right up to Greece's borders. Such a collapse is by no means a purely theoretical danger. Macedonia has a large and discontented Albanian minority, so far represented within the coalition government but coming increasingly under radical leadership manipulated from the Albanian capital, Tirana, while threatened by the equally radical Macedonian nationalist opposition. A much smaller Serb minority had settled its grievances with the government last August, only to see its leader resign after a visit to Belgrade, whereupon a new leader (born in Serbia) repudiated the agreement and produced a new set of demands. Serbia's President Milosevic weeps crocodile tears over the dangers of Albanian separatism. "If such processes continue, I am afraid that there will be nothing for Greece to recognise," he told the Greek foreign minister last November. To resist such pressures, Macedonia badly needs political and economic support. In depriving it of its last main trade route, Mr Papandreou is pursuing domestic political advantage, at the risk of a wider Balkan war. His compatriots should realise, if he does not, that in so doing he adds to the intense irritation with Greece already felt by many of its EU partners. That can hardly be a wise policy for a country so heavily dependent on EU funds.
