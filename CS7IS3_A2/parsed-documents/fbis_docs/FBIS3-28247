Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence that he believes the coalition leaders merely "froze" the tax program "for political reasons," rather than having killed it with Friday's seven-party agreement. "I would only seek the same thing which I appealed to the public to accept, if I appeared again" in a televised news conference, Hosokawa said. In a predawn press conference Thursday, Hosokawa surprised the people and even members of his coalition partners with his announcement of the plan to create a 7 percent "National Welfare Tax," starting in April 1997. At Friday's press briefing, Hosokawa said the tax is necessary to finance a 10-year welfare program for the elderly, raise pensions in tandem with annual price rises, and redeem additional deficit- servicing bonds expected to be floated from fiscal 1994. The new tax, whose mechanism is virtually similar to that of the current 3 percent consumption tax, would be slapped on sales of most goods and services in Japan. Hosokawa cited budgetary estimates of expenditures to be financed by the tax, which were unveiled by the Finance Ministry on Thursday. Hosokawa said his tax program would fund an outlay of 800 billion yen to finance the welfare program, 1.3 trillion yen to cover an increase in government procurement-related spending as a result of the tax, as well as 1.4 trillion yen for redeeming additional deficit-servicing bonds. Under the overall tax plan of 9.5 trillion yen, these outlays would be tacked onto a total of 6 trillion yen in income and corporate tax cuts, of which national and local income tax would account for 5.3 trillion yen, he said. Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist and co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], told a news conference earlier Friday that the coalition parties "have reached the conclusion that they should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and implement a tax cut as they could not reconcile their differences over the plans." Ozawa, widely regarded as a main architect of the tax proposal, made the announcement after emerging from the meeting of coalition leaders. Hosokawa also told reporters the revenue-boosting measure is indispensable to enable his administration to compile the fiscal 1994 state budget. "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the state budget according to its original schedule," he said. Coalition officials said the leaders had to give up the tax program to avert a political crisis which was threatening to scuttle the coalition government. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest party in the alliance, threatened to quit the coalition unless Hosokawa abandoned the plan, which the SDP said would amount to a de facto more than doubling of the consumption tax.
