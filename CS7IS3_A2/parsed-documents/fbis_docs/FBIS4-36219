In a statement by the official spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Algeria welcomed the Yemeni Government's decision and expressed the hope that the Yemeni brothers would immediately begin a dialogue and lay the foundations of a just and permanent settlement to the conflict based on the protection of the Yemeni people's higher interests. The statement added that Algeria, in the words of head of state Liamine Zeroual, had repeatedly warned the Yemeni brothers of the great risks of the conflict to Yemen. The head of state had insistently indicated the need for dialogue and consultation to prevail in the confrontation, especially when he received the two special Yemeni envoys and in the greetings message that he sent to the leaders of that country on the occasion of the Yemeni national day. Within this context, Algeria renews its desire and readiness to offer its cooperation and that of the AMU [Arab Maghreb Union]--of which Algeria currently holds the presidency--with the aim of putting an end to this bloody struggle.
