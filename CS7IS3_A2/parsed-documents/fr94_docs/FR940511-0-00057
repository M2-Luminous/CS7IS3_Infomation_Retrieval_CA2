FR940511-0-00057 FR940511-0-00015 Response: NOAA has amended the regulation by adding ``as authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, as amended, (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq. , the Endangered Species Act, as amended, (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. , and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, as amended, (MBTA), 16 U.S.C. 703 et seq. *␣*␣*.'' The inclusion of ``as authorized or permitted'' is viewed by NOAA as redundant. Issue: Sanctuary Administration Regulations/Permits Comment: NOAA should use economic incentives rather than regulations to ensure that activities do not impact resources. Response: NOAA does not have sufficient authority to provide economic incentives to ensure that activities do not impact Sanctuary resources. Even regulations, which include economic disincentives such as monetary penalties, are not sufficient to ensure that any activity does not impact resources. Comment: Clarify the statement: ``When a conflict with a sanctuary regulation related to specific [non-sanctuary] regulations occurs, the one more protective of sanctuary resources will prevail.'' NOAA regulations should not override those of the local jurisdictions. NOAA needs to clarify: (1) The application of this policy to fishing; (2) Types of conflicts the statement applies to; (3) Who determines whether a conflict exists; and (4) The process for resolving a conflict. Response: NOAA agrees that the statement as written in the DEIS/MP is unclear. Accordingly, the statement has been deleted in the FEIS/MP. Essentially, the statement meant that if two regulations exist covering an activity in the Sanctuary, one promulgated by NOAA under the MPRSA authority and the other by another agency under a different statute, compliance with the less restrictive regulation will not relieve the obligation to comply with the other more restrictive one. Comment: NOAA should follow the guidelines of NEPA when proposing any change in regulations that are listed in the scope of regulations. This is especially applicable to vessel traffic and discharge regulations. Also, clarification is needed on the rulemaking and amendment processes. Response: Listing activities in the scope of regulation reflects that the issues and alternatives were addressed in the FEIS/MP, public hearings were held, and public comments were solicited regarding the activities. If NOAA later proposes the regulation of an activity listed in the scope of regulations in the Designation Document but not regulated at the time of Sanctuary designation, NOAA will request public comments on the proposal. When NOAA plans to amend a rule that has been promulgated, an analysis of the issues, affected environment, alternatives and consequences will be completed and public comments solicited. NOAA will then modify the proposal if necessary and respond to public comments when taking the final action. Comment: A procedure must be established to disagree with management and issue an appeal if permits to conduct research are denied. Response: Section 925.12 of the Sanctuary regulations set forth the procedures for appealing denials of Sanctuary permits. The appeal process involves a written statement by the appellant to the Assistant Administrator of NOAA. The Assistant Administrator may conduct a hearing on the appeal. Comment: Clarify the procedure for obtaining permits for low-flying aircraft engaged in ongoing species monitoring studies and damage assessment studies in response to an incident such as an oil spill. Activities authorized by the NMFS and USFWS should not require a Sanctuary permit because the requirements for permits would be duplicative. Response: All flights engaged in monitoring or research activities that fly below 2,000 feet are required to obtain a Sanctuary permit, or, if the activity is already pursuant to a permit, to have that permit certified. Permits are not required for overflights necessary to respond to emergencies threatening life, property or the environment. Comment: NOAA should not grandfather existing uses if otherwise prohibited by sanctuary regulations. Response: Section 304(c)(1)(B) of the MPRSA specifies that NOAA may not terminate any valid lease, permit, license, or right of subsistence use or of access, if the lease, permit, license, or right ``is in existence on the date of designation of any national marine sanctuary *␣*␣*.'' Comment: Treaty secured rights should not require sanctuary certification. Further, NOAA should obligate federal regulators to consider and protect tribal interests when issuing permits which may affect those interests.
