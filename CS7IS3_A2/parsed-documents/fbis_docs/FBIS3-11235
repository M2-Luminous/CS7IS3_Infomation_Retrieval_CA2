The poll watchers have been appointed specifically to observe the vote count and even vouch for its authenticity with their signature, if required. I repeat: Poll watchers cannot be removed from voting sites. This is a tremendous mistake that may result in any party that may suffer from this filing an appeal for annulment. This is taking place in the Republica de Brasil School and the Manuel Jose Arce Institute. They have even gone as far as to try to expel the press from those premises.
