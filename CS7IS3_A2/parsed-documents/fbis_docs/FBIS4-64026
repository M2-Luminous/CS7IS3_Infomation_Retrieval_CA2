According to the CHECHENPRESS news agency, Chechnya has put its troops on alert, the cabinet of ministers will be working in accordance with a "military" schedule for one week. Members of the cabinet came to a today's meeting in a military uniform. The spreading of the zone under state of emergency to a part of the Sunzha and Malgabek districts in Ingushetia is regarded by the official Groznyy as an "act of open armed aggression", the Chechen department of press and information told ITAR-TASS. Political observers in Groznyy believe that the initiative of the temporary administration on the expansion of the zone under state of emergency in Ingushetia may disrupt a planned meeting between Dzhokhar Dudayev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. CHECHENPRESS reports that the official authorities of Nazran believe that an attempt to impose state of emergency in the Malgabek and Sunzha districts in Ingushetia may destabilise the situation in north Caucasus. At the same time the draft decree on the prolongation of state of emergency for another term was agreed with Ingush President Ruslan Aushev, head of the temporary administration in Moscow Vladimir Lozovoy told ITAR-TASS. This decree really envisages the need to ensure normal work conditions for the forces attached to the temporary administration in some populated localities in the Sunzha and Malgabek districts of Ingushetia. This measure became necessary because a number of provocations took place exactly in those areas, and the presence of the Chechen police was reported there. Vladimir Lozovoy has no information about an official reaction of the Chechen leadership to the draft decree. The decree has not yet been adopted and therefore it is not worth commenting on this decree before it is issued, the head of the temporary administration pointed out.
