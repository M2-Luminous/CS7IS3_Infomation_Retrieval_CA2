FBIS4-8261 "dreeu070__a94029" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Havel Refuses Interviews With News Agencies Havel Refuses Interviews With News Agencies AU0904154894 Prague CTK in English 1841 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0904154894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] London/Prague, April 8 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel will avoid interviews with news agencies because his office cannot check the published text, presidential spokesman Ladislav Spacek told Reuters today. "We have to control in which way, in which shape, it (the text of the interview) will be published," Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek told Reuters. "I think it is good for us to be sure that nobody can take just a part of the text and publish it in convenient context." Reacting to this, Reuters wrote that under the communist regime Havel had worked in the executive committee of the Czech Pen Club, "a writers' organization which campaigned for freedom to publish without government intervention." According to Spacek, Havel stated he would refuse all requests for interviews, including that from Reuters, before the forthcoming meeting of the presidents of the Central European countries in Litomysl, East Bohemia, to take place on April 15-16. Spacek said that Havel was "dismayed" by the published versions of several recent interviews he had had with local press. Havel will not give any interviews to any news agency in the future, Spacek announced. "You know our press. Sometimes we must be more careful than in the Western democracies where the press is on a higher level of responsibility," Spacek said. "It's not very convenient for us to see some quotation or cutting without any context which we can't prerequisite or check beforehand." Spacek gave a similar answer to the Czech News Agency (CTK) when it requested an interview with Havel last week. "We cannot approve the form of information in which it reaches the reader. What matters in every case is also the context in which the report appears in the media, and the statement which is selected. These are the risks because of which we have not granted an interview to CTK since the president has assumed office (in January 1994)," Spacek told CTK, adding that "we can still leave the question open." CTK has requested the presidents of other Central European states to grant it an interview before the Litomysl meeting. Some press offices answered in the affirmative or turned the request down, saying the head of state was busy.
