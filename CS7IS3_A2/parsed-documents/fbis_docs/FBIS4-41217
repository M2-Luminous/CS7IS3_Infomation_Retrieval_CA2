He underlined that a month ago during a meeting between the president and the Liberal Democratic Union of December 12 deputy group of the State Duma, Deputy Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his attitude towards possible prolonging of the parliament's term in office. In Satarov's words, Yeltsin answered that he does not oppose this "in the case that the State Duma and Federation Council work efficiently." Satarov also underlined that "this idea was discussed in professional circles long ago." When asked by Khakamada what is Yeltsin's attitude towards prolongation of his term in office, the latter said: "Do not touch upon the 1996 elections." At the same time Satarov indicated that he would not interpret these words, he is just repeating them. As Satarov said, if the idea of extension of the terms in office prevails then the appropriate change to the acting Constitution will have to be adopted by a referendum. However, the issue on a referendum is still open until the State Duma and Federation Council adopts a decree on referendums.
