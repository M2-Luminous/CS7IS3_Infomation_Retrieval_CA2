Advisers present at today's talk held an optimistic view on Hong Kong's economic prospects. They believe that Hong Kong's economic prosperity is based on the sustained, steady [wen ding 4489 1353], and rapid economic development of mainland China and also on China's policy of reform and opening up. Although the British side refuses to cooperate with the Chinese side on the issue of Hong Kong, as long as China persistently expands opening up, deepens reform, and brings further growth to its economic development, Hong Kong's economic prosperity is guaranteed. However, this does not mean that there are no hidden worries for Hong Kong's economy. The advisers pointed out during the talk that besides the possibility that the British side might deliberately damage Hong Kong's economy, the biggest hidden worry for Hong Kong's economy is inflation. They pointed out that inflation is weakening Hong Kong's competitive capacity with each passing day, and the livelihood of the common people has been considerably affected. However, instead of taking steps to ease inflation, the British Hong Kong Government is spending without restraint and putting forward a number of measures which will result in spiralling inflation. The Chinese and Hong Kong citizens should pay great attention to this fact and the Preliminary Working Committee should study this issue and draw up countermeasures. During the talk, advisers focused their discussions on the White Paper concerning the regulations for the Airport Corporation, which was recently released by the Hong Kong Government. They shared the same view that the regulations are not strong enough to supervise the operation of the Airport Corporation. The company is placed totally beyond the supervision of the public and only the governor and the Executive Council have the right to oversee its operations. In addition, the power of chairman of the board of directors and the executive director of the Airport Corporation are concentrated in one person and the Airport Corporation itself has no right to dismiss its managing director; as a result, the supervision by the board of directors is but an empty shell and people really feel worried that the Airport Corporation may become an "independent fiefdom." Some Hong Kong affairs advisers even questioned whether or not it is appropriate for the Hong Kong Government to change the Provisional Airport Authority into the Airport Corporation before China and Britain have reached an agreement on the financial arrangements for the new airport. They also wonder if the relevant suggestion has violated the spirit of the Memorandum of Understanding on the building of Hong Kong's airport reached between China and Britain. Advisers expressed worries over the financial arrangements for the new airport, which remains unsettled to this day. They pointed out that the consensus of all sides is that Hong Kong needs a new airport and the Chinese have always shown support for the idea. The problem we are facing now is how to urge the British side to produce, in line with the spirit of the Memorandum of Understanding, a financial arrangement which conforms to the principle of cost efficiency so that the airport project can be developed in a comprehensive way as soon as possible. A total of 16 Hong Kong affairs advisers were present at today's talks: Ann Tse-kai, Tsui Tsin-tong, Tsao Kuang-piao, Cheng Yu-tung, Lee Peng-fei, Kuo Ping-hsiang, Hsieh Kuo-min, Tang Hsiang-chien, Kuo Ho-nien, Chan Wen-chiu, Hu Ching-chang, Hsu Shih-hsiung, Wu Ching- hui, Chang Yung-chen, Huang Chih-hsiang, and Yuen Pei-yao.
