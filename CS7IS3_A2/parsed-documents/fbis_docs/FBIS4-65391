Cindoruk, speaking during a meeting with Atun, said Turkey supports a solution on the Cyprus issue but it should not be one-sided and forcible. Atun said that the TRNC parliament has no intention of making concessions on the Cyprus issue adding that the Turkish parliament always supported the TRNC and called the recent UN proposals `unacceptable.' He said the UN-proposed confidence-building measures failed to create a secure atmosphere. `The package was an instrument to seize land from TRNC,' he said. Atun said although they made changes in the confidence-building measures to satisfy Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis, Turkey still continues its goodwill to mend the situation.
