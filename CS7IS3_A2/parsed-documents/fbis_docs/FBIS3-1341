Speaking after a National Party [NP] meeting in Lowryville, in the Northern Cape town of Colesberg, he said SAP Commissioner Johan van der Merwe was negotiating with the generals over their suspension from the force and was keeping the minister informed. "I will evaluate the decision and if I don't agree with it I will bring into play certain powers available to me," he said, without giving any details. Mr Kriel said he had not met President F.W. de Klerk on Thursday, as had been reported on national radio. He said he personally had no reason to resign as he was in no way involved in the violence. "I am a man of peace." He told the meeting of about 250 enthusiastic supporters that the NP wanted to help the poor and to assist people in acquiring houses. His speech was characterised by attacks on the African National Congress, which he said was a violent party that forced children and teachers out of schools with boycotts and strikes. He told people to stand up against intimidation and not to participate in violence, and to vote against what he called the ANC's "impractical plans for the future". Mr Kriel was asked by an ANC supporter why his party was now wooing the coloured vote when it had removed coloureds from the voters role shortly after it came to power in 1948. He responded quickly by admitting that the NP had made a mistake which had now been rectified.
