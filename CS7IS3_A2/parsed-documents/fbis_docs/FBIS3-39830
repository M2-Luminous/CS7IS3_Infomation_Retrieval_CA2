On board the aircraft carrier Foch, which is patrolling the Adriatic and where he spent the previous night, Defense Minister Leotard attended the arrival on Sunday, 20 February in Istrana -- a base located 60 km northeast of Vicence (Italy) -- of six French Mirage 2000-D aircraft for low altitude all-weather attack. These aircraft belong to the 3d squadron at Nancy and have been in service for less than a year. This is the first time that such aircraft have left French territory. They will reinforce NATO's allied surveillance and intervention force over Bosnia. Originally, the Mirage 2000-D was not scheduled to join the armada of French fighter aircraft to be used in the air fleet placed under NATO command for carrying out UN missions. At the Cervia base, some 200 km south of Venice, France already maintains eight Jaguar attack planes, which are not all-weather aircraft; 10 Mirage 2000-C air defense interceptors; five Mirage F1-CR reconnaissance planes; and five Mirage F1-CT ground support aircraft. All in all, the allies currently have some 210 fighter aircraft, 76 of which are American, in Italy and the Adriatic. Mirage 2000-D's were kept in reserve in the south of France. Late last week the decision was made to have them fly out of their base in Istres (Bouches-du-Rhone) to have them land in front of Mr. Leotard in Istrana, before stationing them permanently in Cervia, which is just a 45-minute flight from Sarajevo. Like the latest American aircraft -- the F-15, eight of which are based in Aviano -- the Mirage 2000-D is able to navigate and accurately fire ammunition (to within 10 or 100 meters, depending on the coordinates it receives) in all types of weather, night or day, whether conventional or laser-guided (Footnote 1) (Very low-altitude firing, which is done via visual identification of the target, requires the presence on the ground of guidance officers who help the aircraft's crew adjust firing. Atmospheric conditions (low clouds, overcast, snow) and rough terrain can cause momentary difficulty.). With its newly arrived Mirage 2000-D, France has now deployed some 68 airplanes and helicopters, including the 18 Super-Etendard attack helicopters on board the Foch. Infrared Spy Cameras The arrival in Italy of the Mirage 2000-D's is not the only indicator of the increase in French military power to the benefit, either directly or indirectly, to UN troops in Bosnia. There are others, which are more discreet but no less real. Thus, it is expected that 12 new Sagaie tanks fitted with 90-mm guns will bolster the 18 already present in Sarajevo and placed by France under the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] colors. Similarly, there is talk of bringing 10 French Gazelle and Puma helicopters to the Bosnian capital, which have long been based in Split (Croatia). These helicopters are equipped with infrared cameras and should play an important role in reconnoitering the location of batteries and the movements of units around Sarajevo. Lastly, since Friday, 18 February the French have had two Cymbeline radar tracking units -- like the British, who have three -- which make it possible to track the path of a shell from where it was fired and identify who fired it. The Americans, who are refraining from risking the lives of any GI's on the ground, will not put these radars into service so as not to expose their operators. The French reinforcement does not mean, however, that extra UN troops will be deployed in Sarajevo. If there were to be any, they would be taken from the French contingents in Bihac and Croatia.
