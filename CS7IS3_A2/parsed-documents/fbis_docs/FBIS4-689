The Appeal Tribunal sat on Wednesday after the ANC appealed against a decision of an electoral tribunal in Dzanani, Venda, on March 30 at which a formal warning and fine of R100,000 [rands], suspended for four months, was imposed on the ANC. At the time, the tribunal found that ANC members were responsible for disrupting a National Party meeting at the Makhado shopping complex in Dzanani earlier in March and had prevented the meeting from taking place. The ANC was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.
