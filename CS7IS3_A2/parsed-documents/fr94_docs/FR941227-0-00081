FR941227-0-00081 FR941227-0-00015 Two comments received during the pilot program were in favor of the regulations and suggested that the NOV option be broadened to include other Coast Guard programs. The NOV option can be used by other Coast Guard programs that use the civil penalty process. Any program that implements use of the NOV option will do so by internal policy with prior notification to the public in the Federal Register . Three comments were in favor of the alternative process but suggested different penalty amounts for small oil spills and pollution prevention regulation violations. The penalty amounts specified for small oil spills and pollution prevention regulation violations used during the pilot program were based on current Commandant's policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties. These penalty amounts are reviewed regularly to ensure that they reflect a fair and equitable enforcement policy. The pilot program results indicated that the current small oil spill penalties were appropriate. However, the Coast Guard has revised some penalties for pollution prevention violations. Results of the pilot program indicated that using the same penalty amounts for pollution prevention violations as those specified in the current Commandant's policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties provided no incentive to accept an NOV. To encourage acceptance of the NOV, pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or less under the Commandant's civil penalty guidelines will be proposed on an NOV at 75% of the amount listed for the specific offense. Pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or more under the Commandant's civil penalty guidelines are no longer eligible for issuance of an NOV and will be sent to the Hearing Officer for a determination. The NOV option will be closely monitored to determine if additional spill categories or different penalties are needed in the future. Two comments asked that the determination of first offense be based on the record of each platform or vessel, not the company as a whole. The Coast Guard agrees that for purposes of NOV issuance each platform, vessel, or unit should be treated separately when determining whether or not it is a first offense for the purpose of assessing penalties. This is reflected in the NOV implementation guidance. One comment indicated that Coast Guard petty officers do not have the experience to make a judgment as to when to issue a NOV and that any assessment should only be made after review by a higher ranking authority. The Coast Guard disagrees. Coast Guard Petty Officers selected as issuing officers are trained professionals who have demonstrated knowledge and ability in their field. Before any Petty Officer investigates a violation and issues a NOV, he or she is first given proper instruction and is determined to be qualified by his or her command. Issuing officers, however, have no discretion in assessing penalty amounts. If an NOV is issued, the penalty amount is taken directly from the implementing guidance. If the offense does not meet specific criteria in the guidance, an NOV cannot be issued. One comment stated that a party should be given the right to be heard prior to the issuance of a NOV. The Coast Guard disagrees. A party is not entitled to a hearing prior to initiation of civil penalty action. Under Coast Guard procedures, the ``initiation of civil penalty action'' occurs with the Letter of Notification from a Hearing Officer, or in some cases with the NOV. The NOV does not take away any rights a party has to a hearing. The NOV procedure is voluntary, and the recipient of an NOV may opt to have the case processed under ordinary procedures which include the right to a hearing before disposition on the case. Three comments expressed general confusion over how the NOV option will work and concern about the protection of rights for a party issued an NOV. The NOV is an opportunity to use an optional procedure for processing civil penalty cases. It may be declined by a party. The NOV form states that a party may decline the NOV, which will immediately result in a violation case being forwarded through the appropriate district to a Hearing Officer for determination. The form also states that taking no action on the NOV has the same result as declining the NOV. A ``no action'' response will, however, delay the referral of the case to the District for review because the 45-day from issuance period must elapse before the Coast Guard begins processing the case under normal procedures. A change has been made to ยง1.07&hyph;11(b)(6) to reflect this procedure.
