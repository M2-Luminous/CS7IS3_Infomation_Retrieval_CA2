FR940405-1-00023 FR940405-1-00007 Discussion The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes that are equipped with certain Dowty Aerospace main undercarriage units. The RLD advises that cracking has been found in the fitting subassemblies of the main landing gear (MLG). In three of these instances, the cracking had penetrated completely through the fitting subassemblies from the side stay attachment lug to the main bore, which resulted in loss of damping fluid. In another incident, cracking was found in the web section that is adjacent to the inner attachment bores of the side stay of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. Investigation into the cause of this cracking revealed that damage to the anodic film resulted in corrosion of these subassemblies. Cracking in the fitting subassemblies of the MLG, if not corrected, could result in damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the MLG. Fokker has issued Service Bulletin F28/32&hyph;149, dated August 30, 1991, that describes procedures for an eddy current inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA) 91&hyph;080, Issue 2, dated February 21, 1992, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. Additionally, Dowty Aerospace Gloucester, which is the manufacturer of the main undercarriage units installed on these airplanes, has issued Service Bulletin 32&hyph;161R, Revision 2, dated January 7, 1992, that describes procedures for replacement of any cracked subassembly with a new subassembly, or a serviceable subassembly that has been identified previously with service bulletin number ``32&hyph;161R'' on its nameplate. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 023&hyph;06&hyph;91 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these aviation products in the United Kingdom. The Fokker service bulletin references this Dowty Aerospace Gloucester service bulletin. This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an eddy current inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the Fokker service bulletin described previously. This proposal would also require replacement of any cracked fittings with new or serviceable fittings in accordance with the Dowty Aerospace Gloucester service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,340, or $770 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Fokker: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;205&hyph;AD.
