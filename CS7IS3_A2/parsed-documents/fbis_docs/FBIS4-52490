Three new staff, one officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and two local employees, will be added to the 31-strong staff at the consulate, Evans said. Evans said trade and tourism between Osaka and the vicinity, and Australia will expand following the opening of New Kansai International Airport later this year. "Freeing up those officers who are currently dealing in consular and administrative work will enable them to do more analysis and commerce related work, and liaise more with authorities in Osaka," a department spokesman said. "While Australia's emphasis is on boosting links with all of Asia, we are not forgetting our traditional friends and marketplace in Japan," he said.
