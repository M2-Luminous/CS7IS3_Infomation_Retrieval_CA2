Since 1989, Sweden has imported about 45 percent of its uranium from Russia at below market prices. According to EU quotas, however, each member may only purchase 20 percent of its annual uranium supply from Russia. Because its use of nuclear energy fluctuates depending on the supply of hydropower, Sweden has been granted concessions allowing it flexibility in determining its annual uranium supply.
