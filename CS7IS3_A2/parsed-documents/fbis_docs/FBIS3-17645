This is said in a statement released by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's press-service on March 24. The statement notes that "Crimeans must be drafted, Ukrainian troops be deployed, and servicemen be trained in line with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry procedures and in the interests of Ukraine's defence potential." "Pressure by President Yuriy Meshkov on the Crimean Army Commander and open threats are inadmissible," the statement notes. According to a decree earlier signed by Meshkov, Crimean citizens will be drafted for service exclusively on the territory of the peninsula.
