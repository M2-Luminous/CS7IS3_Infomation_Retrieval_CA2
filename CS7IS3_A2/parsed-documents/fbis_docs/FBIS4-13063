FBIS4-13063 "drnes074dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas `Ready To Reexamine' `Policy,' Notes Conditions Hamas `Ready To Reexamine' `Policy,' Notes Conditions JN1704094194 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 17 Apr 94 p 25 JN1704094194 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Text] Gaza/London--Quds Press and news agencies--The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has lauded the Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion, and stressed that it will maintain this genuine historic cohesion. In a statement issued by its military wing, known as 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, and distributed in Gaza City yesterday, Hamas warned the Israeli Government against expanding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict following its claims against the Jordanian position. In an amazing step, Hamas said that it is ready to reexamine its policy of attacking Israeli military and civilian targets, on the condition that the Israeli prime minister, his army, and government completely stop killing unarmed Palestinians. It pointed out that the objective of the recent 'Afula and Hadera operations, which targeted a group of soldiers and settlers, and in which some civilians were injured, was to deter the Zionist aggression against our people, and legitimate revenge for the martyrs of the abhorrent Hebron massacre. However, in a statement issued by its political bureau yesterday, of which Quds Press received a copy, it said that this is not a constant policy by the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, but an extraordinary policy imposed by the Israeli enemy government. The statement added: We, in Hamas, as we have always said, we are not against the principle of peace, but the peace proposed by the enemy government is not peace, but an entrenchment of occupation. In a clear response to the Israeli criticism of Jordan, it said that the Movement reiterates its concern for the security and stability of all states where the movement's political and economic representatives reside, who operate in accordance with the recognized laws in these states. The movement is also concerned not to give the enemy any justification to exert pressure on any of these states. The statement said that any peace in the region must be based on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the removal of settlements, and the holding of free elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect our people's representatives and leadership. It added that the elected leadership is the one that will decide all the consequent steps and future of the cause. In a statement distributed in Gaza, Hamas stressed that its units "had abided by carrying out its operations within the known borders of Palestine. Our leadership was committed to planning and carrying out its operations only inside the occupied Palestinian territories." The statement added: "If the Israeli Government seeks to expand the arena of the conflict and decides to move against the Hamas Movement's officials or offices abroad, then it will consider this as the beginning of a war in which Israeli blood, interests, and gatherings of Jewish communities all over the globe will be legitimate [targets], and we will reply more harshly to any act of aggression." The statement emphasized: The "Israeli Government knows better than anyone that the Islamic Resistance Movement has long and strong arms in all the world states. We have thus far abided by the rules of the game in the conflict arena. However, If the Israeli Government violates the rules of the game, then this government and the Jewish people will be first to pay the price." The Hamas Movement called on its loyalists to declare a state of "mobilization and the highest degree of alertness."
