Longuet expressed deep concern over the U.S. Government's intervention in private-sector trade. Moreover, he stated that he would urge Japan to open markets in the public works and high-technology fields during his visit to Japan. With regard to voluntary export restraints on Japanese cars to the European Union (EU), he mentioned his intention to introduce regulations on the total number of Japanese cars, including cars produced within the EU area. Regarding the U.S. Government's reinstatement of the Super 301 provision, Longuet stressed: "It is a surprise to us to learn that the United States made a one-sided decision, which targets Japan, its largest trade partner, with the signing of GATT's Uruguay Round agreement near at hand." He said: "Such a method has already gone down in history." He then pointed out that long-term multilateral negotiations through such organizations as the World Trade Organization (WTO) are important for the sake of maintaining the trade balance. Citing the White House's announcement on the sale of private U.S. airplanes to Saudi Arabia, Longuet expressed his displeasure and said: "The United States has a strong tendency to politically intervene in private-sector trade." He added: "The country is trying to promote foreign trade while disregarding market economy rules." On economic relations with Japan, Longuet touched on the fact that France's trade deficit with Japan for 1993 decreased to 24 billion francs (a franc equals about 18 yen) from 30 billion francs the previous year. He expressed dissatisfaction, saying: "The main cause of the decrease is a drop in imports due to the economic recession in France." Longuet indicated that, to correct the trade imbalance, he would continue to urge Japan to open markets in the service fields, including high-technology products such as helicopters; public works; and the agricultural products field. He also stressed: "The main point at issue lies not in individual sectors but in Japan's structural trade surplus." Longuet expressed expectations for his visit to Japan, saying: "I believe that as the Japanese-U.S. relationship is now facing difficulty, this is a good opportunity for us to bring about a better understanding of Japan's claims to the United States and European nations." With regard to Japan's voluntary restraint of exporting automobiles to the EU, he pointed out: "The drop (in sales) of Japanese cars was small in 1993 compared with the drop in sales on the EU market as a whole." The minister stated that the French Government would ask Japan to set a goal for voluntary export restraints so that it can adjust the excess of exports for 1993 during the following two years -- 1994 and 1995. Exports of Japanese cars to the EU last year decreased by 20 percent from the previous year to reach 980,000 units, and the decrease was larger than the drop in sales on the European market (which registered a 16 percent decrease). For this reason, it is believed that he made the remarks taking into consideration the idea of introducing regulation on the total amount which includes locally-produced automobiles.
