Particularly in the past few days you and your government have been once more in the center of attention of Middle East diplomacy. What are the reasons for the optimism that Israel and the PLO will now achieve a breakthrough? [Mubarak] First of all, I would like to point out that the first courageous step that opened the door to an overall solution was made by President Al-Sadat. Without his courageous step we would not have achieved a solution and not even any contact between the parties to the conflict to this day. As far as the Gaza-Jericho agreement is concerned, a problem that has existed for 45 years, it is not easy to implement it within a week, or two or three months. The two sides are facing problems, but I am optimistic that they will reach agreement, although the problems will continue. Still, these problems will be overcome, because there is no alternative to negotiations. That is a fact. [Stenzel] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement has been delayed. Demilitarization had been put off before, now the two sides have agreed on 13 April. Do you think that this deadline can be kept? [Mubarak] The negotiations will be concluded swiftly. Whether it is the 13th or not is not a problem. The point is to conclude an agreement and start implementing it. There are differences of opinion between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In the declaration of principles it was mentioned that security remains in the hands of the Israelis -- at least until a final agreement is reached. Now the Palestinians want to carry out all checks on Palestinians coming to Gaza or Jericho themselves. Yet, the Israelis say that anybody passing through these checks could then go anywhere in Israel. Still, I think that this problem will be solved. [Stenzel] Mr. President, as there was no Camp David without Egypt, there will not be a new agreement without the Syrians. How close is Syria to being integrated in the peace process? So far, one had the impression that Syria was more or less hesitating. [Mubarak] No, Syria is not hesitating. I had several talks with President Al-Asad, with the Israelis but also with all other countries. I think, and I hope that the negotiations that are currently being held in Washington will yield a result in the immediate future. Syria is anxious to solve the problem and to sign a peace treaty, also with the inclusion of Jordan. [Stenzel] Will there be a summit meeting between President al-Asad and Prime Minister Rabin? [Mubarak] I think that, initially, al-Asad will not agree to such a meeting. Only after they achieve something will they meet -- certainly sometime in the future. The point is that the Syrians want an agreement. [Stenzel] And at what price? The return of the entire Golan Heights? Do you think that Israel will be prepared to agree to that? [Mubarak] Well, I cannot speak on behalf of Israel, but I can say that in order to reach a settlement with Syria, Golan must be returned. There may be certain conditions, such as a demilitarized zone, some multinational troops. This will not be the problem. [Stenzel] Mr. President, what is the use of the best peace agreement when fundamentalism destabilizes the entire region? [Mubarak] Look, you in Europe and in the United States, who live far away from this area, have your own assessment of the situation that does not coincide with the realities of the area. So many people claim that Egypt has a problem with fundamentalism like Algeria. I do not want to talk about Algeria, but you must not compare Egypt with another country. Egypt has a 7,000-year-old civilization, Egypt has its roots here, Egypt is a strong country. We are in control of all these things. It happens, of course, sometimes that some fundamentalists, some extremists who were in Afghanistan while the Soviets were there and were trained there, and who were financed by other countries, are trying to destabilize the situation here. I think that this is very difficult. If you talk about fundamentalism in the entire region and the danger that emanates from it for the peace process, then I have to say that I do not believe it. The further they advance, the less room the fundamentalists will find for creating problems. [Stenzel] Are you not under pressure of time? Is there not a danger that radicalism will increase the longer people have to wait for real peace in the Middle East and do not benefit from it, economically and socially? [Mubarak] The danger is that one has to deal with all these criminals, thus neglecting the economic reform. Only then will the situation become more complicated. We are not doing that. We are pushing forward economic reform because only in that way can we improve the people's standard of living. Only if we were to freeze this economic development and concentrate exclusively on fundamentalism would the economic situation deteriorate, and, thus, encourage fundamentalism. [Stenzel] There might be another danger to the peace process by a possible change of government in Israel. [Mubarak] Mr. Rabin and the Labor Party understand the situation very well. Besides, we signed the peace agreement with Menahim Begin. Once an agreement is signed between the Palestinians and Israel, between Israel and Syria, I think that even the Likud opposition, if it were to take over power, would respect these agreements. [Stenzel] Last but not least, what do you expect from the visit to Egypt by Austrian President Klestil? [Mubarak] We have had excellent relations with Austria since the time of Bruno Kreisky. I had more than 10 meetings with him in Vienna, and we received him in Cairo. We have traditional relations with Austria. We will discuss bilateral issues with the Austrian president, the support of the Middle East process by Austria, because Austria used to play a very active role regarding the Palestinian problem. We expect to discuss many problems of the area, questions of cooperation, what could be done for the peace process. [Stenzel] Recently, Norway instead of Austria played an important role as a promoter of dialogue between Israel and the PLO. Could you imagine Austria resuming an important role in this connection? [Mubarak] Austria is capable of playing an eminent role. I wonder why the strong, active role of the Kreisky era was not continued. We had contacts with Austria, we will inform the country of the peace process, and I think Austria could play a very important role. [Stenzel] A more active one. [Mubarak] Yes, for sure.
