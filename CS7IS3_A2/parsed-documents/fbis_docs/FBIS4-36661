The attack on al-Mukalla, the first air raid on an airport to be announced by Sanaa since war broke out five weeks ago, "caused heavy damage to the airport and warplanes" based there, the spokesman said without elaborating. There was no immediate confirmation of the raid which came hours before southern officials expected UN peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to hold talks with al-Bid in al-Mukalla. Yemen's northern President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih called a second ceasefire for Thursday during talks with Brahimi in Sanaa, and then declared another truce for midnight Friday. All ceasefires, including one declared here on Monday, have collapsed with north and south blaming each other. Northern artillery meanwhile fired about six shells that landed near the airport in Aden, 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the west of al-Mukalla, and other neighborhoods, starting fires and damaging homes, southern officials said. Officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said 18 civilians were wounded. Explosions could be seen and heard from the center of Aden as rival forces fought artillery duels about 20 kilometers (12 miles) away -- evidence of the collapse of the ceasefire called by the north for midnight (2100 GMT) Friday. Southern officials said that northern warplanes also tried to hit the refinery in Little Aden. Aid workers said offices of an Athens-based company working at the refinery, the Consolidated Contractors Company, was hit and set ablaze, but there were no casualties as the offices were empty. The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden and vital for the south's armed forces, was hit last Sunday in northern air raids, and six oil storage tanks were set ablaze. Earlier, northern army units had halted their bombardment of Aden and nearby villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said. Running water was restored to some neighborhoods after repairs were made to part of the pumping station that was shelled last week, city officials said. [passage omitted] Southern officials said on Aden television late Friday that they had recaptured almost all of the eastern oil-producing Shabwah province from northern forces after several days of heavy fighting. UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, arrived Saturday in the Saudi city of Jeddah from Amman after holding talks earlier this week in Sanaa as part of a peace mission. He also aims to meet southern leaders. In Sanaa, a government official met with a UN mission seeking to organize relief for victims of the war, the official northern news agency SABA' said. In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its ships was waiting off Aden for safety guarantees before unloading emergency medical supplies for war wounded.
