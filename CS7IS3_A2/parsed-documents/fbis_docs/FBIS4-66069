Today she meets with Rene Steichen, Europe's agriculture commissioner, the author of the plan that would eliminate almost one-fourth of our output. It will be a private meeting with a view to the next European Union Council of Ministers session on 30 May, at which the proposal will be officially submitted. It will be the European debut for Adriana Poli Bortone -- one of the National Alliance ministers -- in the same forum where our Community partners have raised several questions about the entry of "neo-Fascists" into the Italian Government. The new agriculture minister had to tackle the wine problem immediately. Immediately she sent Steichen a letter which described his proposals as "unacceptable." On the eve of her visit she revealed in this interview what she will say in Brussels and the outlines of her program. [Cambi] Minister, will you repeat again today that Steichen's proposal is unacceptable? Do you not think that your political allegiance could hinder you, and therefore Italy, in the negotiations? [Poli Bortone] I will tell Mr. Steichen what I have already written and what I repeated to him at our meeting in Greece. The proposal is unacceptable, period. We say "no" to the addition of sugar, we say "no" to quotas that would penalize Italy's output, and to the way in which they have been set, which in the case of wine is different from what has happened in every other sector. For Italy, the quota was set on the basis of the two least productive years out of seven, while in Germany's case it was set using the average of three harvests out of the six largest. This method must be rejected. In order to do so we have drawn up a detailed document that aims to rule out the addition of sugar and that intends to restore the balance to the mechanism for calculating surpluses. With regard to wine it is necessary to take the following fact into account: Alcoholic strength must be created in the fields, not in the cellars. If this principle is kept in mind, then it is possible to engage in discussions. As for my political allegiance, it must be understood that I represent the Italian Government, the entire country. [Cambi] But the Belgian minister has said that he will refuse to shake hands with you... [Poli Bortone] Everyone shook hands with me in Greece. They were very friendly and said that they wanted to cooperate with the Italian Government. Especially over wine, we have already reached understandings with Spain and France, which have more or less the same position as do we. Of course, if there are any obstacles, we will try to surmount them. This morning there were a thousand fishermen protesting outside the ministry. I went down to talk to them. I listened to what they had to say, and I will try to represent their interests within the Community. This, because the interests of agriculture are the interests of the country. [Cambi] Minister, you know that your appointment has been regarded with skepticism. Why did you choose Agriculture? Are you by any chance taking evening classes to catch up? [Poli Bortone] I know, but I am not as uninformed as people think; I have been in politics for 30 years, and moreover I have found an extremely professional staff here. Evening classes? I would like that, but I am learning fast partly thanks to the ministry experts. I chose Agriculture because it enables me to remain close to the problems of my land and my people, Puglia and the South. [Cambi] Pardon me, but there is a contradiction there. You are a member of a pro-northern government; how can you protect the South? [Poli Bortone] The contradictions are more imagined than real, and in any case by the protection of the South I do not mean the abuse of welfarism, which has caused much harm and has brought no benefit. What I intend to do is to promote agriculture, ensuring that the southern regions match the pace of the northern regions. I am convinced that the revitalization of agriculture and tourism can be a new key to the development of the South. [Cambi] The National Alliance is a "nationalist" party, whereas agriculture is the most European of sectors. How can you keep these two things together? [Poli Bortone] By trying to represent Italy's interests as best as I can within the Community, in the knowledge that a large part of agricultural policy is determined in Europe. I also have the regional authorities beside me. I have met with them and we have set a timetable for periodic meetings. I will be the representative of the country's interests in Brussels. And they must heed us. [Cambi] You will face another thorny problem: milk quotas. What will you do about that? [Poli Bortone] I will tell our partners -- as I have already told my Netherlands counterpart, and he seemed convinced to me -- that we are in compliance with regard to milk quotas. We have paid the fines and have come into line. They cannot continue accusing us. In any case, this issue is by no means closed. Furthermore, through administration by a commissioner and the transformation of AIMA [State Agency for Intervention in the Agricultural Market], we have proved our credibility. Let me return to the South for a moment. We have been accused of many kinds of fraud, but perhaps others commit more and worse frauds, many of them stemming from a welfarist vision. Well, I want to change this image. [Cambi] But was the AIMA decree not drawn up by your predecessor, Alfredo Diana? [Poli Bortone] I found a great deal of work begun by Diana, who is very competent, and I have no intention of wasting it; nor do I have any difficulty in admitting that I will take the best of it. [Cambi] What does it feel like to be called a Fascist? Does it irritate you? [Poli Bortone] I am a right-winger. I am in favor of a modern Right, and the National Alliance blueprint moves in the direction of transcending what is now a distant past. [National Alliance leader] Fini's speech to the lower house was very clear in this regard. As for my allegiance, I have never had any problems with anyone else, because what interests me is what needs to be done. I will be meeting with women of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], because one of my main efforts has been in the struggle against petty bureaucracy, and I know that they have worked hard on that. I will ask them to help. [Cambi] What will you do in your first 100 days? [Poli Bortone] I do not like first 100 days. I think that with the AIMA decree I have already achieved a pass mark in my first 100 days. To do things properly you need time and determination. I want first and foremost to raise the profile of agriculture, to bring young people closer to the land. To this end I am drawing up a plan involving education. I am sure that 100,000 jobs can be created. Another crucial decision is to make the best possible use of research institutions and to provide incentives to encourage the cultivation of crops specific to our lands.
