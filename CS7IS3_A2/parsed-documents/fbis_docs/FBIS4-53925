In an interview with a science journal, Kim said, "If we are to extract plutonium, care should be taken to treat (spent nuclear fuel) in such a safe way that allows no difference in mass after having it reprocessed." "Reprocessing is possible, but we would require enormous time and technology in the process of manufacturing nuclear weapons," he said in the May edition of "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY." Saying that he was simply talking of his personal opinion, Kim noted that there is no evidence that North Korea has conducted underground nuclear experiments. "If the North had done it, we would have detected it by seismograph," he said. "It is presumed North Korea began extracting plutonium from 1985, but I doubt whether they have the technology to manufacture (nuclear) weapons," Kim said.
