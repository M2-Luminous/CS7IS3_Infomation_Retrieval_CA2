The campus will open in April. With the exception of Tokyo University, which manufactured and owns a small-scale facility, this is the first Japanese university to independently own an SR facility, which can be used for the development of new materials and for ultra-fine semiconductor processing. It is planned to open this facility to the outside in order to promote joint research with the industrial world, public research institutions, and such. This has attracted attention as a bold venture aiming at the improvement of the university research environment. The size of the stored energy, which indicates the scale of this facility, is 600 million electronvolts. Compared with the large-scale SR facility (8 billion electronvolts) being constructed by the Science and Technology Agency in Nishi Harima District, Hyogo Prefecture, this facility is less than one-tenth in size but, because it uses powerful superconducting magnets, it will be able to put out powerful radiation relative to its size. Construction of the research facility will be started during this year and equipment developed by Sumitomo Heavy Industries will be installed. It is planned that the facility will be in operation in the spring of 1996. Along with the transfer of the Science and Engineering Faculty from the city of Kyoto, Ritsumeikan University plans to install about 1,000 personal computers and workstations on the new campus and make it an intelligent campus. Ritsumeikan University will also start installing SR equipment on this campus to set the stage for joint research by industry, academia, and government. It has been pointed out that there is a problem with the deterioration and superannuation of university research facilities but Ritsumeikan University is aiming at qualitative progress by renovating the education and research environment through the introduction of "cutting edge" research equipment. Synchrotron Radiation When the orbit of electrons accelerated almost up to the speed of light is deflected by magnets, bright linear radiation is emitted. Since this is a bright radiation source with a wide wavelength range, from visible light to X-rays, it can be used to observe the inner structure of living organisms and manufacture super-high density semiconductor elements.
