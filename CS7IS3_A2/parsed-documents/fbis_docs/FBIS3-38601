Opening the offensive, Industry and Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said that a French business centre for small and medium-sized companies would be set up soon in Singapore. He also unveiled projects for outline investment deals in Asia between French interests and various Asian countries. The activity of the French Foreign Trade Ministry in the region was to be tripled during the next three years. Financial support, particularly in the form of insurance for the prospection of markets and for trade fairs, would be orientated mainly towards Southeast Asia. The number of French trade exhibitions would be increased as would efforts to make known French products. French companies, with few exceptions, began to take an interest in Asia only from 1990 after having concentrated their attention on the United States. They hold only 2 percent of the Asian market. German interests hold more than twice this. U.S. interests hold more as in many cases do the British, and in some places the Italians. Longuet said that direct French investment was also low, representing 0.7 percent to 2.5 percent. Longuet, taking a cautious approach in the light of visits to the region, has set a target of increasing the share of exports to Asia as a proportion of all French exports from 7 percent to 10 percent within five years. This is equivalent to increasing the market share in Asia to about 3 percent. Elsewhere in the world France holds an average market share of about 6 percent. The outcome will depend much on what happens in China which last year imported goods worth more than 100 billion dollars. Longuet did not provide figures for a new aid arrangement which France is to make available to China following an interruption lasting a year caused by Chinese discontent at the sale by France of arms to Taiwan. The arrangement will provide finance for projects by French companies in China.
