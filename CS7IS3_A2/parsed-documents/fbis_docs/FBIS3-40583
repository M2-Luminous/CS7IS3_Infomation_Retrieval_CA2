Turkey has expressed a willingness to increase imports of rice and leather. Both countries have agreed to form a free zone for exports of goods to each other. Additionally, a joint committee will be established to discuss various plans. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister Madam Tansu Chahlar held bilateral talks about regional and international issues. The political cooperation between Turkey and Pakistan will help obtain Turkey's support for the struggle of Kashmiri Muslims. Madam Bhutto said in a statement that she was very impressed with the Turkish prime minister's decisiveness.

Relations between Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey are based on several factors. In the past, these countries have had some agreements for regional development. The three countries have participated in communication and commerce agreements. Iran and Turkey have always helped their Pakistani brothers openly in war and peace. They have also supported Pakistan's principled stands in international forums. Even now, these three countries are cooperating with each other in religious, political, and economic areas. Pakistan was proud of its friendship with these two countries yesterday, is proud today, and will be proud tomorrow. The people of Pakistan have always been with their Iranian and Turkish brothers in good and bad times. The people of Pakistan are waiting for the response to the invitation given by the Pakistani prime minister to the Turkish prime minister and the Iranian president. We pray that relations among Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey improve day by day.
