"It is a very serious allegation and he will have to back it up with facts. As far as I know, he has not provided one single fact for that allegation," he said at a press conference at the National Party [NP] offices in Cape Town. Mr de Klerk was reacting to an earlier allegation of "sabotage" made by Mr Mandela in an interview with SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television. "The NP has complained that the overwhelming majority of Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials at grassroots and polling station official level have been breaking the rules and have not been impartial. We have much to complain about. The IEC is sufficiently representative -- and on certain levels loaded in favour of the ANC -- of all political parties. I have travelled far and wide and have not heard -- apart from specific polling stations -- any accusations of malpractice which has the type of basis of Mr Mandela's statement. I'm shocked at it."
