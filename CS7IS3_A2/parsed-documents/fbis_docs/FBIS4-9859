The monetary base (volume of money in the hands of the public plus the compulsory reserves the banks keep in the BC) increased 43 percent in February compared with January's average daily balance. This is 2 percent more than the average inflation rate measured by the IPC-Fipe [Consumer Price Index-Economic Research Institute Foundation], the IGP-M [General Market Price Index], and the INPC [National Consumer Price Index]. As a result of high interest rates, the internal debt also increased 4.6 percent more than inflation in February, reaching 31 trillion cruzeiros. Based on the average daily balances, the monetary base only increased more than the average inflation rate in the months of December in the last two years. In the other months the BC managed to control the monetary base through the issuance of government titles. The main factor in the monetary base's expansion was the exchange of dollars -- coming from abroad -- for cruzeiros. The net inflow during February was 1.1 trillion cruzeiros. Part of this pressure was compensated for by the issuance of public titles. The BC withdrew 552 billion cruzeiros from circulation in this operation. In the case of the internal debt, its proportion of the GDP jumped from 8.3 percent in January to 8.6 percent in February, which is the same rate as November 1992, when the volume of the internal debt in government titles placed on the market began to drop. Reserves Hard currency reserves, including cash and short-term credits, reached $29.1 billion by the end of January, which represents a considerable increase of $3.3 billion compared with December. Under the concept of international liquidity, which includes mid- and long-term credits, the increase was $3.2 billion, amounting to a total $35.4 billion. In the commercial exchange market, in which imports, exports, and the arrival and remittance of foreign investments are registered, the February surplus was $2.4 billion, 27 percent less than in January.
