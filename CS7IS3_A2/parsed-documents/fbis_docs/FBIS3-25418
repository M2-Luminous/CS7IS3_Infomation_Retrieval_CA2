Although it would not extend the list of powers it has until now insisted could be exercised exclusively but within national framework legislation, the ANC would now accept certain powers could be exercised exclusively by the provinces. Until now, in terms of the interim constitution, the national parliament will be able to exercise powers concurrently with the provinces -- a position rejected by the Freedom Alliance in negotiations since late 1993. In its first shift, the ANC agreed to exclusive powers during negotiations with the government and the alliance earlier this year. However, it insisted such powers had to be exercised within national framework legislation. The Freedom Alliance argued this defeated the purpose of exclusive powers. It further argued that even the limited powers the provinces were granted in the interim constitution could be removed once an ANC-dominated constituent assembly sat to draft a new constitution after the April elections. An ANC concession to the principle of exclusive powers -- even if these are limited to parochial matters now -- and a constitutional principle ensuring these powers will not be removed, is the furthest the ANC has gone in conceding a federal-type dispensation. "The formulation is to effectively have a different approach to exclusive powers to that in the interim constitution. The actual powers -- the functional areas -- will substantially remain the same," Mr Ramaphosa said. A further ANC concession that provinces will be able to define their own legislative and executive structures is another concession to the provinces. This is further strengthened by an agreement that provinces will have their own revenue bases in the form of taxes on betting and casinos. Whether the concessions are enough to lure the alliance as a whole into the electoral process remains to be seen. Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has already rejected ANC President Nelson Mandela's proposals. But the ANC, Mr Ramaphosa said, was engaged in negotiations with elements of the alliance -- namely the Zulu king, the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] of Gen Constand Viljoen and the Bophuthatswana government. The negotiations with the AVF had reached an advanced stage when Gen Viljoen was booed off the stage by Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] supporters at an AVF meeting at the end of January. According to the agreements, the ANC agreed votes for the AVF in the elections could be counted as votes for an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. Those members of parliament could then constitute a volksraad [national council] to push for a volkstaat within the constituent assembly. The next two weeks will be a crucial period for the transitional process. Parallel to the bilateral talks being conducted between the ANC and elements of the Freedom Alliance, the multiparty negotiating council will convene on Monday to draw up the proposed amendments to the constitution and to the electoral act to allow for a few more days for the parties to register. This, Mr Ramaphosa said, would constitute a final deadline for parties to take part in the April elections. Parties could of course choose to stay out of the process. The sub-script of the ANC's concessions has been a warning to those who want to disrupt the election not to dare. Mr Ramaphosa warned there was no prospect of the ANC agreeing to an extension of the election date. And the government agreed to this. He said Mr Buthelezi had assured the independent electoral commission that polling could take place within kwaZulu. "There is a threat to the process," he said. But he was confident the security forces would not stand by and tolerate a disruption. Strict application of the laws should ensure the election went ahead, however.
