After the collapse, the Longgang District Government immediately set up a rescue command center at the scene and organized members of the party, government, and Army to start a rescue operation with all their strength. Li Youwei, secretary of the Shenzhen city party committee and mayor, and other officials also rushed to the scene to attend to the operation. By the time this report was filed last night, a total of 63 casualties had been hospitalized, of which 34 were still in the hospital, four had died, and nine were seriously injured. It has been verified that this building belonged to the Jiecheng Plastic Factory, which is wholly owned by Hong Kong businessman Wang Chengen. The factory building had been built on a plot of reclaimed land, formerly part of a river bed, which had been filled with soft soil. The construction had been started hastily in the absence of any architectural plans, before any application had been lodged with the authorities, and before any legal examination and approval procedures had been completed. Both the steel frame and the beam and column concrete support structures were of inferior quality; the project's quality control was not up to standard; and the building had been put into use before all the construction work was completed. The rescue operation is still in full swing.
