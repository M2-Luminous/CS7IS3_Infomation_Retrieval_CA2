The Bosnian prime minister, who arrived here today to start a two-day official visit to Indonesia, told the press that Indonesia in its capacity as the NAM chairman would exert more political influence on the United Nations (UN) in an effort to create peace and sovereignty in the war-torn Bosnia. He noted that Bosnia was convinced that NAM could voice its supports and play its active roles in the UN. He pointed out that the future developments in Bosnia would depend on the UN agreement. He also hoped that the countries which had so far supported Bosnia in the UN would maintain their supports. During his stay, he will discuss with the Indonesian side the latest development about the Washington Accord, and the future steps to be taken by Bosnia. The Bosnian prime minister said that the diplomatic ties between Bosnia and Indonesia will be established soon at the right time. Siladjzic arrived from Washington and was met at the Sukarno-Hatta airport by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Chief Executive Assistant to the NAM Chairman Nana Sutresna. He told the press about the recent peace talks between Bosnia and Croatia held in Washington. Both sides agreed to form a framework for the establishment of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
