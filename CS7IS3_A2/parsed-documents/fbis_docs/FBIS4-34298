BLP public relations person Tony Alton was responding to remarks by the leader of the National Democratic Party, Dr. Richie Haynes, that the BLP is not in a position to contest an upcoming election. Mr. Alton said the leadership issue in the party has already been settled, with Owen Arthur at the head. He also disclosed that the BLP has candidates for all the constituencies and some, he says, have already been elected. [Begin Alton recording] Currently lifetime members [words indistinct], each of them has indicated that they will, if selected, run on behalf of the BLP again. There are several of us that have been nominated and endorsed by the national council to represent the party at the next election. These would be (Liam Artley), Duncan Carter, Blaine Clark, (Romel Marshall), and myself. There are another six nominations that are on schedule for the end, rather, by the end of July.

Bradshaw missed last week's historic no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford as he had to obtain medical treatment in Antigua. Speaking with (Novodin Busta) from Antigua, Bradshaw indicated that he was still in a lot of pain and was awaiting word from his physician on when he could return to Barbados. [Begin Bradshaw recording] I am still seeing my doctor. I am hoping to be back, [pauses] will be returning to see my doctor again on Friday. I hope that I will be fit to travel to return home. [end recording] Mr. Bradshaw also reiterated that he had intended to be in Barbados for last week's vote. He said he left the 14th Caribbean General Insurance Conference overseas ahead of its conclusions when he heard that the debate on the motion was pending. The MP noted that he is ready to defend his name and respond to the rumors about why he missed the no-confidence motion upon his return to Barbados. He noted that he would be speaking to his party leader, constituents, and the Barbadian public on this very contentious issue. [Begin Bradshaw recording] I was in Belize some time last week. Then last week, week before when I was called and told to return home for the no-confidence motion, and I will return to Barbados. [sentence as heard] [end recording]
