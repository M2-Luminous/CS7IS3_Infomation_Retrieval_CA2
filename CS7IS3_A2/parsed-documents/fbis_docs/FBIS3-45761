Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on New Year's eve. Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this province. Today, we bring you the second part of this interview. [Begin recording] [Zhang] As to the reform measures to be promulgated by the central authorities next year, the provincial party committee and government, through conscientious study and discussion, are fully supportive of them, because they are measures that must be taken for the establishment of a market economy. Meanwhile, the local governments [words indistinct] on matters of importance, matters of principle. The reform of the financial and tax system is mainly aimed at introducing the system of tax sharing, or in other words, redividing all the tax categories of the state into central and local taxes. Therefore, this reform has the greatest impact on all localities. The reform of the monetary and investment system is mainly aimed at [words indistinct] technical transformation and the construction of infrastructure and differential policies will be adopted. For instance, in the sector of general industry and communications, there is strong competition which calls for complete adoption of the mechanism of market competition. Banks should be operated the way commercial banks work. Therefore, these projects are required to show relatively high efficiency and competitiveness. The second category of projects are ones that have good social benefits, and especially transregional ones. They are key construction projects of the state. This is the second category. The third category includes energy, communications, and raw materials projects. This category enjoys priority support from the state. According to this categorization, we have our advantages and disadvantages. For example, we are less competitive on competitive and transregional projects, while [words indistinct] on energy and raw materials projects. [passage omitted] As to the price reforms, there will be many measures promulgated next year. For example, electricity charges will be raised, the price of raw coal will be completely decontrolled, and the price of oil will be basically decontrolled. This province foresees a grim situation as far as commodity prices are concerned. Therefore, the provincial government has decided that this province will not set forth any new price reform measures, so all those that are promulgated next year will be coming from the state.
