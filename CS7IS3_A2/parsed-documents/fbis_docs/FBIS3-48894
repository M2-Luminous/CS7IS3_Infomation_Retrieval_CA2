The daily understands Malaysia's apprehension if the International Court of Justice confirms Indonesian ownership of the two disputed islands because the sea lanes from Tawau to Malaysia's Exclusive Economic Zone situated in the Sulawesi Straits will be under Indonesian control. However, MERDEKA hopes that Malaysia will discard such a narrow-minded perception and will instead adopt a far-sighted attitude. The daily reiterates that Indonesia has no intention whatsoever of putting Malaysia in a disadvantageous position. It recalls that Southeast Asia was once a kingdom alternatively ruled by sovereign rulers in the southern part of the Malay archipelago and in the Malay Peninsula. It adds: Why can't the fact that Singapore -- the majority of whose population is not of Malay stock -- is able to cooperate with Indonesia in developing the Riau islands serve as an example for Indonesia and Malaysia -- whose peoples have the same forefathers -to have good relations?
