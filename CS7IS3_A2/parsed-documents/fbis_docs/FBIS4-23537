FBIS4-23537 "drafr111_a_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire HCR-PT Meeting Previewed; Tshisekedi Minister Comments HCR-PT Meeting Previewed; Tshisekedi Minister Comments AB0806163594 Libreville Africa No. 1 in French 1830 GMT 7 Jun 94 AB0806163594 Libreville Africa No. 1 French BFN [Text] Tomorrow is a day of suspense in Zaire. It is, indeed, tomorrow that the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT] will appoint from among eight candidates the future prime minister of the country. The problem is that the hardline of the opposition against President Mobutu's regime did not deign to present Etienne Tshisekedi's candidacy. Indeed, the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies [USORAS] feels the post of prime minister is not vacant because there is a prime minister named Etienne Tshisekedi. Ousmane Kaba reports: [Begin Kaba recording] Each side interprets the new Constitution its own way. The infamous Article 78 is the bone of contention. One the one side is the Union for the Republic and Democracy [URD], really an extension of the opposition, regarded as a moderate group that supports the theory of a third party, which is to say in light of the permanent confrontation between Tshisekedi-Mobutu, there must be a third person who can cooperate with the president. On the other side is the Union for the Republic and Democracy, a kind of spontaneous generation of dissidents who, after joining the USORAS, wanted to create a third school of thought. There lies all the question because all the political unrest in Kinshasa during these past weeks is only the logical consequence of the interpretation of the new Constitution. As for Tshisekedi, basing himself on his election at the Sovereign National Conference, he does not intend to support any list of candidates for the post of prime minister. For Tshisekedi, as long as the transition does not come to an end, there is only one prime minister: himself. Will the People's Palace be invaded again by the security forces like a few weeks ago? Or will the plenary session be postponed? That is the question. The URD confirms that the meeting will take place, while Tshisekedi's partisans strongly deny the information, ironically explaining that whether there is a meeting at the HCR-PT tomorrow or not, for Tshisekedi, the commission of 33 deputies who will hold the meeting has no legal recognition. [end recording] As Ousmane Kaba has just said, a delegation of representatives from France, Belgium, and the United States recently held discussions with the opposition leaders and Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba. This delegation was the bearer of messages from their governments. It delivered similar messages to President Mobutu Sese Seko yesterday. Regarding the contents of the messages received by the two Zairian politicians, here is (Lambert Mende), minister of communication in the Tshisekedi government: [Begin (Mende) recording] We received a message that encourages power-sharing between President Mobutu and Prime Minister Tshisekedi. We received a message encouraging us to find a common solution to this crisis that has divided us both within the two political parties and in our own political party, by this I mean the problem of dissidents. I think Tshisekedi answered all these questions regarding dissidence by saying that there is a bipolarization of the constitution in this country. We are legalistic. Because of this bipolarization, our friends who left us to join President Mobutu could no longer consider themselves, while on President Mobutu's side, as people who can come and sit among us and be part of our quotas within the HCR and the transitional government. They can only aspire to this privilege when they come back to join the cause that we are defending and around which the USORAS, that is the Zairian opposition has built its project. [end recording] The private press today echoed the criticisms leveled against France by the UDPS. For the PHARE, the appeal to boycott French goods at a rally on 5 June by Kiba Samaliba is nothing other than a declaration of a holy war that can recall the one being waged by the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria [FIS] against French interests. The paper writes, and I quote, in both Kinshasa and the rural areas, people are convinced today that France does not deserve better than the war that the FIS has declared on it. On its part, LE PALMARES, another newspaper close to the opposition, feels that France is a thorn in the side of Zairian democracy. The paper also wrote about the setting up of democratic process in Zaire in order to draw attractive dividends. It will be recalled that at a UDPS rally on 5 June, Kiba Samaliba, a member of the leadership of this party headed by Etienne Tshisekedi, accused France of supporting a dictatorship in Zaire, that is President Mobutu's regime.
