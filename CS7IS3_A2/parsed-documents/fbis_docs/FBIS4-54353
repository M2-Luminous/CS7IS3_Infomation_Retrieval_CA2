The ruling coalition finally agreed Thursday to opposition demands that Hosokawa's former aide, Masatoshi Miyama, be summoned to the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Miyama's Diet testimony is likely to take place in the middle of June after the state budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower house, the sources said. Hosokawa is suspected of involvement in dubious financial deals, including a 100 million yen loan from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin business group in 1982 and the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986. As Hosokawa's former top secretary, Miyama likely handled most of the management of the former premier's personal funds but he could find it difficult to clarify all the allegations in a way that will satisfy questioners, the sources said. Many leaders of ruling coalition parties say Hosokawa will probably have to testify himself to clear up suspicions, the sources said. Hosokawa was forced to quit the premiership in April due to a stalemate in Diet deliberations on the state budget, chiefly caused by charges he might have been involved in the dubious transactions. Hosokawa has said he properly paid back the 100 million yen loan to the Sagawa group by 1991, and denied he personally touched the NTT stock purchase. But the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other opposition parties suspect Hosokawa used the Sagawa money as undeclared political donations for his successful gubernatorial election campaign in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu in western Japan. A financial consultant who used to help Hosokawa told a news conference in the Diet that the former premier bought the shares himself. The LDP, as the political party with the largest number of lower house members, has held the fiscal 1994 budget hostage for the past several months to push its demands for a full inquiry. Due to an agreement on Miyama's testimony at a directors' meeting of the budget committee, however, the LDP proposed completing all discussions on the state budget in both chambers before the current Diet session ends on June 29, Diet sources said. In lieu of the full budget, the government had to push through two stopgap budgets to cover the first three months of fiscal 1994 which started on April 1.
