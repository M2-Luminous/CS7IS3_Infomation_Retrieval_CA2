"Sarajevo was a genuine tragedy, but the world should know that there are others, perhaps more serious tragedies in a city like Mostar," Akashi said as he arrived for his first visit here. Some elements of an agreement that led to a ceasefire in Sarajevo had also been tried in an accord reached between Bosnian Moslems and Croats besieging the Moslem part of Mostar, he added. The accord provides for an interposition of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] troops between the belligerent parties and the withdrawal of heavy weapons to between 20 kilometers (12 miles) and 10 kilometers (six miles) from the city by March 7. Akashi said ceasefire agreements should be signed "in as many cities as possible. UNPROFOR is prepared to do its best, but we're short of troops." In the Moslem-populated eastern sector of Mostar Akashi met with members of the city's "war presidency." "President" Smail Klaric said Mostar "will have to be an open and non-divided city" and be a "part of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory." Croats have laid siege to the Moslem sector for the past nine months and have said they want to make the city the capital of a self-styled Bosnian Croat republic. Akashi is also to meet with Croat officials in the western sector. No fighting was reported in the city Monday after shells rained down on the eastern sector Sunday in spite of Friday's ceasefire agreement.
