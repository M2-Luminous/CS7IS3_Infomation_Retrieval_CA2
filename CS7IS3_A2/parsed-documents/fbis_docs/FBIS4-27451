At this point, the Kingdom of Cambodia had already presented its candidates for this commission. "The delegation also proposed that simultaneously with the cease-fire, an agreement in principle be adopted in order to immediately create the inter-Cambodian Control Commission as a mechanism to control and monitor without delay the cease-fire. "The delegation fully supported His Majesty's clear-sighted and sacred idea on the solemn declaration of fidelity for Cambodia as a state of unity without partition and secession, within its own territorial integrity (the internationally recognized borders between 1963-1969), of peace, solidarity, national unity and prosperity in the concerted efforts for national construction. "Unfortunately, the initiatives on the standstill, unconditional, immediate, total, durable, and irreversible cease-fire all over the territory of Cambodia at the above-mentioned date and time [15 June] had been categorically rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer Rouge, despite the insisted appeal made by His Majesty the King and the two Preah Sangkhareach [supreme patriarchs], Samdech Preah Monkol Tepeacha and Samdech Moha Khousananda. "Instead firstly, Mr. Khieu Samphan urged that this cease-fire process be controlled and monitored by some foreign countries. A list of ten countries was submitted by Mr. Khieu Samphan for consideration, five of which had to be selected to control and monitor the cease-fire. It is worthy to note that the ten proposed countries are all full members of the United Nations that had bitter experiences with the Khmer Rouge during the process of implementing the Paris peace agreements. "Secondly, the Khmer Rouge urged the delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia to accept the formulation of the so-called "minimal policy program" before proceeding to the discussion on His Majesty's proposed cease-fire. This minimal policy program is nothing but its aims at dissolving the legal and legitimate institution of the Kingdom of Cambodia -- the National Assembly and Royal Government of Cambodia -- issued from the UN-organized and supervised general elections. "On 28 May 1994, the participants to this roundtable talk had agreed to issue a joint communique by which a roundtable working group for peace and national reconciliation under the chairmanship of the royal representative of His Majesty the King -- Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong -- be set up to further their discussion. This working group, which will consist of four representatives from the Kingdom of Cambodia and four others from the Khmer Rouge group, will hold its first meeting on June 15, 1994 at Damnak Chan in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. "Throughout this roundtable talk, it is an undeniable fact that the Khmer Rouge revealed their intention not to seek a solution to the remaining Cambodian problems by political means, but to resort to their stalled tactics of "fight talk, fight talk." Worse still, they had striven to internationalize the remaining internal problems existing among Cambodians to dismantle the National Assembly and the Royal Government of Cambodia, internationally recognized through UN-sponsored free and fair general elections of May 1993. It goes without saying that the cease-fire, which was the outstanding and main topic of this roundtable talk could not be achieved due to the intransigent opposition of the Khmer Rouge."
