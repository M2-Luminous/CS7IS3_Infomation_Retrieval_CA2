He was received [in France] today by the French prime minister and by President Mitterrand. He took advantage of the occasion to announce that three African countries -- Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania -- had given him their agreement on sending 5,500 UN peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. Monique Mas: [Mas] According to Butrus-Ghali what is needed is for the genocide to be halted, the refugees to be helped, and the humanitarian organizations to be protected. In order to do this, the UN secretary general envisages a 5,500-strong force. They would be authorized to defend themselves if they are attacked, but on the other hand there is no indication that these UN peacekeeping troops would have a mandate to defend the civilians against the militiamen in the zones where they will be deployed.
