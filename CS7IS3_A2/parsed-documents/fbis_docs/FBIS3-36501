The results of the talks are also being subjected to quite a lot of criticism. In particular, the opponents of this visit consider that the Treaty on Friendship, Good-neighborliness, and Cooperation that has been signed will set in motion a new spiral of escalation of tension in the Caucasus. Let us listen to what Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council, who was a member of the Russian delegation to Tbilisi, thinks about this: [Begin Pain recording] I think that the objections that are being put forward against the treaty are groundless, for a number of reasons. In the first place, uncertainty about Russia's attitude to the integrity of Georgia to a considerable extent stimulates the outbreak and escalation of conflicts. Second, it is the third point of the treaty that has aroused the greatest criticism; in accordance with this point Russia pledges to help with the development of Georgia's regular army. But this point is closely linked with a political settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian conflicts. And for the first time the Georgian side at the talks has agreed with the idea that Georgia could resolve its political problems with the autonomies along the path of the federalization of Georgia, that is, on the path by which relations are constructed between the center and the autonomies in the Russian Federation. Perhaps the most important result of this visit was that the Georgians put their trust in the good-neighborliness and good intentions of Russia toward that country that is now on the verge of catastrophe. [passage omitted] I think that the suggestion that no treaty should be concluded with Georgia because its relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia are unresolved is groundless, because similar contradictions exist in virtually all the post-Soviet states. [passage omitted] Furthermore, it is quite impermissible to impose any particular model of political development on another country that is recognized by world society as independent. We may say that today federalization is one of the best models; it, to the greatest extent, resolves the problems of interrelations between the central authorities and the autonomies, but to directly include in the treaty conditions specifying federalization or, even more so, the granting of independence to some of its components, is impermissible. [passage omitted] [end recording] [Announcer] The results of the Russian-Georgian summit talks were commented on, specially for Mayak, by Emil Pain, the director of the Ethno-Political Research Center and member of the Presidential Council.
