It is possible that discussions on this proposal will begin almost immediately. As Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Committee for Foreign Policy, told journalists after the committee's meeting, the foreign policy doctrine is based on Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs' speech at the international conference "Latvian Security at the Turn of the Century." It has been submitted to the Saeima in a somewhat different form. V. Birkavs will present the doctrine at the plenary session, before formal debate begins. At present, Latvia does not have a foreign policy doctrine, per se, approved by parliament. The main points of this doctrine are: Latvia's orientation towards the West, membership and cooperation with international institutions -- NATO, the European Union [EU], the Western European Union, CSCE, the Balladur plan -- as well as concluding a free-trade agreement with the EU that will permit Latvia to obtain EU associate member status. Latvia's relations with Russia, according to the foreign policy doctrine, should be equable in economic as well as political terms, though not at any price, especially not for the price of losing Latvia's general orientation, emphasized A. Kirsteins. A. Kirsteins also said that Latvia has to accept, in the immediate future, the law on citizenship, and the document regulating the status of foreigners and stateless people in Latvia. The suggestion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin [not further specified] could be interpreted as a good idea, A. Kirsteins stated.
