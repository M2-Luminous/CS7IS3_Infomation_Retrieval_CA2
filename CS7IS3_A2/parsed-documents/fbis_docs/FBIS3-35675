He said so in an interview with Interfax on Friday when he commented on the signing of documents on Lithuania's joining the program by President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels the day before. Jursenas did not think that Lithuania would be accepted into NATO soon. He believes that "the two sides should meet each other halfway" if the North Atlantic Alliance was to expand. In his view, NATO itself should be prepared to incorporate Central and East European nations. On the other hand, Jursenas argued, those who want to join NATO should meet certain requirements. By joining the Partnership for Peace program, Lithuania has made serious commitments. "This will be a process which can take years, not weeks or months," Jursenas emphasized. The speaker said that even though Partnership for Peace did not provide any unambiguous guarantees of Lithuania's security by NATO, the very fact of closer cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance would reassure his country if its independence, sovereignty, and integrity were threatened. This, in turn, would contribute to stability in the Baltic area, Europe, and the world. "Lithuania's desire to integrate into Europe's political and economic structures and collective security system is in no way hostile to Russia or any other country," Jursenas emphasized, and added that it would be desirable that Lithuania's neighbors also join Partnership for Peace. "This would be beneficial to the region, the continent, and the world," Jursenas believes.
