A spokesman told reporters "the secretary general has not resigned and has no intention of resigning." Woerner, 59, whose mandate runs out in 1996, has been operated on for stomach cancer three times since April 1992, and in early January he said he had beaten the illness. However, on January 14 he was operated on for a severe intestinal blockage and in early May he postponed indefinitely a visit to the United States. At the start of the week, Woerner wrote to NATO defence ministers explaining he would not be able to chair meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, for medical reasons. "It was my firm intention to leave the hospital in time to chair the meetings. Even my doctors were hopeful that this would be possible. "However they now advise me that the previous untimely interruptions of my convalescence had taken their toll and that another premature return might well damage the chances of a full recovery," he said in a letter, published by NATO Thursday. However, while Woerner's post is not due to come up for another two years, a senior European Commission official suggested that the question of a possible successor to Woerner could be linked to the other international posts coming up in Europe in the next couple of years. "Without being morbid, one can imagine an agreement on a global package including Woerner's post, the president of the European Commission, the secretary general of the Western European Union and the secretary general of the European Union's Council of Ministers," the official said, requesting anonymity.
