One assumes that the future government in Rome will not touch South Tirol's autonomy. If, however, things turn out differently, "we will not stand idly by like a lamb." The background to this are statements from neofascist circles that form part of the Italian right-wing alliance and that have challenged parts of South Tirol's autonomy, on the one hand, and called for the revision of the Osimo treaty, on the other, which settles Italy's border with the former Yugoslavia. Durnwalder and Siegfried Brugger, chairman of the South Tirol People's Party (SVP), called on Foreign Minister Alois Mock on Thursday, when they were assured of Austria's function as the protecting power. Even before, Mock had noted that developments in Italy would be observed carefully. As Durnwalder emphasized once more, the SVP will not agree to a government with neofascist ministers. If only "the smallest part" of autonomy be threatened, South Tirol would immediately resort to all necessary means at all levels. "Then, even self-determination would no longer be a foreign word to us." What is irritating for Khol is that fascist ideas have come to the surface in Italy. Those who challenge the Osimo treaties , question any postwar borders. "Austria can certainly not keep out of this dynamism," Khol said in allusion to the Brenner border.
