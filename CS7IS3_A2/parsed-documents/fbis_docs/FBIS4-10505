Credit assistance reached 363.058 billion bolivares (6 percent of GDP) and there was capital flight worth $2.65 billion during the first quarter of the year. The collapse of important banks created such a climate of distrust that those holding liquid assets were forced to purchase foreign exchange in an amount eight times greater than the decrease in international reserves for the entire year of 1993. The reopening of Banco Latino, where the problems confronted by the banking system were first detected, coincides with the decline of the crisis in the financial system. The intervention at Banco Latino was a bad business for the government in terms of opportunity costs, but the lowest point of the curve seems to have passed. The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), announcing the reserve levels at the end of the first quarter, reported that the foreign exchange movement had begun returning to normal. With a balance of $12.656 billion in gross reserves at the end of 1993 and a positive balance in the current account of the balance of payments--$937 million at the close of the first quarter--the gross amount of foreign currency to date is $10.943 billion, which means there had to be a $2.65 billion flight of capital. Indebtedness To Bridge the Gap The government made a cut in the 1994 Credit Law to reduce net public indebtedness. Liabilities of 240 billion bolivares, equivalent to $2.1 billion, are expected, but 100 billion bolivares are expected to be amortized. The government's objective is to reduce the number of sources of financing from multilateral organizations not considered priority and which are tied to requirements that the government cannot meet. But this shift in the government strategy harms the position of the capital account of the balance of payments. The multilateral organizations' loans committed to social programs allowed the country to capitalize the loans because they did not signify expenditures of the country's foreign currency. This mechanism would mitigate the negative tendency of the balance of payments. The governmental goal of the 1995 Umbrella Law is to commit resources to purchasing strategic military equipment, ruling out the possibility of capitalizing the indebtedness. Necessary Aid The monetization of financial aid could promote inflation if the BCV does not use mechanisms to reduce liquidity. An increase in the monetary base without an increase in goods and services produced by society increases the price of products. This, however, was a necessary evil to reestablish the system's stability. The failure of one bank could generate the failure of others, a risk the fiscal authorities did not want to take. One peculiarity of the financial crisis is that there is a systematic relationship: The collapse of bad banks could provoke the failure of good banks. Without a solid financial system, it is impossible to think about the entry of new capital. The people's distrust increases the demand for dollars, creating distortions in the economy, as occurred in the country in the first quarter of the year. Cover Deficit in the Current Account The basic objective of the government's stabilization program is to obtain a macroeconomic equilibrium to reestablish a climate of confidence that will open new opportunities for private investment and promote productive activity. The entry of capital would improve the balance of capital, thus strengthening the country's international reserves. If we are unable to attract foreign exchange capital, our international reserves will continue to decrease. The current account will continue along the same trend of 1993 and might reach a $3-billion deficit balance this year. The entry of nonspeculative and short-term foreign exchange capital would strengthen the Venezuelan position. A climate of political stability and an economic proposal devoid of excessive adventurism could be the key to recovering investor confidence.
