Deputy Foreign Minister Anthony Ani told the official NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA, NAN, that his government was eager to canvas the views of the inhabitants of the disputed Bakassi Peninsula. He said Nigeria had nothing to fear if a referendum was conducted in the area because he said more than 90 percent of the population of the peninsula was made up of Efik-speaking Nigerians. Efik is spoken by the population of two Nigerian states sharing a border with the disputed territory of 1,000 square kilometres (390 square miles), which Nigeria has always claimed. The two countries, while trying to resolve the conflict through diplomatic channels, have stationed troops in the border area. Ani has just returned from a visit to some five countries in central, southern and eastern Africa to brief authorities there on the Nigerian position on the dispute. He said that although his government had yet not considered a referendum as an option, it "may give it a thought" if it would help resolve the dispute peacefully. He reiterated his government's belief that the conflict can still be resolved through dialogue, rather than seeking a solution at the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Nigeria has accused Cameroon of "internationalising" the dispute by taking it to the court and to the United Nations Security Council.
