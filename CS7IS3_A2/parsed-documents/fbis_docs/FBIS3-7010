Today, I want to ask you about the situation there and the purpose of sending the survey team. [Yanai] Although Japan used to have relations with the former Yugoslavia, frankly, unlike the European countries, we were not necessarily familiar with the detailed situation in that country. Therefore, to study what policies we should set up and what contributions we should make in dealing with the problems of peace and humanity existing in the former Yugoslavia that are creating world-wide concern, it was decided the MOFA as a body would make an on-the-spot study -- without confining its activities to collecting data through embassies in foreign countries -- to grasp the actual situation. [GAIKO FORUM] When peace was being sought in Cambodia, opposition and doubts about participation were raised among the Japanese people. Fortunately, however, peace has been restored. Notwithstanding, we notice opinions in the newspapers about the situation in Yugoslavia being very complicated. Under such circumstances, you have dared to start a study on Yugoslavia. What kind of survey did you carry out? [Yanai] First, let me introduce the outline. It is true there is the opinion that, while it is understandable for Japan to be involved in Cambodia which is located in Asia, why should it go as far as Europe? However, the significance of the problem of peace and humanity should not be determined by the distance. Since such a serious problem is going to have global influence, our country should not remain indifferent on the grounds it is a problem in Europe. In the case of Cambodia, Japan was also seriously concerned about the situation. International cooperation, with the European countries, and Central and South American countries rushing to the spot, was realized in the process of restoring peace in Cambodia, in the peacekeeping operations [PKO], and in carrying out humanistic assistance activities, thus making it possible to attain the objectives. We have learned from this how important it is for the world to concentrate its strength to solve such a serious problem. The first step of our survey was to grasp the Yugoslav situation. We visited all the countries which constitute the former Yugoslavia except Montenegro -- Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia. Some of the countries have attained independence and been recognized by our country, and some of them are not yet independent. We met with key figures of the respective countries, and studied their actual situations. In addition, UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], the UNHCR [UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees], and other international organs are located within the area, and we talked with people associated with the various organizations. We had an opportunity to observe the situation of the respective countries and international activities taking place there. Even today, when we hear the name Yugoslavia, we tend to imagine a united area. However, the various areas of Yugoslavia are quite different. I do not think it correct to try to understand the respective areas indiscriminately. Let me briefly describe the situation of each area. Slovenia has become completely independent, and presently there is no military dispute at all. In Croatia, there are two big problems. One is its relations with the Serbian people living in Croatia. This is a very serious confrontation which developed into a clash of military powers. Another problem is the conflict between the Croatian people and other races living in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is a confrontation among three groups--the Croatian, Serbian, and Islamic people (hereinafter referred to as Muslims). Unfortunately, the confrontation among these three groups has now developed into a military conflict. Macedonia has attained independence peacefully, and there has been no military conflict at all. The country remains quiet. Potentially, however, there is the problem of the minority race of Albanian people in Macedonia. Also, there is the danger that the problem involving Albanians living in the autonomous state of Kosovo, Serbia, north of Macedonia, might involve the country. As for Serbia -- with Montenegro we call it "the Union of New Yugoslavia" -- affected by the war, the country is broken economically and is also subject to economic sanctions. Its currency system has totally collapsed, and it is suffering an inflation rate of astronomical figures. However, there is no military conflict within Serbia. Besides, the Serbian people are united very firmly under the leadership of President Milosevic. As we have seen, a considerable difference exists between each area and, accordingly, the United Nations is carrying out different PKO in respective areas. In Croatia, the UN Peacekeeping Forces are stationed in the Serbian residential areas to control the reoccurrence of conflict. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the PKO's [peacekeeping operations] main task is to secure the safety of personnel engaged in humanitarian aid. Developing preventive activities is the PKO's task in Macedonia. Moreover, UNHCR-sponsored humanitarian activities are being developed in various districts of the former Yugoslavia. The Muslims Have No Intention of Seeking Peace [Okada] Let me explain how we were dealing with the Yugoslav situation prior to our recent survey. Besides grasping the situation as a whole, we participated in discussions at various international levels; in particular, we participated in those sponsored by the United Nations and, further, offered humanitarian aid mainly through the UNHCR. In the process of our participating in such international activities, there is one thing I noticed: The Yugoslav problem is viewed as serious in the United States and Russia, as well as Europe. On the other hand, though there are fragmentary reports in newspapers, Yugoslavia is very remote from Japan in terms of geography and culture, and many Japanese people, including those who are in comparatively responsible positions, tend to respond: "Yugoslavia? -- That problem is too difficult for me to understand." It may be true that, seen from a comparatively narrow viewpoint based on our historical, social, and economic relations with the country, Yugoslavia's problems are not likely to deeply affect our national interests. However, Japan declares itself to be a country that shares global values with other democratic countries. If, for instance, the Japanese people really believe in the significance of democracy, human rights, and humanism, they may as well express their opinions based on their beliefs -- even though the problem may be complicated in nature and difficult to understand, as is the case of Yugoslavia. When visiting the area, I was particularly impressed to discover two new facts: First, I found out that, at present, the Muslim side is not willing to obtain peace. I had to renew my recognition of this. The Serbian side, having already obtained what it wanted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and being accused internationally, is willing to make an appropriate compromise to achieve peace. Croatia, presently being attacked by the Muslims, wants to achieve a cease-fire one way or another; and, to attain this purpose, seems to be making various concessions concerning conditions for peace. I realized that only fragmentary reports about these situations were available to the outside world. Then, talking with European and U.S. diplomats and other officials in the area, I was strongly convinced that they have a serious aversion to Milosevic as a symbol of great Serbianism, and as a Stalinist. In short, everything is being dealt with in the recognition that Serbia is to blame and that, compared to Serbia, the other countries are acceptable. They intend to achieve peace by suppressing Serbia. However, since Serbia has strength, it must be controlled by military force. But, the European countries and the United States seem to be somewhat hesitant about taking such action as it is likely to result in a serious sacrifice for them. Seemingly, they are distressed with this dilemma as what they believe in is not supported by their ability to realize it. However, even concerning recognition of the facts on which their belief is based, I question whether it is really justifiable for them to one-sidedly make a judgment to that extent. [GAIKO FORUM] If the Muslims do not want peace, what do they intend to do? [Okada] The Muslim experienced a very serious defeat in the initial stage of the conflict. Most of the weapons of the former Yugoslav allied forces were transferred to Serbia, which was the main part of the allied forces. As a result, Serbia, although its strength was inferior in terms of the number of soldiers, was able to win victories one after another in its military actions. Then, the Muslim group, which had been in a continuously inferior position throughout the period, changed to the offensive around the autumn of last year. Though the Muslim group does not seem to have greatly expanded its territories through military actions against Serbia, the group had won victories one after another in its territorial competition against Croatia, thus placing several cities under its control. Therefore, the group may be feeling confident that, if they try harder in the future, they might be able to recover what they lost during the military conflicts. That is why they do not want to compromise for peace. Also, we can point out the fact that the opinion of the international community is on the side of the Muslims. For example, while it is the actual situation in Sarajevo that the attacks are mostly made by the Muslim side and no attack is being made by Serbia, it has been reported in most cases that Serbia is making the attacks, thus bringing about casualties. We may say that the newspapers or the mass media are being skillfully controlled from behind the scenes. A Unique Case of Assisting Refugees [GAIKO FORUM] Mr. Nagasaki, what is your opinion as one in charge of assisting the refugees? [Nagasaki] It is our duty to assist refugees not only in Yugoslavia, but throughout the world. Basically, there are various organizations such as the UNHCR, WFP [World Food Program], the International Migration Organization, and the International Red Cross Council. According to the "White Paper on Refugees" the UNHCR issued last year, the number of refugees throughout the world was reported to be approximately 19 million. The number of refugees from Yugoslavia -- in the case of Yugoslavia, in addition to the "refugees," there are so-called "domestic refugees" who are taking refuge within the country -- shows a very large figure of 4.25 million. In the past, the problem of refugees used to be understood as a problem which tends to take place in developing countries. The problem of refugees of Yugoslavia can be considered a unique refugee problem taking place in an advanced area. Besides, though we talk about the former Yugoslavia, it consists of totally different areas. In particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina is a troubled area where the battle fronts are being built up with all the military forces jumbled together. In a normal situation, a battle takes place first, and then an international organ helps the refugees who have escaped from the front lines. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, however, the international organ goes to the spot where a conflict is taking place and develops its action to offer humanitarian aid. Moreover, in the recent conflict, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the three groups were, after all, competing with each other to secure their positions. In such a situation, though each group is supposed to welcome humanitarian aid under a normal situation, we had to face various political disturbances. I realized that the case of Yugoslavia is a very unique one in which the humanitarian aid is being offered under a very difficult situation where the conflicts and the problem of refugees are taking place concurrently. In Yugoslavia, we had the opportunity of listening to the opinions of personnel who are offering humanitarian aid under the UNHCR and the WFP; in Croatia, we visited the refugee camps operated by the Red Cross of Denmark; and in Serbia, we visited the refugee camps operated by the Serbian Government authorities in the locality. We realized that every facility is in a serious condition. One thing I want to say is that the form, or should I say the difficulty, of humanitarian aid differs depending on the place. Typically different is the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina where it is difficult to secure access even if we want to transport goods for humanitarian aid. In the case of Serbia and new Yugoslavia, the refugees and the weak are presently in a very tough situation because of the economic sanctions in addition to the chronically aggravated economic conditions. What Are the Opinions of Other Countries About Japan's Concern? [GAIKO FORUM] The actual situation seems quite different from Japanese press reports. Nevertheless, while speculations by neighboring countries, and speculations by Italy, the United States, and all the other European countries are being entangled with one another in addition to the UN activities, the activity of the Japanese people, such as Yasushi Akashi and Sadako Ogata and others, is being highlighted, though it may be accidental. It is likely that they might feel anxious about Japan's being concerned with the problems of former Yugoslavia. What is the reaction of the neighboring countries? [Yanai] As you mentioned, since days gone by, countries such as Austria, Turkey, Italy, France, Germany, and also Russia and other countries were very much concerned about the former Yugoslavia, or about the Balkan Peninsula if we take a broader area. In the past, there was a struggle among the great powers to expand their sphere of influence over the area. All the countries located on the Balkan Peninsula, including the former Yugoslavia, also once competed with one another for hegemony in their respective areas. However, the situation has changed today and, within the framework of the United Nations, all the countries are cooperating with each other to restore peace and to offer humanitarian aid. Although their interests are not completely identical as each country has its own national interests, at present there is fortunately no struggle among the great powers as was seen in the past. Japanese people have appeared on the stage under such circumstances. I think Japanese people are rather welcome to the arena, and there will be no negative feeling toward Japan as long as Japan also lends its hand to restore peace and to offer humanitarian aid. Additionally, regardless of districts, the people of the former Yugoslavia are very friendly to Japan. One reason may be that, historically, our country has never interfered in the area with any ambitions. Also, their feeling toward Japan is very friendly because there was a very favorable relationship between the two countries when Yugoslavia was the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In view of such relations, it is considered very natural for us to help the area one way or another. Also, by chance, Japanese citizens were appointed heads of the UN organizations having ties with the area. Ogata is the high commissioner for refugees, and Akashi is special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations in charge of Yugoslav problems. Also, there is another Japanese, Secretary General Hiroshi Nakajima of WHO. As WHO is also offering humanitarian aid with medical supplies and more, it turns out that the three organizations are coincidentally headed by Japanese. Although not because of this fact, we tend to feel like cooperating with these leaders. Yugoslavia in East Europe [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, in a sense the Cold War seems to have functioned as a kind of stabilizing factor for the Balkan situation, including the former Yugoslavia. However, it seems that this time the ethnic problem has erupted now that the stabilizing factor has been totally removed. How should we understand the future Yugoslav situation within the total framework of East Europe? [Okada] In East Europe, there is no other place where the ethnic problem is as complicated as in Yugoslavia. However, besides Yugoslavia, there are certain countries which are more or less involved in racial problems. As you know, as of 1 January 1993 Czechoslovakia was divided peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, there may have been other places where national consciousness was once sharply exalted when the stabilizing factor in the form of the Cold War was removed. However, they may have become rather prudent in their own way because of the miserable situation taking place in Yugoslavia. A potentially most serious problem besides that of Yugoslavia is that of the Hungarian people who are in foreign countries. In particular, about 600,000 Hungarians are included in the 5.3 million population of the new Slovakia, and nearly 2 million Hungarians are living in Romania's Transylvania. In addition, Hungarians are also living in the autonomous state of Vojvodina (in Serbia), north of Yugoslavia. Therefore, some people fear that, if the various problems taking place in Serbia lead to oppression of the minority race of Hungarians living in Yugoslavia, the oppression might stimulate the national consciousness of people of Hungarian descent, which might come to involve other areas. Another problem, which is considered a little more realistic threat, is the problem of the people of Albanian descent. About 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, Serbia, is Albanian, and, in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], south of Serbia, about 20 percent of its population is Albanian according to official statistics -- although Albanians claim the ratio should be over 40 percent. When we talk about FYROM, it should be understood that the Macedonian nation was first recognized by the late President Tito. Bulgarian people still think they are West Bulgarians, and the nationalistic Serbian people call them South Serbians. Greece also thinks FYROM was originally part of Greece. Such being the situation, there were two Balkan wars involving the area prior to World War I. In that sense, though the conflict is presently taking the form of a civil war within the former Yugoslavia, should relations between the Albanians and the Macedonians worsen, creating a conflict around the area, it is feared that an international conflict might take place involving Bulgaria and Greece in addition to Serbia and Albania. Comparison of the Situation With the Cambodian Peace [GAIKO FORUM] In the case of the Cambodian peace, we noticed the interesting phenomenon that all the people were somehow united under a symbolic person called Prince Sihanouk (the present king). In Yugoslavia, is there any person who can be a key person to bring about a peaceful solution of the conflicts? [Yanai] It is a very interesting idea to compare the Yugoslav situation with that of Cambodia. Certainly, in the case of Cambodia there is a charismatic figure called Sihanouk whom even the Pol Pot faction respects, thus making it possible to set up a framework for peace under him. To our regret, there is no such person in Yugoslavia. Though, in the past, there used to be a person called Tito, there is presently no one to replace him. Another difference is that, in the case of Cambodia, the Paris Peace Conference was held, and a very comprehensive agreement called the Paris peace accord was signed. The accord was not merely an agreement for a cease-fire, but it provided for the peace process as a whole. There is a framework formed by the countries concerned, including our country, to support this agreement, and PKO was carried out based on this framework. In the case of Yugoslavia, however, there is no such total framework for peace, thus creating a very difficult situation with peace talks being held on one hand, and the PKO and humanitarian activities being carried out on the other. [Yanai] Then, do you mean that the way for peace has not yet been paved [in former Yugoslavia] as in the case of Cambodia? [Yanai] I am afraid I should admit that. What Can Japan Do? -- The Form of Cooperation and Assistance [GAIKO FORUM] By the way, I want to ask what Japan can really do. What form of cooperation and assistance can Japan offer? Public opinion in Japan has also changed since the Cambodian peace was achieved. The opinions in the past supporting the one-nation pacifism have disappeared, and now the Japanese people think Japan should not offer economic assistance alone, but should make international contributions. However, there seems to be anxiety about the possibility of Japan's making an over-commitment as a political superpower. Taking such public opinion into consideration, what kind of contributions do you think possible for Japan? [Yanai] In the first place, various requests were presented by the local side during the process of our survey. Those requests may be roughly divided into three categories - requests by the countries constituting the former Yugoslavia, requests by the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, and requests from the standpoint of offering humanitarian aid. First, of the countries which constituted former Yugoslavia, Croatia, Slovenia, and FYROM, which have been recognized by our country, expressed both the government's and the private sectors' earnest desire to deepen their relationship [with Japan]. As a necessary step, they wanted to have Japanese embassies established in their countries. Particularly in the case of FYROM, because its economy is the most inferior of the former Yugoslav countries and, moreover, because the country has been separated due to the economic sanctions from Serbia and other countries which used to be traditional markets for FYROM, the country earnestly wants Japan to offer its economic cooperation, and to introduce Japanese private enterprises to the country. Also, for the time being, they earnestly want Japan to help them in dealing with the accumulated debts and more. Second, concerning the UNPROFOR headed by Akashi, it was earnestly requested that Japan send an administrative official to assist Akashi, and to meet the request it has been decided that Assistant Division Chief Tomiko Ichikawa of the UN Administrative Division, International Cooperation Department, Foreign Policy Bureau, is to be sent to the area as an administrative official. Also, in view of the successful experience in Cambodia, they requested that a venue for a conference with major countries be set up. The purpose of setting up the conference is that they want to perform their peace-seeking duties in Zagreb, capital of Croatia, where the UNPROFOR is headquartered, so they can hold discussions on various problems with ambassadors and other officials from the respective major countries and, therefore, they want Japan to be prepared to join the conference at the earliest stage possible. Also, as a general idea, we talked about the possibility of Japan sending staff members to the UNPROFOR or other unit of the PKO. Though it was not an official request by the United Nations, a PKO commanding officer in FYROM said in general terms that the PKO, which was developing the security operations, was in need of military monitors -- they are unarmed monitors -- and, therefore, it would be welcome if Japan could send such staff members. Also, it was reported that transportation and other equipment were in short supply. Third, three requests were presented with respect to the humanitarian aid. It was reported that, although refugees were being taken care of at present either by the refugee camps or by general households, there were in any case not enough facilities to receive all the refugees. And Japan was asked for aid in this respect. In the case of the former Yugoslavia -- different from Cambodia -- solidly built houses are necessary as the refugees are in cold areas. Second, with regard to humanitarian aid which is being offered by international organizations other than the UNHCR, such as WHO, UNICEF, and the International Red Cross, it was expressed in a general form that, while Japan had already been largely cooperating with these organizations, they expect Japan to continue its aid in the future. The third point was with regard to medical problems. They said that, in the former Yugoslavia, they have doctors, nurses, and hospital buildings. However, there is a serious shortage of medical equipment and medicines. [Okada] Different from the case of Cambodia, I do not think Japan is going to be deeply involved in the problem of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. So far, the EC has been taking the initiative [in dealing with the problem of peace in Yugoslavia], with the United Nations helping the EC in matters which it cannot deal with. The peace talks in Yugoslavia have been chaired jointly, literally, by Owen, representing the EC (EU), and Stoltenberg, representing the United Nations. Behind the peace talks are NATO and the military power of the United States trying to find a way toward peace. I do not think there is any chance for us to enter the scene and to play an actual role in forming a framework for peace. What Mr. Akashi actually does will not be to take part in the peace-seeking process. Anyway, we are going to continuously observe the situation with interest, and we may be asked to play a role within our capacity. What we have been doing is to participate in sanctions, to put political pressure on the parties concerned, and to participate in talks. I do not think there is any role different in quality from these to be played by us in the future. There are also other fields Japan should do something about. For instance, it seems important to build up relations with those countries which have attained independence. In the case of FYROM, for example, new conflicts might take place should the living conditions of the people be aggravated. To prevent such a situation from taking place, Japan is expected to cooperate in elevating the economic level of the society. I think that, from now on Japan should offer its help in these fields to the extent possible. The national administrative structure of Japan is very rigid, and it is not possible to promptly set up an embassy even if a new nation is formed. Only two or three embassies have recently been established even in the former USSR. Therefore, it is important to deal with the situation, making the most of the already existing systems. The problem is, for instance, how to deal with a country like FYROM. No ambassador has been assigned to our embassy in Belgrade as the situation does not allow us to do so, and it is also not possible to take a plane from the area because it has been subjected to sanctions. We must drive for hours to get there. Telephone connections are also terrible. We should first take such local conditions into account when we try to do something in the area. Another problem is how to maintain Japan's presence in these areas. For instance, I was very impressed to see a bonkei [a tray landscape] at a hotel where we stayed in FYROM. It was gorgeous. While there are only a few Japanese married to local citizens, there is an association called the Macedonia [FYROM]-Japan Association with one thousand and several hundred members, and everyone is studying about Japan very hard. From a broader point of view, we want to study in what area and in what form we can offer our assistance to such areas. [Nagasaki] Though it is not well known, Japan has offered aid to the former Yugoslavia through international organizations in the considerably large amount of $82 million. As far as the former Yugoslavia is concerned, the total sum of our aid as of the end of November 1993 ranked the third in the world, next to EC and the United States. We intend to exert ourselves to effectively meet the needs of the locality, and to offer aid in such a form that Japan's cooperation is really appreciated by the beneficiaries. [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.
