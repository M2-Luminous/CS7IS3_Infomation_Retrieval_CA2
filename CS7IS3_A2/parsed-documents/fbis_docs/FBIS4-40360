At a news conference held in the Russian State Duma representatives of the "Russia's Choice" called on the president to suspend the decree. Lawmaker Viktor Pokhmelkin pointed out that he proceeds from the necessity to carry out a resolute, efficient and step-by-step fight against bandits, but this should be done in strict compliance with the constitution and should by no means infringe on constitutional guarantees of the rights and freedoms of an individual, including in the sphere of criminal court investigation, which have been guaranteed today. In the opinion of the "Russia's Choice" faction, the president's decree, and paragraph 1 in particular, contains clauses which obviously run contrary both to the Constitution and the Russian criminal code. In particular, the decree allows to conduct an examination before criminal proceedings are instituted with the results of the examination considered as evidence. This runs contrary to Article 109 of the Criminal Code which says that no investigating activities can be conducted before criminal proceedings are instituted, except for the examination of the place where a crime was committed. It is presumed that no sanctions shall be used against the suspects, such as a written promise not to leave the place, the release on bail or on security. According to Article 89 of the Criminal Code, the settlement of all these problems is in the competence of an investigator, a prosecutor or court only. The decree stipulates that it is possible to detain a suspect on the above-mentioned charges for the period of up to 30 days, while Article 22 of the Criminal Code says that a suspect can be detained for no more than 72 hours. All this shows that the president has exceeded his constitutional powers and practically made addenda and amendments to the Criminal Code in effect today, while addenda and amendments to the Criminal Code can be made only by law, which shall be adopted by the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, the lawmaker said. At the same time, the "Russia's Choice" faction believes that provisions of the Constitution on the right of the defendant to defence, the presumption of innocence and compliance with the law when conducting a criminal investigation have been violated as well, the lawmaker said.
