In an article today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that Iraq's international image is shining, and that its brightness will extinguish the light in the eyes of evildoers, defeatists, and dollar worshipers. The paper goes on to say: The reason the embargo, along with Ekeus, have been pushed into a corner is manifested in the fact that Ekeus has continued to evade the issue of setting a date for the start of "long-term monitoring" per Resolution 715, although this monitoring actually started before the beginning of this year. The paper says that for some time, there have been increasing Arab and international calls for lifting the unfair embargo clamped on Iraq. In this regard, the paper notes the statements made by former French Defense Minister Jean-Bernard Chevenement, who has described the anti-Iraq embargo as an objectionable scandal for humanity, adding that he is indignant over the suffering the embargo is causing to Iraqi children. Commenting on those who have been blinded by malice, those who placed their destiny in the hands of Zionists and colonialists and spent the Arab nation's wealth buying consciences to ensure the perpetuation of the embargo against the Iraqi children, women, and elderly, the paper urges them to correct their positions and come to their senses.
