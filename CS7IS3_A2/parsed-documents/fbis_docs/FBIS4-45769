And it is unlikely that various political forces will not want to take advantage of that fact. Especially since water wars are not uncommon in the history of Central Asia. In the hot summer of 1850 a unit set out from Khiva in the direction of Staryy Urgench: Khiva's ruler, Mukhammed-Emin, had ordered the construction of a dam on the Sharkrauk. The Turkmen tribes that paid the khan a "blood tribute" by sending their young men to serve in his forces had rebelled. And Mukhammed-Emin decided to put down the revolt by depriving the "yomut bandits" of water. Dams were erected everywhere to cut the yomuts off from the water of the Amu Darya. The yomuts took up arms. But the "water embargo" proved a powerful weapon. The yomuts were defeated and sued for peace. And in 1869 the khan allowed water to be released from the Amu Darya to the Turkmen lands through the Laudan Canal. Yet a much more bitter and more protracted "water war" occurred in the region after the arrival of Russia and the massive introduction of cotton cultivation. The 1920's. The Fergana Valley lies in smoke and blood. Red Army units are hunting down Basmaki units. A unit of Umar Ali's irregulars bursts into a village in Margilanskiy Rayon in the middle of the planting season. To punish the peasants for planting cotton the guerrillas cut down 54 people, and the rest were told that if they planted cotton again "a holy mound would be built with the villagers' heads." Umar Ali's "anti-cotton" sentiments were not the exception, but more likely the rule among the Basmaki. Incidentally, the fight over cotton in Central Asia began before the Bolsheviks arrived. Prior to the revolution virtually all uprisings in Central Asia were preceded by peasants' refusal to plant cotton. Just as soon as the fields were sown with traditional crops alarmed czarist officials sent off secret dispatches to the capital. These were followed by the arrival of punitive forces... It is a well-known fact that the Basmaki lost. For many years cotton was the deciding factor in the life of Soviet Central Asia, becoming a monoculture. The region's ecological system has simply not been able to withstand the pressure of this monoculture. It is interesting to note that the traditional irrigation system of Central Asia, which according to scientists took shape in approximately the middle of the first millennium B.C.E., existed virtually without significant change for more than two millennia.
