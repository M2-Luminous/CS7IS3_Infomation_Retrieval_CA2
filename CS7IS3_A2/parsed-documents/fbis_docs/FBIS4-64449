Helmut Steinel, who is responsible for relations with the Council of Ministers in the Secretariat General, gives two main reasons for that: The Bundestag elections in the middle of the term of the presidency, which goes to Bonn during the second half of the year as part of the rotation, and the problems of scarce funds. Steinel sees virtually no chance until the year 1999 for reducting the German net contribution to the European Union -- according to the Commission, all in all about 23 billion German marks [DM] -- that FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel has demanded. Until then, the financial distribution is determined by the decisions made at the summit in Edinburgh at the end of 1992. Only afterwards could there be an easing of the burden on the Germans, in particular when the transition period expires for the four would-be members (Sweden, Austria, Norway, Finland), during which their usual net contribution (about DM3 billion) will be halved. In Steinel's view, until then German payments to Brussels can be reduced only by saving more than in the past in the European Union. However, the Commission official is "skeptical regarding the will" of the 12 members "to save." For him it would already be a "success" of the German presidency, "if no new items for expenditure would be created." This, however, is in contradiction with the central tasks in the second half of the year: The implementation of the proposals by EU President Jacques Delors (white paper) to combat unemployment. With regard to the planned infrastructure projects, Steinel primarily expects "financing by the private sector" with, at best, minor interest subsidies from Brussels' coffers. In total, the preliminary draft of the Commission for the 1955 EU budget (German share: 28.4 percent) contains only ECU300 million (about DM550 million) for the white paper project. The budget, which amounts to DM137 billion this year, is to increase by 3.4 percent in 1995. A total of 58 percent of that is allocated to agricultural policy. Regarding this by far largest block of expenditures in particular, Bonn has "not always advocated saving" in the past. Thus, the protection of German farmers from the effects of the currency turbulence on agricultural prices last year cost the European Union about DM2 billion. Steinel does see one initiative to be started by future EU President Helmut Kohl: The chancellor wants to make his European affairs adviser Juergen Trumpf, state secretary in the Foreign Ministry, the new secretary general of the Council of Ministers -- "a very influential position."
