After consultations with his Czech counterpart, Josef Zieleniec, the Scandinavian guest met journalists at Cernin Palace. Miroslav Konvalina reports: [Konvalina] Haavisto stressed at the briefing that he talked with Josef Zieleniec, above all, about the security political situation in Europe and about bilateral relations, which he designated as very good. He said that Finland, just as Austria, Norway, and Sweden, should soon become a member of the European Union, where it will seek its security guarantees. Finland is not interested in entering NATO or any other security structures. It considers the Partnership for Peace, however, a good initiative for East European countries. In an interview for Radiozurnal, Haavisto praised the work of the Czech Republic in the Security Council.
