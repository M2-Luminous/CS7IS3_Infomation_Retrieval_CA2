In response to inquiries from the presidential staff, the government, and public organizations about the number of our servicemen, three of our highest-ranking generals gave different figures. Moreover, the gap between the figures amounts to over 20 divisions. Dmitriy Volkogonov said just before his removal from the post of presidential military adviser that 1.8 million men serve in the Russian Armed Forces. Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of General Staff, divulged that the Armed Forces include a total of 2.1 million servicemen. Defense Ministry Pavel Grachev, however, said that at present the Armed Forces are 2.341 million men strong.
