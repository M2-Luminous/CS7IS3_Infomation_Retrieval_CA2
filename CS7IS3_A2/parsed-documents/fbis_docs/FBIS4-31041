This was stated for SRNA by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the People's Assembly of the Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. As he said, he received this piece of information from Nikiforov, the Russian member of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia. Yasushi Akashi, special UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia, who held talks with the delegation of the Serbian Republic, is trying to persuade all the warring sides to take part in the continuation of the peace talks, Momcilo Krajisnik said. He stressed that the Muslim delegation is abusing the problem of Gorazde for the umpteenth time in order to obstruct peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The representatives of the Serbian Republic should hold informal talks in Geneva with Charles Redman, U.S. envoy for the former Yugoslavia.
