Japan's surpluses stand out among industrialized nations, but the country has a problem in ridding itself of economic recession. What we see is a vicious cycle of surpluses causing the high yen, the high yen worsening the recession, and then the recession increasing the surpluses. On top of that, there is the worldwide trend for decline of the dollar, and there are now growing apprehensions that the yen will go up further. On 4 May, led by the U.S. Treasury Department, central banks of about a dozen nations decided to collaborate in dollar-buying money market interventions to put a stop to the fall of the dollar. The Clinton administration has in the past accepted the conditions of the cheap dollar and the high yen as a way of pushing for correction of the imbalance in the trade surplus, but this time the U.S. administration made clear that it is changing that policy. The administration has also made its position clear that the excessivly low evaluation of the dollar does not serve the national interests. To look back on the times when the U.S. monetary authorities made active market interventions, there has hardly been an instance of the markets being impervious to such treatment. Many market observers think the U.S. authorities' shift of policy this time is working as a brake on the dollar's minicrisis. The U.S. authorities have apparently determined that the high yen and the high [German] mark will work adversely against the Japanese and European economies and this can boomerang against the U.S. economy. We hope this will become an opportunity for countries to have better policy coordination. The Hata government should make the most of this amicable atmosphere in policy cooperation and deal with the high yen problem by making active interventions in the market. The current-account surplus may be at the highest level ever, but changes are being seen in the basic tone of the expanding surplus. There is the definite trend of the export volume decreasing and the import volume rising. Exporters are coming to find it increasingly difficult to fill up high-yen-caused gaps in income by passing cost pressures on to local dollar-based prices. The growth rate of the surplus is slowing as well. There are many signs which suggest that the high yen cycle that started in 1990 is coming to an end. With all this happening, what the government should do now is come up with a daring surplus reduction target, and announce it to the world. It may be only an endeavour target, but still if it can help reverse the trend for the high yen soon, it surely will have served as an effective economic measure. When a target is set only to respond to pressure from the United States, the effect of it will diminish by half. The government must push for and carry out deregulation daringly, and must show the world that it is serious about reform of the economic and social structure. Meanwhile, there are excessive reactions in the money markets to the worldwide trend for the cheap dollar. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (FRB) in early February started taking the precautionary action of raising the short-term interest rates to prevent overheated economic conditions from causing inflation. It is said that U.S. long-term interest rates are reacting to these actions, causing prices of stocks and bonds to fall, and leading even the dollar to fall in the exchange market. There is now concern that there will be another Black Monday like we saw seven years ago. But as yet we do not see any indications that the U.S. economy will actually plunge into inflation, and we do not see any reason to expect long-term interest rates to keep on rising. Compared with seven years ago, conditions are different; take the cooperative relationship among the monetary authorities for instance. There was a major rift between the United States and Germany at that time. There remains the question of whether the U.S. financial deficit condition will really improve, but we hope the Clinton government will succeed with its health-care system reform and other programs. It looks like the German economy has hit bottom, and that European interest rates have stopped falling. It is probably true that the world's interest rates have bottomed out. It is not so rare to see the markets rocking in a transitional period like this. Being in such times, Japan and the United States need to have closer cooperation. The two countries should forget all that has passed, and resume the Japan-U.S. economic consultations without delay. It will serve as a good message to the markets.
