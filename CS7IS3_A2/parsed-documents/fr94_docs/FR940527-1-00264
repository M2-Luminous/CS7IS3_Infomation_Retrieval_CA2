FR940527-1-00264 FR940527-1-00014 The Commission believes the method and unit of payment should be comparable across settings. This consistency is necessary because the ambulatory services offered by hospitals are also furnished in other sites, such as free-standing surgery centers and physician offices. Moreover, most ambulatory care is provided outside of hospital settings. Additionally, the various payment methods and units that Medicare employs for ambulatory services encourage choosing the site of service on the basis of financial rather than clinical considerations. Finally, the lack of payment comparability across sites inhibits efforts to control overall health care expenditures. Although the same method and unit should be used to determine payment to all providers of ambulatory services, the payment rate may vary for different providers and across treatment sites. There are many reasons why costs may differ among similar providers (such as teaching and non-teaching hospitals) and across treatment sites (such as hospitals and physician offices). The Commission believes it is desirable to recognize in the payment system those factors that represent a benefit to society and are beyond the control of the provider, such as the costs associated with medical education. Further, these costs should be shared more broadly across the health care system to avoid financial discrimination against teaching facilities. Medicare should establish a prospective payment rate per unit of service based on methods currently used in other settings. Such a system would go a long way toward improving the financial incentives to providers by rewarding efficiencies in service provision and penalizing inefficiencies. ProPAC recognizes that such a system should be only an interim measure, however, because it does not control the growth in volume of services. The Commission therefore recommends that an outpatient prospective payment system be implemented as soon as possible to incorporate volume control measures. The payment should move from a fee for an individual service to a larger payment unit containing more services. Such a bundled approach, along with the integration of hospital-provided outpatient services into the physician volume performance standards, is necessary to control outpatient expenditures. ProPAC will submit additional recommendations to the Congress as part of its analysis of the pending report from the Secretary on outpatient payment. Problems with the current payment method, however, should not be ignored until a new system for outpatient services is fully implemented. Features of the current system that encourage cost and charge inflation and increase beneficiary liability should be changed immediately. Recommendation 21: Revision of the Payment Formula for Outpatient Services Until prospective payment systems can be implemented for hospital outpatient services, the blend formula used to calculate hospital payments for ambulatory surgery center-approved procedures, radiology services, and diagnostic services should be revised. The formula should subtract beneficiary copayment after the total payment has been calculated. The resulting reduction in Medicare program payments to hospitals should be used to partially offset increases in program expenditures due to reducing beneficiary liability. The total Medicare payment for certain ambulatory surgery, radiology, and other diagnostic services is based on the lesser of costs, charges, or a blended amount. The beneficiary's copayment is 20 percent of charges. Medicare's share is intended to be the total payment amount minus the beneficiary copayment. For facilities paid the blended amount, however, program payments are not reduced by the full amount of the copayment. Thus, total payments to hospitals for outpatient services are higher than the Congress intended. The formula that determines the blended amount combines two parts: the first is the hospital-specific portion of payment based on the lesser of costs or charges minus 20 percent of charges; the second is the prospective portion based on 80 percent of the applicable prospective rate. For ambulatory surgery, the prospective rate is the payment for the relevant procedure category used in paying free-standing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). For radiology and diagnostic services, it is a portion of the payment in the physician fee schedule that is intended to represent the technical expense of providing that service. The second part of the formula, calculated at 80 percent of the prospective rate, inappropriately assumes that 20 percent of the prospective rate equals 20 percent of charges (the copayment). In fact, charges are usually much higher than the prospective rate. Because the full contribution of beneficiary cost sharing is not captured. Medicare's share of hospital payments is overstated. To correct the formula, the copayment should be subtracted after the calculation of the total amount. For ambulatory surgery, the current and the corrected payment calculations are illustrated in Figure 2&hyph;1. The Commission believes the current blend formula results in payments to hospitals that are higher than the Congress intended. Additionally, this quirk in the formula provides a strong incentive for hospitals to increase charges, which increases beneficiary liability and total payments to the hospital.
