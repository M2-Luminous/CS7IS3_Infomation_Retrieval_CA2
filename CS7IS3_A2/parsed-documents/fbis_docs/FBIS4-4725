Noting that the UNSC published its presidential statement on March 31 making irrational demands and urging us to allow additional unjust inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the statement pointed out: The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here. Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the course of the inspection, they should be settled between the agency and the inspected country -- the actual parties concerned with the inspection. Nevertheless, the UNSC discussed our issue based on the IAEA Board of Governors unjust and biased conclusion that the scope of the noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been broadened. It is clearly contrary to the purpose and principle of the UN Charter. If the UNSC truly wants to fulfill its mission, it should raise an issue with the United States, which is posing grave threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with a huge amount of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to the solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean authorities, the perpetrator of the United States. The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the safeguards accord in the president's statement and sided with the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK. Before demanding additional inspections of us, the UNSC must first take steps to correct the unjust action by the IAEA Secretariat, which has expanded its unjust treatment while currying favor with the big country. The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for further widening the area of unfair treatment while openly joining the U.S. anti-republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA Secretariat has gradually expanded the unfair treatment. We will repay this without fail. Under the present situation in which the United States is onesidedly clinging to pressure after overturning all promises made to us, we have no choice but to normalize peaceful nuclear activities, which we had unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States and the South Korean authorities are attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with the presidential statement of the UN Security Council. However, this cannot fool us. The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the single- hearted united might of our party, the people, and the People's Army will be. Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin. Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is consistent.
