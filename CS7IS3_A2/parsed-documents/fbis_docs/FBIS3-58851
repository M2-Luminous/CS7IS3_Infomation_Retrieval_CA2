In domestic policy, one blunder followed the other, especially in personnel matters. To date, many of his candidates are still in limbo between being confirmed by the Senate and sinking into oblivion. Foreign policy did not take place -- and if it did, it deserved the rating: "idea good, execution inadequate." After one year in office, Clinton deserves a 2. In domestic policy, he has meanwhile shown a good performance. Cutting the deficit has begun and a general health insurance and the control of portable firearms are under way. Following Somalia (3-) and Haiti (5), he got three good marks in foreign policy: for concluding GATT, for ratifying the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico (NAFTA), and finally, Clinton's top performance at the NATO summit. Unfortunately, however, it is not just the bitter cold at home that troubles him on his first anniversary. In time for the anniversary, a special public prosecutor was appointed to look into the Clinton's alleged embezzlements in connection with the Whitewater company. The same thing happened to Richard Nixon, and that is why Washington now has a Whitewatergate. What if the affair ends up in smoke? In this case, Clinton has the best chances of getting reelected in 1996. For, the economy is finally recovering and, as we all know, election results are predetermined by the purse.
