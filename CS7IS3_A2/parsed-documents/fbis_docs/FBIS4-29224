Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong and others officials concerned attended the reception. Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam delivered a speech at the reception. He said he would like to believe that Mr. Carter's unusual current visit to our country would mark a good sign in gradually turning the distrust and hostility lasting between the two countries into relations of friendship, amity, and mutual respect [chimi kato sonsaengui pomsangchi anun ibon urinara pangmuni tunara saie chisoktoegoinnun pulsingwa choktaegamul sollingwa uho hosang chonjunguro chomcha pakkuo nagalsu innun choun chingjorago mitkkosiptta]. He said that it is the current trend of international relations to advance toward reconciliation, friendship, and cooperation after the Cold War ended, and that it is also the common desire of the peoples of the two countries to establish normal relations [chongsangjogin kwangyerul maennun kosun] between the DPRK and the United States by ending [chongsan] hostile relations between them. He said: If the United States respects our country's sovereignty and treats it as an equal partner by discarding the concept of confrontation with us, the pending issues between the DPRK and the United States, including the nuclear issue, will be resolved satisfactorily and the two countries can live on good terms with each other. He believes that this will immediately contribute to peace in Asia and the rest of the world. He said that Jimmy Carter, crossing through Panmunjom, would have directly witnessed the tragic division of the Korean peninsula, as well as felt the pain of the Korean people -- the same nation with the same blood, who has suffered for nearly 50 years because of its artificial division on the single territory and added: Our people ardently desire reunification and hope for a true peace. Also, he said: I believe that you will be able to deliver our people's resolute desire for peace and our Republic's peace-loving position to the people of the United States and to the social circles throughout the world the way they really are [kunun ttohan tangsinduri uriinminui kyongyolhan tongil yolmanggwa uri konghwagukui pyonghwa aehojokin ipchangul migugindulka segye sahoegyee sasil kutaero chondal harirago minnundago malhaessupnida]. He said: I think that Jimmy Carter's visit, made at his own initiative, and that of his entourage would lead to a thaw in the frozen relations between the two countries and to creating a peaceful environment. He stated: I hope that I can meet various U.S. politicians, including Mr. Carter, to openheartedly exchange views in the future as well. Then, Jimmy Carter delivered a speech. He said that he is very pleased to come to the DPRK after anticipating it for three years. He said: The time has come to establish overall relations, including full friendship, understanding, trade, and exchange of visits, between the two countries. [tunaraga wanjonhan chinsongwa ihae muyok insa kyoryurul pirotan chonmyonjogin kwangyerul surip halttaega toettago hamyonso] The United States is ready to render its due cooperation to the DPRK to achieve this goal [i mokchogul sirhyonhame issoso ungdang chosonminjujuui inmin konghwagukkwa hyopchohal chunbiga toeo ittago malhaessumnida]. He pointed out that it is the nuclear issue that has created a big misunderstanding between North Korea and the United States at present, and that if the nuclear issue is resolved clearly and the misunderstanding is removed, progress can be made in solving other problems. He pointed out that he could not but feel sadness when he saw the division of Korea, crossing over the Demilitarized Zone today, and that the U.S. leaders believe that Korea should be reunified peacefully without fail, [migugui chodojadurun chosoni pandusi pyonghwajoguro tongil toeoya handago mitkko issumyo] and that he also believes that it can be done. He said: Despite the differences in opinions between the two countries, those problems can be easily solved when the two countries make efforts together to achieve their common goals. These problems can be solved by direct talks between the two countries and their mutual understanding can be promoted as well [iwagwaun munjewa kwanryonhayo chijop hoedamul tonghayo hosangihaerul chungjin sikil su iddago malhaetta]. Participants in the reception proposed a toast for the friendship, peace of the people of the two countries, for the long life and good health of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and for the good health of Mr. Jimmy Carter. Pyongyang artists performed at the reception.
