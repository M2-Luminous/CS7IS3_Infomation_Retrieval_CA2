Both assume this will take place on 24 April, even though the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] has not been able to officially decree the date of the runoff. Despite heavy technological investment in the TSE, after two weeks, the country still does not know the official outcome of the elections. It had been pompously announced that the results would be available just hours after polling places closed, but the TSE was not even able to supply overall preliminary figures. A lack of openness, impartiality, and effectiveness on 20 March hindered the vote count. The same structural deficiencies have caused the opposition to report fraudulent acts and challenge the election results in 44 municipalities. Nevertheless, the most probable outcome will be that the TSE will dismiss these reports to end, as soon as possible, an electoral process that got out of control. The vote count in these elections has not been much different from those in previous elections. ARENA would like to avoid a runoff, because a first-round victory would make the outcome indisputable and give ARENA a pretext to continue ruling as if it has the complete support of El Salvador's citizens. The truth of the matter, however, is that ARENA only received 25 percent of the vote from those citizens registered. ARENA's untamed ambition for power led it to commit illegitimate acts on 20 March -- acts whose limits are still unknown. If these acts were a determining factor in the final results, ARENA will have to repeat them with the serious risk of getting caught. On the other hand, the coalition is ready for the runoff elections, because it believes that the people's vote is a commitment that cannot and should not be negotiated with the ruling party, and because it wants to show its ability to provide strong opposition in light of the fact that it will be very difficult to win the runoff. The coalition's task is not at all easy. The Christian Democrats, who were divided among those who would like to support ARENA and the coalition, decided not to support either. The small parties also do not appear willing to back the coalition directly. Even though the immediate electoral outlook does not favor the coalition, the runoff election could be an important contribution to the nation's democratic future, especially if one seriously considers the need to totally reform the electoral system after 24 April. Moreover, such a reform process should begin immediately and, in turn, remedy the most easily correctable anomalies in the little time remaining before the runoff elections. Unfortunately, for the time being, it is practically impossible to correct the most serious anomalies. The runoff elections provide a new opportunity to move ahead toward the democratization of the country, but for this to take place, the electoral event has to be radically transformed.
