The measure, modelled on Hong Kong practice, will be implemented later this year. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will be the first in China to try this approach to industrial safety. A government document issued last month indicates enterprises with 50 to 200 workers must hire an acting safety officer. Those with more than 200 must have a full-time one. And for industries classified as dangerous, special safety units must be established. The same will apply to large-scale industries that control a number of subsidiaries, a Shenzhen municipal official responsible for labour safety said. The official, who identified himself only as Mr Lo said training courses were being prepared for the safety officers, who would have to be registered with the government to be eligible for the job. Although at present large-scale and state-controlled enterprises in China usually have safety units, they are not obligatory. And for foreign-funded factories, except in highly organised ones, safety units are a rarity. Guangdong Labour Bureau safety chief Tan Shaofen said that when accidents happened in these enterprises, owners would be penalised. Over the past two years serious industrial accidents have been reported in southern China, some resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries, and occurring most often in factories funded by Hong Kong and Taiwan interests. "It's futile simply to hold owners responsible," Mr Lo said. "And the newly issued document stipulates that anyone who wishes to open a factory has to employ safe ty officers" he said. He said the new safety officers needed to be properly trained in the relevant laws and regulations, industrial safety, and what to do in case of accidents. The new policy would be fully implemented in the SEZ within two years, Mr Lo said. Mr Tan said there was no plan at present to adopt the system in other parts of Guangdong, although he said Shenzhen was moving in the right direction. "We will keep a close eye on it," he said. Mr Tan explained that "the system in Shenzhen is different. All enterprises there come directly under the SEZ government, while here we have bosses like the labour bureau, the union". But he was quick to point out that foreign-funded enterprises could not be exempted from Chinese laws on industrial safety. Mr Tan said his department suffered from a shortage of staff. This had paralyzed, to a certain extent, the enforcement of laws and regulations on industrial safety, particularly in foreign-funded enterprises. "We have to rely on local governments to monitor the situation. They will be responsible for any accidents occurred. And the owners of foreign enterprises will also be charged," he said.
