Hebei's 110 deputies, who were deliberating Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report," were very happy when they learned that General Secretary Jiang Zemin was coming to see them. At 9:10 A.M., General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Deputy Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, entered the Hebei Hall of the Great Hall of the People chatting to each other. The Hebei delegation of deputies, who were waiting to have a group picture taken with the general secretary in the hall, applauded warmly in welcome. General Secretary Jiang Zemin cordially shook hands and chatted with the Hebei deputies. The deputies extended greetings to him. The atmosphere in the hall was warm and relaxed in the few minutes before the group picture was taken. After the group picture was taken with the delegation, General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered an ebullient speech. He said: Hebei is very close to Beijing. I think I understand the situation in Hebei. Hebei's work was done pretty well last year. What I want to say is: The central authorities have already set major policies -- that is, Comrade Xiaoping's speeches made during his South China tour, the guidelines of the 14th party congress, and the 50 points set by the Third Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee. It is crucial to do a good job of implementing them. First of all, we should enable leading cadres at all levels to understand and grasp these major policies. To help people grasp the 50 points, relevant departments have produced a video with narratives for study reference. We should study while working. At this point, the general secretary incidentally asked Deputy Ye Liansong, governor of Hebei Province: "What did you major in college?" "I majored in engineering," Ye Liansong answered. Then, the general secretary sighed with emotion and said: "Many of our leading comrades majored in engineering and technology. Now we are establishing a socialist market economy, and it will not work without a knowledge of economics. Economics is a great branch of science, but it cannot be grasped overnight. So we must make arduous efforts to study it and study it systematically." The general secretary then continued to say: "Capitalist countries have been engaged in market economies for hundreds of years, and they have indeed gained some experience which reflects general patterns and it would help us to learn. It is the first time that we have established a socialist market economy. So it is all the more necessary for us to study in practice. We have set major policies. We should continue to explore new ways and gain more experiences in practice. I place great hopes on you comrades. I'll learn, practice, and work together with you." Immediately following the general secretary's remarks, Cheng Weigao said: "We will do our work conscientiously." As he said farewell to the Hebei delegation, Jiang Zemin cordially remarked: "I hope that Hebei reaps a good grain and cotton harvest this year." At this, the deputies burst into applause.
