Therefore, it seems that the tedious nuclear tug-of-war has overcome one stage for the time being. The result of this negotiation may have been a choice under the necessity of avoiding a catastrophe. It is a result which is somewhat unsatisfactory. What was agreed upon at the negotiations between North Korea and the United States was to carry out limited inspection. This is an agreement which is worse than the conditions that were met before North Korea announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March of 1993. North Korea is claiming that since it has withheld its withdrawal from the NPT, it is not a full member country of the NPT. Therefore, it is saying that allowing the one-time inspection is not an obligation but a form of cooperation. This does not even meet the condition of the ordinary [tongsang] inspection that could have been carried out before the demand for inspection was made by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on unreported nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. As such, North Korea is carrying out acts lacking international level but on the other hand it is gaining profits. North Korea has fulfilled its demand of making us withhold the Team Spirit exercise and obtained direct contact with the United States since March. While North Korea achieved such results, not one demand by our side was met. In the beginning, the United States had demanded that North Korea accept complete nuclear inspections. However, the United States made a strategic compromise as a last resort to make North Korea receive complete nuclear inspections by committing North Korea to the NPT system. The U.S. plan is that rather than breaking off negotiations, it hopes to maintain a dialogue to consecutively resolve issues at the next high-level talks. Therefore, the remaining problem at this point is on how negotiations will progress between North Korea and the IAEA to discuss the method and time of the inspection. It is uncertain whether the IAEA will agree on the method of a one-time inspection which will stop at examining the continuity and safety of North Korea's nuclear inspection. If such an inspection is carried out, it will be regarded as a bad precedent. A more important issue is whether North Korea will show a sincere attitude in the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks as anticipated. Judging from North Korea's means of dialogue up until now, we cannot rule out the fact that North Korea may lead the high-levdl talks to slow progress by launching its offensive in waves through endlessly new conditions and proposals. The U.S. strategy is to reach an agreement on inspection of unreported facilities at the high-level talks but it is expected that there will be many critical stages. As a result of its interest in negotiations with the United States up until now, North Korea may well treat South-North dialogue superficially. That kind of sign has appeared on several occasions. We must be prepared to defend our firm principle of guaranteeing North Korea's nuclear transparency and securing South-North dialogue.
