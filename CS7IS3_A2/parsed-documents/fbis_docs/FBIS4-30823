Keri; place and date not given: "We Do Not Need Redeemers"] [Text] [Keri] What do you expect from your party's extraordinary congress on 4 June? Apart from you, does anyone else have a chance to be nominated as candidate for the position of prime minister? [Horn] The congress must decide about the possible coalition partners of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and also about the person who will be the party's candidate for the position of prime minister. Naturally, if the congress asks me to play this role, I will accept it. As for other possible candidates, I do not know of anyone, I do not have information about this; we will see how things develop. [Keri] In your view, how long will the coalition talks last and when can a new government be formed? [Horn] It is difficult to predict this, but I think that the coalition talks can end within one or a maximum of one-and-a-half months, and a new government can be formed by mid-July at the latest. [Keri] Do you think it is wrong that the names of certain figures were made public prematurely as members of the new government? [Horn] No. I think that we need a government of experts and I would welcome both Ferenc Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the next government. Of course, this does not yet mean any commitment but the aforementioned people are not MSZP members; on the other hand, they are experts of European reknown in their fields. I think that such viewpoints will also emerge at the coalition talks. [Keri] Have you already asked the aforementioned persons whether they would accept a ministerial position? [Horn] We have not held any committing talks but, naturally, I asked them whether they would accept such a role in the next government. After all, this still depends on many things.... [Keri] What if the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] agrees after all to form a coalition with the MSZP but they do not accept you as prime minister? [Horn] I do not think that the SZDSZ will come up with such a condition; the SZDSZ is much cleverer than that. Not to mention the fact that, today, most people in the SZDSZ leadership regard Balint Magyar's declarations as hasty. If they come up with any similar condition, this might hinder or even foil the formation of a coalition. I must add that the issue is not primarily about myself. It is rather about the fact that coalition talks that start with preconditions do not augur well. [Keri] How much chance do you give to an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition? [Horn] I see very big chances for this. Of course, there is no 100-percent guarantee for anything, but it seems that both parties have a strong willingness for coalition cooperation. [Keri] Do you completely exclude the possibility of a coalition with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]? [Horn] At the end of February, we said that we do not exclude the possiblity of a coalition with a KDNP free of extremism, because we judge quite a few things similarly. However, the campaign experience shows that the KDNP did not quite succeed in changing its style. They used a rather extremist tone, and this did not prove to be profitable for them. [Keri] The new government is also facing tough and unpopular decisions. Do you think that you will lose the support of our society in a short time and the events of 1990 will repeat themselves, namely you will lose the local government elections? [Horn] I do not fear that, because the new government will represent a totally different style than the current one. By this I mean that the new government will conduct an open policy and will not sign any secret agreement. We will sincerely present Hungary's real situation to the public, the "heritage" we received, and the very difficult tasks awaiting solution, tasks the new government will have to confront. On the other hand, the government will continue the social dialogue successfully used by the MSZP in the past four years. Contrary to the current government, we do not want to have confrontations with various strata of our society; instead, we will endeavor to come to an agreement with them. This could be one of the guarantees for a long-term activity of the new government. The other guarantee is that every government decision should be based on the view that the government is acting in the interest of a large majority of our society. Of course, all this cannot bring a spectacular improvement overnight. Most probably a considerable amount of time must pass for the people also to feel the changes in their everyday life. I can confidently say that, no matter how bad our situation is, it is not hopeless. We can stabilize the situation while definitely improving the situation of those mostly in need. However, we can only achieve considerable improvement in one or two years. [Keri] According to [departing prime minister] Peter Boross, it is useless to prepare any inventory, because you are quite aware of Hungary's situation. [Horn] I highly respect Mr. Boross for really doing everything in his power for the benefit of smooth elections, and I hope the same will apply to the second round. But Mr. Boross promised to present Hungary's real situation to the public. I do not see that the government did this. The government still has to prepare the bill and show the commitments it accepted and the commitments it will leave for its successor. Mr. Boross is giving evasive answers. I would really like him to think things over: He would also benefit from adequate relations between the government and the opposition in the next parliament. [Keri] Mr. Boross also said that he would like to hold a detailed conversation with his successor on what mistakes the new government should avoid and what values it should preserve. If you become the prime minister, what will you expect from this conversation? [Horn] I am open to any dialogue. Obviously, a departing prime minister can give very serious and wise advice to the new government. It is another matter to what extent the new prime minister can use this advice, because it is possible that things that Peter Boross finds very useful are regarded as nonessential things by us. Not accidentally, we would like to have a different policy and style from the one carried out by the current government. However, we would welcome a regular dialogue between Peter Boross and the other future opposition leaders and the future government parties. [Keri] What attitude would you regard as desirable in the new parliament? [Horn] I find it extremely important to ask the opinion of the opposition when preparing the laws, as well as the efforts for coming to an agreement. Even if the MSZP and the SZDSZ got a two-thirds majority in parliament, we would still endeavor to hold coordinating talks with the opposition by considering Hungary's interests. For example, clarifying the authority and jurisdiction of the president of the republic could be such an issue. I must point out that this would not mean any limitation. Something else: The opposition is also interested in legislating a good media law as soon as possible. I very much hope that, in line with their promises, they will play a really constructive opposition role. [Keri] What is your opinion about the claim that an MSZP-SZDSZ two-thirds majority would carry the danger of a parliamentary dictatorship? [Horn] A dictatorship would emerge if laws threatening democracy were legislated. I do not think, and I even find it an irresponsible and empty talk, that anyone presumes that the MSZP or the SZDSZ has such intentions. It is useless to threaten people with such things. [Keri] In connection with this, what is your opinion about Matyas Szuros' recent declaration that Hungary would also benefit if the MSZP did not win too much? [Horn] I find this ridiculous, because I cannot explain the meaning of "winning too much" [tulnyer]. What should one understand by this? If the MSZP achieved results close to an absolute majority, it could assert its views more successfully than with smaller results. Therefore, I would very much like Matyas Szuros to stop making such declarations. [Keri] In connection with Miklos Nemeth, you said that people who struggled for the election results do not like it if someone joins the finished house.... [Horn] I am glad you asked this question because the answer appears in print and this can be interpreted much more exactly than the spoken statement. By ready-made situation I meant that the MSZP achieved a considerable election result without Miklos Nemeth. The ready-made situation does not mean that Hungary is in some kind of a rosy state. Regarding Miklos Nemeth, in January we offered him the possibility to return to Hungarian political life. He was unable to accept this, but we did not rebuke him for this; we understood him. When it became clear that there is a debate regarding the person to be nominated as our candidate for the position of prime minister, one could hear voices saying that Miklos Nemeth will come and this will solve all the dilemmas. He will not be able to solve this because there are no redeemers. Hungary needs very tough and hard working people, rather than redeemers. One who has not lived through the struggles of past years is not really aware of Hungary's real situation, because this could not be sensed clearly either in London or Paris. I stress, however, that we would very much welcome Miklos Nemeth's future return to Hungarian political life because we are talking here about a valuable person. But this is not an issue for us today. [Keri] Do you find it necessary to change the current government structure? [Horn] By all means, but I would caution the new government not to start some kind of a radical reorganization. In my view, we definitely need an efficient economic cabinet and its head should have full authority. It was an impossible situation that four finance ministers replaced each other in the past four years and that economic ministers were constantly forced to confront each other and often forced to play against each other. Such a situation only harms the country. In addition, I am against any kind of amalgamation. I find it more important to eliminate quite a few offices. Compensations should end next year, and so should the Compensation Office. The National Information Office is absolutely useless and I do not know whether it is necessary to have an office for ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders (although I can be convinced with proper arguments) because, in my opinion, the Foreign Ministry can carry out these tasks. In my view, managing the privatization affairs should be settled and the National Property Agency [AVU] and the State Trust Fund Ltd [AV Rt] should be amalgamated. In other words, we need a streamlined state administration by all means. [Keri] Can you envisage the restoration of the position of deputy prime minister? [Horn] I do not see much sense in this, although I am open to any argument. However, I do not find it a positive thing when a new government reorganizes everything. [Keri] What is your opinion about Peter Boross' declaration that, according to Western European practice, the largest opposition party should fill the position of parliament chairman? An example of this was in 1990 when Arpad Goncz became chairman of the parliament and then president of the Republic. [Horn] This is a very nice statement; interestingly enough, it is formulated when the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is forced into the opposition. Arpad Goncz was chairman of the parliament for a very short time, until he was elected president of the Republic, and this was part of the MDF-SZDSZ pact. I do not find it necessary at all that the opposition should provide the chairman of the National Assembly. In my opinion, one of the parties that received the largest support should provide the chairman of the National Assembly. As for Peter Boross' statement, there are indeed countries where the representative of the opposition fills the position of parliament chairman. However, in neighboring Austria, for example, the deputy chairman of the ruling Social Democratic Party fills the position of parliament chairman. So, one does not have to go too far to refute this statement about the "Western European" practice.
