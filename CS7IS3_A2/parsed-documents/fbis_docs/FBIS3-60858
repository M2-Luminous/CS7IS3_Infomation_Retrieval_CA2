The kidnappers are still holding up three boys, a bus driver and two pilots. As soon as weathermen announced that the weather permitted flight, the terrorists ordered the helicopter to be tugged by a tractor to a remote runway. [passage omitted] The four terrorists have not been identified yet. Officials said the computer sketches of them are available and a photofit picture of one of the kidnappers, made with the help of the teenager hostages and their teacher which were freed on Friday (one boy was freed Saturday morning) in return for a $10 million ransom, was shown on Russian television. Officials hope that some of the televiewers will be able to identify the terrorists and supply additional data that may help to free the remaining hostages. [passage omitted] ITAR-TASS correspondent in Rostov-on-Don, where nine teenagers and their teacher were kidnapped on Thursday, quoted the school principal as saying that the terrorists declared that they all were AIDS-infected and are going abroad for medical treatment. They also promised the hostages to give them money and take them abroad. The principal, Valentina Fedoseyeva, said that "the children burst into laughter when three masked men armed with assault rifles burst into their class." They thought it was a joke staged by their military instructor and only after the attackers fired three rounds into the ceiling did the children realise it was serious.
