We can be proud of the fact that the Croatian people have contributed greatly to the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Today's official opening of the Croatian Embassy in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a sign that we are implementing resolutely the Washington agreement on the creation of the federation of the Bosniaks and the Croats and the confederation with Croatia, Dr. Tudjman said. He emphasized that this was a proof that, in search of friendship with the Bosniak-Muslim people, a certain level has been reached with the realization of the agreement on the federation and that the future confederation is paving the way to the end of the war, the aggression, and the tragedy of Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
