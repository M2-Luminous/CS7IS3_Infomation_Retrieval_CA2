The Burundian Government has demanded that the people should lay down their arms. For two days several districts of the town have been affected by shooting and fighting, especially the district of Kamenge, in the north of Bujumbura. Several Hutu took refuge in this district after the massacres of last autumn. Francois Rijkmans reports: [Rijkmans] The Burundian Government is unanimous in wanting an end to violence in the town. The armed resistance has got itself organized these last few days. The Burundian army, which is mainly Tutsi, has clashed with Hutu militias. It seems that a military committee has put pressure on the government. The government wants to restore peace and to disband the illegal militias. The decision has been taken: Everyone must hand in their weapons this evening at 1800. But there are questions as to how, and some people are fearing a new explosion of violence in the powder keg of Bujumbura. The Burundian army has surrounded the Kamenge district with an impressive number of troops. The people of this district, and of other northern districts of the town, had already agreed to be disarmed, but on condition that their safety is guaranteed, on condition that the troops stop the slaughter. The Brussels representatives of Frodebu, the Burundi Democratic Front, are afraid lest the army, dominated by Tutsis, should enter Kamenge in force to carry out ethnic cleansing.
