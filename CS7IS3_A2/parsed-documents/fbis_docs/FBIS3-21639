[Diaz] Does this mean that drugs are brought to Cuba either by plane or by boat? And how far off the Cuban coast are these packages dropped? [Zamora] As you said, they try to violate our airspace and our jurisdictional waters. Of course, we always try to take appropriate steps to prevent such elements from violating our waters and our airspace. And as I was telling you, although our territory is not internally affected by drug trafficking or drug consumption and is free of organized criminal groups dedicated to international drug trafficking activities, Cuba keeps as a priority the battle against this evil--the battle against those actions that seek to use our jurisdictional waters and our airspace for illegal drug trafficking operations, or as shelter to avoid the antidrug forces that persecute them in neighboring countries. Thus, when our nation is enduring a serious economic crisis, the product of the double blockade against our country, our government's response to this evil remains solid and firm. [Diaz] Your explanation is very clear; but this is a country with an economic crisis, and I believe this could lead to a social crisis. Worse yet would be that such evils proliferate in our country. My question to you was about Cuba's real situation concerning drug consumption and trafficking. [Zamora] As you know very well, from the very beginning the Revolution has provided everything to our citizens so they can develop all their potentials in the educational, cultural, scientific, and technical fields. And this has prevented our citizens from expressing any interest or need to resort to the drug phenomenon. This is the basic reason, and often our friends abroad cannot understand it because they cannot conceive that this problem does not exist in Cuba. But we who live in the fatherland know that this is true, and that the Revolution is the basic element that has helped us stay away from this evil that is adversely affecting mankind. [Diaz] Precisely. Roughly, how many criminal actions were reported in 1993? Can you provide those figures? [Zamora] By all means. To have an idea of the scope of this international phenomenon, in 1993 a total of 3,3364 kg of cocaine were seized in 79 different operations, which is an increase of 104 percent as compared to 1992. These drugs are dropped in packages through a system called plane bombing, then are collected by fast boats. In 72 cases these drugs were found on the Cuban coast or floating on waters near Cuban territory. And 27 kg were seized from traffickers who were either trying to carry the drug into the country or out of the country. The final destination of these drugs was the European countries and Canada; but, of course, the objective was the use of our airports. [Diaz] On another occasion I will continue talking with Eliseo Zamora about the National Drug Commission founded in Cuba in 1989. I know there are people in their homes who are still willing to listen to us, especially when dealing with such important subjects as this one.
