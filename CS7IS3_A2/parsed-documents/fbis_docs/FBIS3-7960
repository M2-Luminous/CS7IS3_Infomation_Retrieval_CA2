Well-informed sources and diplomats are aware of that, as are most probably its initiators in Washington, and by doing so they are consciously drawing Bosnia further away from peace and an end of the war. The idea is basically also directed against the interests of the Bosnian Moslems. The ten-month war between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats has reached such horrible proportions that its cruelty surpasses all previous wars and has broken up all alliances between these two peoples, i.e. their political leaders. The key issue is central Bosnia, the scene of fierce battles between the Moslems and Croats over control of mixed territories and arms factories. This part of Bosnia is the essence of life of the Bosnian Croats in that ex-Yugoslav republic. It was inhabited by over 400,000 Croats, 200,000 of whom fled before the clashes with the Moslems, while the death toll remains unknown. The worst Moslem atrocities against the civilians were committed in this region, while the Bosnian Croat forces (HVO) carried out massacres over the Moslems, especially in the area of Vares, Vitez, Gornji Vakuf and Prozor. The Bosnian Croats have demolished Mostar which, after the Serbs were forced to leave, became a predominantly Moslem town. One wonders if a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia is possible from that viewpoint. The fact remains that the idea for a federation comes from abroad and that the negotiatiors are under terrible pressure. Regardless of the outcome, these talks represent the defeat of the policy of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and his party, the Croatian Democratic Union (H.D.Z.). One should recall that the major disputes in [word indistinct] occured over central Bosnia, which is now virtually lost because a federation implies the maintaining of actual state of affairs. [as received] This discord within HDZ was stemmed from the insistence of the Bosnian branch of H.D.Z. on maintaining central Bosnia as a "basis" of Croat population, while western Herzegovina, in which Zagreb was mainly interested, was "ethnically clean" even before the start of the war and had very loose links with Sarajevo. The United States' excuse that this kind of federation would solve the problem of the Moslem access to the sea is also invalid, because part of the coast of former Bosnia-Herzegovina has been ethnically clean, i.e. Croat-populated, for a long time. Simultaneously, the urging of a new federation by the United States, former defender of the Bosnian Moslems, proves that the Moslems are the winners in the war with the Croats, and are thus in a superior position. On the other hand, the United States, which until now has undermined all peace efforts by insisting on a so-called intact Bosnia-Herzegovina, now admits that division is inevitable. This represents a defeat of Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, if he is the one who makes any decisions at all. This only proves that the Bosnian Serbs were right in insisting that it [words indistinct] who in fact does not want a Bosnian Moslem state. Furthermore, it is unclear what will happen to the autonomous province of Western Bosnia, Moslem enclave in northwest Bosnia. Judging by the current state of affairs, if a Moslem-Croat federation came to life, this part of Bosnia called Cazinska Krajina would very likely become autonomous within the Bosnian Serb republic. The question is what could this federation mean for the Bosnian Serbs. [words indistinct] ways for its setting up primarily recognize the sovereignty and independence of the Bosnian Serbs within Bosnia- Herzegovina. On the other hand, if such a community was a threat to Bosnian Serb interests and could provoke yet another [words indistinct] major Croat-Serb clashes would be bound to happen, and concerning the latest Russian initiatives in the Balkans, the fighting could have tragic consequences primarily for Europe, as well as for the whole world. Regardless of what led the United States to insist on this idea, its realization certainly does not accept reality and the actual state of the affairs, and simultaneously draws Bosnia-Herzegovina away from the much desired peace.
