Here is the text: The latest events in Crimea, the statements and practical steps by officials of the Republic of Crimea, cause concern in Ukraine and in international circles because of the possibility of a sharp exacerbation of the sociopolitical situation on the peninsula, the creation in the center of Europe of a hotbed of danger, and instability. The new leadership of the autonomy has gone from a declaration of intent to concrete actions aimed at changing the legal status of the autonomous republic of Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine. In particular, it has become known that a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council plans to discuss the issue on returning to individual provisions of the 6 May 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, which contravenes the Constitution of Ukraine and which were changed by the Supreme Council of Crimea itself in September 1992. At the same time there is an attempt to carry out the current constitution of the Republic of Crimea and to create the basis for Crimea's secession from Ukraine which would be a blatant violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Attempts by the leadership of the Republic of Crimea to legally introduce its own citizenship, to create its own military formations, and to change the status of Sevastopol cause concern. All of this contravenes the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine and the generally recognized principles of international law. The ambitious attempts by individual Crimean politicians also go against the goodwill of Ukraine to contribute to Crimea's all-round social, economic, and cultural development. The Supreme Council of Ukraine itself gave the Crimean oblast the status of an autonomous republic within the composition of Ukraine. It adopted a law of Ukraine on the delimitation of powers between the bodies of power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. The president of Ukraine adopted a law on an open economy regime on the territory of the Republic of Crimea. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers regulated, together with the Crimean Government, issues of ownership, formulation of the budget, and carried out a number of measures to stabilize the economy in the Republic of Crimea. Ukraine is genuinely carrying out a policy of renewing historical justice with regard to the deported peoples and is contributing to the return of the Crimean Tatar people to their historical homeland. Crimea is and will remain a part of Ukraine, says the Ukranian president's statement. However, instead of fully exploiting the given opportunities to pull Crimea's economy out of the crisis situation, certain political circles in the autonomous republic have recently adopted a different course. There is open speculation on the economic difficulties that Ukraine as well as other CIS countries are suffering today, even though in such difficult conditions Ukraine has, to a considerable extent, found the possibility to cover Crimea's deficit in financial and material resources. Despite these objective realities, anti-Ukrainian and antistate feelings are constantly being stirred up among the population of Crimea. Facts prove that dangerous processes in the Republic of Crimea do not have an exclusively internal Crimean origin but to a considerable extent are stimulated by individual political forces in Russia, whose actions have recently taken on signs of open interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine. In accordance with the Constitution and current Ukrainian legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine which has wide powers in the economic sphere, makes use of the natural wealth, ecology, culture, and organizes community life. The Republic of Crimea, as an autonomous and constituent part of Ukraine, is not a bearer of state sovereignty and cannot enter into political relations with foreign states. The validity of the Constitution of Ukraine extends over the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea. The territory of Ukraine is single, indivisible, inviolable, and complete. Crimea cannot have its own citizenship which is separate from Ukraine. Citizens of the Republic of Crimea are citizens of Ukraine. The autonomy may not have its own armed forces. The press service of the president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine is authorized to state that all necessary measures will be adopted by the Ukrainian president and the Supreme Council of Ukraine to stabilize the political situation in Crimea and to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity. The president of Ukraine will ensure absolute adherence to the constitution and laws of Ukraine on the entire territory of the state, including Crimea as a constituent part of Ukraine. The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine notes that some political and public figures of Russia are violating the rules and norms of behavior on the territory of another state. In connection with this, in the future, any attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine will be resolutely stopped in accordance with Ukraine's legislation.
