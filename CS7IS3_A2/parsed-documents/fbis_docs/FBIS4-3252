FBIS4-3252 "drchi075_w_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong PRC Officials, Pro-Democracy Politicians Comment on Merger PRC Officials, Pro-Democracy Politicians Comment on Merger HK1904064594 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 19 Apr 94 pp 1, 6 HK1904064594 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Chris Yeung, So Lai-Fun, and Fung Wai-Kong] [Text] China made it clear last night that the merger of the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point would not change its belief that core members of the United Democrats were subversive. Only hours after the two key liberal factions announced they would form the Democratic Party in October, mainland officials said that if the move was aimed at "mending the fence between China and core United Democrats members", the attempt was futile. The alliance, however, puts China in an awkward predicament because it has consistently frozen out the United Democrats while wooing other liberal factions to the cause of planning post-1997 Hong Kong. Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, who was enlisted by Beijing in the latest batch of Hong Kong affairs advisers, stood staunchly behind the merger yesterday, clasping hands with Martin Lee Chuming and Szeto Wah, the two United Democrats most distrusted by China. Announcing the formation of the party, a move which apparently took Chinese officials by surprise, Mr Lee said the need for a strong and united liberal coalition was becoming more pressing as 1997 approached. "This is a time when we must not be intimidated by threats from Beijing. We must take a stand on principle, take a stand on human rights, the rule of law and the development of democracy," Mr Lee said. "We represent a very wide section of the community and if China tries to isolate us, China's really trying to isolate the people of Hong Kong," he said, noting that the new party would comprise at least 17 legislators. In its manifesto, read out by Mr Cheung, the new party declares that it supports Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 as an autonomous and capitalist Special Administrative Region of China. "We care for China, and, as part of the Chinese citizenry, we have the rights and obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of China," the manifesto said. Mr Lee said that although Meeting Point as a party and individuals in the United Democrats were members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, the group branded as subversive in the months after the Tiananmen Square massacre, the new party would not be joining it. The plan, however, did not sway China's attitude towards the United Democrats, who were also leaders of the Alliance. "The behaviour of these people is self-contradictory," a Chinese official said. "They are, on one hand, saying there should be dialogue with us. But on the other hand, they said they have to overthrow the present government," he said repeating an allegation which Mr Lee and Mr Szeto had denied. While stressing that they were surprised about the merger plan the officials said they needed to study the plan. "Although there has been some gossip about the merger for some time, it (the announcement) is news to me. We knew nothing about it," one official said. Another official in charge of Hong Kong affairs said he needed more information, such as the background of the merger and the party's future plan and platform. "There will not be room for dialogue if they do not abandon their stance towards China," he said. Mr Lee described the merger which had been planned since January, as "a milestone in the history of the Hong Kong democratic movement". "From various policies and remarks from Beijing, including the recent Xi Yang incident, we find that the room for manoeuvring is getting smaller," Mr Lee said. "When we look ahead, particularly towards 1997, both the Meeting Point and the United Democrats feel there is a necessity for us to stand together." The new party would not give up pursuing dialogue with China -- an objective that he said the United Democrats had failed to achieve. He dismissed the idea that the new party was intending to gain any advantage in seeking communication with Beijing by the incorporation of Mr Cheung. "Whatever we do, the ball still remains in the Chinese court," Mr Lee said. Mr Cheung said he would be pleased to explain to China about the new party, and he would play a role in pursuing in this direction. He denied that the merger was aimed at countering the growing pro- China forces in the upcoming three-tier elections. "We do not intend to be confrontational to anybody. We believe that the public can exercise their free will to choose suitable representatives," he said. Both he and Mr Lee pledged to welcome other democrats, whether they belonged to other parties or not, to join them. "Our doors are open and all those who share the same beliefs are welcome in the party," Mr Lee said. The party would approach a number of people to participate in formulating its structure and platform. Mr Cheung said the new party would not threaten the survival of other small democratic parties, such as the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. But he pointed out that it would be up to individual groups to assess their situation. Extraordinary general meetings will be held separately on May 15 to gauge members' view on the move and the timetable for dissolving existing parties. Both will continue to function until then and their legislators will hold joint meetings to streamline their differences on policies and their work in Legco. They will step up co-operation in the coming District Board elections though it was still undecided whether their candidates in the next elections would stand under the new name. The parties have not always agreed and there were cases in which they voted differently. These included votes on the approval of the Chek Lap Kok airport site preparation contract, the Container Terminal No 9 project and China's Most Favoured Nation status. Mr Lee said past differences should be shelved and past decisions respected.
