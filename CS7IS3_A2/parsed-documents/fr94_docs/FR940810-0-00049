FR940810-0-00049 FR940810-0-00021 A major reason for this approach for construction and shipyards is that measured levels of exposure often fail to define risk and are often not received before the work is completed. This was partly explained in the proposal. There OSHA noted that for removal jobs, highly variable amounts of asbestos are generated, ``reducing the predictability of exposure levels from one monitoring event to the next. Moreover, measured asbestos levels often cannot be used to determine the need for (specific controls) .␣.␣. because of the time required by the laboratory to complete the test and report the results.'' (55 FR at 29715&hyph;16). Thus, it would be unproductive to leave employees unprotected while initial monitoring results are being analyzed; and in many cases, even prompt reporting of exposure levels during the setting up of the controls would not predict exposures during the actual removal. A significant risk remains at the PEL of 0.1 f/cc, and it is feasible to attain lower levels for some workers exposed to asbestos. OSHA has therefore considered whether to establish different PELs for different operations based on the lowest exposure limits that can feasibly be achieved in those operations and that are needed to eliminate significant risk. OSHA has decided not to do so because the operation-specific work practices mandated in the standard will be a most cost-effective means of assuring that significant risk is eliminated to the extent feasible. Asbestos has been the subject of extensive rulemaking by OSHA and other agencies, and the operations that expose employees to asbestos are well known and thoroughly studied. Moreover, given the shift away from asbestos products wherever substitutes are available, it appears unlikely that major new uses will be found for asbestos in the future. OSHA has therefore been able to focus its rulemaking effort on evaluating the work practices that will best reduce asbestos exposures in the specific operations that expose workers to asbestos. The result is a standard that relies heavily on mandated work practices that will, in most situations, result in employee exposure well below the PEL. In effect, the mandated work practices will assure that each asbestos worker is exposed to the lowest feasible level for the operation in which that worker is engaged. This approach was taken in the 1986 construction standard. There, OSHA ``tiered'' its construction standard ``to apply increasingly stringent requirements to those work operations associated with the highest exposures.'' (51 FR at 23706). Rather than two classifications as in 1986 (small-scale and abatement work), OSHA now divides construction work into four classes and has made additional limited distinctions based on measurable variables such as amount of material disturbed. Since OSHA's approach assures that each employee is exposed to the lowest feasible level of asbestos, no additional protection would be gained by establishing a series of different PELs for different operations. Such an approach would add cost and complexity to employers' compliance duties and to OSHA's enforcement duties without benefiting worker health. PELs lower than 0.1 f/cc would be particularly unsuitable as compliance criteria because it is difficult to reliably measure lower levels. Because such measurements are unreliable, if lower PELs were established, measurements taken by employers and by OSHA would provide an uncertain basis for determining whether employers have fulfilled their compliance duties. However, both employers and OSHA can easily determine whether the work practices prescribed in the standard are being followed. The mandated work practices thus assure that employees are better protected than a series of different PELs while reducing compliance burdens on employers and easing the agency's enforcement burden. Therefore, rather than set operation-specific permissible exposure limits, OSHA proposed to further reduce risk by requiring certain additional work practices. The operations for which mandatory work practices are required would otherwise result in employee exposure that is significant. OSHA believes that these controls are feasible, reasonable, and necessary.
