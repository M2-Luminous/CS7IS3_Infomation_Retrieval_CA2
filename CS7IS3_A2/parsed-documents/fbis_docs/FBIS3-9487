Namely, the government commission investigating into the Smolnikar case has established that members of the Defense Ministry have overstepped their powers. Therefore, the defense minister must take responsibility for that activity. According to Drnovsek, permitting such activity would mean deviating from the rule of law. The prime minister suggests that the Social Democratic Party should continue participating in the government coalition.
