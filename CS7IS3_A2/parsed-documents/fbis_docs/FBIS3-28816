While both Japanese and American negotiators are continuing their last-ditch efforts to seek a political settlement of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the U.S. Government, taking aim at Prime Minister Hosokawa, is coming out to politically jolt the prime minister in an unprecedented way in a bid to press him to make a political decision on Japan's acceptance of the U.S. trade demands as a "reformist," while citing his past statements. At a 9 February news conference at the White House, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and other American officials took tough attitude toward Japan. At the news conference, Mr. Cutter, assistant to the president, said: "A consensus has been built in the Japanese society that Japan must open its market, but our Japanese negotiating counterparts take a view different from the consensus. We have called them bureaucrats, but we had better call them obstinate officials of the Japanese Government." In this way, the senior American official attacked bureaucrats in Kasumigaseki in an unprecedentedly harsh tone. At the news conference, an unidentified reporter asked: "If the prime minister were put to shame, will it not put U.S.-supported Japanese reforms in danger?" In response, Mr. Kantor said, "He will not be put to shame for holding frank discussions." He also stressed that the prime minister, in his article written when he established the Japan New Party last year, stated that tearing down the Japanese bureaucratic system will result in building a society where priority is given to consumers." He went on to say: "We are trying to consolidate the fragile power base for the Hosokawa government." Claiming that the reason for the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. negotiations lies in the Japanese bureaucratic system, the U.S. Government has pinned its hopes on the prime minister to make a political decision to break the deadlock. The actual situation, however, is that the prime minister has relied on bureaucrats for his management of policies and the U.S. Government learned about the situation from the tax-increase upheaval that occurred shortly before the prime minister left Japan for Washington. The U.S. Government, therefore, is trying to drive a wedge between the prime minister and the bureaucrats on the eve of the Japan-U.S. summit talks. The U.S. Government does not anticipate that the prime minister will easily act at the beck of its tactics, but it is revealing its intention to whip up "domestic pressure" in Japan by selling the Japanese the impression that the "United States stands by Japanese consumers." It can be said that the United States is trying to adopt a Japanese version of the "campaign-style politics" that the Clinton administration has used to drum up public support through a publicity offensive.
