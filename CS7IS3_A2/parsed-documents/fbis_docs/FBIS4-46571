In 1974, he was appointed Deputy Lead Designer and, in 1981, Lead Designer -- Executive of "Vympel" GosMKB. G.A. Sokolovskiy is a corresponding member of the Russian and International Engineering Academies, a doctor of technical sciences, has been decorated with orders and was awarded the rank of USSR Council of Ministers Prize Laureate. Valeriy Yakovlevich Kozhinov graduated from Kazan Aviation Institute in 1963. He has been working at "Vympel" GosMKB since 1975 and has been a department chief since 1983. He is a candidate of technical sciences. "Vympel" GosMKB is one of Russia's leading enterprises that develops aircraft weapons and guided missiles for air defense missile complexes. It has highly-skilled cadres and good technical tools for drafting, designing, and manufacturing test models and small series, and ground and flight tests of the most modern weapons models. The GosMKB's main product is air-to-air, air-to-surface and surface-to-air guided missiles, aircraft launchers for guided missiles and unguided rockets, various electromechanical, electrohydraulic, and pyrotechnic onboard devices for aircraft and helicopters and electronic warfare (EW) systems. "Vympel" GosMKB has its own KB [Design Bureau] and test plant. The KB consists of several departments: future developments, design critical analysis, and ground optimization. The test plant manufactures models for tests and small series for sale. The firm's products have long enjoyed a good reputation in many of the world's countries. For example, the French magazine PARIS MATCH wrote the following about the "Kub" Air Defense Missile Complex's 3M9 missile (NATO designation SA-6 Gainful) in October 1973 during the intensification of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: "Sometime the Syrians will erect a monument in honor of the inventor of these modern missiles. He is deserving of that. Surface-to-air missiles not only played a decisive role in the defense of Syria from air raids but also had an enormous psychological impact on the population. Residents of Damascus and its suburbs were witnesses to the missile shootdowns of a dozen Phantoms, Sky Hawks and Mirages, the aircraft crashed to the ground and the pilots were forced to eject." Today there is practically not a single CIS-produced aircraft or helicopter that would not have "Vympel" GosMKB items on board. The firm's products were supplied to various countries for many years but no one knew who had developed them. The time has come to talk about that. "Vympel" GosMKB was formed in 1949 as a developer of aircraft machinegun-cannon and bomb weapons. This direction of work has been preserved until the present day. Designs of guided missiles became a priority in the 1950's. Ivan Ivanovich Toropov was assigned as the first Lead Designer at the GosMKB. The Tu-4 aircraft's bomb and cannon systems were developed in 1955 under his leadership. At the same time, the GosMKB conducted the development of radar seekers for air-to-air missiles, K-7 air combat missiles with semiactive radar guidance, air defense missiles with solid fuel engines and R-13 missiles. The R-13 (AA-2 Atoll) -- this is a short range missile (approximately 7.6 km) with infrared guidance that was developed as an equivalent for the well-known American Loral Aeronutronics AIM-9B Sidewinder missile. It is in the inventory of MiG-21 aircraft of many of the world's countries. The R-13 is the first air-to-air guided missile that was accepted into the fighter aircraft inventory of the USSR and the people's democratic countries in 1962. In 1959, "Vympel" GosMKB began developing the "Kub" Air Defense Missile Complex's 3M9 missile. Its development was completed under the leadership of new Lead Designer Andrey Leonidovich Lyapin who headed "Vympel" MKB in 1961. The 3M9 is the first Soviet air defense missile with semiactive radar guidance and a combined rocket-ramjet solid fuel sustainer engine which permitted providing it with relatively long range with the missile's comparatively small dimensions and weight. The missile has a flight range of 24-28 km and supports the interception of airborne targets at low (to 30 m) and medium altitudes. The missile weighs 600 kg. The rocket-ramjet solid fuel sustainer engine employed on it was developed by the GosMKB for the first time in the world. The missile has been repeatedly modernized, as a result of which jam-proofing of the guidance system was increased, its power-to-weight ratio and accuracy were improved, and design and operating specifications were increased. The missile, as part of the "Kub" Air Defense Missile Complex, is in the inventory of a number of countries until the present time. The 3M9 missile is installed on a self-propelled mount. Later, "Vympel" GosMKB concentrated its efforts on the development of second, third and fourth generation guided missiles (primarily air-to-air missiles), launchers, and also bomb racks, turret machinegun-cannon systems and chaff cartridge and infrared decoy dispensers. Lead Designer G.A. Sokolovskiy has headed this work since 1981. The idea of modular utilization of interchangeable infrared and radar seekers on the missile's basic design that has been set forth in the R-13 missile has become one of the fundamental ideas in the GosMKB's work. This idea was utilized during the design of other elements of the missile which permitted us to substantially expand the capabilities of the aircraft weapon platforms of the R-23 (24) (AA-7 Apex), R-40 (AA-6 Acrid) and R-27 (AA-10 Alamo) missiles during attacks against targets at various speeds, ranges, altitudes and under conditions of natural and man-made interference. At the same time, many other engineering tasks were carried out, the urgency of which has been preserved until the present day. For example, the R-40 missile, designed to destroy high-speed, high-altitude targets and in the inventory of Su-15, MiG-25 and MiG-31 aircraft, with relatively high weight (470 kg) and medium range (up to 70 km) as before remains the highest altitude air-to-air missile. It permits the destruction of targets at altitudes of up to 32 km. The issues of the employment of passive and active thermal protection have also been worked out on it (the latter is ensured using freon that is supplied from a tank that is located in the launcher), jam-proofing of a combined radar-optical fuze and the technology of the utilization of titanium alloys in the design (including the body of the missile engine). The R-60 (AA-8 Aphid) missile with infrared guidance is the organic weapon of the Su-15, Su-17, Su-24, Su-25, MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-25, MiG-29, MiG-31, and Yak-38 aircraft. This highly maneuverable air combat missile weighs 44 kg and permits the destruction of targets at ranges from 200 m to 15 km. During the design of the R-60, the firm's engineers resolved the task of ensuring the destruction of targets maneuvering at maximum G-loads at very short distances. This was a unique technical breakthrough in world practice in the sphere of close combat air-to-air missiles. Based upon the assessments of foreign experts, the lead totaled approximately 10 years. Later the GosMKB developed the following air-to-air missiles in this direction: the R-73, R-27, RVV-AE, and the R-33 with which the Russian Air Force is equipped today. The R-73 (AA-11 Archer) -- the light (it weighs approximately 105 kg) close air combat (up to 30 km) missile utilizes combined aerodynamic command and control. It is designed to destroy aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles under conditions of heavy jamming. Protection of the infrared seeker from jamming is ensured through the selection of a photo receiver range and utilization of time-pulse modulation and the employment of a digital signal processing unit with independent channels. The missile has a reverse launch mode to protect the aircraft weapon platform from the rear hemisphere. According to the opinions of Western experts that were published in JANES DEFENCE WEEKLY magazine in June-September 1989, the R-73 missile "has outstripped" the ASRAAM missile "by 10 years". Superiority in maximum launch range is nearly a factor of two. The R-27 -- is a multirole medium- and long-range (72...130 km) missile that was developed in a modular design. It has two engine variants (normal and enhanced power-to-weight ratio) and two seeker variants (infrared and semiactive radar). The weight in the heaviest variant totals approximately 350 kg. A combination of modules permits obtaining four types of missiles with various technical specifications. The missile has combined guidance: command-inertial in the initial phase of the trajectory and homing in the terminal phase. The R-27 missile is designed to destroy aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and antiship missiles. The RVV-AE (AMRAAM-ski) is a medium range (90 km) missile that was developed to intercept various types of targets, including aircraft, helicopters, air-to-air missiles (such as the Hughes Aircraft AMRAAM and Phoenix missiles) and surface-to-air (such as Patriot air defense complex missiles) and also cruise missiles in complex meteorological conditions and under conditions of heavy electronic jamming in the background of the earth or water surface. The missile weighs approximately 175 kg. It has a combined guidance system: command-inertial in the inertial phase of the trajectory and active radar in the terminal phase. High jam-proofing is ensured through spatial-time signal processing, Kalimanovskiy filtering, continuous resolution of kinematic equations and the availability of the inertial phase of the trajectory. The missile has two modifications: M and M2. The second variant has a greater target interception range, enhanced seeker jam-proofing, and a greater target destruction probability at super-low altitudes (up to three meters) due to the utilization of a radio altimeter. The RVV-AE missile is being installed on tactical and strategic aviation aircraft. In accordance with the conclusions of experts that were presented in articles in the August-October 1992 issues of FLIGHT INTERNATIONAL magazine, the RVV-AE, while beating the AMRAAM missile in weight-dimensions specifications, has an entire series of advantages, including greater launch range (by approximately 20%) and a higher maneuvering target and low-altitude target interception probability. Employment of latticed control surfaces controlled by an electric drive on the RVV-AE is an original technical solution that has been utilized on an air-to-air missile for the first time. Holding back the adjacent flow using a large number of planes, these control surfaces retain their effectiveness up to large angles of attack at limits of 40�. The lattice's separate lifting surfaces provide a total lift force that is several times higher than a monoplane control surface (approximately a factor of three for the missile's maximum speed that equals Mach 4). The dependence of the lift force coefficient on the angle of attack remains constant in all flight speed and altitude ranges. Furthermore, the latticed control surfaces, having significantly less chord, permit the use of a less powerful drive. "Vympel" Design Bureau, jointly with the Ukrainian Institute of Electric Welding imeni Ye.O. Paton, has developed a unique technology for manufacturing these latticed control surfaces. The R-33 (AA-9 Amos) -- is a long-range missile (120 km) that is designed to intercept aircraft and cruise missiles. It weighs approximately 490 kg. It has a combined guidance system: command-inertial in the initial phase and semiactive radar in the terminal phase. A catapult launch technique from a semi-recessed position under the MiG-31 aircraft fuselage was employed for this missile for the first time in world practice. That positioning of the missile permitted a substantial reduction of the frontal resistance of an aircraft weapon platform with a combat load. Along with air-to-air and surface-to-air missile developments, "Vympel" GosMKB has the experience of developing air-to-surface missiles. Today Su-17, Su-24, Su-25, Su-27, MiG-23, MiG-27, and Mirage F1 aircraft are equipped with Kh-29 (AS-14 Kedge) missiles that were developed at our KB. The Kh-29 missile is designed to destroy hard to hit ground-based (large bridges, powerful concrete shelters, and airfield runways) and naval surface (surface combatants and submarines in the surfaced position) targets. It weighs 660-680 kg. The missile was developed in two variants: with television and laser guidance systems. The television seeker ensures target lock-on prior to launch at ranges of 10-12 km. After the appearance of the image of this target on the cockpit display, the pilot conducts the launch and autonomous guidance is carried out from then on. The semiactive laser seeker carries out target lock-on at ranges of 8-10 km and requires target illumination either from a ground set or from the aircraft weapon platform which must be equipped with "Klen", "Kayra", "Smerch" or ATLIS type systems. Work that is being conducted at the present time to increase the jam-proofing of the Kh-29 missile's seeker will permit an increase of its operating range to 25-30 km, having preserved a circular deviation of approximately 1-2 m from the center of the target being destroyed. Two types of launchers have been developed at the firm for practically all of the listed missiles: using rail launchers from which missile separation is ensured using the missile engine's energy and using catapult launchers, which support missile separation from the aircraft with push rods that utilize the energy of pyrotechnics or hydraulic systems. In contrast to a number of foreign firms such as, for example, Frazier Nash (Great Britain) or ACMA (International Consortium) which have recently been developing rail launchers utilizing easily removable modules, "Vympel" GosMKB is following its own path. At the firm, we think that with all of the positive qualities of a launcher with easily removable modules, they have an entire series of shortcomings. They are more complex in design and require more highly skilled maintenance personnel in operation and additional buildings for work with and storage of the modules. The reliability of the launchers is reduced and the amount of equipment for the aircraft weapon platform is increased. As a rule, "Vympel" GosMKB conducts the development of rail launchers for definite weapon platforms which permits the production of the assembly of the launchers under conditions of the plant-manufacturer and simplifies operation. In the process, the tasks of optimizing the launchers for weight, aerodynamic resistance, and the manufacturability of the design are resolved. The kinematic diagrams of fasteners and other mechanisms are original and have been simplified to the maximum extent possible which increases the launchers' reliability. Their standardization is being conducted along the following directions: for various weight groups of missiles, for one weight group of missiles for various types of aircraft, for various weight groups of missiles for one type of aircraft, and also according to the connection points (for example, the APU-13 is easily mounted on hardpoints or on bomb racks). In a number of cases, the firm is resorting to the installation of up to three types of lugs on the missiles to mount them on various types of launchers. Similar approaches are also being employed during the development of catapult launchers. The original design solutions of catapult mechanisms and synchronization of movements of the forward and aft push rods permit providing the required speed of separation while observing safety for the aircraft weapon platform. For example, the catapult launcher for the RVV-AE missile, having a similar fundamental operating scheme with the Frazier Nash launcher for the Sky Flash missile (British Aerospace) and the AMRAAM, is distinguished from it by its simpler and more reliable catapult mechanisms and synchronization of the operation of the push rods through the utilization of special hydraulic compensators-batteries. This significantly simplifies the launcher itself. The issues of the placement of the self-contained power source, the designs of the catches that reduce aerodynamic G-loads on the missile, and the readjusted hardpoints were also resolved in an original manner on it. "Vympel" GosMKB has also developed launchers for 50-122 mm unguided aircraft rockets with 5-20 barrels. They are also disposable or reusable and are equipped with one or multichannel launch systems. Launchers for small caliber guided missiles have tubular launch rails, for example, the APU-8 and the PU-O-25L, and support launches of air-to-surface missiles with semiactive laser and radar seekers. All CIS-manufactured frontal aviation, antisubmarine warfare, and long range aviation aircraft are equipped with "Vympel" GosMKB bomb holders. The holders support suspension of conventional and guided bombs, canisters with machinegun-cannon weapons, guided missile and unguided rocket launchers, torpedoes, rescue equipment, canisters with submarine detection equipment and other cargoes weighing from five to 25 kg. They are designed both for external and internal employment. Based upon critical analyses, the holders have a different number of fasteners and are distinguished by a high degree of standardization. It is attained through the employment of a large number of standard circuits from which, like from separate units, the design is assembled. The firm's latest achievement is a bomb holder that is loaded independently prior to its installation on the aircraft. In the sphere of EW systems, "Vympel" GosMKB has developed and introduced into operation several generations of passive jamming and decoy dispensers for all classes of CIS aircraft and helicopters. Since the beginning of the 1980's, they have been developed on modern microcircuitry and according to the modular principle. At the present time, there is a broad selection of internally and externally mounted functional-design units with manual, semiautomatic and automatic control for dispensing 26-, 50-, and 140-mm infrared decoy and chaff cartridges. The dispensers' software permits creation of a cloud or a trail of jamming that varies by assigned or random laws with the following parameters in accordance with the flight modes and the directions of attack: the number of cartridges in a salvo, the number of salvos in a series, and the number of series and the intervals between them. At the present time, the firm is developing a special air target based upon the 3M9 missile that is equipped with jamming dispenser systems for fire rehearsal of ground-based and shipborne air defense missile-gun complexes. Each design that comes out of the design bureau today, as a rule, contains dozens of inventions. More than 800 of the firm's original technical solutions are protected by patent documents. Among them: common layouts of items; various systems; the design of individual compartments, assemblies, mechanisms and connections; stands for modeling and ground work, and also technological devices and accessories. For many years, "Vympel" GosMKB was among those enterprises that was financed from the state budget. Since 1987, the situation has changed. The enterprise is gradually transitioning to contract relations. A number of developments were initially financed from the state budget and, later, through contracts. At the present time, the firm is experiencing financial difficulties caused by the overall state of Russia's economy, the disruption of ties with contractors and series-production enterprises, the absence of a new military doctrine and the totally illogical conversion program of industry's defense sectors. During the last two years, the firm's strength has been reduced by 25%, however, its creative potential has been preserved. Additional difficulties are also arising as a result of the fact that the Air Force is not utilizing an integrated approach to ordering aircraft, helicopters and their weapons but is ordering them from separate chief and lead designers. The new economic situation is compelling the firm to increase the rates of scientific-research and experimental-design work: to develop new models of equipment, modify already existing models to impart greater flexibility and effectiveness of employment to them and to expand the spectrum of weapon platforms, including foreign weapon platforms. At the present time, "Vympel" GosMKB's engineers, jointly with foreign experts, are conducting work to determine the possibility of mating the firm's missiles with foreign aircraft. Negotiations are being conducted to equip aircraft from Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and China with "Vympel" GosMKB missiles and also for the firm's participation in the modernization of MiG-21 aircraft that are in the United Arab Emirates, India, China, and Syria. "Vympel" GosMKB has developed a method and has conducted research that demonstrates the possibility to utilize bomb holders that have been developed at the enterprise to suspend foreign aircraft bombs on combat aircraft manufactured in the CIS. A series of additional measures is being conducted for the standardized employment of items on the whole, their elements and individual systems. Special attention is being paid to standardizing different types of air-to-air and surface-to-air guided missiles. In the process, three well-known approaches are being utilized. The first approach consists of realizing the advantages of modern air-to-air missiles on the whole and their separate systems, first of all active seeker systems. For example, the AMRAAM missile is being employed for the Norwegian NASAMS Air Defense Missile Complex. The second approach consists of expanding the capabilities of air-to-air missiles that have proven themselves in a surface-to-air variant through a certain amount of reconfiguration and by increasing their power plant capabilities. That is what Raytheon is doing for the American Sparrow missile in the Ivolvd [transliteration] Sparrow variant. The third approach consists of a combination of the first two. For example, they plan to utilize the AMRAAM missile in the ASAM-1 Air Defense Missile Complex. Right now the GosMKB is developing designs of fourth generation missiles that have many fundamentally new scientific and technical solutions that include the missile's external appearance, its aerodynamic specifications, methods for forming its command and control, guidance and engine thrust control systems, and also optimization of all components based upon their standardized or, on the contrary, based upon their specialized employment and based upon cost-effectiveness criteria. According to the assessments of the firm's experts, the new designs do not lag behind such future foreign developments as the American Loral Aeronutronics and Ling-Temco-Vought HAVE DASH and Hughes Aircraft, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Westinghouse AAAM air-to-air missiles and also such developments as the French Aerospatiale "Aster", the Franco-German Euromissile Association's Roland RM5 and the American Ling-Temco-Vought ERINT air defense missiles. In the sphere of electronic warfare systems, the enterprise has begun developing complex systems that consist of missile attack warning sensors, automatic dispenser command and control subsystems and canisters with chaff and infrared decoy cartridges. The deterioration of the economic situation has compelled "Vympel" GosMKB test production to shift to operating modes for the production of small lots of series-produced products for export deliveries as part of combat aircraft complexes. Furthermore, "Vympel" GosMKB is expanding the sphere of civil production which today totals approximately 10% of the total volume of developments. Preference is being assigned to scientific-intensive and specialized models that permit us to utilize the enterprise's potential to the maximum possible extent. "Vympel" GosMKB demonstrated its products at the Central Exhibition Field in Moscow in 1989, and also at the "Le Bourget-91", "Kubinka-92", "Mosaeroshow-92", "Athens-93" and "IDEX-93" exhibitions. The firm is most qualified to resolve the following issues: theoretical research, drafting and design; compilation of algorithms and computer programs; calculations; modeling; testing for durability, vibration, strikes and on environmental impact; flight testing; development of electro-pneumatic-hydromechanical systems and pyrotechnical devices; development of telemetry equipment; technological processing of designs and others. Having a great deal of experience in the development of weapons systems, "Vympel" GosMKB is working jointly with many CIS enterprises and proposes cooperation to all of the world's firms.
