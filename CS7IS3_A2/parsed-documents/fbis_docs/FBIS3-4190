Li Changchun -- provincial NPC delegation leader, provincial party committee secretary, and provincial people's congress standing committee chairman -- took the floor first at the conference, briefing reporters from many news units on the situation in Henan Province. Li Changchun said: Located in the hinterland, Henan is a populous, agricultural, and interior province. Since reform and opening up, and especially over the past few years, the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government have made unreserved efforts to attain the strategic goals of raising Henan's gross national product to a level higher than the country's average and of lowering Henan's natural population growth rate to a level lower than the country's average. They have called on the Henan people to follow the Red Flag Canal Spirit of the people of Linxian County by carrying out diligent and pioneering work in a down-to- earth manner; holding aloft the banner of enhanced unity and constant rejuvenation of Henan; inviting advanced foreign technology and expertise; and establishing lateral economic associations with other provinces and regions. As a result, Henan's economic growth has been pushed forward to a large extent, as well as on an extensive scale. Now Henan has been rated the ninth largest industrial province in the country. Speaking of Henan's development prospects, Li Changchun stated: Henan is rich in natural resources, boasts convenient communications, and promises excellent development prospects. Henan's development prospects can be boiled down to good momentum and great potential, coupled with enormous difficulties. In answering questions raised by the reporters, Li Changchun noted: Henan is a large interior and agricultural province. The total population in Henan's old liberated areas, mountainous areas, and areas along the Huang He amounts to 7 million. Henan still lags far behind the country's coastal areas in terms of economic development, partly due to the lack of good policies, but mainly due to the lack of internal dynamism. We hope to be granted more preferential policies so as to push forward Henan's economic development. Provincial leaders -- such as Fan Qinchen, Zhang Zhigang, Qin Kecai, and others -- also attended and answered reporters' questions at the news conference.
