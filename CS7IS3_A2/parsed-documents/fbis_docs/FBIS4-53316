Ministry leaders have started to openly admit their fears that a further delay would put a damper on the economy, which has recently shown improvements and been relieved from a further rise in the yen. "I can't deny that a long delay will affect the economy," Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a press meeting held Tuesday [17 May] just before the Diet started its budget deliberations. The day before, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito made headlines by spelling out his concerns at a usually vague regular news conference. The full 73 trillion yen budget for the year that started 1 April faced a Diet impasse over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's questionable loans from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking group. During the stalemate, the government adopted a 50-day provisional budget in March worth 11 trillion yen, effective from 1 April, to bridge the spending gap. That stopgap budget will expire on Friday. The Diet deadlock continued in April, with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party stubbornly pursuing the loan issue and causing Hosokawa to resign. To further bridge the delay, the government endorsed last week a 40-day supplement to the provisional budget. Both Fujii and Saito said that fresh public projects and other outlays related to new policy measures cannot be included in the stopgap budget, and Saito stressed, "that's why we are calling for early Diet passage" of the full budget. Economists said the budget has become crucial to Japan's economic recovery during the halt in the yen's rise, and warned that economy-stimulating spending included in the February 15.25 trillion yen package will dry up by the end of June. Jesper Koll, chief economist at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc., said the stimulus package helped Japan's real gross national product (GDP) to grow 0.1 percent in calender 1994, and without it real GDP would have contracted 1.8 percent. He added that Japan needs to continue bolstering the economy with fresh spending even after the package-related outlays disappear. Diet budget deliberations usually last about two months, roughly the time frame necessary to have the budget passed by the end of June. The LDP and the Social Democratic Party, which split from the ruling coalition when the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed, have said they will try to ensure the budget is passed by the end of the current Diet session on 29 June. Many economists say there is no guarantee that goal can be realized, given all the current political turmoil and with Hata's coalition holding only a minority in the diet. Koll said, "foreign institutional investors have completely lost faith in Japan's budget and they are set to sell off Japanese stocks if a clear direction is not in sight by around 15 June." This would mean a major setback in Japanese stocks that have been underpinned by foreign buying, he said. From around that time, market attention will shift to the bank of Japan with a cut in the official discount rate becoming the only way to buoy the economy, Koll said. Meanwhile, bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, in his latest news conference, called for Hata to use "leadership" to push through the budget.
