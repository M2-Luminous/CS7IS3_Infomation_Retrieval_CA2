FBIS4-10490 "drlat071_o_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Colombia Candidate Navarro Accuses Samper of Harassment Candidate Navarro Accuses Samper of Harassment PA1204001994 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A in Spanish 0130 GMT 11 Apr 94 PA1204001994 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A Spanish BFN [From the "AM/PM" newscast] [Text] Throughout last week, the relationship between Antonio Navarro Wolff and Ernesto Samper was very active, so much so that Navarro accused Samper of harassment. The story began 5 April in Cartagena at the Socialist International Summit. Samper, in a first seductive move, tried to have his picture taken next to Navarro. Navarro played hard to get, but in the end the picture was taken. Samper said his social and economic platform coincided with Navarro's. Next in this new love affair, Navarro told Samper this was not true and described Samper as a neoliberal, saying in social matters, the peace process, and concerning corruption their views were very different. The next day when the coastal press published reports on the alleged love affair, Navarro reacted. He spoke of harassment similar to that of Miguel Angel Bermudez. Then, on 7 April there was a commotion on the air of RCN [Radio Cadena Nacional]. Samper's harassment reached the point where he proposed to Navarro a legal matrimony and told him the doors were open until the day of the elections. Navarro answered his suitor [pretendiente] yesterday in Cali. [Begin Navarro recording] I want to tell Dr. Samper once and for all, with all due respect but with all clarity, to quit that story. We represent a different project from the one he represents, and we do not accept terms or invitations that definitely do not match our way of doing things or that of our people. [end recording] Today Samper insisted on the wedding. [Begin recording] [Samper] I believe Navarro thinks deep-down that if we are close to a 51-percent popularity rating and there will not seemingly be a runoff election, it is best to jump onto the winning bus. [Navarro] Dr. Samper is hoping I give up my candidacy to support him, but no way. The dawn shall come, and I will not support him. [end recording]
