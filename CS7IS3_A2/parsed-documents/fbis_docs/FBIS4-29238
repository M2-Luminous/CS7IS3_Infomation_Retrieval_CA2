He said that the raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by the Japanese police on June 6 was a downright expression of the Japanese authorities' heinous hostile policy toward the DPRK in collusion with the United States and the South Korean puppets. The Japanese authorities are escalating crackdown on Chongnyon, talking about study of "measure for public peace at home" and establishment of "emergency security arrangements" he said, adding: If the Japanese reactionaries think they can go scotfree after provoking Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens' organisation of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan with a futile design to realize the old dream of "greater East Asia coprosperity sphere", it would be a big mistake. The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences of their anti-DPRK and anti-Chongnyon racket, immediately give up such moves and sincerely apologize for all the criminal acts they have committed up to now and punish the criminals. The spokesman expressed the belief that the Korean youth and students at home and abroad under Pomchonghaknyon would actively turn out in a struggle to defend the democratic national rights of the Korean youth in Japan, our brothers and sisters, and the dignity of the homeland from the Japanese reactionaries' ever intensified fascist suppression.
