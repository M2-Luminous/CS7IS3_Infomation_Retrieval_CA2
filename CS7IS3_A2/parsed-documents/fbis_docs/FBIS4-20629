In April of the following year, under the provision of the Technopolis Law, it was designated as Technopolis No. 1. Located at the foot of the majestic Mount Gairin, the "techno research park," adjacent to Kumamoto International Airport, is where the Technopolis Center, Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory and Kumamoto University's Joint Regional Research Center, together with 12 companies, including leading-edge research laboratories and software developers, are pursuing R&D activities. The principal undertakings and characteristics of this foundation are as follows: The Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory was established in April 1985 as a research organ of this third-sector foundation. The laboratory, staffed by 12 researchers specializing in the fields of automation, computer, and data processing, conducts joint research with local colleges and businesses. It also undertakes both commissioned and its own independent research. The results of its work are reflected in improved technological capabilities, as well as new product development, of local companies. The laboratory, moreover, provides small and medium-sized businesses with technical guidance and consulting utilizing its technical know-how. In order to assist in the development of technical personnel for local industries, the laboratory began giving a lecture series at Kumamoto University, providing "Tahara School," aimed at development of business executives, as well as a range of management and technical training courses designed for different levels of personnel. The laboratory, furthermore, is conducting a two-year technical training program with a one-to-one student-teacher (laboratory's research staff) ratio. The program already has produced 35 graduates, all of whom are currently active in local businesses. As for the financial support essential to any R&D activities, using the yield on the foundation endowment, several financial schemes, offering a guarantee of obligation or low interest financing, financial assistance to R&D (no interest financing) and to joint industrial, academic, and governmental research (funding assistance), are being made available. The regional technical exchange is being promoted through the organization and vigorous activities mounted by various research forums involving industrial, academic, and governmental efforts. Especially the "Kumamoto Intelligent System Technology Research Forum" (an abbreviated designation: RIST), whose membership is subscribed by 56 local companies and some 50 professors from universities and technical colleges, has contributed substantially in raising technical levels through annual symposiums on introduction of intelligent technology to regional industries, monthly technical forums, various types of seminars held several times a month, as well as through joint research. Moreover, when a bio endowment was established in 1993, the biotechnical R&D enterprise was undertaken. Information services offered to regional industries consist of online search of various commercial databases, including industries, manpower resources, technical papers, and patents, and the publication of a PR magazine covering the laboratory's activities. The foundation has been active since October 1985, serving as an executive office of Japan Technomart. In July 1993, in order to strengthen the foundation's communication functions with its members, an advisor was appointed. Since its inception 10 years ago, the foundation has contributed to the accumulation of technologies at Electromechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, the raising of local industries' technical sophistication levels, and the promotion of industries. While further improving unique technologies and creating new ones, using as a basis the accumulation of technologies and construction of the industrial foundation achieved during the first phase, the Kumamoto Technopolis Program is proceeding with its second phase at the same time, undertaking construction of the second Technopark, whose aim is to create the "incubation field" complete with the "housing and recreational" environment and city functions which will be appealing to working people. In the future, together with the promotion of regional industries by further strengthening ties with the Prefectural Industrial Technology Center and through the promotion of the joint project involving industry, academics, and government closely connected to the region, and vigorous support to the promotion of local businesses, the foundation will work on specific policies which will prove effective in the construction of the technopolis.
