Guyana is one of three member states -- Antigua and Barbuda, and Montserrat are the others -- yet to implement the CET after Caricom agreement in 1992 on a lowering of the tariffs to reflect international trends. All three opposition parties here supported the government as the Customs (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 1993 came up for debate and passage this week. Debate on the bill was previously scheuled for December 16, but was postponed because of delays in printing of the voluminous tariff rates. The CET is intended to demarcate a regional market behind a common tariff against third-country goods. It is expected to facilitate the development of regional manufacturing and agriculture.
