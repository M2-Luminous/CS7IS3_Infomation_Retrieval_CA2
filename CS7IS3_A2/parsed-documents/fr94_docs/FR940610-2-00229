A model demonstration project must_ (a) Build upon specific components or strategies based on theory, research, or evaluation. These components or strategies must include procedures to identify youth who are at risk of dropping out of school and to recruit youth with disabilities who have already dropped out of school; (b) Include alternatives for engaging students in programs that provide functional literacy skills and employment training and for serving students who refuse to return to their previous school; (c) Develop working relationships with the private sector, especially employers, rehabilitation personnel, and local Private Industry Councils authorized by the Job Training Partnership Act; (d) Target services to specific students (i.e., by age, disability, level of functioning, and membership in a special population, if appropriate); (e) Produce detailed procedures and materials that enable others to successfully replicate the model as implemented in the original site; and (f) Evaluate the model at the original model development site and, if implemented at other sites, at those sites to determine whether the model can be adopted by other sites and yield similar results. The project must determine the effectiveness of the model and its component or strategies, including multiple, functional student outcomes measures, other indices of the effects of the model, and cost data associated with implementing the model. Invitational Priority: Within Absolute Priority 1 the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the following invitational priority. However, under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1), an application that meets this invitational priority does not receive competitive or absolute preference over other applications: Projects designed to serve minority youth (e.g., Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander) or youth from urban areas with recognized high drop out rates. Project Period: Up to 36 months. Absolute Priority 2_Outreach Projects for Services for Youth with Disabilities (84.158Q).
