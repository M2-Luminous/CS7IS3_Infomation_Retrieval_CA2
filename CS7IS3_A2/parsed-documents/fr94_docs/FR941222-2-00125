FR941222-2-00125 FR941222-2-00098 There remains the possibility, however, that if the required connection is made to a historical tribe, the Assistant Secretary may wish to investigate further the possibility of acknowledging all or several of the component communities that comprise the UHN. This issue would only need to be investigated if the connection to a historical tribe is proven. Since 1900, the petitioner's community has been identified consistently by anthropologists, state and Federal government representatives, residents of south Louisiana who are not members of the petitioning group, missionaries, journalists, and others, as ``Indian'' or by other terms which indicate at least some Indian ancestry. There is no evidence that anyone denied that the UHN were an Indian community since 1900. They therefore meet criterion 83.7(a), identification by outsiders as an Indian community since 1900. The petitioning group has provided a copy of its governing document, which describes its membership criteria. Evidence indicates that the group is following its membership criteria satisfactorily. No evidence was found that any of the members of the UHN are members of any federally recognized tribe. No evidence was found that the petitioner or its members are the subject of congressional legislation which has expressly terminated or forbidden the Federal relationship. Based on this preliminary factual determination, we conclude that the UHN does not meet criteria b, c, and e in 25 CFR 83.7. Since the UHN does not meet all of the seven mandatory criteria, we conclude that the UHN should not be granted Federal acknowledgment under 25 CFR part 83. As provided by 25 CFR 83.10(h) of the revised regulations, a report summarizing the evidence, reasoning, and analyses that are the basis for the proposed decision will be provided to the petitioner and other interested parties, and is available to other parties upon written request. Comments on the proposed finding and/or requests for a copy of the report of evidence should be addressed to the Office of the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, Attention: Branch of Acknowledgment and Research, Mail Stop 2611&hyph;MIB. After consideration of the written arguments and evidence rebutting the proposed finding and within 60 days after the expiration of the 180-day response period described above, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs will publish the final determination of the petitioner's status in the Federal Register as provided in 25 CFR 83.10(1). Ada E. Deer, Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31374 Filed 12&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;02&hyph;M
