SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Publishers are required to furnish to the Postal Service certain information for each of their publications that has second-class mail privileges. The Postal Service uses this information to determine whether these publications continue to qualify for such authorization. 39 U.S.C. 3685. PS Form 3526 has been revised on an interim basis for the October 1, 1994, filing requirement. The final version of the form will be based on the comments received from this notice. Publishers may use the revised interim form or the previous January 1991 edition to meet their filing requirements for this year. The interim form has been reduced to standard size paper (81/2 by 11 inches) and is printed on two sides. The reverse contains space for questions concerning circulation of the publication. There are two additional pieces of information that will be required from publishers under the new form. An additional space is provided for the publisher to calculate and report the percentage of paid or requested circulation for the publication. In addition, a space has been provided for the publisher to provide the date of the issue in which the Statement of Ownership will be printed. Alternatively, there is a box that the publisher can check if the Statement of Ownership is not required to be published. These changes will facilitate the processing and use of the form. Information provided on PS Form 3526, Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation, will be used for scheduling the eligibility review of the publications, if necessary. Stanley F.
