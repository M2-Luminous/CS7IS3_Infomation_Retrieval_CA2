This behavior called chemotaxis can be used for the detection of toxic substances in contaminated water. Based on this observation, scientists at the Free University of Berlin (Institut fuer Biochemie, AG Oekotoxikologie, E hrenbergstr. 26-28, 14195 Berlin) developed a testing system for toxic compounds dissolved in water. Preliminary studies showed that the system containing the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia is versatile and sensitive. As the scientists in Berlin report, the toxic substances cause typical flight and evasive actions. The extent of the reaction depends on the substance concentration. Tetrahymenia is suitable as a testing organism because it is an intermediate step between bacteria and higher organisms, both biologically and ecologically. It plays an important role in the food chains in water. The biochemistry and physiology of the organism has been studied thoroughly. The ciliate is used in three different test formats in Berlin. The testing apparatus basically consists of an outer chamber, into which an internal chamber consisting of 18 measuring tubes is inserted. The measuring tubes are connected with the outer chamber by fine channels. In the initial test phase, the organisms are in the outer chamber. The test sample is in the measuring tubes. If they contain toxic substances, the ciliates avoid the tubes, otherwise they spread to both chambers. The measured value is the number of organisms which entered the tubes. Another test measures how the growth of tetrahymena is inhibited when agents are added. However, this test is considerably less sensitive than the chemosensory test. The change in the membrane potential due to water contamination can be studied using fluorescent compounds; the sensitivity of this test is supposed to be similar to that of the chemosensory process. In studies with chemical substances, which were selected randomly from the "European Inventory of Existing Chemicals", the test had a broad range and high sensitivity. However, the method is not suitable for continuous monitoring of the water quality.
