As reported, Pavlovskis considers that the signing of the agreement is not only of economic importance but also political one, because the agreement gives guarantees for Latvia's security. The agreement and the declaration added to it provide for Latvia to sign also the associated agreement in nearest future, and then become a full and equal member of the EU. The period of Latvia's joining the EU can last from six to ten years, says Pavlovskis. If the Saeima (parliament) ratifies the free trade agreement in November, import duty will not be imposed upon Latvian goods in the EU starting from January 1, 1995. Besides, Latvia will be able to increase export of its produce to the EU. Some of Latvian industrial goods will have a 2-4 year long transitional period to enable their entering the free market. The free trade principles will not refer to agricultural products, but three protocols will regulate the trade with them providing for certain quotas for mutual trade. The protocols regulating the trade with the agriculture goods say that the EU plans to endow Latvia trade quotas for beef, pork, butter and cheese. Pavlovskis noted that Latvian produce lacks attractive and qualitative packing, and it could prevent full use of the EU endowed quotas. But it is very important that the quotas, granted to Latvia, enable Latvia to sell its production in Europe. Pavlovskis considers that worries about the agreements negative influence upon Latvian agriculture and industry are not motivated, because Latvia, according to the initialled agreement, will have a four year long transitional period during which import duty tariffs will be decreased for the EU agriculture products. The Agriculture Ministry's specialists support the ready for signing additional protocols to the free trade agreement on the procedure of import duty tariffs decreasing for agriculture products, because the agreement provides for the order according to which Latvia's inner market could be defended from excessive flowing in of agricultural products from the EU. The EU has determined a zero import duty tariff for Latvian made textile industry goods, and it endows quotas allowing Latvia to export only 30 percent of its textile industry goods, said Pavlovsis. Latvia will grant favorable terms mainly to goods that are not made in Latvia at all, and also to vegetables in winter. The free trade agreement will promote flowing in of foreign investments to Latvia, setting up of joint ventures with Latvian producers, whose production could be sold in European states' markets, said Pavlovskis. Pavlovskis also noted that the quotas for industrial and agricultural products could be revised every three years thus effectively regulating the development of Latvia's foreign trade. Latvia's 5th Saeima plans to accept the free trade agreement with the EU in October, 1994. The Latvian delegation will return from Brussels on June 21.
