At Otopeni airport the Romanian head of state made a statement to the press on the results of his talks and contacts with politicians and businessmen in the three countries. Referring to his visit to Lithuania, Iliescu emphasized the importance of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the two countries, which augments the series of legal documents regulating the framework of bilateral relations. Both in Lithuania and in Belarus, where he made a stopover and met with the new head of state, the sides expressed the desire to consolidate bilateral ties. The Asian tour started with a visit to the ROK, the first official Romanian visit to that country at the level of heads of state. The visit, President Ion Iliescu said, was a political event that was given its due attention by both the mass media and the political leadership of that country, which expressed the desire to consolidate relations with Romania. President Ion Iliescu emphasized that our country should show greater interest in South Korea and the economic region of southeast Asia in general since that is the most dynamic region in the world. In this respect, he referred to various aspects of his meetings with the representatives of some big companies that have cooperation relations with Romanian companies. On the occasion of those meetings, the local businessmen expressed their interest in investing in the Romanian economy. Referring to his visit to the special economic zone in the southern part of China, Ion Iliescu described it as an area that has registered spectacular progress in the past 15 years, which took concrete shape in the development of several strong urban centers. Foreign capital investment in the region has acquired great proportions, with the respective zones dynamizing the entire Chinese economy, which is in full process of modernization and has taken a decisive turn toward the mechanisms of the market economy. In conclusion, President Ion Iliescu said that the tour, which is part of a program of opening up toward regions of great interest, has been characterized, on the one hand, by a highlevel political dialogue to consolidate bilateral ties and, on the other hand, by important economic considerations, something that could also be seen from the composition of the Romanian delegation.
