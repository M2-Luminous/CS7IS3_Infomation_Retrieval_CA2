This is when warring groups in Afghanistan have also agreed to set Jalalabad as a secure area. Here is our colleague, Khameneh, in Pakistan with a report: [Khameneh] The leaders of the warring groups in Kabul have agreed to declare Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, as a secure area where clashes and military operations will be avoided. The Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and the Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, in separate meetings with the Pakistani Charge d'affaires in the last 48 hours, have shown a positive reaction to a call by Pakistan for declaring Jalalabad as a secure area. A spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in a news conference this evening, announcing this, added: The acting Pakistani consul in Mazar-e Sharif, also, in a meeting with General Dostam has received a similar response to the call. After recent clashes among rival groups in Kabul, which began 33 days ago, about 80,000 out of 250,000 Afghan refugees have sought refuge in Jalalabad and its suburbs. Pakistan's efforts to declare Jalalabad as a secure area can be construed as a restraining act toward Afghan refugees entering Pakistani soil. During the first 10 days of fighting in Kabul, about 17,000 new Afghan refugees entered Pakistan and eventually, some three weeks ago, Islamabad banned Afghan nationals from entering that country without a valid visa.
