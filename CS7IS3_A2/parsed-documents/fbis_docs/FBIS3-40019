How long will you give the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to make a clear statement on the coalition? [Waigel] The FDP cannot afford a zig-zag policy in this respect. It has always been well off with a coalition statement for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. It would be good for the political situation in Germany if the FDP were to commit itself before the presidential elections! If the Liberals were to hesitate with their coalition statement, we will relentlessly try to get their coalition voters in the election campaign. Then we will tell everybody who wants to vote for the FDP for the continuation of the coalition that they are making an uncertain choice with that! Then the FDP will have problems getting into the Bundestag at all. [BILD] What do you recommend to the FDP regarding the presidential elections? [Waigel] I expect the FDP will vote in the third ballot, at the latest, for CDU/CSU candidate Roman Herzog! The election of Johannes Rau with the help of FDP votes would be a disastrous signal for the continuation of the coalition. [BILD] May Johannes Rau let himself be elected president with the votes of the Party of Democratic Socialism? [Waigel] It is not permissible that Johannes Rau lets himself be elected president by the votes of armchair Bolsheviks! In 1969, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] asked Gerhard Schroeder, the then CDU/CSU candidate for the office of president, again and again whether he would permit himself to be elected with the votes of the National Democratic Party of Germany [NDP]. The SPD must now accept being asked the same thing. In this respect, the attitude of the CDU/CSU candidate is exemplary. [BILD] From the purely arithmetic point of view, the results would currently be sufficient only for a grand coalition in Bonn. What will the CSU do then? [Waigel] If the SPD were to be stronger than the CDU/CSU after the next Bundestag elections, the CSU would not participate in a grand coalition. Similar signals have also been heard from the CDU. In this case, the SPD should form a minority government. Grand coalitions only lead to a strengthening of the extreme parties on the right and he left. [BILD] When will taxes be lowered again? [Waigel] Reunification has its price! We are coping with these burdens by having saved about 70 billion German marks [DM] and having raised taxes by about that amount. As soon as any leeway develops in the budget, we will use that to lower taxes again. [BILD] What about the inflation rate? [Waigel] In view of the price development, I consider it possible that the inflation rate will have a 2 in front of the decimal point by the end of the year. This gives rise to new leeway for interest rate reductions. Each percentage point of interest rate reductions opens up an investment volume of DM7 billion. This is more than can be done by any investment program. [BILD] Mr. Waigel, do you actually think that [former Environment Minister] Peter Gauweiler can ever again become a minister in Bavaria? [Waigel] As district chairman, member of the CSU Presidium, and member of the CSU Executive Committee, Peter Gauweiler continues to be in the first rank of the party. We rely on him in the election campaign. Of course, someone who temporarily gets out of the line of fire can become a minister once again. Free of his office, it will be easier for him to refute the accusations.
