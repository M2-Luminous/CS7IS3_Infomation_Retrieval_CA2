With this observation, European Investment Bank (EIB) President Brian Unwin reaffirmed yesterday, during the presentation of the financial institution of the European Union [EU], that the funding of large-scale EU projects depends more on the availability of "good projects," than on the availability of funds. Organization Participating in European Development This is one way to justify the fact that, despite a 15-percent increase in new loans (reaching ECU19.6 billion or approximately 130 billion French francs), the EIB contributed only 12 percent of this amount to the European Growth Initiative, which was decided during the Edinburgh summit in December 1992 and further extended by subsequent summits. Actually, the EIB could use only one-fourth of the amount initially provided for under this "Edinburgh" financial scheme, and the European Investment Fund, which was also approved in late 1992 with a view to supporting the Community's economic recovery, has not yet seen the light of day. However, through its "normal" activities, the EIB contributes to European economic development by adhering to priorities defined by the European Commission, whereby each of its loans is subject to a favorable recommendation by the Commission. Last year, its loans represented 2 percent of the overall investment effort within the EU (GFCF or gross fixed capital formation). The EIB's average financing level reached 30 percent of project cost, while the beneficiary projects constituted 5 percent of European GFCF. This percentage is markedly higher in the EU's four poorest countries (Portugal: 22 percent; Greece: 15 percent; Spain and Ireland: 14 percent), which receive more than one-third of all EIB loans. "Could we have done more?" asked Brian Unwin, immediately adding: "Yes, but we cannot invent good projects." The upper ceiling of outstanding EIB debts and guarantees is limited by statute to ECU144 billion. On 31 December 1993, only 68 percent of this amount was used. But "projects must be justifiable on economic and environmental grounds, and they have to be technically and financially viable," emphasized the EIB president, adding that "the quality of the (EIB's) portfolio is essential to its reputation as a borrower on the capital markets." Thanks to its "triple A" rating, the EIB enjoys the best possible borrowing conditions. The EIB's means of action will be increased "in the coming weeks" with the establishment of the European Investment Fund, which was delayed one year because of the slowness by member states in passing the necessary amendments to the EIB statutes ratified by their national parliaments. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Main Beneficiaries of EIB Loans (in million ECU) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Country |Loan Amount |including "Edinburgh" Fu-| | | |nding | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Germany |2,096.6 |287.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Spain |4,005.1 |344.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |France |2,205.5 |300.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Italy |3,362.0 |446.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Portugal |1,488.8 |186.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Britain |1,929.1 |300.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |EIB loans totaled ECU19.6 billion in 1993, 90 percent of which was destined | |to EU member countries.
