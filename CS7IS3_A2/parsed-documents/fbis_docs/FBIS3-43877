The opening of the road, announced Monday by NPFL radio, was seen as more symbolic than meaningful, since rival factions from Liberia's three-year civil war are still moving towards demobilisation and disarmament. A rival armed group, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), was still blocking traffic at Kakata, 55 kilometres (35 miles) north of Monrovia, on a stretch of the same highway where the NPFL roadblock was raised Saturday. The ULIMO blockade was imposed in retaliation for the kidnapping last week of 11 ULIMO fighters, blamed by ULIMO on Charles Taylor's NPFL, and a refusal by aid agencies to supply territory it controls in the north and west of Liberia. The raising of the NPFL blockade was welcomed by Liberia's interim government, which controls the capital and its surrounding territory. However, an official communique warned the step could only be a "significant contribution to peace" when all roadblocks and security checks are dismantled and control of roads is handed over to the multinational peacekeeping force ECOMOG. A source close to the Nigerian-led ECOMOG, first posted in Liberia in August 1990, stressed that roadblocks should only be raised when disarmament had started. Liberia has enjoyed a brittle peace since July when warring factions signed an agreement to lay down their arms and disband by mid-January. Organisation of African Unity representative in Liberia Enoch Dogolea greeted the NPFL move with a call for the United Nations to speed up Liberia's peace process at a ceremony marking the highway opening.
