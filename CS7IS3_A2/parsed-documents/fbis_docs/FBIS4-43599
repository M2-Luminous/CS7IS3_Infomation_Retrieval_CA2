At the same time Ankara was criticized by European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans van den Broek. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nikos Meletis] Government Spokesman Venizelos today said that the possibility of a Greek-Turkish summit meeting has not been raised. The spokesman characteristically stressed there will not be another meeting like that in Davos, Switzerland. [Venizelos] Theoretically we have never ruled out such a possibility, but there are no plans and no specific proposal or desire for something like that. What is important is that the cycle of artificial tension must stop. [Meletis] Venizelos repeated that the only outstanding difference between Greece and Turkey is over the drawing of the boundaries on the continental shelf. All other so-called differences are unilateral Turkish demands and cannot be part of a dialogue. At the same time, in Ankara they are thinking seriously following yesterday's criticism by EU Commissioner Van den Broek, who made it clear that the deterioration in respect for human rights and the lack of progress in the Cyprus issue constitute serious obstacles in EU-Turkey relations. These statements were made just one day after the Constitutional Court's decision to dissolve the pro-Kurdish Democratic Party, a decision which has drawn a lot of reaction.
