Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and "De Beers" chairman of the central selling organisation Nicky Oppenheimer also agreed after two-day talks which ended on Wednesday to abide in their cooperation by the agreement which expires in the end of 1995. Russia wanted to change the agreement which envisages that 95 per cent of its diamonds are marketed through "De Beers" and five per cent independently. It strives to increase the independent share. "Until the moment when any changes are agreed the sides remain adherent to the terms of the agreement which is valid until the end of 1995. Both sides pledge to adopt the necessary measures to cease shipments of Russian jewellery diamonds to the world market by bypassing the existing agreements on the sales of the products", according to the communique. The sides also pledged their mutual responsibility for the fate of the world diamond market and the well-being of all diamond producers. They expressed hope that a new series of talks would restore the stable basis for future cooperation and thus will create guarantees for a further development of the diamond business for the benefit of both sides and the world diamond industry.
