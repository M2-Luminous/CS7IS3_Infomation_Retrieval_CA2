FR940705-0-00032 FR940705-0-00002 (2) When a sheath slitting cord is used it must be nonhygroscopic and nonwicking or be rendered such by the filling or flooding compound, continuous throughout a length of cable and of sufficient strength to open the sheath over at least a one meter length without breaking the cord at a temperature of 23 # 5 â—‹C. (o) Identification marker and length marker. (1) Each length of cable must be permanently labeled either Optical Cable, OC, Optical Fiber Cable, or OF on the outer jacket and identified as to manufacturer and year of manufacture. (2) Each length of cable intended for direct burial installation shall be marked with a telephone handset in compliance with Rule 350G of the 1993 National Electrical Safety Code (NESC). (3) Mark the number of fibers on the jacket. (4) The markings must be printed on the jacket at regular intervals of not more than 2 meters. (5) An alternative method of marking may be used if acceptable to REA. (6) The completed cable must have sequentially numbered length markers in Meters or Feet at regular intervals of not more than 2 meters along the outside of the jacket. (7) Continuous sequential numbering must be employed in a single length of cable. (8) The numbers must be dimensioned and spaced to produce good legibility and must be approximately 3 millimeters in height. An occasional illegible marking is permissible if there is a legible marking located not more than 2 meters from it. (9) The method of marking must be by means of suitable surface markings producing a clear distinguishable contrasting marking acceptable to REA. Where direct or transverse printing is employed, the characters should be indented to produce greater durability of marking. Any other method of length marking must be acceptable to REA as producing a marker suitable for the field. Size, shape and spacing of numbers, durability and overall legibility of the marker will be considered in acceptance of the method. (10) Agreement between the actual length of the cable and the length marking on the cable jacket must be within the limits of +1 percent, ^0 percent. (11) The color of the initial marking must be white or silver. If the initial marking fails to meet the requirements of the preceding paragraphs, it will be permissible to either remove the defective marking and re-mark with the white or silver color or leave the defective marking on the cable and re-mark with yellow. No further re-marking is permitted. Any re-marking must be on a different portion of the cable circumference than any existing marking when possible and have a numbering sequence differing from any other existing marking by at least 3,000. (12) Any reel of cable that contains more than one set of sequential markings must be labeled to indicate the color and sequence of marking to be used. The labeling must be applied to the reel and also to the cable. (p) Optical performance. (1) The optical performance of the single mode fibers must be in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraphs (p)(1)(i) through (p)(1)(viii) of this section. (i) The attenuation values of the single mode fibers within the cable must not exceed 0.5 decibel per kilometer (dB/km) for dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber at 1310 and 1550 nanometers and must not exceed 0.5 dB/km for dispersion-shifted single mode fiber at 1550 nanometers. The test method used for measuring the attenuation must be in accordance with either: (A) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;78A; or (B) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;61. (ii) The attenuation values for wavelengths between 1285 and 1330 nanometers and between 1525 and 1575 nanometers for dispersion-unshifted fibers must not exceed the attenuation at 1310 and 1550 nanometers by more than 0.1 dB/km. The attenuation values for wavelengths between 1525 and 1575 nanometers for dispersion-shifted fibers must not exceed the attenuation at 1550 nanometers by more than 0.1 dB/km. The test method used for measuring the attenuation must be in accordance with any one of the methods specified in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of this section. (iii) Attenuation discontinuities in the fiber's length must not exceed 0.1 decibel (dB) for dispersion-unshifted fiber at 1310 # 20 and 1550 # 20 nanometers and must not exceed 0.1 dB for dispersion-shifted fiber at 1550 # 20 nanometers when measured in accordance with EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;59.
