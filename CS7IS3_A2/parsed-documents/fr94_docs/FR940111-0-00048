FR940111-0-00048 FR940111-0-00015 On September 28, 1992 (57 FR 44534), EPA proposed criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant to section 110(m) of the Act may not be applied statewide. The preamble to the proposed rule contains a detailed discussion of the background of the Act, of the proposed criteria, and of the provisions of section 179 and section 110(m) (see 57 FR 44534&hyph;44535). New §52.30(c) of the rule provides five criteria that EPA will use to determine if sanctions imposed pursuant to section 110(m) may not be imposed statewide. If at least one political subdivision meets all five of the criteria, then that political subdivision will be considered principally responsible, and EPA will not impose sanctions on a statewide basis. Rather, EPA will impose sanctions only on the areas of the State for which EPA determines it is reasonable and appropriate to impose sanctions. If all of the criteria are not met by at least one political subdivision, then no political subdivision is principally responsible, and EPA will use its discretion to determine whether to apply statewide sanctions. However, if EPA, using its discretion, initially determines that less-than-statewide sanctions should be applied, the Agency will not need to consider the criteria; EPA will impose sanctions on those political subdivisions the Agency has determined to be reasonable and appropriate. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis and each action will be subject to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act. 1 1 As noted in EPA's proposed rule, the Agency will follow notice-and-comment rulemaking in every instance that EPA anticipates imposing section 110(m) sanctions (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). In each rulemaking action, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed geographic scope of the sanctions, the timing of the sanctions, and the order in which the two available sanctions will be imposed. To the extent the public has commented on these issues as a general matter in this rulemaking action, EPA has responded by suggesting that the issue is more appropriately raised in independent rulemaking actions in which section 110(m) sanctions are proposed. In the final rule, EPA has changed four provisions from the proposal based on comments received regarding specific details of the regulatory text. They are as follows: 1. In §52.30(a)(2), the definition of ``required activity'' was revised in two ways. First, the phrase ``may include, but is not limited to'' was deleted from the definition. Second, the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element'' is replaced by the phrase ``plan or plan item.'' These two changes were made in order to follow more clearly the language of section 110(m). Since section 110(m) refers only to actions required with respect to a ``plan or plan item,'' EPA agrees that the phrase ``may include, but is not limited to'' is unnecessary because it appears to imply EPA has authority to impose sanctions with respect to findings other than those for a plan or plan item. Furthermore, since section 110(m) uses the phrase ``plan or plan item,'' EPA believes it would be more consistent to use that phrase in the regulatory language rather than the phrase ``adequate SIP or SIP element.'' 2. The terms ``plan or plan items'' are added to the definitions section of the rule, §52.30(a)(4), and are defined as follows: ``For purposes of §52.30, the terms `plan' or `plan item' mean an implementation plan or portion of an implementation plan or action needed to prepare such plan required by the Act, as amended in 1990, or in response to a SIP Call under section 110(k)(5) of the amended Act.'' 3. In §52.30(c), ``criteria,'' as defined in the proposal, provides: ``The EPA will use the following five criteria, all of which must be met, to determine whether a political subdivision is principally responsible for the deficiency.'' This section is clarified by revising it to read as follows: ``For the purposes of this provision, EPA will consider a political subdivision to be principally responsible for the deficiency on which a section 179(a) finding is based, if all five of the following criteria are met.'' Thus, the rule clarifies that all five criteria are to be met, not merely used by EPA to determine how sanctions will be imposed. 4. In its proposed rule, §52.30(d)(1), EPA provides: ``If all of the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section have been met through the action or inaction of the `same' political subdivision, EPA will not impose sanctions on a statewide basis.'' Although no comments were received from the public on this language, a review by the Agency suggested that the phrase ``same political subdivision'' may be confusing. By including that language in the rule, EPA was attempting to indicate that one political subdivision must meet all five of the criteria before EPA's authority to impose sanctions on a statewide basis would be constrained (see 57 FR 44536). For example, if a State has two nonattainment areas and a rule, which was past due under the Act, was not yet adopted and submitted to EPA for either area, EPA would look at each nonattainment area independently to determine whether the five criteria were met. If the first three criteria were met by one nonattainment area and the last two by the second nonattainment area, then EPA's authority to impose statewide sanctions would not be constrained. However, if one nonattainment area met all five of the criteria, EPA could not impose statewide sanctions based on the finding for that area. The EPA is replacing the word same with the word one in the rule in order to alleviate any confusion. This provision will be implemented in accordance with the interpretation above. II. Background In general, the preamble to the proposed rule notes that the Act contains two sanctions provisions:
