This is a matter cherished by the leaders of the Sanaa regime. All this is done to make it possible for the regime in Sanaa to use them in its aggression against their areas and people, and consequently deepen the wounds of the sons of the same area, the same tribe, and the same family. The Sanaa regime does not care about any ideals or religion in order to reach its objectives. Will the misled ones accept that the honor of their women be violated in their areas, their dignity trampled upon, and their possessions looted, as happened in some areas? Did the misled ones not think about how they were treated before the crisis? The leaders of the regime in Sanaa are not above causing strife between tribes and personalities in the areas surrounding Sanaa. Money and weapons have been provided so that a brother can kill his brother, and plant strife between the tribes to dominate them all, instead of planting love and affection among the sons of the same people, and spending resources on construction and the establishment of services. All this is known to the sons of the Yemeni people in the north, and this will always be with them until they get rid of the leaders of this domineering regime. Everybody knows that the leaders of the Sanaa regime have established their regime based on domination, discrimination, and arrogance. They look at others as subservient to them, not as honorable people. Today they consider their aggression against the Democratic Republic of Yemen as a matter of occupation and domination, not as a matter of unity, as they claim. We wish to confirm to all the sons of our people, and particularly those who have been misled from the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, that the regime of the Democratic Republic of Yemen is becoming more firmly established every day. We were the ones who advocated unity, but on the basis of equality, justice, democracy, and national unity. In this we adhere to the basis of the pledge and accord document, and not to the basis of accepting control, domination, imposition, corruption, discrimination in citizenship, and the buying of people. We aim, God willing, to establish a state of discipline and law and order, a state of equality and justice, and a state of stability and prosperity. When a regime is established in Sanaa on a similar basis, we will unite with it. Our hearts are open and our hands extended to the sons of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, to work together under a new regime, in which there will be no domination by one group over another. We shall build together and live together a stable and secure life. This is impossible with a regime such as the current one in Sanaa. It is on the basis of the foregoing that we appeal to the misled ones, and to all those compelled to take part in the aggression against their people and their country, to listen to reason and to be aware that their fate and future are linked to the fate of their people and areas. The domineering regime in Sanaa will not always be there for them, but will use them for its domineering objectives and later will expel and humiliate them, as is its habit. However, first it will involve them in the killing of their people and brothers. There will be nothing for them except the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which keeps its arms open for all its honorable and patriotic sons to take part in its construction and development, and enjoy its blessings.
