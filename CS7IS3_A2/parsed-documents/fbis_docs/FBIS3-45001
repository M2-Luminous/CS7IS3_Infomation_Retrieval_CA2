The panel, which consists of health physicists, radiology experts and medical ethics specialists, will review the data turned up by inter-agency investigations to comb the hundreds of thousands of documents about the tests and see whether ethical standards were violated. The efforts, initiated by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, also involve the Defense Department, the Department for Veteran Affairs and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The White House, which set up a "working group" a week ago to coordinate the activities, said the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is also joining the probe. The CIA reportedly destroyed many of the reports on the tests. The Energy Department has so far interviewed some 4,000 callers on a telephone hotline, about 20 percent of them claimed to be victims of some of the radiation experiments, a department spokesman said.
