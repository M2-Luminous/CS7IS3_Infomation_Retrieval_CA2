FR940819-2-00092 FR940819-2-00063 CSX is a class I rail carrier operating a rail system comprising over 19,000 miles of track in 19 States, the District of Columbia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada. CSX is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a noncarrier holding company that owns and controls several carriers subject to Commission regulation, including: CSX; American Commercial Barge Line Company (an inland barge carrier); CSX Intermodal, Inc. (a motor carrier); and various other wholly owned carrier affiliates. The proposed purchase, lease, and trackage rights involve only CSX's rail operations in Pennsylvania. The carrier operations of CSX's other Commission regulated affiliates are not affected by the proposed transaction. Conrail is a class I rail carrier operating a rail system comprising over 17,000 miles of track in 13 States, the District of Columbia, and the Province of Quebec, Canada. Conrail is the wholly owned subsidiary of Conrail Inc.; it is not part of a larger railroad system. Applicants state that all rail service over the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions has been previously discontinued. 6 The Ridge Subdivision provides rail access to the Keystone electric generating plant located at milepost 5.83 near Shelocta. The plant has never received regular shipments of coal by rail. Prior to the discontinuance of service the plant occasionally used rail service for shipments of miscellaneous materials, heavy generating equipment for repair or replacement, and some test shipments of coal. The plant burns approximately 4.5 million tons of coal annually. It is primarily supplied by coal mined at or near the facility and delivered by conveyor belt or truck, but this coal is relatively high in sulphur content. Because the plant in the future must comply with the emission standards of the amended Clean Air Act 7 , it must obtain either lower sulphur coal, limestone for scrubbing, or both. Rail is the preferred mode to deliver these commodities to the Keystone plant, as these commodities are not available in quantity from local sources. 8 6 Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad Inc._Discontinuance and Abandonment Exemption_in Jefferson and Indiana Counties, PA , Docket No. AB&hyph;369 (Sub-No. 2X), and CSX Transportation_Discontinuance of Service Exemption_In Jefferson and Indiana Counties, PA, Docket No. AB&hyph;55 (Sub-No. 457X), (ICC served Nov. 17, 1994). 7 Pub.L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399 (1990). 8 The lines also provide access to an electric generating plant at Homer City. This plant also burns locally-mined coal delivered directly by conveyor belt or truck. While it does not use rail service for the receipt of any significant amount of fuel, it also wishes to preserve rail access for the movement of machinery and equipment. Conrail serves origins that produce both lower sulphur content coal and limestone. This transaction will give the Keystone plant the option of receiving coal or limestone in single-line service from Conrail. Because Conrail is granting back to CSX trackage rights over the line segments being acquired and leased, CSX will also be able to provide single-line delivery of coal, limestone, and other products to the Keystone plant. Therefore, Keystone will acquire competitive single-line rail service, an advantage that did not previously exist. Conrail expects coal to begin moving to Keystone as soon as service to the plant is authorized. It estimates that approximately 150,000 tons a year will move for the first 3 years of service. It does not expect to move limestone until after the year 2000, when a scrubber is installed. Conrail states that the proposed transaction involves only about 31 miles of track and one potentially major rail shipper. Assertedly, the transaction will have no significant impact on other carriers. No interchange points are located on the lines, and no additional through routes will be created. Nor do the lines contain any connections that could be used for overhead traffic or to construct new through routes. Applicants contend that the transaction will have no adverse impact on their employees because no rail service is presently conducted on the line. They do not object to the imposition of conditions for the protection of employees affected by the purchase, as set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_ Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979), as clarified in Wilmington Term. RR, Inc._Pur. & Lease_CSX Transp., Inc., 6 I.C.C.2d 799 (1990), modified, 7 I.C.C.2d 60 (1990), aff'd sub nom. Rail Labor Executives' Ass'n v. ICC, 930 F.2d 511 (6th Cir. 1991) ( Wilmington ); for the protection of railroad employees adversely affected by the proposed lease, as set forth in Mendocino Coast Ry._ Lease & Operation, 354 I.C.C. 732 (1978) and 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980) ( Mendocino ), as clarified in Wilmington, supra; and for the protection of railroad employees adversely affected by the proposed trackage rights in the related transactions, as set forth in Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino. Under 49 CFR 1180.4(b)(2)(iv), we must determine whether a proposed transaction is major, significant, minor or exempt. The proposal here does not involve the control or merger of two or more class I railroads and has no regional or national significance. The transaction involves Conrail's purchase, lease, and acquisition of trackage rights and Conrail's grant back of trackage rights on the lines now owned by CSX in Pennsylvania. Because service on these lines has been discontinued, there is no actual, current competition to be lessened. Indeed, were it not for this transaction these lines apparently would be candidates for abandonment. While CSX's grant back of trackage rights is restricted as to certain types of traffic, the restrictions introduce the potential for market and geographic competition, if not direct head-to-head competition, a potential that would not otherwise exist for the Keystone electric generating plant. Because the proposed transaction would restore rail service, and the potential for rail competition, it clearly represents a benefit to the public. Accordingly, we find the proposal a minor transaction as defined in 49 CFR 1180.2(c). See RR. Consolidation Proced. of Significant Transactions, 9 I.C.C.2d 1198 (1993). Because the application complies with our regulations governing minor transactions, we are accepting it for consideration. 9 9 While the application's market impact information is complete, the operating data (concerning operating plans for minor transactions) submitted in compliance with 49 CFR 1180.8(b) (Exhibit 15) appear incomplete. This shortcoming, however, is inconsequential in this case. The application and exhibits are available for inspection in the Public Docket Room at the Offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington, DC. In addition, copies may be obtained upon request from applicants' representatives named above. Any interested person, including government entities, may participate in the proceeding by submitting written comments. Any person who files timely written comments shall be considered a party of record if the person's comments so request. In this event, no petition for leave to intervene need be filed. Consistent with 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1)(iii), written comments must contain: (a) the docket number and title of the proceeding; (b) the name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party and its representative upon whom service shall be made; (c) the commenting party's position, i.e., whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction; (d) a statement of whether the commenting party intends to participate formally in the proceeding or merely comment upon the proposal; (e) if desired, a request for oral hearing with reasons supporting this request; the request must indicate the disputed material facts that can only be resolved at a hearing; and
