FR940503-2-00108 FR940503-2-00074 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,403] Johnson Controls, Inc., Bennington, VT; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On April 5, 1994, the workers with the support of their Congressman, requested administrative reconsideration of the Department's denial notice for workers at the subject firm. The notice was issued on March 15, 1994 and was published in the Federal Register on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14876). It's claimed that an appropriate subdivision at Johnson Controls in Bennington, Vermont was adversely affected by increased imports because Johnson Controls moved a part of the production process (the filling, charging, decorating and installing) at Bennington to a plant in Mexico. The charged batteries will then reenter the U.S. as imports. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, DC, this 21st day of April 1994. Robert O. Deslongchamps, Director, Office of Legislation & Actuarial Services, Unemployment Insurance Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10592 Filed 5&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
