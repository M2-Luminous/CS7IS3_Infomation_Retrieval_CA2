But the court is one thing -- and the job is another. V. Linnik, who had issued a number of orders by the end of the day, and the small group of journalists who support him, proved unable to produce a newspaper: PRAVDA did not appear on 7 April. Yesterday there was a joint meeting of Journalists Union members and the PRAVDA journalists' collective. The meeting relieved Viktor Linnik, who was reinstated in his post by the court, of his duties as PRAVDA chief editor. Aleksandr Ilin was again elected to that post. So Viktor Linnik is giving the orders, while the vast majority of PRAVDA workers are producing the newspaper. [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0911 GMT on 8 April adds: "PRAVDA with a circulation of 218,000 is now run by Greek businessman Jannis Jannikos, the president of the `PRAVDA international' joint stock company."]
