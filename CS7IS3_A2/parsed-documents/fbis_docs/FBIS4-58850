Even though everyone is talking about Yemeni unity and maintaining it, why do we see the opposite? [Al-Dali] Regrettably we would not have liked to talk about such incidents, such bloody, painful, and tragic incidents. But as you have observed, the incidents began some time ago with the liquidation of the southern brigades stationed in the northern governorates. As the YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] did not take any military stand on these liquidations, influential elements in Sanaa seem to have taken advantage of this situation and began to liquidate the Ba-Suhayb Brigade. This, in turn, led to the flare up of the military situation. The military mentality, which thinks there is a military solution for Yemeni problems, is the cause of this situation. [Abu-al-Majd] You had some demands about implementing the Pledge and Accord Document and emphasized the first article of that document, which concerns security. Can we have a further explanation? [Al-Dali] Yes, we had demands that were agreed on by all those who signed the document, including the brothers in the General People's Congress. We signed an agreement that the assassins of the YSP leaders and those who wreaked havoc on the country and brushed the citizens' and Yemen's security aside must be arrested. We said this was the first step to restoring confidence and that they must arrest the assassins first to enable us to stay in Sanaa and prepare for the committees' meeting. But this did not happen and the agreement's first article has not been implemented. [Abu-al-Majd] And this is why the war began? [Al-Dali] They wanted to evade the implementation of the document and cause the military situation to flare up. They never liked the document and were not ready to implement it. They aggravated the military situation to avoid public pressure on them to implement the document. [Abu-al-Majd] How can this situation be reversed now that the Arab League Council has held a session in Cairo and the secretary general was entrusted with consulting Yemeni leaders to stem this bloodshed? In your view, what measures are required to stop this bloodshed? [Al-Dali] First, halt the fighting, then disengage the forces, and then give the brothers--the Arab League, the Arab brothers led by Egypt--an opportunity to try for a political solution to this stormy crisis. [Abu-al-Majd] Before this explosion of the situation, there were mediatory efforts by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and you both signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman. These mediations did not succeed; why? Is it because of you or because of others? [Al-Dali] In fact, we did adhere to the document and still want to implement it. We have said that the situation has to be normalized and confidence restored. [Abu-al-Majd] Will you continue to pursue unity? [Al-Dali] Certainly, certainly. Unity would be ours and the Yemeni people's, and we will carry on with it. [Abu-al-Majd] Despite all that has happened? [Al-Dali] Despite everything. But we will rectify our situation. It has to be corrected. [Abu-al-Majd] How? [Al-Dali] This is up to the dialogue. [Abu-al-Majd] How can there be a dialogue while guns still heard? [Al-Dali] Fighting has to stop first; the bloodshed must be stemmed. And then we should return to the negotiating table and begin to implement the document. These are our demands as a communist party. [Abu-al-Majd] Is the YSP willing to stop the bloodshed or will it fight unilaterally? [Al-Dali] We are willing. But if we halt the fighting while the other party insists on fighting, will we not surrender ourselves for a massacre? [Abu-al-Majd] Are you willing to accept... [Al-Dali, interrupting] Yes in principle. [Abu-al-Majd] But are you willing to accept Arab buffer forces, if such a proposal is resubmitted, discussed, and accepted by the Arab league? [Al-Dali] If necessary. If it is necessary and there is no other way to halt the fighting, we have no objections at all. [Abu-al-Majd] Do you not refuse to receive an Arab delegation carrying these proposals? [Al-Dali] Not at all. We have no objection if all other means are exhausted. [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, what is the true and effective way out of this crisis to save the Yemeni people and halt the bloodshed? [Al-Dali] We believe we are suffering a caesarean section with this new situation in Yemen. When we demand a halt to the fighting, we mean to alleviate the pains and afflictions of this caesarean section. That is all I can say. We insist on halting the fighting, not because of a sense of defeat nor to avert the outcome, but to spare the blood of the Yemeni youths who are being killed here and there.
