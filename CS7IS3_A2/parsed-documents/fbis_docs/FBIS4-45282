The large confiscation makes this state appear to be a "drug paradise." During the action taken by members of the Federal Judicial Police and the National Institute To Combat Drugs, several collection centers for the grass that arrived from various parts of the country were dismantled. Included was a shipment brought in by charter from Mexico City, which those responsible were preparing to send to the United States. Also seized were seven vehicles outfitted to transport the marijuana. Arturo Ochoa Palacios and Commander Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, the institution's representative and the Federal Judicial Police deputy commissioner in the state, respectively, gave a detailed account of the operations. The largest seizure took place in the town of Tijuana, where federal agents confiscated a shipment of 2,966 kg of the grass, distributed in 369 rectangular packages concealed among perishable products. They were found in a warehouse of the Olivos Industrial Center, situated on Extension Road, lot 100, which was being guarded by Eleazar Ruiz Diaz and Ruben Alfonso Chavez Baez. In another warehouse located at 10 Sancho Panza Street in the La Mesa precinct's Los Espanoles subdivision, of the same town, the public poisoners had hidden 1,401 kg and 900 grams. There, Noe Covian Sandoval, Alberto Maciel Benitez, and the brothers Cuauhtemoc and Cipriano Covian Garcia were arrested. They had unloaded the drugs from a tractor trailer truck of the Kenworth make, with a tanker, that had arrived from Guadalajara, Jalisco, driven by Jose Manuel Armendariz Torres. Captured in the same town were Eusebio Rodriguez Quintero, Eugenio Hernandez Hernandez, and Luis Garcia Rodriguez, who had in their possession a marijuana shipment weighing 1,319 kg and 400 grams, distributed in 455 packages. The drugs were to be marketed at a machine shop located in the town's central section. Hence, a surveillance operation was mounted, until the aforementioned individuals were caught while setting the price. They had extracted a package of the drugs from a moving van, to show as a sample. Later, with the information given by those in custody, another accomplice, Victor Hugo Garcia Elvira, who had been assigned to carry the drugs to Tijuana, was captured. [passage omitted]
