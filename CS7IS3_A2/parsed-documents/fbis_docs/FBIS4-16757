Officers Union, Russian State Party Have Held Congresses"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first congress of the Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya Derzhavnaya Partiya] was held on 17 April. It was organized by Officers Union's activists under Stanislav Terekhov and representatives of a number of left-wing and patriotic organizations and movements (Russian Federation Communist Party (CPRF), Cossack unions, and so forth). To all appearances, the new organization will be modeled on the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (a charismatic leader, strict internal hierarchy) and is apparently designed as an alternative to it. Stanislav Terekhov said in his address that the new party's closest allies should be the CPRF ("Zyuganov's party") and the Russian Orthodox Church. The congress delegates received a paper entitled "On Statehood," which, to all appearances, will become the new party's ideological platform. The state-patriotic document was drawn up jointly by Officers Union and CPRF experts. Prospects for an alliance between the state patriots and the CPRF, however, will become clear only after the Communist Party's second All-Russia conference, scheduled for 23-24 April. During the conference, the party leaders will have to resolve the dilemma: either they enter the Union of Communist Parties -- the CPSU, hewing to the principles of proletarian internationalism and uncompromising struggle against the current regime; or continue as a left-wing state-patriotic party of constructive opposition. Although on 16 April the Moscow branch of the CPRF decided at Yegor Ligachev's initiative to raise the question of the CPRF's joining the CPSU at the upcoming conference, the proposal is unlikely to be adopted. "Zyuganov's party" is gradually becoming a more and more respectable and law-abiding organization that tries to avoid unnecessary conflicts with the current authorities. Typically, its leaders are inclined to hold May Day festivities together with the trade unions, not Viktor Anpilov's communists (this decision was made by the CPRF Moscow branch and others). One possible form of the CPRF's coalition with the patriotic forces may become the Public Committee for the Rule of Law and People's Power, which was set up yesterday, including both communists and patriots: Stanislav Terekhov, Sergey Baburin, Viktor Ilyukhin, and others.
