The inspection not only has great significance for ensuring the state's scientific decisions and modern management, but will also definitely make great contributions to laying a legal foundation for the country's statistical work. Since the "Statistics Law" was promulgated and put into force more than a decade ago, statistical work has played an increasingly important role in the country's macro-decisionmaking and macroeconomic regulation and control. This year is an important one for building a socialist market economic system. Following the implementation of a series of major reform measures, some interest setups formed in the past have changed and many problems have arisen as a result of the readjustments of interests. Therefore, the situation demands that we build a macroeconomic regulation and control system in line with the development of the market economy as soon as possible, and strive to refine the system. The basic function of statistical work is to conduct statistical surveys and analyses of economic and social development to faithfully reflect the actual situation; and to provide objective, accurate, and reliable information for making scientific decisions and for formulating macroeconomic regulation and control measures. According to information provided by the State Statistics Bureau, over the last few years, the nation's important statistical data as a whole has objectively reflected the trends and changes in the nation's economic performance and has basically been accurate. However, it must be pointed out that individual localities, departments, and some units have a poor understanding of the statistics law; some of them have even ignored it and falsified statistical data. In particular, they have resorted to deception in preparing indicators that reflect their work performance -- radically violating the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, damaging the party's good traditions and style, and disturbing reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy. If this mistake of extreme egoism and regional protectionism is allowed to spread, the country's scientific decisions and macroeconomic regulation and control are bound to lose reliable ground, which will have a disastrous affect on the healthy development of the nation's economy. People in economic circles have pointed out: Currently, the prominent characteristic of fraudulent practice in statistical work is to use falsified data to win either personal or a small group's political honor and to favor their economic interests. For instance, to show their "work performance," the leaders of a certain county asked their agriculture bureau to increase peasants' per-capita net income from 188 yuan to 204 yuan. But, when they learned that the higher authorities had decided to treat counties in which peasants' per-capita net income was less than 200 yuan as counties eligible to receive impoverishment relief aid, they again asked the statistics and agriculture bureau to change the per-capita net income to 183 yuan and submit it to departments concerned in order to be awarded an impoverishment relief fund. In another example, in an attempt to make their county the province's first to double its total industrial and agricultural output value, the leaders of a certain county fabricated a string of figures for announcement by the news media, causing a very bad influence. Fraudulent practice in statistical work is by no means an ordinary violation of discipline in economic life -- its damaging and corroding effects are extremely serious. When commenting on this matter, a leader of the National People's Congress Standing Committee seriously pointed out that we must have adequate understanding of the serious damage caused to society by this law-violating act, and that we should unrelentingly investigate cases of this kind. A person in charge of the State Council stressed: The news media should timely expose cases that have caused a bad influence. We should educate a large number of people with each case exposed. We should respect facts at any time and under any circumstances -- this is the fundamental principle our party has always upheld, our party's lifeline. We can expect that, through the current inspection of enforcement of the statistics law, new progress will be made in laying a legal foundation for the country's statistical work.
