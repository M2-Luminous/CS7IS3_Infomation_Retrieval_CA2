Shumeyko's Salary Will Equal Chernomyrdin's"] [Text] A deputy who is to sign up to work for any committee of the parliament's upper chamber will now be paid the same monthly salary as a minister -- this is today a little more than 300,000 rubles [R]. This was decided yesterday by the Federation Council, which got down to tackling the unpopular question of providing sustenance for itself and made a serious attempt to put its needs within more or less modest limits. Following this principle, the salaries of committee chairmen will be the same as those of vice premiers, and those of vice speakers will be the same as those of first vice premiers. The pay of Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko will become level with that of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. Until then, according to the "Temporary Rules," each senator will receive five minimum monthly salaries (that is, R70,000) a month for "deputy expenses," or mailing, printing, and so on. As of yesterday, however, every one of them has the right to hire any number of assistants provided their total pay does not exceed 80 minimum monthly wages, or R1.12 million a month. Curiously, in order not to scout for personnel around the capital, it was suggested to the new parliamentarians that they take a look at the lists of the now unemployed assistants of the former body of deputies. The bulk of expenses will naturally fall on the senate's staff. Its final structure has not been determined yet. At any rate, it has been decided that at first each of the Federation Council committees will employ 12 persons. The main supporting force will be the chamber's general staff: the staff head and three of his deputies will be in charge of an analytical center, three legal departments, departments for information technologies, relations with Federation components, international departments, and a press center, plus the inevitable personnel department, general affairs, logistics, and other departments. According to Vladimir Shumeyko, nearly 400 persons will thus get jobs. Importantly, the number is primarily limited by the lack of space in the Federation Council building, the former State Committee of Construction building. The staff can be increased of course, "if we take over the lean-to, a little building...."
