This was discovered as a part of the research to establish an industrial process for synthesizing PPS directly from aromatic compounds such as sulfur chloride, xylene, and diphenyl sulfide. This makes possible the production at one tenth the present price of PPS if produced on the same scale as existing plants. Super molecular weight PPS which was synthesized with a new method via polysulfonium can be processed into a transparent film or fibers; moreover, polysulfonium as a stable intermediate product is expected to have many applications such as photoresist, temperature sensors, polymer alkyl reaction reagent, and ion exchange resin. The research group of Professor Tsuchida discovered an oxidative polymerization reaction system where PPS can be synthesized at a yield of nearly 100% when xylene and sulfur chloride are reacted at normal temperatures and normal pressures in the presence of trace quantities of vanadyl compound under an air flow. Characteristics are that the polymerization reaction progresses at room temperature, byproducts are not produced, and high purity PPS can be synthesized. Prior research confirms that it is sufficiently used as a low cost, practical process with a simple method which can produce it just by mixing two compounds. On the other hand, it was confirmed that it was possible to synthesize selectively a useful disulfide compound by suppressing the oxidation process with aromatic compounds and sulfur chloride in the same reaction. When the bis(4-bromophenyl thiophenyl)disulfide attained with this method is polymerized, the synthesis of super molecular weight PPS becomes possible. Furthermore, the method to synthesize amorphous, super molecular weight PPS was newly discovered from the new synthesis reaction system to be the initial source of sulfide compounds. The characteristics of this system are the point of making polysulfonium which is soluble in the solvent be the source material, that it is easy to grow high molecular weight bodies, and that the methyl radical can be simply removed from the polymer formed. Thus, the super high molecular weight PPS with a molecular weight of about 250,000 was successfully synthesized. Since this PPS can be produced at room temperature unlike prior products from prior research, it was confirmed that it is amorphous and its processing into films or fibers is simple. Also, with this method, sulfide and sulfonium are alternately connected via the phenyl radical and the synthesis of polysulfonium having a very high, super polarized structure became possible. Because this material has optical and electrical properties, much is expected of it as a new material.
