He said that the precarious situation that developed in the nuclear energy complex resulted from non-payment by the Russian Grid joint-stock company for the electricity received from nuclear power stations. The company ran up a debt of 674 billion rubles. Planned work to ensure safe operation of nuclear power stations had to be stopped because of the lack of funds. Unless the situation changes, the Balakovo nuclear power station will have to be shut down for safety reasons in June. The station's operators salaries are in arrears for three months. "Operators are despairing and the situation may get out of control any time", Startsev said. The work of the entire nuclear fuel cycle is paralysed by the lack of funds, Lev Ryabev, Russian first deputy minister of nuclear power, told reporters. Production amalgamation "Mashinostritelny Zavod" stopped the manufacture of clusters of fuel elements. The Chepetsk mechanical plant producing zirconium was stopped. There is a similar situation at complexes in Krasnoyarsk-26, Tomsk-7, Kirovo-Chepetsk and at nuclear machine building plants. It will be necessary to lower the capacity of power generating sets at nuclear stations to prolong their operation with the use of whatever fuel remains, Ryabev said. If a nuclear power plant is shut down, it will take seven to ten years for reactors to cool off. Fuel storages will have to be maintained in a safe state. This will require the consumption of large amounts of electricity, and hence huge outlays. In view of the fact that funds needed for the maintenance of normal operation of stations are not allocated, the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Industry and the Central Committee of the trade union made a proposal to the State Duma to envisage the allocation to nuclear power stations of 560 billion rubles from the budget on easy terms when the Russian budget for 1994 is finally drawn up. If this proposal is not accepted, it will take a much larger sum, over one thousand billion rubles, to shut off nuclear stations.
