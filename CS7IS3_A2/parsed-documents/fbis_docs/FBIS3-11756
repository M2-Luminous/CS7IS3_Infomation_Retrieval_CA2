The resumption of sessions on 22 March was a reply of sorts to the warning in the statements made by the U.S. ambassador in Port-au-Prince. William Lacy Swing had hoped for a normalization of the Senate with the presidency of Firmin Jean-Louis. But such was not the case. Edner Jean reports: [Begin recording] [Jean] The warning from the U.S. Embassy clicked in the Senate -- but in a sense opposite to that Ambassador Swing had perhaps hoped for. The office led by Senator Bernard Sansaricq had not held sessions for three weeks, giving priority to the negotiations of the Alliance [for Parliamentarya Cohesion] which was trying to put an end to the internal divergence. The first effect of the U.S. Embassy press release was the cessation of those talks. Alliance senators, divided on the question of the two offices, had to go back to their camp, which led Dejean Belizaire, president of this political bloc, to say that the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its existence only to the firm determination of its members. He deplores what he calls the brutal interference of the U.S. Embassy in Senate affairs. [Belizaire] If the international community has good reason to satisfy the whims of President Aristide and those of the legislators close to him and encourages them to violate the Governors Island accord, the New York pact, and the Constitution, the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion owes its existence only to the firm determination of its members to defend the Constitution and to promote an ideal of peace, justice, and democracy worthy of our ancestors' struggle to make Haiti into a modern state, independent and sovereign. The Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion deplores the brutal interference of the U.S. ambassador in the Senate's affairs. [end recording] [Jean] Besides those protests from the president of the Alliance, the senators elected on 18 January, the main target of Mr. Swing's statements, reiterated that they had returned to the parliament to stay. Proof of their determination: In response to the Embassy's press release, they oppose a draft resolution severely castigating the office led by Firmin Jean-Louis. Let us listen to Romel Manigat: [Manigat] The senators are setting a dangerous precedent, meaning the lack of respect for the decisions made by the majority, and are introducing a subversive parliamentary practice which consists of having recourse to foreign interference in order to influence the legal decisions of a legitimate power of a sovereign state each time the petty interests of a minority are threatened. Considering that Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, Julio Larossiliere, and Yvon Gislain failed in their constitutional oath provided in Article 109; considering that it is necessary to reinforce discipline in the Senate and to protect the Haitian nation's superior interests, I am requesting, if it please the honorable members of the Senate Discipline and Ethics Committee, that you propose to the senators a draft resolution requesting the application of the 4 March 1994 resolution suspending the senators judged guilty for a four-month period with loss of their salary. [end recording] [Jean] Another consequence of the press release from the U.S. Embassy is to remind the Bernard Sansaricq office that it had a government to dismiss and another to constitute as soon as possible. On that side, the senators from GARD [Action Group for the Recovery and Defense of National Sovereignty] and of the Alliance are mixing speed with haste. They do not agree on the best ways to achieve their goal. [Unidentified senator] Starting 22 March, Prime Minister Robert Malval's resigning government is no longer authorized to deal with the day-to-day matters of the Haitian state. Article 2. The day-to-day matters of the Haitian state will from now on be dealt with by the directors general of the various ministries of the first rank below the resigning prime minister and under the control of the legislative power. [passage omitted]. [Jean] All things considered, despite the firm statements and the unreserved support of the Americans to the office led by Firmin Jean-Louis, the control of the Senate of the Republic seems to have definitively escaped the normalized office. In any case, the contested senators elected on 18 January proved on 22 March their firm determination to challenge the international community, which was expecting a regularization of the situation in the Senate in order to vote on the legislators' plan.
