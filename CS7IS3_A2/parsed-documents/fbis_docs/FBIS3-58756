It promises again to cautiously explore the scope of action for interest rate policy moves. It resolutely rejects forced interest rate cuts to boost the economic cycle, and refuses, equally resolutely, to solve Germany's economic problems through a devaluation of the German mark by means of lower interest rates. The Bundesbank says in its report that it remains the most important monetary policy task to return to price stability. It stresses that this would also provide a basis for lasting growth and would be a contribution to the safeguarding of Germany's economic base. To make it successful, however, it must be supported by a moderate wage policy and by an economic and financial policy seeking stable framework conditions. The Bundesbank believes that the money supply target for 1994, which has been set at between 4 and 6 percent, can be reached. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank also examines the question of how German savers have reacted to the capital yield tax. Before the new tax was introduced, there were massive evasion reactions and "evasion deals" through financial centers in the neighbor countries. Unlike the "withholding tax" of 1989, however, most of them were not accompanied by definitive capital outflows. In view of no more than 11 (as against an estimated 24) billion German marks in gross earnings from the capital yield tax, the Bundesbank criticizes the federal finance minister for having underestimated the extent of the evasion reaction. It admits, however, that probably only the smaller part of the deficit can be explained by tax evasion abroad. The wrong forecast has above all something to do with the applications for tax exemption by which a larger part of the income was exempted from tax than originally expected. Another factor is the extensive decline in the average yield since the spring of 1992. According to the Bundesbank, the largest vehicle by far for portfolio shifts are foreign investment funds. The second most important "evasion instrument" were investments in the Euromarket.
