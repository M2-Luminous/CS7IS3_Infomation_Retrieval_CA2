Total cases, lost workday cases and nonfatal without lost workday cases are expressed as incidence rates are per 100 full-time employees (200,000 person hours). Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 2424, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1991. The most recent lost-workday incidence rate for logging was 9.9, which is almost double the 5.0 incidence rate in the manufacturing sector and almost three times the 3.7 incidence rate for the private sector combined. The lost-workday rate, that is an indicator of the severity of cases, is extremely high in the logging industry (274.8 lost workdays per 100 full-time workers). It is more than three times the private sector lost-workday rate (79.8) and more than double the manufacturing lost-workday rate (101.1). 2. Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes an annual Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). The CFOI is a systematic and verifiable count of fatally injured public and private sector workers. This census uses administrative records, such as death certificates, workers' compensation fatality claims, medical examiners' records, and other reports to Federal and State agencies, to identify the workplace fatalities and complete descriptive data on the workers and circumstances of their deaths. According to the 1992 CFOI, the most recent data available, 158 logging employees were killed while performing logging operations. Table 3 shows that more than 60 percent were using power tools and performing cutting activities at the time of their death. Almost 20 percent were killed while operating logging machines or vehicles.
