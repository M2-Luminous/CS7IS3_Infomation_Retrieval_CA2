FR940725-0-00164 FR940725-0-00019 In paragraph (a) of the final rule OSHA continues the requirement that was found in the first sentence of paragraph (a)(1) in the previous text. The employer is required to disconnect, blank off, or otherwise block by a positive method all pipelines that could carry hazardous materials into spaces that have been tested and found safe for work. There were no substantive comments addressing this provision. Although OSHA has clarified the language with this rule, the substance remains the same. The second sentence of paragraph (a)(1) in the previous text required that manholes and other closures of a space that were secured during the testing of the space remain secured afterwards to prevent alteration of the tested space atmosphere. OSHA has eliminated this requirement from the final rule. OSHA has decided that it would be more appropriate to recognize that closures of tested spaces may be opened safely for various reasons during work operations and that a requirement for them to remain secured was unnecessary. What is critical for safety is that the atmospheric conditions within the space remain within permissible levels. Therefore, OSHA will continue to recognize the need to test and monitor spaces as necessary. This will assure that safe work atmospheres are maintained and if they are not, work must be stopped regardless of how the atmosphere becomes contaminated. Paragraph (b) of the final rule (as was the third sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of the previous rule) is intended to ensure that a safe working environment is maintained within a previously tested space, even if outside contaminants may have been introduced into the space after initial testing. The final rule says that when any changes occur that could alter conditions within the space or other dangerous atmospheres, work shall be stopped until the space is visually inspected, retested and found to comply with §§1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14 of this part, as applicable. To provide guidance to employers on what changes would require work be stopped, OSHA has included a note with examples. Paragraph (c) of the final rule requires a competent person to test atmospheric conditions within a previously tested space as often as necessary to maintain conditions as specified on certificates issued by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person. The Agency has changed the format of the final rule and this new paragraph (c) addresses only the language that was found in paragraph (a)(4) of the previous rule. The requirements that were found in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of the previous text are not addressed in this section because they are covered elsewhere in OSHA's requirements or they have been moved to a more appropriate section of the final rule. For example, previous paragraph (a)(3) required employers to ensure that employees understand and obey all warning signs, tags, and the language of Marine Chemists' certificates. The requirement addressing employee understanding of the warning labels is found in §1915.16 of this Subpart. OSHA considers paragraph (c) of the final rule to be an editorial change to the language that was found in the first sentence of paragraph (a)(4) in the previous rule and therefore, non-substantive. In paragraph (d) of the final rule, OSHA requires that if a competent person finds that atmospheric conditions within a space fail to meet the applicable requirements of §§1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14 of Subpart B, work in the space must be stopped, the space retested by a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person and a new certificate issued in accordance with §1915.14(a) before work may resume. The language found in paragraph (d) is similar to that found in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(4) of the previous standard and the basic requirement remains the same. Modifications to the previous language have changed references to the maintenance of gas-free conditions to the maintenance of conditions meeting §§1915.12, 1915.13, and 1915.14. These sections address not only gas-free conditions but also other hazardous atmospheric conditions to which an employee may be exposed, which are also within the scope of the certificate. OSHA believes that separating the two requirements found in paragraph (a)(4) of the previous rule into separate paragraphs (c) and (d) of the final rule will improve compliance by making the rule easier to understand. Paragraph (e) of the final rule requires a competent person to continue to test as necessary those spaces he or she has tested previously to ensure that the atmospheric conditions within the tested space are maintained. This is consistent with both NFPA 306 and industry practice. The substance of the final rule is similar to the language proposed in 1988 and the first sentence of paragraph (b)(2) of the previous rule except that, like paragraph (c) above, tests are to be conducted for all relevant atmospheric conditions. In paragraph (f) of the final rule, OSHA requires that all work be stopped in those spaces tested previously by a competent person when a competent person finds that the conditions within the space no longer meet the requirements set forth elsewhere in this subpart. The language in paragraph (f) of the final rule is similar to the language proposed in paragraph (g) of the 1988 proposal and is parallel to the language contained in paragraph (d) above.
