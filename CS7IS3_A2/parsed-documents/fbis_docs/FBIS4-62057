This is how the situation was described by participants of an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Maritime Trade Union Federation and the Coordination Committee for Joint Actions, which took place here today. The meeting discussed the extraordinary situation in the territory, which is deteriorating with every passing day. More than one-third of the territory's production capacities have already come to a standstill. The number of unemployed has topped 10,000, according to official figures. Unofficial sources claim their number is five times bigger. The average monthly cost of a basket of 19 staple foodstuffs now equals to 100,000 rubles in the maritime territory as against 46,000 rubles in the Russian capital and in the rest of the country. According to the most modest estimates, forty per cent of the territory's population are now below the poverty line. The cost of power-carriers is growing and the sum of default payments has grown to astronomic figures due to this. For instance, the local enterprises owe only "Dalenergo" (far eastern power society) as much as 200 billion rubles. The main power supplier is on the verge of bankruptcy. It has no money even to carry out current repairs and to prepare for the winter season. The cost of coal has increased. The local consumers were compelled to give up using imported and liquid fuel. The local resources, which have to be regularly augmented, have diminished to a critical level. The participants of the meeting pointed out that the Russian government, overlooking the region's specific features, was continuing to increase taxes and tariffs on electricity, thereby contributing to the boosting of socio-economic tension in the maritime territory. The centre's latest instruction to raise the cost of one kilowatt of electricity makes the situation in the territory simply explosive. This view was shared by the heads of urban and district administrations of the territory, executives and managers. In their opinion, preferential tariffs for electricity should be fixed to pull the maritime territory out of the social, fuel and power crisis. They also called for the territory's inclusion in the list of regions of the far north and application to it of the law on privileges to their population, paid from the federal budget. Moreover, they believe it is necessary to change the taxation system by differentiating it and substantially reducing the taxes on profits, collected from enterprises. The meeting recommended Vladimir Ignatenko, the presidential representative, to urgently inform Boris Yeltsin on the situation in the maritime territory.
