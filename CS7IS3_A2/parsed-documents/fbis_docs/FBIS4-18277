The government has proposed granting aid to companies "employing, for a minimum of 18 months, a young person who has never before had a stable job." This aid, paid over nine months, will be worth 1,000 French francs [Fr] per month. It will be doubled for any young people taken on before 1 October. A decree will implement the measure as of next week. The prime minister made his decision after discussions with the employment minister and after hearing the report of discussions held by Michel Bon with the social partners. [passage omitted] Cost of Fr6 Billion The National Council of French Employers [CNPF], whose hobby horse is lowering labor costs, also approves of this measure: "This clear and simple decision eliminates all ambiguity concerning the levels of payment and the nature of any possible training. In our eyes, it is a serious factor in calming the concerns expressed by young people." With the exception of the Workers' Force union [FO], which contests the very principle of lowering wage costs, a fairly general consensus is being reached on how to reduce charges which, moreover, was also gone into by the Five-Year Plan [on employment]. Since it is not now possible to directly alter wages, the only alternative is to give aid to the companies -- whatever the cost. The cost of the measures announced yesterday is evaluated at around Fr6 billion in 1994 for 500,000 young people. No details were given as to the source of this funding, which will further widen the budget deficit, unless the windfall from privatization is used, as it has been to recapitalize certain public companies! By deciding to grant a fixed sum for everyone entering their first job, whether or not they are qualified, the government is steering clear of the pitfall of segregating young people, while nevertheless favoring the low-paid. However, it is risking the job placement of older workers, as occurred with Martine Aubry's Exo-Jeunes scheme. However, the government undoubtedly has no other alternative.
