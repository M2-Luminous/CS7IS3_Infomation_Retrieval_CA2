He said that to further develop cross-strait relations, the government is now taking the initiative in handling the issue with a positive, pragmatic, and sensible attitude. Hsiao said that he is not in favor of controlling exports to the mainland. Commenting on a statement made by the Directorate of Budgets, Accounting, and Statistics on 5 January that the country's export dependency on the mainland has approached the danger point, Hsiao pointed out that there is no danger point for the development of cross-strait economic development and trade. He said he does not believe that exports to the mainland should be controlled when they approach the 10-percent level. He said that such a control is not in the interests of the country because it would hurt us first before hurting the other side.
