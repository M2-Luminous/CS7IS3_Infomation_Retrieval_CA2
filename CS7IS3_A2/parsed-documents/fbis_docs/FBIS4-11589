Minister Leal, who met with the American Chamber of Commerce yesterday, said this transition period is required by NAFTA and is necessary because of the special conditions of the region, which is leaving behind a period of wars and conflicts. He said that in a prudent amount of time -- three years -- the Central American economies should adjust themselves to the transformations that are taking place, allowing the countries to maintain current preferences and to have access to the same preferences so they can join NAFTA after the transition period. The chief of Nicaraguan diplomacy said that with the signing of the treaty, Central America is at a serious disadvantage with Mexico. "With the implementation of NAFTA this year, Central America runs the risk of losing its preferential conditions for access to the U.S. market. This is because the reduction of tariffs in this treaty is automatic for 84 percent of Mexican products," he indicated. For the Central American isthmus, 20.1 percent of exports to the United States have a tariff treatment with preferences assigned by the Caribbean Basin Initiative [CBI], the Generalized System of Preferences (SGP), and the Assembly Plant [Maquila] Regimen. During a meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and dignitaries of the Central American region and the Belizean prime minister, a high-level commission was created that will be in charge of the follow-up work on the CBI and Central America's adherence to this extremely important treaty. "It must be noted that the leading products exported to the United States are agriculture and textile products. It is precisely in these sectors that our relative competitiveness with regard to the same products of Mexican origin are adversely affected," Leal said. He added that the seriousness of this situation not only consists of the fact that Mexico is joining the U.S. market, but that it also enjoys a preference that is far beyond the usual tariff treatment. "NAFTA encompasses, in addition to tariff aspects, the so-called nontariff barriers. It also includes specific provisions regarding investments," he pointed out. He added that the CBI lacks these additional benefits, "which constitutes a severe disadvantage for Central American products. It will allow Mexico to compete under better conditions." He said NAFTA will grant Mexico preferential treatment on sugar, which will make the country a net exporter of the product. As for the textile sector, he indicated that the treaty allows 45 percent of Mexican exports to the United States to enjoy a zero tariff, which means Mexico will have an advantage over Central American products in the U.S. market. Finally, he called upon the businessmen to support the treaty signed by the northern countries.
