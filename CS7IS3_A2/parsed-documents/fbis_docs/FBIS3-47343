The top government spokesman told a news conference that Tokyo "attaches great importance" to the summit, which comes at the final stage of framework trade negotiations between the two countries. Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to meet February 11 in Washington to assess the progress of the trade talks, which are being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord reached last July. Takemura said that in addition to talks on bilateral relations, the premier also plans to present Clinton with a specific plan to boost the languishing Japanese economy. Hosokawa will likely visit the U.S. capital from February 10 to 12, Takemura said, adding he had not heard if the Japanese leader would confer with Clinton on more than one occasion.
