[Passage omitted] [Gutierrez] How would you rate your performance in 1993? [Guzman] We have made progress on meeting the goals that we set. This is borne out by the results achieved in our country this year (see below), both in terms of action waged against terrorists as well as against organized crime and drug trafficking. We got rid of nearly 1,000 terrorists and captured 1,873 guerrillas. In addition, the Medellin Cartel has been brought to its knees by the National Police and Escobar was killed. [Gutierrez] Not all sectors see the crack in the guerrilla organization so clearly. [Guzman] We have made progress this year on breaking up the guerrilla organization thanks to the intervention of the Prosecutor General's Office. Without its help, we would not have been able to put that many terrorists behind bars. Charges have been filed against every one of them and their illegal activities are being spelled out in detail. We have filed our evidence and those guerrillas will be brought before the courts. [Gutierrez] In practice, is there not more than one area off limits to the Army? [Guzman] No. To date, no area has been declared off limits to the Army. The Army has gone in and enforced the law. I can give you one example: In the San Lucas Mountains, funds for the ELN [Army of National Liberation] came from gold mining and cocaine operations and the Army went in and took control of the situation. The same is true of San Jose del Guaviare. We cleaned the area out. [Gutierrez] But we are still seeing videos of terrorist summit conferences in areas under the jurisdiction of the Mobile Brigades, the antiterrorist forces. [Guzman] That is all highly relative. The videos that they are showing us are not at all authentic. It is easy to stage a meeting in the jungle in two or three days. They can easily meet and immediately break up again and that is what happened. In some cases in which we went in on the basis of information that we had, the individuals had already held their meeting and left. It is all highly relative when one is operating in a jungle area. There you have to move troops by helicopter and sometimes, for any number of reasons, you may not have the logistics in place and be forced to postpone the mission for 24 hours. In such cases, when an operation is postponed, those elements immediately change their plans. [Gutierrez] How do the troops view the process that began with the [Socialist Renewal] Current (CRS)? [Guzman] As very positive. I wish that other terrorist organizations would hear us and understand the importance of peace. I think that that is the best way, the solution chosen by the previous terrorist groups and the one now being used by the CRS. It believes that the most positive option is unquestionably to engage in dialogue and a favorable solution for the nation. [Gutierrez] What about the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and the ELN? [Guzman] I think that what is happening in this case is that the terrorists do not want to even hear about any dialogue, which is an enormous mistake because they have not allowed the conditions to be created for the National Government to take the position of talking with them. They have always played tricks. Now all the guerrillas want to do is engage in extortion, steal livestock from ranches, actively engage in actual drug trafficking, and become the third-ranking drug cartel in order to finance their activities. [Gutierrez] Does that explain attacks like the last one in Guican? [Guzman] The guerrillas as such have been defeated for quite some time. Now they are acting like the rings that engage in common crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism. I can guarantee that these organizations have reached one of their lowest points ever because we are hitting them everywhere. Such actions can only be explained when dealing with a ring of criminals. Drug traffickers attack anything they can and the FARC and ELN care about absolutely nothing. In Sumapaz, they machine-gunned an ambulance even though it was properly identified, which shows a total lack of respect for human rights in general. They hide behind the shield of human rights of which they themselves are the worst violators.... The terrorists have distorted information in order to discredit the Armed Forces and the Police for alleged irregular conduct. [Gutierrez] The Attorney General's Office agrees on this, but the organization has also filed a number of isolated complaints against members of the Armed Forces. [Guzman] I think we have made great progress in this area this year. We have drafted regulations and convinced our people that they must respect human rights. That business about the Attorney General's Office "syndrome" has disappeared. The Ministry of Justice has proceeded with total transparency. Some investigations have even been conducted jointly. In the case of Riofrio, for example, we turned our investigation over to the Attorney General's Office, as we did in the case of Uraba. There, the Armed Forces inspector and deputy attorney general worked together. The Army has absoslutely no interest in covering up any crime or any alleged crime that we are said to have committed. We shall not hesitate to discipline or impose criminal penalties on those guilty of irregular conduct.
