Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said aid to Malaysia and 1 billion pounds in defence sales were linked between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by the then Defence Secretary George Younger. Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee: "There was a temporary, incorrect entanglement, but there is now no link." And the Government accused Malaysia of being "short-sighted" in imposing its trade ban last week in response to British press allegations surrounding the Pergau dam project and arms sales to the former colony. Labour later claimed Mr Hurd's evidence, during a grilling by MPs which lasted almost three hours, was "incredible" and that the link between aid and arms sales must have continued after June 1988. Britain contributed 234 million pounds to the dam construction, believed to be the largest amount of overseas aid for a single project in British history, while the Ministry of Defence discussed a 1 billion pound defence with Malaysia [as received]. Premier Mahathir Mohamad, angered by reports on the affair in Britain which included corruption accusations, has banned UK firms from applying for contracts for Malaysian Government business in a return to its Buy British Last policy. [passage omitted] Earlier, John Major accused the Malaysian Government of being "short-sighted" for freezing out British firms. In a radio interview, the Prime Minister said Malaysia owed much of its economic development to British trade and investment and its interests would be equally badly affected. He told BBC Radio 4's "Today" programme: "I don't believe that what the Malaysian Government has done to British companies is remotely justified." Malaysia was "within striking distance" of achieving its ambition to become an industrialised country. He added: "I believe it is short-sighted to have acted as they have done, and I believe that over time they may be seen to have damaged the Malaysian interest as much as the British." Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad drummed home the message later in a speech to businessmen from the Asia-Pacific advisory group in which he warned that Malaysia had missed its target and was hurting "its friends." Mr Goodlad said British exports to Malaysia were worth almost 1 billion pounds last year alone but added: "Trade benefits both partners. It should be encouraged, not blocked." [passage omitted] In his appearance before the committee, Mr Hurd criticised the "swirl of speculative allegations" about the dam project, adding: "To the best of my knowledge, most of these stories are creatures of fancy." He said Britain was keen to increase trade with Malaysia in 1988 and the Ministry of Defence had been negotiating a 1 billion pound defence deal. A protocol signed by Mr Younger, now Lord Younger, "reflected the Malaysian wish" for British aid equivalent to 20 percent of the defence deal, Mr Hurd said. The link was broken three months later when the Ministry of Defence realised it was incorrect. The Malaysians were informed in a letter from Mr Younger but the committee heard that Malaysia was given a commitment for 200 million pounds in British aid in a different letter on the same day. Labour's Dennis Canavan asked Mr Hurd how he thought the Malaysians would have viewed this. "Would you not even have the tiniest bit of suspicion there was a link between these two messages, or would you just think it was Christmas?" he asked. Mr Hurd stressed the Government had "learned from the Pergau experience" and procedures were tightened. But shadow foreign secretary Jack Cunningham dismissed his evidence as "inadequate, contradictory and incredible." He said: "There can only be one explanation for the fact that the Prime Minister John Major and the Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd ignored the clear advice of their accounting officer that the dam project was `an abuse of the aid system.' That is that the two projects continued to be linked, despite the denial by Conservative ministers to the House of Commons, the Public Accounts Committee and now the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. ``The fact that British trade and British jobs are now at risk is entirely the fault of the Conservative Government and Conservative ministers and their disreputable deals.''
