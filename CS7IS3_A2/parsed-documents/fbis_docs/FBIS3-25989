Comrades in charge of political and legal affairs work from across the province conscientiously studied a series of important instructions issued by a number of central leaders with regard to maintaining political stability and social order; analyzed in an in-depth manner the province's present political and legal affairs work on the basis of summing up last year's work; and laid down the tasks for 1994 in light of Qinghai's realities. Provincial party committee Secretary Yin Kesheng delivered a speech at the closing session in which he stated: Over the past year, political and legal affairs workers across the province have made strenuous efforts and scored noticeable achievements. We are going to accomplish more onerous tasks in 1994. Given the fact that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the "Decision on Several Questions on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we are bound to witness speedier reform and construction in 1994. We are facing an excellent opportunity for faster development on the one hand and a rigorous test and challenge on the other. In order to narrow the gap between Qinghai and the rest of the country and more successfully push ahead with reform and construction, we should comprehensively step up political and legal affairs work and strive to maintain social stability. Speaking of Qinghai's political and legal affairs work in 1994, Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: We should understand more clearly the importance of political and legal affairs work in the new situation; unswervingly adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two types work at the same time; and make every possible endeavor to maintain provincewide stability. To this end, Yin Kesheng added, efforts should be made to strengthen leadership; conduct work in a down-to-earth manner; and strive to open up new vistas for the province's political and legal affairs work in 1994. First and foremost, the provincial political and legal affairs committee should strengthen leadership over all political and legal affairs departments across the province; strengthen coordination among and supervision of public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs at all levels; and work hard to open up new vistas for the province's political and legal affairs work. Second, party committees at all levels across the province should strengthen overall leadership over political and legal affairs work while governments at all levels should render unreserved support to political and legal affairs work with a view to further pushing ahead with the province's political and legal affairs work in 1994. Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: The political and legal affairs workers in Qinghai are loyal to the party and the people. Over the past many years they have made indelible contributions to Qinghai's stability and development. Nevertheless, problems have also been discovered within the ranks of political and legal affairs workers. In view of this situation, it is necessary to make every possible endeavor to turn the province's contingent of political and legal affairs workers into a contingent that is politically reliable, professionally competent, and capable of fighting tough battles and withstanding all tests and is supported and cherished by the broad masses of the people across the province. Comrade Yin Kesheng maintained: It would be impossible to successfully further political and legal affairs work in the absence of the party and government's leadership and support. Thus, party committees and governments at all levels in Qinghai should continue, as always, to attach great importance to and support political and legal affairs work; constantly guide political and legal affairs work with correct principles and policies; assist political and legal affairs departments to independently investigate and handle cases in accordance with the law as well as strictly enforcing the law under the guidance of the party's basic line; show concern for and help political and legal affairs departments tackle problems in work; and assist public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs in updating technological equipment and improving working conditions. Comrade Yin Kesheng stated: The whole society is undoubtedly duty-bound to step up political and legal affairs work and improve social order. All areas, departments, trades, and professions as well as all social strata should give support to and enhance cooperation with political and legal affairs departments and join them in successfully strengthening management of comprehensive social order. All units, urban district offices, and neighborhood committes, as well as rural and pastoral villages and townships across the province, should make continued efforts to establish and perfect a responsibility system aimed at stepping up comprehensive social order management with a view to creating an overall social atmosphere for maintaining social order and improving the general social mood, wherein all bad deeds and people will be invariably opposed, thereby: Exerting more social pressure on all types of criminals; improving social order across the province in a comprehensive way; and lowering the province's crime rate to a minimum. Chen Yanqin, Tang Zhengren, and Doba, provincial party committee standing committee members; Huanjue Cenam, provincial people's congress standing committee chairman; provincial Vice Governor La Bingli; and other comrades also attended the closing session. Lu Haiping, provincial political and legal affairs committee deputy secretary, made a summing-up speech at the closing session.
