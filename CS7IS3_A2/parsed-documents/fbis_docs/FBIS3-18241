The deficit is 5 billion higher than in 1992 and 4.7 billion higher than expected. What was already understood when the 1994 draft budget was presented was confirmed by the 1993 calculations, which were approved by the Federal Council on Wednesday [23 February]; the federal financial situation has dramatically deteriorated within a year. The bad economic situation affected both the revenue and expenditure side; moreover, the excessive structural burden on the budget has also been clearly demonstrated. The 1993 draft budget still had a deficit of 3,086 million. Meanwhile, Parliament approved 2.9 billion francs in supplementary credits. Actual additional expenditure only amounted to 862 million francs. Moreover, there are credits of 2 billion francs remaining. Thus, these are twice as high as in 1992. On the revenue side, 3.9 billion francs less was earned than expected in the budget. [passage omitted]
