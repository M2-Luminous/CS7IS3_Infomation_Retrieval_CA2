FBIS4-54100 "dreas101_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 South Korea Paper Reacts to DPRK Notice Paper Reacts to DPRK Notice SK2505051494 SK2505051494 BFN [Editorial Report] With the exception of TONG-A ILBO, all Seoul vernacular morning papers on 25 May merely provide straight reports of North Korea's recent notification to the UN Forces side that it was replacing its negotiating body to the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] with a Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army [KPA]. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries, on page 2, a 600-word article by reporter Pak Che-kyun entitled "The Significance of North Korea's `establishment of a Panmunjom Mission'." Reporting on North Korea's notification, the article comments that "this attempt of North Korea aimed at incapacitating the MAC, stems from its intent to topple the present Armistice Agreement system. What is more, it is a product of its hitherto-employed tactics to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement." Holding that the conclusion of a peace agreement with the United States is an overriding goal of North Korea designed to promote the relations with the United States while excluding South Korea, the paper says "Regardless of the North's stance, the ROK and U.S. Governments are assuming a stance that the present Armistice Agreement should be adhered to. Hence, chances are high that the two governments will again call on the North to abide by the Armistice Agreement through a government-level statement or a Panmunjom channel." The article then predicts that "despite North Korea's stubborn persistence on instituting the Panmunjom Mission," the issue would not be a big problem for the MAC system because "the function of the MAC itself was already paralyzed" ever since an ROK general was appointed as a senior member of the UN Forces' side to the MAC. The article then concludes: "Accordingly, the ROK Government is expected to cope with the issue by proclaiming its basic stance to `convert from the present armistice state to a peace state between the North and South' as stipulated in the North-South Agreement."
