Stressing that acts of violence must now come to an end, the president issued the directive during a three-hour meeting with the members of the three peace panels headed by Professor Alfredo Tadiar and former Ambassadors Howard Dee and Manuel Yan. Based on their reports, the chief executive noted that the panels are too cautious about possible legal implications that may arise from the their actions thus slowing their conduct of the peace process. Let me make it very clear that the objective of the peace talks is to stop the violence and the bloodshed, while maintaining our traditional and permanent position of not compromising Philippine sovereignty, the president reminded the group. To achieve that objective I think we should not be too legalistic at this point in time, the important thing is to accomplish the first step which is to stop the violence, he said. Some of the panel members expressed concern that the Congress might question in the future, the legality or the constitutionality of their decisions. However, Ramos gave them the authority to pursue whatever they think will expedite the conduct of the peace process, saying that whatever legal questions might arise could probably be resolved later on. The president also assessed that the government's efforts to stop [words indistinct] long and lasting peace have borne significant results. I think we are achieving the result that we want which is the reduction of violence but we should not lose sight of the fact that although violence has been reduced, it is a fact that there are still people dying out there in the field, he pointed out. The chief executive called on every local government official to fully support the initiatives of the peace panels. He specifically asked the local officials in Mindanao to coordinate their actions with the group of former Ambassador Yan. He received reports that certain governors and other local officials are making moves without consulting the Yan panel. There are still possible clash points and if we are not careful, they might undermine the peace process he said. During the meeting the president was briefed by the panels on the progress of their respective peace talks. Tadiar said that his group will have an informal meeting with the RAM-SFP-YOU [Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan; Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union] which is tentatively scheduled tomorrow, 23 March. He said the meeting will be the first after the talks stalled last December. Yan reported that his panel and the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] mixed-committee are scheduled to resume their meeting tentatively on 4 to 6 April. He said the venues are still being worked out. Dee said that the National Democratic Front [NDF] has backtracked from the planned Vietnam exploratory talks because of their demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order 125. Executive Order 125 signed by the president on 13 September of last year defined the approach and administrative structures for the government's comprehensive peace efforts. They also demanded that preliminary talks be conducted in Europe prior to the Vietnam meet last 16 March. The Dee panel sent a letter to the NDF pressing for the meeting and informing the leadership of a possible amnesty proclamation. They have yet to respond to our letter, Dee said.
