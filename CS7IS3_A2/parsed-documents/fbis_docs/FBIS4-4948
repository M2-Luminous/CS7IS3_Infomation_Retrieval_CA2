According to the South Korean Embassy, the United States expressed disappointment that no progress had been made on Korea's opening its market to American automobiles at the 16th working-level meeting. South Korea, however, said that Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor can discuss the matter while in Morocco this month for the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement. Washington also complained about the way Seoul handles protection of U.S. trademarks and intellectual property rights and demanded the lifting of a regulation on importation of frozen codfish heads and sausages. South Korea expressed concern over the revival of the Super 301 trade provision while protesting the U.S. delay in a new dumping trial for Korean-made color televisions and inclusion of Korean standard pipes in a list coming under anti-dumping regulations. Seoul urged Washington to acknowledge its efforts to protect U.S. intellectual property rights and drop it from the Priority Watch List (PWL). Moreover, South Korea voiced concern over a U.S. court ruling on "business secret violence" between Korea's Iljin Corp. and America's General Electric. The two nations also discussed ways to narrow their differences in the investment and service sectors. Chong Ui-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's International Trade Bureau, led the Korean delegation while Peter Collins, deputy assistant trade representative, headed the U.S. side.
