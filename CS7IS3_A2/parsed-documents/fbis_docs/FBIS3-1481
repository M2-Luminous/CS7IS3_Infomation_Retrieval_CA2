Guy] [Text] Ventersdorp March 28 SAPA -- The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] has challenged the Goldstone Commission to search the African National Congress' [ANC] headquarters following Monday's shooting during a Zulu march in Johannesburg. "In the past he (Mr Justice Richard Goldstone) has not hesitated to raid sensitive military and state installations, and has also not hesitated to condemn white right-wing activists before they have even appeared in court," said a statement by the AWB's Executive Council on Monday evening. It added that the AWB had taken note that peace monitors present had observed that the Zulu march had been peaceful until AK-47-wielding gunmen opened fire without provocation. "Let today's events be a warning to the world: the proud Zulu nation shall not be subjected to communist domination, either in the form of the ANC or the National Party," the AWB said. "Likewise the Boer nation will also not rest until it has won freedom in its own land."
