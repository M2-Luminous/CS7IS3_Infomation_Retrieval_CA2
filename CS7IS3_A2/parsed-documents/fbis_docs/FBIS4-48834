FBIS4-48834 "drafr103_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 27 May South African Press Review for 27 May MB2705142294 MB2705142294 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Mandela's Overtures to White Community -- "Two weeks into his Government's term, [Mandela] seems to be bending over backwards to accommodate De Klerk and the NP [National Party] in a manner that has already antagonized many within the ANC in Parliament." So argues political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba in a commentary published in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 May on page 16. Mandela, the commentary continues, "is so firmly committed to allaying the fears -- perceived and real -- of whites and the business community that he is in danger of soon finding himself a captive of white South Africa." Nyatsumba cites as examples of Mandela's efforts to appeal to the white community his state of the nation address in which he "unveiled remarkably moderate plans" and Mandela's decision to appoint Leon Wessels as deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly despite the ANC parliamentary caucus decision to nominate Bridgit Mabandla to the position. The commentary argues that there is now a need for "a voice to the left of the ANC...in Parliament to remind the new ANC-led government of its responsibility to the black masses." Nyatsumba concludes his commentary: "For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of apartheid in the past will have to be made." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May to 2 June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The editorial says that while President Mandela, "master unifier that he is," might have been expected "to play down the seriousness" of the "secret land deal," no one else has "to fall in step." The paper sees the incident as "an early test of the way in which this country will work under the government of national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts and...encourage the media to go along with this." "We won't," promises the paper. NEW NATION 100-Day Reform Program Viewed -- "The minutes have started ticking by since President Nelson Mandela announced his 100-day reform programme in Parliament this week," begins the Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 27 May in a page 14 editorial. We "welcome the President's approach in making the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven' process." "This approach played a critical role in giving a voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we were to fail like the United States of America did during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white community proved unwilling to share their material success with people of other races." The South African plan should succeed, however, because it "is aimed at unlocking the energies of the multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws." BEELD Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- "A people-centered community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament," begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg BEELD on 25 May. "Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task -- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people of this country, and a people-centered community will be established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies, the management, and the good leadership by government in realizing the above." "Our impression is that President Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy." Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial on the same page notes that "South Africa's formal admission to the Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream. This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa." "For as long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West."
