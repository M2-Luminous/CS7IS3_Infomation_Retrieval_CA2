Chinese President Jiang Zemin is hosting a ceremony to welcome Mauritian President Cassam Uteem and accompanying him in a review of a guard of honor of the three services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This is the sixth time this month that foreign heads of state and government have reviewed the Chinese honor guard, which, in the past six months, has received foreign dignitaries from 26 countries, including the French prime minister and Egyptian president. The frequent appearance of the honor guard of the three services in front of the Great Hall of the People reveals one aspect the busy scenario of this year's Beijing diplomatic activities. In the meantime, Chinese leaders have toured the five continents. The forthcoming official visit to Austria, Germany and Romania by Premier Li Peng starting June 29 will be the sixth major trip abroad by a senior Chinese leader. For China, a country busily engaged in a modernization drive, a peaceful international environment constitutes a major external condition, and the absorption of foreign capital, technologies and advanced expertise is a crucial part of opening up to the outside world. Developing ties with other countries in the diplomatic, economy and trade, scientific and technological, and cultural fields is in line with China's present and future interests. Consolidation and expansion of good-neighborly ties of friendship with other countries remains atop China's diplomatic agenda. Now, a stable and good-neighborly environment has come into being and China's ties with its neighbors have entered the best period in history. In the past few months China has received the Azerbaijani president and the Russian prime minister. During Premier Li Peng's tour of four central Asian countries and Mongolia, China signed a historic border agreement with Kazakhstan and a friendship and co- operation treaty with Mongolia. Frequent high-level exchanges are featured in this year's Sino- Europe relations. In the first half of the year, China played host to Romanian and Estonian presidents as well as prime ministers from Slovakia, Finland, France and Portugal. Meanwhile, chairman Qiao Shi of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman Li Ruihuan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called on eight European nations. The good political links have lent an impetus to the mutually beneficial co-operation in economy and trade, and science and technology. As a result, the economic and trade co-operation between China and western Europe has maintained strong growth, while that between China and eastern Europe has been reinvigorated following a period of stagnation. The past six months have also witnessed new growth in ties between China and the American countries. A Chinese Communist Party (CPC) group headed by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, travelled to Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and the presidents of Ecuador, Surinam and Peru have been to China. The trip to Beijing by Canadian Governor General Hnatyshyn marked the normalization of all-round ties between the two countries. The Canadian prime minister is also expected to be here later this year. Sino-U.S. ties have maintained the trend toward improvement and development. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Secretary of State Warren Christopher have visited Beijing this year, while Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, State Councillor Song Jian and Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Wu Yi have been invited to visit the U.S. In addition, the three joint commissions on economy, commerce and trade, and science and technology have been reopened. At the end of last May U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to extend China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status and to delink future annual MFN reviews from human rights issues. The decision creates favorable conditions for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic co-operation between the two sides and for the improvement and growth of the overall relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, during the past six months China has continued to consolidate its unity and co-operation with African countries. Earlier this year, it resumed diplomatic ties with Lesotho. And the defunct apartheid system and the birth of a new South Africa has created favorable conditions for the establishment and development of friendly ties of co-operation between China and South Africa. Apart from all this, China has been actively involved in multilateral diplomacy and has strengthened its co-operation with other countries within the United Nations and other international organizations. At the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights last March China frustrated, with the support of other justice-upholding countries, an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. This once again demonstrated the degree of unity and co-operation between China and other developing countries. At present, Beijing is vigorously making preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women, to be held here next year. In addition, after signing the Uruguay Round accords, China is girding itself to become a founding member of the World Trade Organization.
