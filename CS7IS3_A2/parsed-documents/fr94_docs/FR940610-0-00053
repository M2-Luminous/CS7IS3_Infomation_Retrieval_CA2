Immediately following §1.643(d)-2, an undesignated center heading and §1.642(c)&hyph;6A are added to read as follows: Pooled Income Fund Actuarial Tables Applicable Before May 1, 1989 §1.642(c)&hyph;6A Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989. (a) Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is before January 1, 1952. There was no provision for the qualification of pooled income funds under section 642 until 1969. See §20.2031&hyph;7A(a) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for the determination of the present value of a charitable remainder interest created before January 1, 1952. (b) Valuation of charitable remainder interests for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971. No charitable deduction is allowable for a transfer to a pooled income fund for which the valuation date is after the effective dates of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 unless the pooled income fund meets the requirements of section 642(c)(5). See §20.2031&hyph;7A(b) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for the determination of the present value of a charitable remainder interest for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1951, and before January 1, 1971. (c) Present value of remainder interest in the case of transfers to pooled income funds for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983. For the determination of the present value of a remainder interest in property transferred to a pooled income fund for which the valuation date is after December 31, 1970, and before December 1, 1983, see §20.2031&hyph;7A(c) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) and former §1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1994). (d) Present value of remainder interest dependent on the termination of one life in the case of transfers to pooled income funds made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989 _(1) In general. For transfers to pooled income funds made after November 30, 1983, for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, the present value of the remainder interest at the time of the transfer of property to the fund is determined by computing the present value (at the time of the transfer) of the life income interest in the transferred property (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and subtracting that value from the fair market value of the transferred property on the valuation date. The present value of a remainder interest that is dependent on the termination of the life of one individual is computed by use of Table G in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. For purposes of the computation under this section, the age of an individual is to be taken as the age of the individual at the individual's nearest birthday. (2) Present value of life income interest. The present value of the life income interest in property transferred to a pooled income fund shall be computed on the basis of: (i) Life contingencies determined from the values of lx that are set forth in Table LN of §20.2031&hyph;7A(d)(6) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations); and (ii) Discount at a rate of interest, compounded annually, equal to the highest yearly rate of return of the pooled income fund for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding its taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the yearly rate of return of a pooled income fund is determined as provided in §1.642(c)&hyph;6(c) unless the highest yearly rate of return is deemed to be 9 percent. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the first taxable year of a pooled income fund is considered a taxable year even though the taxable year consists of less than 12 months. However, appropriate adjustments must be made to annualize the rate of return earned by the fund for that period. Where it appears from the facts and circumstances that the highest yearly rate of return for the 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property is made has been purposely manipulated to be substantially less than the rate of return that would otherwise be reasonably anticipated with the purpose of obtaining an excessive charitable deduction, that rate of return may not be used. In that case, the highest yearly rate of return of the fund is determined by treating the fund as a pooled income fund that has been in existence for less than 3 preceding taxable years. If a pooled income fund has been in existence less than 3 taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the transfer of property to the fund is made, the highest yearly rate of return is deemed to be 9 percent. Par. 8. Section 1.642(c)&hyph;6 is amended as follows: 1. The section heading is revised. 2. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised.
