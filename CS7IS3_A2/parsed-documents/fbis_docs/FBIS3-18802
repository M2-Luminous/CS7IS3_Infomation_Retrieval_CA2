A corresponding agreement was signed by Eduard Lintner (Christian Social Union), parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, and Estonian Interior Minister Heike Arike in Bonn on 7 March. The foci of joint police investigations are to be, among other things, drug-related crimes, forged money, and the smuggling of people, as well as money laundering, the smuggling of stolen cars, and arms trade. Lintner stressed the need for ever closer police cooperation with the countries in East Europe and the successor states of the Soviet Union. The FRG has categorized them in three "rings," depending on their geographic location. After the conclusion of agreements with Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the treaty with Latvia [as received] is the first one with a country of the second "ring," to which, in addition to the Baltic states, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are counted. Agreements are also planned with the Central Asian, formerly Soviet, republics as the third "ring," Lintner said. "Gratifying beginnings" already exist, in particular with Uzbekistan, he noted.
