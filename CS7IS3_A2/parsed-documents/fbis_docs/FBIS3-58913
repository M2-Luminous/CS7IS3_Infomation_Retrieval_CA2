Following a meeting yesterday of the Defense Chiefs of Staff and other military authorities, Fabbri reported that the first substantial contingent to return home will be about 600 men making the trip before the end of this month. He explained that the general plan is for the "redeployment of the contingent in the Belet Uen area, in the north of Somalia, towards the main base at Balad and then, towards the Mogadishu port and airport." All phases of the gradual repatriation of the Italians, said the minister, have been "agreed to with the UNOSOM command and the commands of the U.S. and German contingents" and the plan "provides for the replacement of the Italian troops with the troops of other nations." On maximum security, Fabbri said that though no large scale military operations against the departing Italians were expected, "the risks of possible displays of hostility from local elements, especially in the phases when our forces are most vulnerable, cannot be ignored." Thus, "information activities managed by national sources, making use of the cooperation of competent agencies in the United States and within the United Nations," will be drawn on, he said and reported that among the first to return to Italy will be logistics units, leaving to last tank divisions, armored units and the helicopters, "the most effective components for defense purposes." The minister cited as "of special significance" for security the decision to deploy a naval unit with helicopter, medical and logistics support off the coast of Mogadishu as of March 1 for "the most critical phase of the withdrawal process." Another step in this area of planning will be the arrival of Italian Air Force planes to the Nairobi airport, just across the border from Somalia, and alert status for "some aircraft in Italy for possible emergency interventions." Fabbri told the committee that the ship off the Somali coast "will give our command and their units a high degree of operating autonomy by allowing the departure of men aboard landing craft from areas outside the Mogadishu port or airport, which could be tied up." Concluding his remarks to the committee, the minister noted that the "reconciliation process among the Somali factions has not yet taken the path likely to lead quickly to agreement" and underscored the need for further political and diplomatic efforts in this area. On December 29, the cabinet confirmed the withdrawal of combat troops from Somalia and Mozambique and the defense minister said the pull-out from Mozambique should be completed by April 30, the same date set by the UN for the end of its mission there. There are some 2,500 Italian troops in Somalia and about 1,200 in Mozambique. The former operation began for Italy on December 11, 1992. Five Italian soldiers have been killed in Somalia and two in Mozambique. Other Italian forces are taking part in UN missions in Albania, Cambodia, Pakistan, Kuwait, El Salvador, Slovenia, Morocco and Egypt, Fabbri said at the time.
