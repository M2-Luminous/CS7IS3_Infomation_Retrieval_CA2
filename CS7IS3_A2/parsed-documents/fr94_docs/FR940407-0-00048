FR940407-0-00048 FR940407-0-00010 33 CFR Part 162 [CGD09&hyph;94&hyph;004] Temporary Amendment to Inland Waterways Navigation Regulations Establishing Speed Limits on Connecting Waters From Lake Huron to Lake Erie AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: The Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, is renewing, with minor changes, a temporary, trial regulation previously in effect during the 1993 navigation season. This temporary regulation, as before, amends the speed limits on connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. The normal speed limits in this area are determined in large part by concerns about wake damage. However, lesser wakes are created by nondisplacement power vessels and it appears that the speed limits may unnecessarily impede their passage. The temporary regulation allows nondisplacement power vessels, less than 100 gross tons, to exceed the normal speed limits subject to certain restrictions. Generally, the minor changes in this version of the temporary regulation (in comparison to the previous version of the temporary regulation) place more restrictions on the use of the higher speeds by the operators of the nondisplacement vessels in order to better ensure safe, effectively regulated operations. The purpose of this temporary regulation, as before, is to test the feasibility and safety of the operation of nondisplacement vessels in the connecting waters from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. During this period of continued trial, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District invites further public comment on this regulation or future versions thereof for the purpose of either amendments to this temporary regulation or for the purpose of considering a permanent change to the standing regulations. DATES: This regulation is effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 1, 1994 and terminates at 12 midnight on November 30, 1994. Comments on this trial during the 1994 navigation season must be received on or before October 31, 1994 in order to be considered in the drafting of a proposal for permanent change to the standing regulations which the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District may submit to the Commandant of the Coast Guard in the fall of 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and supporting materials should be mailed or delivered to the Chief of the Case Management & Port Safety Section, Ninth Coast Guard District, room 2069, 1240 East Ninth Street, Cleveland, Ohio, 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3994. Please reference the name of the proposal and the docket number in the heading above. If you wish receipt of your mailed comment to be acknowledged, please include a stamped self-addressed envelope or postcard for that purpose. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection at the above location from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.
