He said this, replying to the question of whether his appointment a member of the Russian Security Council means a higher status of border troops within the system of ensuring the state's security. "While the border was earlier the only boundary designed to fight single infiltrators," Nikolayev continued, "now we face an all-out 'offensive' of smugglers, drug and arms dealers as well as mobs. We need new border troops, and we are now working on this issue." Nikolayev who was recently appointed a member of the Security Council by the Russian president's decree, is now making an inspection tour of the Russian Far East. "The Russian Far Eastern bounderies have some features distinguishing them from other parts of the state border," Nikolayev noted. Their main part runs across sea expanses, forcing us to keep here powerful coast guard forces. "The main problem here is that it is an area of constant violations of fishing regulations. "We should find a way to settle this problem not by force but legally," Nikolayev stressed. "This area is of interest not only to Russia but to other states as well which should understand that they upset the ecological and biological balance in this part of the world ocean by destroying rich marine resources."
