Pallais said that "we would be satisfied if Cuba returned" to the OAS, from which it was expelled almost three decades ago. This topic will be considered along with the main agenda of the Fourth Ibero-American summit that opened Tuesday in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The commercial embargo "is unilateral by the United States, and we do not believe in such measures," Pallais stated. He noted, however, that Cuba has still "not fulfilled the prerequisites" to form part of the so-called democratic countries, because it has not implemented "economic reforms and political openness." During the past decade the regime of Fidel Castro openly supported the Sandinists in their war against the Contras, who were armed and financed by the United States. Violeta de Chamorro's Government, which replaced the Sandinists in 1990, maintains diplomatic relations with Cuba, although these relations have been quite reduced compared to relations during the Sandinist period.
