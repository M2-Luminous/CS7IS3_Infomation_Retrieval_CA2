The Russian position was outlined today by Ambassador in Nicosia Boris Zenkov in his address at a meeting of the Larnaca district Rotary Club. Russia will never support the establishment of two states in Cyprus, Mr. Zenkov stressed, and added that Cyprus is too small to be partitioned. He expressed the hope that there will be some positive developments this year for a balanced basis for negotiations in accordance with the Butrus-Ghali ideas and the confidence-building measures, which, as he put it, should be considered as a warm-up for a settlement. Mr. Zenkov further noted that realism should be demonstrated about a Cyprus solution in the near future, adding that he does not believe the confidence-building measures will be implemented easily. He said: Many years will be necessary because of the long separation of the two communities. Mr. Zenkov also noted that he had recently informed President Glavkos Kliridhis and Mr. Rauf Denktas that if a solution is found to the Cyprus problem, Russia will propose that they be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
