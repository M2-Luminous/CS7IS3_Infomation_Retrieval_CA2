While discussing program goals and tasks, the conference split in two. A group of participants and MDBDR Cochairman Leonid Zlotnikov found their further participation in the conference, as well as in the MDBDR, impossible. The discord was provoked both by ideological concerns and, according to those who left the conference room, a breach of the agreed-upon time limit. One MDBDR leader, Olga Abramova, who shares the ideas and approaches of the Civic Union in Russia, thinks that the Movement should learn from Volski [leader of the Civic Union in Russia], while Leonid Zlotnikov and his adherents are more inclined to follow the Gaydar line. It is possible, according to a BELAPAN correspondent, that the former members of the MDBDR will join the United Democratic Party of Belarus.
