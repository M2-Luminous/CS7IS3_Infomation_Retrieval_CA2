A resolution condemning the U.S. moves against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was adopted at the Tokyo Youth Study Session for Solidarity Between Japan and Korea held on April 25. Noting that the United States was increasing military threat and economic pressure against the DPRK and creating tension in Northeast Asia, it called for a continuous movement for the denuclearization of Northeast Asia. On April 28, representative members of the executive committee of the Japan Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship called at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and strongly demanded that the United States immediately decide to discontinue the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres, stop the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, put an end to military exercises and provocations, threat and antagonism against the DPRK and seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue. They staged a protest in front of the South Korean puppet embassy in Tokyo.
