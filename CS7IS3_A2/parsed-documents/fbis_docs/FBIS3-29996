But the top government spokesman said a meeting of cabinet ministers to be held Friday will not reach any conclusion on specific market-opening measures. "The cabinet-level meeting will be held to try to map out a plan as early as possible," Takemura told a news conference. The meeting, bringing together nine ministers, including the foreign, finance and international trade ministers, will take place after a regular cabinet meeting Friday morning, he said. It will aim to formulate a program to speed up deregulation, strengthen import and investment promotion steps, revamp competition policy and improve government procurement processes. Last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan in trade negotiations with the U.S. agreed to map out a four-pronged scheme as soon as possible. The move is intended to stave off the trade dispute with the U.S., which has been increasing pressure on Japan to whittle down its lopsided trade surplus since the collapse of talks on a bilateral trade framework on February 11. Meanwhile, Takemura indicated Japan will consider an extension of planned tax cuts beyond this year after implementing a sweeping tax system reform. Under the original plan, the tax cut period is limited to only this year. This has sparked U.S. criticism that the tax cut is far from sufficient to stimulate the languishing Japanese economy.
