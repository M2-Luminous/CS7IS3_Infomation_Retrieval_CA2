FBIS3-46783 "dreas003_d_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-003 Document Type:Daily Report 5 Jan 1994 South Korea Country To Join OECD Maritime Commission SK0401021294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0136 GMT 4 Jan 94 SK0401021294 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- Korea will join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) maritime transport committee as an observer this year in an effort to actively cope with world maritime market opening, the Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) said Tuesday. Korea will become a committee member in 1996, when negotiations for opening the world maritime market wrap up, according to KMPA officials. KMPA will hold a public hearing either next month or March with maritime-related organizations, including the Korea Shipowners' Association, to collect opinions from businesses and research institutes, and establish an OECD maritime information center at the Korea Maritime Institute to gather information. Joining the committee will enable the government to coordinate its maritime policy with major maritime countries and considerably reduce friction with them. The government will be able to apply pressure through the committee on countries with protectionist policies, enhancing the international competitiveness of the Korean maritime industry, the officials said. However, Korea will experience various difficulties following the joining. The government will have to repeal protectionist systems, including obligatory use of Korean freighters for designated cargoes, ahead of schedule and allow foreign advances into the domestic maritime transportation sector. The OECD Maritime Transport Committee was established in 1961 to contribute to promoting international trade through free and fair sea transportation, and 24 countries, including the United States, Japan, Britain and New Zealand, have joined the committee so far.
