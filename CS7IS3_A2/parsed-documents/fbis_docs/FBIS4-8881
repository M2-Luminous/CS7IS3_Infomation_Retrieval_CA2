Martic has nothing against "the normalization of relations between the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of Croatia in the foreseeable future," either. For the normalization of relations between Krajina and Croatia, Martic stressed, it is necessary to establish permanent peace; to this end Croatia should stop its continuous attacks on the republic of Serb Krajina. "It has to give up resolving its frustrations by force," he said. He said that he is "a pessimist when it comes to the present political leadership of Croatia and their real intentions." Martic stressed that Veljko Knezevic, head of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb, has "connections with Krajina only through relatives," and that "if this mission brings about transition from the war option to the political option, we in Krajina will welcome it." The president of the republic of Serb Krajina stresses that he does not believe in the serious intentions of official Croatian policy, the aim of which, as far as the opening of the Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb is concerned, according to Martic, is to "create a picture in the Croatian public that Krajina will in that way be reintegrated into Croatia." According to Martic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic "in the light of his past achievements and what he has done for the Serb people," is the number one person for the post of president of all the Serbs, once all Serb lands unite.
