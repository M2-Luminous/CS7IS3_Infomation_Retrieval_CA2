Mobilization for National Development [MDN] plans to demonstrate against the embargo and in favor of the employers' movement. Professor DeRonceray, a fierce opponent of Father Aristide, asserts that the embargo has only undermined our economy and worsened the misery of the poor. It is urgent that he go down to the streets to say no to the embargo. The demonstration, which will begin in Colomb Quay, will stop in front of the parliament and the U.S. Embassy. Let us listen to Hubert De Ronceray. [Begin recording, in Creole] Through this demonstration we will join with the businessmen, will say no to the embargo imposed on the people by the international community, and will say yes to a solution coming from inside the country. MDN invites all its partisans and friends in Port-au-Prince to participate in this demonstration, and all people living in the provinces and the rural sections to organize peaceful marches to force the deputies and senators to be done with the Aristide matter and to implement Article 149 of the Constitution. We will then have a provisional government of concord that will unblock the country, and will hold elections for the installation of a definitive government. [end recording]
