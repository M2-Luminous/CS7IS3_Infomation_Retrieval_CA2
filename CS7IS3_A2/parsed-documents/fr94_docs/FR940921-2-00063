FR940921-2-00063 FR940921-2-00057 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 31922 (Sub-No. 1)] Wisconsin Central Ltd._Purchase Exemption_Soo Line Railroad Company Line Between Superior and Ladysmith, WI AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Notice seeking comments on the issue of whether employees affected by a purchase transaction may have test period averages (TPAs). 1 1 Test period average is defined as all compensation received by the employee and all time for which he was paid for the 12-month period immediately preceding the date of his displacement divided by 12. The TPA produces a monthly average compensation and average monthly time for which the employee was paid. SUMMARY: The Commission is considering a request by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) that the Commission interpret its labor conditions as requiring a railroad employer to furnish upon request TPAs to employees affected by the sale of a rail line on which the employees work. Comments are invited on the issue. DATES: Any person interested in participating in this proceeding as a party of record by filing and receiving written comments must file a notice of intent to do so by October 3, 1994. We will issue a service list of the parties of record shortly thereafter. Petitioners will have 10 days after service of the service list to serve each party on the list with a copy of the petition. Initial written comments must be filed within 30 days after service of the service list. All parties will have 50 days after service of the service list to reply. The exact filing dates will be specified in the notice accompanying the service list. Comments must be served upon all parties of record. ADDRESSES: Send comments referring to Finance Docket No. 31922 (Sub-No. 1) to: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph H. Dettmar, (202) 927&hyph;5660. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: An Arbitration Board found that nothing in the express wording of, or the industry practice under, the New York Dock conditions 2 requires a railroad to provide affected employees their TPAs until they have been ``adversely'' affected as a result of the purchase transaction, and thus concluded that the railroad is not obligated to provide that information except in connection with the calculation of displacement allowances under our labor conditions. 2 Those first imposed in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979), as clarified in Wilmington Term. R.R. Inc._Pur. & Lease_CSX Transp., Inc., 6 I.C.C.2d 799 (1990). On appeal to the Commission, BMWE argues that the information permits affected employees to determine if they have been ``adversely affected,'' i.e. , placed in a worse position as a result of a transaction and thereby entitled to a displacement allowance. BMWE notes in this regard that equally important to total compensation is the amount of time the employee had to work to receive it. Second, BMWE avers that the TPA is necessary for employees to comply with the requirement of Article I, section 5 that they exercise seniority to seek a position producing compensation equal to or exceeding the compensation received in their prior position. Without the TPA information, the union says that employees are unable to determine which positions produce equal compensation. Soo Line Railroad Company, on the other hand, argues that the information is readily available to employees, is burdensome for the railroad to provide and ought not to be required. The Commission believes it would be helpful to have additional comment on these issues from the parties as well as the interested public. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.

Decided: September 9, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commission Simmons, and Commissioner Morgan. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
