After a meeting with EU mediator Owen and his UN Counterpart Stoltenberg, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told reporters that Serbs would continue to participate in the peace process but refuse to accept those who ordered air strikes against Serb positions as international mediators. Karadzic said that it is time for the EU to return to help solve the Bosnia conflict because the United States has sided with the Muslims and is directly involved in the Bosnia civil war. The United States has become a major mediator in the Bosnian peace process since early last month when an agreement in principle was reached on the U.S.-proposed Muslim-Croatia Federation. The EU- proposed peace plan for Bosnia and international mediators Owen and Stoltenberg have been desolated since. However, after the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions near the Muslim enclave of Gorazde on April 10 and 11, Serbs announced that they were suspending all contact with UN peacekeeping forces, especially the commander of the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia Michael Rose, who ordered the air strikes. As the peace process was stalled, Owen and Stoltenberg came to Sarajevo. Observers say their visit will show the Bosnian peace process cannot proceed without the EU.
