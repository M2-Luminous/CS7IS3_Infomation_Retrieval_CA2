On 29 December 1993, officials from the People's Bank of China announced: As of 1 January 1994, China will unify exchange rates and practice a unitary, well-managed, and floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand. This major measure taken by the Chinese Government for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure is undoubtedly a relatively thorough change to the double-track system of exchange rates, under which official rates and rates quoted at foreign exchange swap markets coexisted, and which has been practiced in China for several dozen years. In fact, the exchange rate of renminbi has undergone several changes since reform and opening up. Prior to 9 April 1991, an adjustable "pegged" exchange rate system was practiced in China for official exchange rates. Starting 9 April 1991, the official rates of renminbi were quoted under a managed floating rate system with the rates between U.S. dollar and reminbi at about 1:5.2 then floating to about 1:5.8 at the end of last year. At the beginning of 1988, China set up foreign exchange swap markets, allowing enterprises to buy or sell foreign exchange at the prices determined, to a certain extent, by market supply and demand. In December 1991, China again set up foreign exchange swap markets for residents inside the territory, allowing them to trade foreign exchange within a certain limit. Comparing the present reform with the above progressive changes, people can see that there are distinctive differences in terms of range and intensity. The current reform of foreign exchange system also includes the practice of a banking system in settlement and sales of foreign exchange; revocation of foreign exchange to be retained and turned over to the state by enterprises; establishment of an exchange market for transactions among banks; improvement of exchange rate formation mechanisms; prohibition of foreign exchange priced, settled, and circulated inside the territory; suspension of issuing exchange coupons; improvement and perfection of managing settlement of internal and external remittances; realization of renminbi convertibility under current accounts; cancellation of mandatory planning for revenue and expenditure in foreign exchange; and exercise of macroscopic regulation and control by the state over foreign exchange and international payments mainly through economic and legal means. This major reform measure will have a far-reaching impact on China's economy. Experts maintain that judging from the economic situation in China now, conditions for unified exchange rates have matured. According to the latest figures released by the State Statistical Bureau, China's GNP broke through 3 trillion yuan last year, representing an increase of 13 percent over the previous year, and the total volume of imports and exports reached $190 billion, increasing by approximately 15 percent over the previous year. Since Chinese commodities are acceptable to the world, it is natural that renminbi, which represents the value of Chinese commodities, should be accepted by the world too. This has provided favorable conditions for unification of the renminbi exchange rate from the point of balancing international payments. People also discovered that at the time when the exchange rates were being unified, a "consumption craze" emerged in large and medium cities in China, but it was very soon quenched. This was attributed to the following arrangements of the government. Foreign exchange retained by enterprises was allowed to be used again, exchange coupons were allowed to be used indefinitely after the suspension of their issuance, the price difference between renminbi and exchange coupons was maintained, and others, to avoid encroaching upon the interests of enterprises, localities, and individuals. In the meantime, people realized more clearly that although the unification of exchange rates might still cause labor pangs, after all, advantages outweighed disadvantages. It will be conducive to China's openness to the outside world, importing of foreign capital, building of the socialist market economic structure, and enhancement of efficiency in all capital liquidity. It will also contribute to restoring China's signatory status in GATT as it has removed a major obstruction on the road to reentering GATT. In addition, the practice of a unified exchange rate system also has opened a path for renminbi to become a freely convertible currency, thereby moving toward achieving the ultimate goal of linking China's markets with the world market. Economists here maintain that in the course of abolishing the old structure and establishing the new, there are still a lot of concrete tasks to do. China's new exchange rate system has just begun to operate, so the government should be very prudent in its actions and chiefly employ economic and legal means to achieve macroscopic regulation and control over foreign exchange and international payments, with a view to preventing great fluctuations in exchange rates and ensuring China's economy develops in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner.
