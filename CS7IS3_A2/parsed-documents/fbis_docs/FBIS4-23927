FBIS4-23927 "drafr118_c_94032" FBIS-AFR-94-118 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 19-20 Jun South African Press Review for 19-20 Jun MB2006102794 MB2006102794 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES Putting Domestic Problems First -- "As the facade of Nationalist power is stripped away," weekly revelations show how "South Africa subsided into the parlous condition which now confronts the government"; "islands of privilege have been preserved for officialdom in the sea of poverty that covers most of South Africa," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 19 June on page 22. "If the waste and corruption can be eliminated, the cost of government can surely be reduced, and resources may be diverted to meet the more urgent needs of the people." "Next week's budget will be heavily burdened by the profligate mismanagement of the past. Vested interests -- civil servants in Pretoria, bantustan bureaucracies, the armed forces, the armaments industry, the artsy- craftsy establishment -- that grew fat in the imperial years" are fighting "to preserve such elements of the old system that can be snatched from the revolution." Internationally "it does not seem possible even to explain to foreigners that the Nationalists have left South Africa very largely a run-down slum." While South Africa has an interest here, it "cannot carry this continent, and it serves Africa best by working toward its own restoration." "The first, overriding need is to restore our economy to health; the second is to attend to the needs of our own people; after that, we may lift our eyes to a wider horizon." RAPPORT Pressure on Finance Minister--"When Minister Derek Keys delivers his budget speech on Wednesday he will be closely watched to a greater extent than he or his predecessors have ever experienced," begins a page-20 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg RAPPORT on 19 June. "Not only is he acting as minister of a government of national unity, of whom the main role player, the ANC, has a controversial economic policy, but he will have to find some balance between what is expected and what is possible. On the one hand, he will have to try to boost the struggling economy -- a task that has given several of his overseas counterparts sleepless nights during a worldwide recession. On the other hand he will have to find considerable sums of money to finance the reconstruction program." "The ambitious Reconstruction and Development Program will result in higher state spending." "The promised large numbers of houses, schools, and hospitals to be built through increased taxation could have a far reaching negative effect on the economy, which could in turn affect both rich and poor alike. If extreme caution is not applied the internal demand for imported goods will rise, followed by a drop in foreign exchange reserves, a further weakening of the exchange rate, higher inflation, and increased wage demands by unions." "Mr. Keys only has one way of narrowing the economic gap: He will have to ensure economic growth. South African products will have to be more competitive in foreign markets so that it can expand its exports in order to build up its foreign exchange reserves." SOWETAN Petrol Price Increase -- "The consumer is again left wondering about the truth behind last week's increase in the price of petrol. The Government, now composed of some of the people who were very loud in their opposition to the last hike, tells us that the increase was unavoidable," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 20 June on page 8. "What then confuses us is the Government's attack on people who say they can continue selling petrol at the old price," surely "the Government should be wishing them good luck and ignoring them." Energy Affairs Minister Botha's "argument that deregulation must be introduced in an orderly way, sounds too much like old National Party language." BUSINESS DAY Public Broadcasting -- "The SABC's [South African Broadcasting Corporation] suggestion to the Independent Broadcasting Authority that it be funded by taxation rather than by licence fees has merit, but only if it is introduced as part of a total change to the country's broadcasting industry and to the management of public broadcasting," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 20 June on page 4. "Under the present ANC-led government, the public broadcaster has become more democratic. However, with many ANC members in management positions, the SABC will have to guard against slipping back into its former role as the exclusive voice of the regime." "Before any decision is taken on the SABC's funding, the broadcaster's role needs to be defined, as does management's financial accountability." "What is needed is a full appraisal of what services the SABC should most appropriately provide, who should be accountable and how they should be transmitted. Only then can the queation be addressed of how the public broadcaster is to be financed."
