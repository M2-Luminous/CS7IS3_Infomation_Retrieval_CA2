Mr. Amnuai, addressing the opening of the Third Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer at the United Nations Conference Centre, said most of the objectives set out when the convention was first agreed upon had been achieved. ``New threats to the ozone layer are possible,'' he said, pointing to a pressing need for continuing research on ozone layer depletion. He drew attention to the work of the World Meteorological Organisation in investigating UV-B radiation and its environmental effects. UV-B radiation, which has some positive influences on the body, can also cause sunburn, snow blindness, cataracts, ageing of the skin and skin cancer. It can suppress immunity against tumours initiated in the skin, and can affect plant growth and plankton formation adversely.
