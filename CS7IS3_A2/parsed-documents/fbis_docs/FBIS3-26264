Local officials said the investment made up 30 percent of the province's entire investment in fixed assets. Hubei overfulfilled its targets of opening and installing 190,000 new telephone lines, increasing generating capacity by 1.46 million kw, and completing 2,600 km of new high-grade highways in the past year. In addition, the province has also opened 50 domestic and overseas air routes. The Tianhe international airport in this provincial capital has finished its extension work and will go back into operation next month. Two other airports capable of handling Boeing jets in Enshi, the prefectural seat of Enshi, and in Shashi, a new light industrial city, have also been completed and have gone into use. The improved investment environment has greatly enhanced Hubei's appeal to overseas investors. Foreign investment keeps pouring into the province's major cities of Wuhan, Huangshi and Yichang. Meanwhile, statistics show that Hubei approved the establishment of 2,188 new foreign-funded enterprises last year, 943 more than in the previous year.
