That was said by Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings when he stopped over in Luanda this morning on his way to Namibia. He was welcomed by National Assembly Chairman Franca van Dunem, government members, and officials of the Ghanaian Embassy in Angola. [Begin Rawlings recording, in English fading into Portuguese translation] I realize the Angolan war has been provoked by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. The winds of democracy blowing over our continent represent a historic opportunity not only to individual countries, but to all of them. We ought to do away with ethnic differences because they create problems, not to the better off, but to the underprivileged. I think it would be good if we could take this magnificent opportunity to establish democracy in Africa. We have no other option. This is our continent and we ought to work together. [end recording] President Rawlings then left for Namibia.
