ITAR-TASS has learned from trustworthy diplomatic sources that the Norwegian Government has decided to cancel the strict rule in trade with Russia, which had been in force so far, according to which the Russian Government was required to issue like guarantees in reply to Norwegian financial guarantees to credits granted for various joint economic ventures. The Norwegian cabinet of ministers plans to submit for the parliament's endorsement a proposal not to demand any reply financial guarantees from Russia. Henceforth, Norwegian businessmen will trade with their Russian partners relying only on the guarantees provided by their own country. On the initiative of the Foreign Ministry, the norwegian Government plans to ask the parliament for permission to allocate 500 million krones (almost 68.5 million dollars) to guarantee the credits that will be granted by Norwegian companies to East European and CIS nations without any reply guarantees. Pride of place in this crediting policy is given to Russia. Moreover, the cabinet will ask for 100 million krones (13.7 million dollars) for the so- called "losses fund". In other words, this will be money that one "could lose" if trade with unreliable partners. According to various sources, the parliament, most likely, will not object to this decision.
