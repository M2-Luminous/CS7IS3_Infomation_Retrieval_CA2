C. Options Considered for HCPPs That do not Furnish Inpatient Hospital Services Our primary goal in setting limits for prepaid health care organizations is to ensure that we do not pay more for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations than we would pay if the beneficiaries were not so enrolled. We consider Medicare fee-for-service payment amounts for individual services to be the most appropriate proxy for the amount that Medicare would have paid for a group of HCPP enrollees if those beneficiaries were not so enrolled. As discussed above, we also consider the AAPCC, which is derived from Medicare fee-for-service payment amounts, to be an appropriate estimate of total Medicare fee-for-service costs for a group of Medicare beneficiaries. In addressing changes to the regulations governing allowable payments to these HCPPs, we considered three options. First, we considered making only technical changes to the current regulations by updating them to reflect the movement in fee-for-service Medicare away from reasonable charge-based payment to fee schedules for physician and lab services and durable medical equipment. Under this option, we would have retained the effective incentives provisions. This approach was not consistent with our primary goal. Second, we considered using the part B AAPCC plus an appropriate amount for administrative costs. We discarded this option because it might constitute an incentive for these HCPPs to allow or encourage their Medicare enrollees to seek part A services for medical conditions for which part B services would be equally or even more appropriate, but might bring the HCPPs' incurred costs above the part B AAPCC. Third, we considered using aggregate Medicare payment levels for individual part B services to define ``reasonable cost'' for these HCPPs. We selected this approach because we believe it is consistent with our primary goal. We also considered whether it would be feasible to specify an appropriate volume of services. We concluded that, at this time, we do not have sufficient data to determine appropriate volume for part B services for HCPP enrollees, so a volume formula is not included in this proposed rule. VI. Outlier Threshold In setting the amount of the outlier threshold, we are concerned that it include an adequate number of high cost beneficiaries, without including such a substantial proportion of costs that its utility as a measure of efficient behavior is limited. Because in general in health care financing a small number of individuals account for a large percentage of outlays, finding an appropriate balance between the percentage of total costs represented by the outlier threshold and the percentage of beneficiaries represented is difficult. There is a range of reasonable choices. Using 1989 data summarized in the table below, we examined the relationship between the cumulative percentage of persons served and the cumulative percentage of program payments to determine a reasonable outlier threshold. At the low end for a potential outlier threshold, we believe a figure that accounts for about 2 percent of beneficiaries and about 25 percent of outlays is reasonable. At the high end, we believe a figure that accounts for about 0.3 percent of beneficiaries and about 7 percent of total outlays is reasonable. The approximate mid-point between these two ends is the 1 percent of beneficiaries who account for about 16 percent of total payments. We are proposing to set the outlier threshold at the lowest annual per capita amount that we project to account for the 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with the highest annual per capita outlays. In 1989, that amount was about $39,000. For 1993, the annual per capita amount that we project to account for the 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries with the highest annual per capita outlays is $55,000. Outlays on behalf of this group of Medicare beneficiaries would account for about 16 percent of total outlays.
