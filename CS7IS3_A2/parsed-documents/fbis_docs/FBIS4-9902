FBIS4-9902 "drlat065_i_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-065 Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Nicaragua FSLN Atlantic Coast Loss Analyzed FSLN Atlantic Coast Loss Analyzed 94CA0088A Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p 14 94CA0088A Managua LA PRENSA Spanish CSO [Commentary by Adolfo Miranda Saenz] [Text] No one got an absolute majority in the Atlantic Coast elections, but given the conditions, regardless of the number of votes garnered by each candidate, the percentages indicate that the big winner was the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC), and the big loser was the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN). The Sandinists, having accumulated vast resources during the years when they were in power, were unable to put in a strong showing against the PLC, which was transformed from a small party to a big adversary. It joined the fray on its own and bravely fought to win a decent percentage, which is an undeniable victory. The FSLN may try to minimize the failure it suffered, winning such a small percentage in spite of all its power and resources. But the fact remains that in comparison to the votes it garnered, the PLC's percentage--won without joining the parties that make up the National Opposition Union (UNO) or any other liberal parties--suggests that if the liberals were to lead a democratic alliance, they could defeat the FSLN in 1996. The FSLN has been unable to recover from its electoral defeat of 25 February 1990 because it has been unable to correct its mistakes. Its two main factions have said that they recognize their errors, but no faction has come out and identified by name those who committed abuses under Laws 85, 86, and 88. Nor is there any talk of returning the ill-gotten gains, expelling corrupt members, or fixing the blame for the government's leading us into a chaos from which we have not yet emerged. In other words, they have limited themselves to expressing repentance, but only in words...while the fact is that they left our country in ruins, with 50,000 dead, widows, orphans, blind people, amputees, etc., plus the tragic fact that we have regressed three decades in history, becoming the most backward and impoverished country in the Americas. On the Atlantic Coast, in contrast, people know that in Managua a man accused of being a fascist, ultrarightist, radical, mean, corrupt, and the embodiment of Somozism, as mayor has carried out more development projects and accomplished more for the people than the Sandinists and the current government combined. That is to say that everything the Sandinists and the officials of the current government have said against Arnoldo Aleman is nothing but words, in contrast to a man who has responded with deeds. This situation leads me to the conclusion that since Arnoldo Aleman poses a real political threat to them, they have tried to push him out of the race by portraying him as the most terrible thing on earth in order to discredit him. But that tactic has not yielded any results, although I confess that I, like others, believed them for a while. The tactic of tarring a candidate as a Somozist to oust him from the political arena did not work in 1990, but they did not learn their lesson. The percentages obtained by the PLC in the Atlantic Coast elections show that our people are not swayed by mere words; they know how to evaluate deeds. A mayor who can show visible accomplishments that cannot be hidden or denied deserves respect. He has been able to revitalize liberalism in a country where, not too long ago, admitting to being a liberal was tantamount to pleading guilty to a crime before the accusing finger of the "immaculate" Sandinists, who have been very good at accusing and maligning others, but incapable of being honestly and clearly critical of their own corruption, beyond superficial and ambiguous words. That is why the people held them accountable in the 1990 elections, and have just done so again in the 1994 elections on the Atlantic Coast, even though they are celebrating their "triumph" (?). The votes won by the PLC, added to those cast for other non-Sandinist political groups, confirm that the FSLN is a losing party whose image of failure will be difficult to shed between now and 1996. We liberals--all liberals--must acknowledge this triumph by Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC, and must close ranks to form a unified movement. This great effort by the PLC deserves our support. Those Nicaraguans who do not want a return to Somozism or the continuation of Sandinism in power should close ranks and not fall into the trap of diluting our strength or discrediting the mayor of Managua, blindly accepting the accusation that he is a "Somozist," a well-worn ruse often employed by the Sandinists. The results of the Atlantic Coast elections, with the undeniable liberal triumph of the PLC, should cause us to stop and reflect and rethink our political strategy. The FSLN's emphatic denunciation of Arnoldo Aleman should not prevent us from supporting the PLC and the mayor of Managua. The FSLN has Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC in its sights because it knows that this force can defeat it at the head of a democratic alliance. Those of us who, without being Sandinist militants, at one time supported the FSLN, without asking or getting anything in return because we were doing it for Nicaragua's sake, have the most right to demand redress for the harm they did and the deception they perpetrated. We also have the right to demand that they drop their aggressive and derogatory remarks about other politicians whom they accuse of corruption, because those "corrupt" people have shown by their deeds--not their words--that they are better than the Sandinists. As the old saying goes, people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
