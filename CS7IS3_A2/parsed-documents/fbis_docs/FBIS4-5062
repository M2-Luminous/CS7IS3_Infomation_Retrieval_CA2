"The economy is brighter and close to hitting bottom," the BOJ chief told a news conference after wrapping up a three-day quarterly meeting of the central bank's managers of 33 domestic branches and its three overseas representatives. His comments, reflecting increased optimism by the regional branch managers and overseas representatives, indicated a slight change from recent remarks that more time is needed to see if emerging bright spots in consumption and production will be sustainable enough to lift the economy. Mieno was still cautious about a recovery, though, citing potential downward factors such as the yen's appreciation amid the stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks. The BOJ chief said his view on the economic situation has "delicately" changed, but reiterated that he will continue to "carefully watch" recent improvements led by recovering personal consumption and slightly increasing exports. Summing up the quarterly meeting of branch managers, Mieno said the managers confirmed evidence of improved corporate sentiment. Most of the branch managers attending the meeting reported that the economy is showing signs of bottoming out. Mieno said their assessment of the economy "turned brighter than at the time of the previous meeting," noting that anticipation of recovery is spreading among corporate managers. Company leaders, who until recently had been discussing the timing of the recovery, are now talking about its tempo rather than its timing, he added. "The chances are slim for the economy to fall back again," Mieno said, brushing aside the possibility of a repeat of the setback which occurred a year ago. He noted four "stronger positive factors" which have come to the surface over the past year. "Inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring programs have progressed steadily, and recent macroeconomic measures are buoying the economy," he said. "Exports are recovering due to brighter overseas economies led by the United States, and improvements in domestic economic activities are spreading," he added. But Mieno said he wants to carefully monitor to what extent the book closing by companies for the fiscal year ended March 31 "inflated" economic indicators. The BOJ chief also said three persistent factors should be carefully watched -- the yen's appreciation, ongoing labor cutbacks and continuing balance-sheet adjustments by financial institutions, noting these may drag the economy down again. With Japan's current account surplus remaining at a high level, trade friction with other nations prevails, and a trend toward a higher yen is dominating foreign exchange trading, Mieno said. The recent yen-dollar exchange rate of around 104 yen to the U.S. dollar is "severe for exporters," but the latest round of the yen's appreciation is milder than last year's, Mieno said. He noted that the dollar fell from 125 yen to near 100 yen last year, while its fall in the current round is only from 110 yen late last year to Wednesday's 104 yen level. Asked about the central bank's stance on the yen's appreciation in connection with the stalled trade talks with the United States, Mieno repeated that he desires to see stable exchange rates reflecting economic fundamentals. An agreement reached among finance ministers and central bankers of Group of Seven major industrial nations on their cooperation to stem wild rate fluctuations is alive, Mieno added, suggesting his intention to call for reconfirmation of the accord at a G-7 meeting slated in Washington later this month. Considering the recent upward trend in long-term interest rates led by the United States, Mieno said they are unlikely to continue rising. He said it is natural for market rates to move up and down in the near term, but long-term rates will settle down during the process of adjusting to the state of the economy. Mieno praised the positive stance taken by financial insitutions to liquidate bad loans.
