I say very simply and frankly that there are repeated attempts to destabilize the internal situation with the aim of forcing Lebanon to attend the negotiations from a weak position. This requires us to respond to this provocation with more internal and national cohesion. [Correspondent] Minister, you received this week the Lebanese negotiating delegation members who reported to you on the negotiations and talks held in Washington. Can you tell us if there has been progress on the Lebanese track? [Buwayz] It is clear from the latest round held in Washington that Israel's desire to make progress was almost nonexistent. It was evident that the Israeli Government was not ready to apply the principles of the Geneva summit between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. This gives the impression and makes it clear that there was a determined decision to foil this round or ensure its failure. Additionally, we feel there is not yet readiness within Israel to achieve progress, something that is possibly due to the domestic situation in Israel. In any case, there are U.S.-Israeli contacts that are supposed to activate things. Some U.S.-Arab contacts are also expected with the aim of finding a way out that would restore substance to the negotiations. [Correspondent] Has the United States asked Lebanon to rescind its decision to suspend the negotiations? What are the conditions for doing so? [Buwayz] Negotiations are not an issue of formalities. Formalities, the timing of the round, and the way invitations are sent out to attend the rounds are not the bases for the negotiations. The basis remains Israel's ability and its decision to achieve progress. For several reasons, we do not feel that Israel has decided it wants to achieve progress. [Correspondent] What did you discuss with the secretary general of the Higher Lebanese-Syrian Council? [Buwayz] Lebanese-Syrian relations are not outside the framework of this regional situation. It is normal for us to discuss the regional developments that are of interest to the secretary general of the Higher Council. [Correspondent] Regarding the peace negotiations, what is your stance on the Russian positions that yesterday announced the death of the peace negotiations and called for a new international conference. Regarding security, many denunciations were made and the state was asked to take strong measures to prevent bombings. Is there anything new? [Buwayz] Of course. The Lebanese state must perform all its duties, now more than ever, in controlling and monitoring security. Citizens should also realize that there is a premeditated provocation aiming to provoke a particular sector of the Lebanese people to create reactions that will play a principal role in undermining internal cohesion and solidarity. It is no coincidence that the Kasrawan area was the direct target. The reason for targeting it is clear. The targeting of a church and the French Cultural Center were no coincidence either. All these developments should clearly make us realize that there is an attempt to provoke. We should not be trapped by it. The state must thwart these attempts through its security organs and the Lebanese people, who have experienced war and know that things should be more cohesive than ever.
