Beginning on that day, the national grain price deregulation policy was formally implemented and urban residents' grain and oil was no longer provided based on the plan. Its price stopped being based on "planned supply" and was thoroughly freed up. Grain planting farmers no longer planted in accordance with the national mandatory plan. Some regions also eliminated grain contract fixed quota purchases, and farmers set up and adjusted their planting structure and set up their planting plan based on market demand, and grain and oil sales freely entered the market. When people regard food as heavenly, in the set traditional thinking of Chinese urban residents, freeing up grain prices undoubtedly was a major break through from the era of the plan! In the first year that grain prices were freed up, what was the status of grain production, grain markets, grain purchases, grain consumption, and grain departments? Urban Residents Everywhere Find Convenience The deregulation of grain prices was a "great liberation" for hundreds of millions of urban residents. The residents did not need to go every month to line up to receive grain coupons, and did not need to go to the designated grain stores to buy grain. At every grain exchange market there were large and small packages of grain for sale. Moreover, the vendors' service was enthusiastic and the price could be negotiated. At the food market one could even conveniently pick up the Thai fragrant rice, jiaozi flour, and cornmeal that he needed. An organizational cadre said that for a number of years before we ate plenty of old rice. Now it is better. After we get off from work, we go to the exchange market and we can buy either a lot or a little. It is all new rice and the price is fair. His viewpoint is rather representative. Grain Enterprises Move Toward the Market In several places the state grain stores are no longer crowded as they were. According to a survey of a certain city's state grain store business, grain stores throughout the city realized a profit of 991,000 yuan from January through October of this year, a 74.03 percent decline from the same period last year, and 85 percent of total grain stores suffered a loss. Grain enterprises are quietly turning to the market. One county's grain and oil supply company established six grain stores in the county seat. Formerly monthly grain sales were more than 3 million jin, but this year in the first two months that grain prices were deregulated, they only sold slightly over 10,000 jin of grain. The freeing up of grain prices forced grain stores to actively participate in the intense competition of "the great market, the great circulation, and the great commerce." Several state grain stores have begun to engage in grain finishing and manufacture semi-finished products. They are striving to establish a foothold in market competition. Exchange Markets Are Full of Customers The pattern of state grain stores being the only business throughout the country has been broken. So, in the area of circulation, in addition to the grain department, retail stores and exchange markets are emerging in streets and lanes all over. Grain exchange markets, in comparison to the one-price, several-variety state grain stores, are a cut above. The crowded situation in several exchange markets says it all. Four Great Grain Purchasing Wars This is the first year that grain prices have been freed up and there are numerous difficulties with grain purchases in localities throughout the nation. The reason is that after the grain market was freed up, there were numerous rushes to purchase. In this year's summer and fall grain purchasing seasons, the grain that the farmers harvested still had not been entirely dried when in several localities and townships several collective and individual purchasers and grain using units one after another put up signs as purchasers. In some local townships, in addition to those in the locality concerned with grain, supply and marketing, farm machinery, transport, and seed units; flour mills, rice mills, breweries, and vermicelli factories came directly to the people for purchases. Numerous purchasing units, in order to scramble for grain sources, raised the purchasing price on one another. In this year's fall grain purchases for example, the purchasing price for hybrid paddy was bid up from 0.64 yuan per kilogram to 0.66 yuan, 0.68 yuan, and a high of 0.74 yuan. Some individual grain dealers drove their tractors to the field and immediately purchased the grain that the farmers had just husked. They took it in with their left hand and put it out with their right hand. When making purchases, they played with the "scales" to entrap the farmers and do everything possible to avoid taxes and industrial and commercial administrative fees. They drove up prices and expanded the differential with the grain department's purchasing price. Numerous rushes to purchase disrupt the order of the market, and the grain department's grain purchases face a serious crisis. Mixed Emotions for Grain Planting Farmers With the total freeing up of grain purchases and prices, farmers who plant grain have mixed emotions. They are happy because the self-determination in planting that farmers have been crying for for several years has been implemented. Farmers can take the initiative in selecting what they will plant based on market demand, and contract grain orders are changed to parity purchases to add protective prices to the purchases determined by the market, and farmers can acquire many benefits. Farmers are sad because nowadays planting grain does not make money. Although farmers benefit from the state's freeing up of grain prices, a large part of this benefit is offset by the rise in prices of the means of production. According to statistical estimates, nowadays those who plant one mu of paddy essentially do not earn any money, and some have to take money from their own pockets. So, farmers' enthusiasm for planting grain is dampened. Second, those who have the freedom to plant crops do not know what they can plant to earn money. Before, whatever they planted, the state would purchase it. Nowadays what one plants must be determined by the market situation and the risks are great. Third, they are worried about heavy burdens. Since opening up, township cadres have run economic entities and weakened their function of serving the farmers, increased charges, and made burdens heavier, and the funds and materials to support agriculture have been squeezed out. Fourth, delaying the signing of contracts until production and delaying payment until the purchase make it difficult to arrange planting. Existing Problems Cannot Be Easily Overlooked If the problems that have occurred since grain prices were freed up are not promptly adjusted and resolved, the consequences are dreadful to contemplate. Grain volume has gone down and grain prices are seen constantly rising. With the freeing up of grain prices and farmers free to plant what they want, they plant whatever makes money. Prompted by economic benefit, farmers see that planting grain does not make money and one after the other change to planting cash crops such as garlic, peanuts, rape, and medicines. According to relevant department statistics, the area planted in early rice this year throughout the country is 119 million mu -- 12.17 million mu less than last year. Because the grain area is reduced, production has declined, making formerly tight supply and demand relations tighter and leading to an expected constant rise in the market prices of grains and oils. Purchasing is chaotic and grain reserves have fallen dramatically. Multi-channel grain purchases are intensely competitive, making purchasing extremely chaotic. In Jiangsu alone, this year's grain reserves are 50 percent lower than at the same time last year. Individual businesses play tricks and the residents are greatly harmed. Because various sets of remedies are still not sound, especially because there is no central quality testing department to check the quality of grains and oils, some individual business people, intent on nothing but profit, mix gypsum powder into flour and market it and some mix semi-finished oil or semi-finished sprouts with mixed oil, cottonseed oil, and bran oil and sell it as first or second class rapeseed oil. The consumers' rights are damaged. The grain stores' path is difficult and it is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects. Grain stores that for a long time depended on planned supply do not have their own funds. All business activity depends on bank loans. In addition, old and new debts build up and do not go down, the bank interest that enterprises are burdened with builds up from year to year, and burdens become heavier and heavier. Since the opening up of the market, grain enterprises have been bearing this burden and there is no way to go into battle with a light pack. In addition, old employees are in the majority in grain enterprises. In some urban areas, the ratio of retiring employees to employees on the job has reached approximately 1:1. Enterprise burdens are heavy. Some units even have difficulty maintaining employees' basic livelihood.
