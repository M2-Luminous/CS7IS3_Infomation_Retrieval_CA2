He graduated from the Economics Faculty at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University and completed his postgraduate studies at Tbilisi State University. He defended his candidate's dissertation in 1980 and his doctoral thesis in 1990. He has been a professor at Tbilisi State University since 1991. Between 1988 and 1993, he was head of department at the Georgian Academy of Sciences Institute of Economics. He began his political career in March 1992 when he became government adviser on economic questions. In October of that year he was elected to Parliament. In November, he was appointed Republic of Georgia minister of the economy. He is married and has two daughters. On 10 December 1993, Mikhail Dzhibuti resigned. [Adamashvili] The plaque outside the office of the minister of the economy still bears your name. Has your resignation been accepted and how has the government responded to it? [Dzhibuti] As it was solely my decision to quit my functions as minister, it can only be a question at this stage of when a successor will be appointed. My decision was taken not for the usual reasons of family circumstances or health; I resigned in order to draw the public's attention to the chaos that exists in the management of the economy. The reaction to my resignation was the same as that when dead people are being discussed, that is to say when nothing is said. The entire reaction came down to the level of human feelings being hurt: Why didn't Dzhibuti warn us? Surely, our relations didn't merit this? And so forth. For me personally, this is more insulting than anything. After all, I am on friendly terms with many people in the Cabinet of Ministers and I have not rejected these relations. I do not agree with the activities that the current Cabinet of Ministers is implementing in the economic sphere. Of course, it is possible to name those principally involved but, nonetheless, it is a question of collective responsibility. Each member of the Cabinet of Ministers is responsible for the policy conducted by the government. I dissociate myself from the Cabinet of Ministers as a whole and from its individual members precisely as far as this responsibility is concerned. [Adamashvili] What caused you to resign? By what thoughts were you guided in taking this step? [Dzhibuti] A connection exists between a system and subsystems. A system is made up of subsystems. However, the characteristics of a system are something more than the simple total of subsystems. The characteristics of a system do not repeat the characteristics of any one of the subsystems of which it is made up, whereas any subsystem in a system bears the characteristics of the system. This can be applied to the Cabinet of Ministers where any minister is like a subsystem. When the Cabinet of Ministers acquired the antireformist characteristics of a system and the sphere of activities of this system -- parliament and the head of state -- did not repulse this immediately, this situation became unbearable for me with my outlook and capabilities. I thought that my resignation would serve as an SOS and that economic policy would become a subject of serious discussion. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Neither in the government nor in parliament nor in economic institutions and faculties.... All this confirms the state of dreadful torpor not only of those managing the economy but also of general economic thinking and emphasizes the casual approach to the economy in all segments of society and among all politicians. [Adamashvili] You have said that the reason for your resignation was your disagreement with the forceful methods used to manage the economy. How did pressure from the government on your branch specifically manifest itself? [Dzhibuti] In Georgia, the Soviet style of managing the economy has not changed. There has been no reform of macroeconomic, branch, regional, and microeconomic management. Socialist enterprises prevail in industry and collective farms in agriculture and supply depots and auctions in the sphere of trade. Almost half of agriculture is subordinate to the Ministry of Defense. That is to say, everything that existed under the Soviet system has not been touched, including the administrative style of management. True, this management is not having as great an effect as it used to since the communist binding mechanism does not exist. However, the directorate is not in a hurry to implement reforms. It likes being the boss even among ruins. This also does not run counter to the interests of the ministries in charge. State ownership was as big a fiction as public ownership under the Soviet system. In actual fact, all property was in the hands of the nomenklatura and this is how it has remained to this day. Only a reform of the system can create state ownership before which both directors and ministers will appear not as lords but as employees. Political pressure on the economy is also being determined by the fact that the destruction of the district soviets has proved meaningless while managers are, in the main, "Soviet." [Adamashvili] What have you personally done in order to break through the situation that has taken shape? In what instances were you hindered and prevented from acting in what you considered to be the right direction? [Dzhibuti] I have done everything in order to expound an economic strategy and tactics in the form of a document. Such a document should have become a guide to action for all branches of management. By following it, it would have been possible to have overcome the obstacles of mentality and ignorance. At the same time, it would have been possible to have judged the activities of certain managers and levels of management. A program aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability and implementing system changes was contained in this document. A draft indicative plan for 1993-95 was drawn up.... I think one cannot pick out individual cases when I was hindered. The obstacle was a permanent one as, for example, of the two draft government decrees, one either contradicted an earlier decree adopted by the government or was aimed at restoring administrative management and individual power. [Adamashvili] How do you view the situation that has taken shape in the republic's economy today? What timely measures should have been taken to prevent the crisis and the plunging of the coupon? What else can still be done in order to save Georgia's economy? In what direction should we work? [Dzhibuti] One can characterize the situation as follows: the chaos of disorder. The crisis and the coupon are incommensurable quantities. Let's begin with the crisis. There are several qualitatively different reasons for the economic crisis in Georgia as well as for that in all postcommunist states. The first set of reasons have nothing to do with internal republican factors: These are the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia's obvious or not so obvious attitude to events in Georgia. The second set of reasons are of a republican nature: The conflicts in the Tskhinvali zone and Abkhazia, the civil war, internal political disorder, and so forth. In general, it was impossible to prevent the crisis. However, it would have been possible to have reduced it by removing the internal republican reasons. As for the coupon, it is connected with the state of the economy and the monetary and credit policy. Depending on what this policy is, the devaluation of the coupon can be halted within a very short period of time. Everything here depends on who is managing the economy and how. The general strengthening of the currency depends on the restoration of the strength of the republic's economy. The coupon itself, that is to say the national currency, is not the reason for the crisis. On the contrary, we have survived almost a year with just the coupon. Since November 1992, Georgia has received no kind of assistance to strengthen its currency system. In addition, a national currency represents the foundation of an autonomous economic system without which political independence does not exist. In order to save Georgia's economy, we have to refrain from social experiments and implement the declared policy of economic reform and not put spokes in the form of legal nihilism in the wheel of natural economic development due to ignorance, dilettantism, and personal profit. We have to work toward improving people's lives and in so doing, we must follow the path of civilization and not unexplored tracks in our history. [Adamashvili] In the event that your resignation is not accepted, will you agree to continue in your former position and under what conditions? [Dzhibuti] At the given stage, unless circumstances change, my decision remains final. However, if a reformist-minded Cabinet of Ministers is formed and guarantees are given that the system transformations contained in those programs and the indicative plan in which I participated will be implemented and the opportunity presents itself, I will work with pleasure and with no less responsibility on implementing the transformations. There has probably not been a minister anywhere in the world who, having resigned, has not thought about becoming minister again!
