The article is entitled, "Irresponsible Sexual Conduct is Suicidal." It contains very precise data, which I find very interesting and which you should know about. According to this article, the AIDS prevention and control program that the Ministry of Public Health has successfully been carrying out has made it possible to, up to the end of 1993, diagnose 988 patients in Cuba as HIV-positive. Of these, 236 have fallen ill, and, as of 31 December 1993, 148 had died. During 1993, 102 seropositive individuals were detected, from the close to 2 million test results examined, tests made with reagents produced by Cuba's pharmaceutical industry. There are more details. Let's see what Dr. (Manuel Santin Pena) said. He is the national director for epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health. Eddy? [Announcer identified only as "Eddy"] Well, he said that the blood banks are well monitored; it is therefore not possible in Cuba to catch the disease of the century through blood transfusions. Practically the only way to contract the virus in our environment is therefore through sex, which makes it dependent on an individual's sense of responsibility and conduct in selecting a partner and using condoms properly. Dr. (Santin) commented: Irresponsible conduct is quite simply suicidal. He also said that the prevention program is in the process of being perfected. According to (Santin), sanatorium care will continue to be made more flexible. In the last few years, those seropositive individuals who have become more aware regarding their illness are being offered facilities to allow them to live within the society and within their families. The experience gained now permits us to begin the system of outpatient care, which can be extended to all seropositive people who take a responsibile attitude toward the family and the society and who, moreover, voluntarily request such care. The Ministry of Public Health will maintain sanatorium care, which will continue to play an important role in the program against AIDS, while at the same time trying to reach out further into the community. Care of the seropositive will be the responsibility of the Family Doctor Program physicians, and they will, through interconsultations, receive the specialized care they require including, free, the specific medications required by their condition as carriers of the AIDS virus. It is important to remember that the AIDS virus dies quickly once outside the human body. This explains why casual contact does not provide a vehicle for the transmission of AIDS. Can AIDS be transmitted by a kiss on the mouth? It is true that the virus has been found in saliva, and in tears. This discovery, logically, provoked concern, but the truth of the matter is that in order to transmit the disease by mouth, the virus would have to make direct contact with the circulating blood. Up to the present, there has not been a single report of anyone's having contracted AIDS from a kiss on the mouth. Neither are there any reports of people having become infected through common use of a glass, flatware, or bed linens. This has been an article carried in the newspaper GRANMA today and signed by comrade Jose Antonio (de la Osa), entitled: "In Connection With the Disease of the Century: Irresponsible Sexual Behavior is Suicidal."
