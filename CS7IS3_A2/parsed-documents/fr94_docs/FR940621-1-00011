FR940621-1-00011 FR940621-1-00003 Initial study has concluded that the amount of vessels' seawater-ballast to be discharged into the Hudson River would constitute such a small volume that no change in the salinity or temperature levels would occur. Species contained in water collected from the open ocean are unlikely to survive a fresh water environment. Any nuisance species contained in the ballast water would not therefore, create a new infestation. While these regulations will help to prevent potential infestation of species introduced through the ballast water of vessels, data from the Army Corps of Engineers shows that no vessel traveled north of the George Washington Bridge in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore, the Coast Guard has concluded that the proposed regulations would have no negative impact on the environment. The Coast Guard solicits comments on the potential environmental impact of the proposed regulations. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 151 Administrative practice and procedure, Oil pollution, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water pollution control. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend 33 CFR part 151, subpart C as follows: PART 151_VESSELS CARRYING OIL, NOXIOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES, GARBAGE, MUNICIPAL OR COMMERCIAL WASTE, AND BALLAST WATER * * * * * Subpart C_Ballast Water Management for Control of Nonindigenous Species 1. The authority citation for subpart C is revised to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 4711, as amended; 49 CFR 1.46. 2. Section 151.1502 is revised to read as follows: §151.1502 Applicability. This subpart applies to each vessel that carries ballast water and that after operating on the waters beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone during any part of its voyage enters the Snell Lock at Massena, New York, or navigates north of the George Washington Bridge on the Hudson River, regardless of other port calls in the United States or Canada during that voyage. 3. In §151.1504, the definitions of Captain of the Port (COTP) and Voyage are revised to read as follows: §151.1504 Definitions. * * * * * Captain of the Port (COTP) means the Coast Guard officer designated as COTP of either the Buffalo, NY, Marine Inspection Zone and Captain of the Port Zone or the New York, NY, Captain of the Port Zone described in part 3 of this chapter or an official designated by the COTP. * * * * * Voyage means any transit by a vessel destined for the Great Lakes or the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, from a port or place outside of the EEZ, including intermediate stops at a port or place within the EEZ. 4. Section 151.1506 is revised to read as follows: §151.1506 Restriction of operation. No vessel subject to the requirements of this subpart may be operated in the Great Lakes or the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, unless the master of the vessel has certified, in accordance with §151.1516, that the requirements of this subpart have been met. 5. In §151.1510, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are revised to read as follows: §151.1510 Ballast water management. (a) * * * (1) Carry out an exchange of ballast water on waters beyond the EEZ, in a depth exceeding 2000 meters, prior to entry into the Snell Lock, at Massena, New York, or prior to navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, such that, at the conclusion of the exchange, any tank from which ballast water will be discharged into the Great Lakes contains water with a minimum salinity level of 30 parts per thousand. (2) Retain the vessel's ballast water on board the vessel. If this method of ballast water management is employed, the COTP may seal any tank or hold containing ballast water on board the vessel for the duration of the voyage within the waters of the Great Lakes or the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge. * * * * * Dated: June 13, 1994.
