The two men held a private meeting before attending a dinner hosted by the Guatemalan president. The two presidents also held a news conference in the Maya Room surrounded by their highest-ranking officials, including the foreign, finance, and commerce ministers of the two countries. Figueres announced his government's decision to improve political, trade, and economic relations with Guatemala. The visitor insisted on praising the peace process and voicing his support for the process which, he said, is led by President de Leon Carpio. He also said he respects Guatemala's internal affairs. He also talked about subjects of special interest -- such as coffee, bananas, and exports to the European Union -- and the challenge that the free trade agreement represents for Central America. However, he said the most important thing at this moment is the country's efforts to achieve peace, and he argued that economic and social matters were useless without peace. Figueres ended by referring to the possibility that Costa Ricans will join the Central American Parliament, but he said he respects those people in his country who oppose joining the organization. He stressed that a debate on this issue is not imperative at this time, only discussions about more urgent and positive issues.
