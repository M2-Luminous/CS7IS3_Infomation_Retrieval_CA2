FR941222-2-00056 FR941222-2-00049 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Licensing Opportunity and/or Opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the Use of Orally Active Derivatives of 1,3,5(10)-estratriene and Pharmaceutical Compositions Thereof AGENCY: National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, DHHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health is seeking licensees and/or CRADA partners for the further development, evaluation, and commercialization of novel esters of estradiol and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. The invention claimed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/122,853 entitled ``Orally Active Derivatives of 1,3,5(10)-estratriene'' (Kim, H.K., Blye, R.P., and Bialy, G.), filed August 17, 1993, is available for either exclusive or non-exclusive licensing (in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404) and/or further development under a CRADA for clinical and research applications described below in Supplementary Information. To expedite the research, development, and commercialization of this new class of drugs, the National Institutes of Health is seeking one or more license agreements and/or CRADAs with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in accordance with the regulations governing the transfer of Government-developed agents. Any proposal to use or develop these drugs will be considered. ADDRESSES: CRADA proposals and questions about this opportunity should be addressed to: Dr. Gordon Guroff, Deputy Scientific Director, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Building 49, Room 5A64, Bethesda, Maryland 20892 (301/496&hyph;4751). Licensing proposals and questions about this opportunity should be addressed to: Ms. Carol Lavrich, Technology Licensing Specialist, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20852&hyph;3804 (301/496&hyph;7735, ext. 287). Information about the patent application and pertinent information not yet publicly described can be obtained under a Confidential Disclosure Agreement. Respondees interested in licensing the invention(s) will be required to submit an Application for License to Public Health Service Inventions. Respondees interested in submitting a CRADA proposal should be aware that it may be necessary to secure a license to the above patent rights in order to commercialize products arising from a CRADA. DATES: There is no deadline by which license applications must be received. CRADA proposals must be received on or before March 22, 1995. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: One facet of oral contraceptive technology which has received little attention over the last three decades is the development of new orally active estrogens with attractive pharmacologic profiles. These would include hormones with fewer side effects than those associated with the currently available estrogens, ethynylestradiol and its 3-methyl ether (mestranol), notably nausea, vomiting, alterations in liver function, and histopathology and clotting disorders. Some clinicians have suggested that the presence of the 17-ethynyl moiety, which protects the steroid from rapid metabolism by the liver (so-called ``first-pass'' effect) and thus confers oral activity, is also responsible for many of the side effects observed with these drugs. In an effort to develop nonethynylated estrogens, NICHD has synthesized several estradiol nitrate esters which exhibit potent estrogenic activity in rats and rhesus monkeys following both oral, subcutaneous, and percutaneous administration. Using an increase in the uterine weight of immature rats (rat uterotropic test) as an endpoint, two of these esters were more than five times as potent as ethynylestradiol following oral administration. They also induce estrogen withdrawal bleeding in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys following both oral and percutaneous administration. They are very potent postcoital agents following oral administration to rats on days 0&hyph;4 of gestation. The superiority of these esters to ethynylestradiol or its methyl ether as the estrogenic component of oral contraceptive tablets will depend upon clinical and histopathological findings from toxicity studies in animals and/or clinical observations in Phase I and II human studies. The estradiol nitrate esters also have considerable potential clinical utility as replacement estrogens in menopausal women. The most widely used therapeutic regimens involve oral administration of ethynylestradiol, estradiol or conjugated estrogens (principally estrone sulfate) either continuously or cyclically, with or without addition of a progestin, much of which depends on the presence or absence of the uterus. Compounds of this series have been studied for estrogenic potency following oral, subcutaneous and topical administration and pharmacokinetic data are available on several analogs utilizing radioimmunoassays developed by the Government. Relative binding affinities to the rat and rabbit uterine estrogen receptor are currently being studied.
