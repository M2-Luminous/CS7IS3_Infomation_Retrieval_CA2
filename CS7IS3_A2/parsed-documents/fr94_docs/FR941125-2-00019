FR941125-2-00019 FR941125-2-00014 [A&hyph;588&hyph;029] Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber From Japan; Amended Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: On May 26, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT) the final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994). On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, period with respect to Momoi Fishing Net Manufacturing Co. (Momoi). Momoi's rate is zero percent for the 1990&hyph;1991 period. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly Moore or Tom Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0090. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On February 28, 1994, the CIT, in Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522, February 28, 1994), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final results of the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan (37 FR 11560, June 9, 1972). In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Momoi's fishnetting sold or imported into the United States for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, was 2.67 percent. Momoi's dumping margin for those final results was calculated based on the price to Momoi's U.S. importers ( see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 58 FR 42291 (August 9, 1993)). Based on the information on the record, the Department concluded that the price to Momoi's U.S. importers included U.S. Customs duties and brokerage expenses. On February 28, 1994, the CIT remanded this case to the Department to reconsider whether Momoi's C.I.F. sales excluded any charges for U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges in the calculation of United States price (USP) for Momoi ( see Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States (Court No. 93&hyph;09&hyph;00522)). Final Remand Results In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Momoi for the 1990&hyph;1991 administrative review of fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. Based on additional documents provided by Momoi in response to a supplemental questionnaire issued by the Department, we determined that Momoi's C.I.F. sales prices excluded U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges. We determined that the revised weighted-average margin based on this information for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, is zero percent. Final Results of Redetermination On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94&hyph;140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991 period with respect to Momoi. Momoi's rate for the 1990&hyph;1991 period is zero percent. Since we have not conducted an administrative review of Momoi for a later period, we will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to apply these amended results as a cash deposit for entries of merchandise produced by Momoi. This deposit requirement, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. This amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative review notice is in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: November 14, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29105 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
