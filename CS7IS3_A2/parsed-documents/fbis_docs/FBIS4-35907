Europe TA0206155794 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (MAMON supplement) in Hebrew 2 Jun 94 p 2 TA0206155794 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT (MAMON supplement) Hebrew BFN [Report by Arye Egozi] [Text] Israel Aircraft Industries [IAI] is operating special production lines to produce artillery shells for use by Eastern European armies. This fact was revealed yesterday at the opening of the Israeli pavilion at the military fair in Brno in the Czech Republic. Procurement backorders from Eastern Europe currently total approximately $100 million. IAI has marked Eastern Europe as a major target for the export of military systems. On the basis of orders submitted by several Eastern European armies, IAI has begun to produce artillery and tank shells in order to replace the ammunition that was supplied to these countries in the past by the former Soviet Union. Among other steps, IAI has developed an accelerated production line for 100 mm shells for T-55 tanks and 125 mm shells for T-72 models. Artillery shells have also been developed, including state-of-the-art cluster shells, both 130 mm and 152 mm in diameter. IAI is also selling machine guns, assault rifles, and handguns to Eastern Europe. Contacts are underway for additional deals. Eleven Israeli companies are exhibiting their wares at the Brno military fair, including the IAI, REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority], Tadiran, El-Op, Elbit, and Elisra, which produces electronic systems and sophisticated weapon systems. Senior Czech Army officials and senior representatives of other Eastern European armies are expected to visit the fair during the four days it is held.
