Well, I want to say right away that I could have found some kind of common language with Anatoliy Borisovich, had it concerned something banal, of an everyday nature. Our conflict is not a personal one. Primarily, we are talking about two radically different approaches to denationalization and privatization of property. It is a conflict of two points of view: of the Moscow Government, and of the Committee for Management of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo] headed by Chubays. I would like to point out that the issue here is the attitude towards the property that was created by the work of millions of people. This very fact demands that we distribute the property in such a way as not to harm those who created it. This is the concept that was laid down as the basis for the privatization that is going on in Moscow now, and we are defending it. This is the reason why some are saying that Moscow is nearly sinking the privatization process, that it is intentionally reining it in, due to its own, parochial considerations, and, therefore, it is ruining the system which is so orderly, according to the Goskomimushchestvo's thinking. At present we insist on the privatization procedure we have chosen basically because the approach that is being defended by the Goskomimushchestvo with such orthodox fanaticism can only bring us, and is already doing so, to a collapse of the economy instead of stabilization. We are not insisting on a different approach because we are against privatization. On the contrary, we see it as a powerful catalyst of the development of market relations which will bring into the economy new banking and commercial capital, new administrative structures, entrepreneurs with a contemporary, constructive way of thinking, and good organizers. I have to say that Moscow was there at the very beginning of privatization, and in number of privatized enterprises we are at the front line, as they say. Last year we practically completed privatization in trade, public catering, municipal and everyday services, transportation, and construction. Small-scale, rapid privatizing of trade facilities helped us resolve many problems related to supplying a big city with manufactured goods and food: More than half of all the food sold to Moscow residents has been acquired by commercial structures. Last year the city revenue received 21 billion rubles [R] from privatization; all in all, we have received 37 billion since this work started. But only an outsider can rejoice at those numbers. In reality, these sums are so small that they constitute a very unimportant share of our budget revenues. This is what hides one of the aspects of our differences with the privatization program declared by the Goskomimushchestvo. Free distribution of property or its sale at token prices practically led to its being simply auctioned off. How else can we view, for instance, the fact that functioning enterprises, which are part of the single industrial complex of Moscow and produce goods needed by Moscow and by all Russia, were sold as real estate, and at 1991 prices at that. There is a multitude of examples of such absurdity, but I will only cite one. The Goskomimushchestvo priced ZIL [plant imeni Likhachev], the giant of our machine building, at mere 4 billion rubles. This was at a time when new equipment installed at the plant was valued by experts at an incomparably higher price. The result? The ZIL conveyors have stopped, as you know. As the plant has became a joint-stock company, it does not have the money to pay wages, and the plant managers have to appeal to the Government of Moscow for help. But what do the new owners think, those who bought the controlling bloc of shares? I do not think they are overly concerned with the situation at the plant, with its many thousands of workers. These people bought it cheap and are treating it as a cheap commodity. The ZIL story is a good example of how wasteful the Goskomimushchestvo is in its treatment of government property. Privatization brings practically nothing into the country's revenue, which means that our budget does not have sufficient sums to cover major social and investments programs. Privatization "a la Chubays" highlights another dangerous phenomenon. It fails to engender real owners. The workers' collectives do not become such as they receive their enterprise practically for nothing. Neither, definitely, does it transform into owners those who invest their money, in the form of vouchers, in enterprises or numerous funds. On top of that, many people are still undecided about what to invest them in. Meanwhile, voucher privatization is entering its final, I would say landslide, stage. The deadline for voucher investments runs out 1 July. And what next? Here I would like to mention the third aspect of our conflict. Currently, the Goskomimushchestvo is the sole owner of all government property. This fact allows it to dictate its own terms of privatization. But we insist on a very speedy division of property into government and municipal. It is a matter of principle for Moscow, given its capital status. This would allow us to conduct privatization in such a way as not to harm the interests of our city, to replenish its budget, and to implement our social programs. However, we still have not received a response to our proposal. Being law-abiding people, we, however, do not intend to give up our city property and we definitely do not intend to manage it thoughtlessly or negligently. A recent session of the city government discussed the results of our privatization for the last year and its execution this year. I want to emphasize right away that we are basing our work on the government privatization program and adhere to the approved regulatory acts. But at the same time, the program stipulates that our city is carrying out the difficult functions of a capital city, that we have a huge population and huge property holdings and, therefore, the issue of managing this property is of vital importance for us. Besides, we are entering the final stage of voucher privatization and it is our duty to help Moscow residents figure out where to invest their privatization vouchers. In our consistent privatization process we have determined what should be privatized first, what should be done later, and what should not be privatized at all. This, of course, refers to the city's vital support systems. Here is the final point. Privatization should entail the emergence of new owners who will buy property and start thinking, apart from profits, about the interests of Moscow and its people.
