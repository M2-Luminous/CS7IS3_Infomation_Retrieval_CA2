One bullet pierced the glass of a window in the office of Leonid Hrach, republic committee first secretary and candidate for Crimean president. Fortunately, at the time the office's usual occupant was in a carefully guarded republic radio studio, where a live debate between the presidential candidates was in progress. There were 15 minutes to go until the end of the discussion.... An incident of a different kind took place around another candidate -- Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bargov. As he was coming of a hall in Yalta after addressing voters, a group of women expressed their dislike of the candidate by attempting to strike him. The security services came to the rescue. The Crimean presidential elections are scheduled for 16 January. Six candidates have registered, all of whom are now vigorously campaigning. Crimea's law on the presidential elections prohibits local mass media sources from publishing candidates' popularity ratings, although the results of independent studies, which coincide in many ways, are passed around from hand to hand and by word of mouth. All observers note that the main rivalry has developed between the two candidates with the highest chances of victory. That is, current Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bahrov and Communist Party Leader Leonid Hrach. Both are experienced politicians -- however, at times their electoral platforms are diametrically opposed. Leonid Hrach is supported by structures of the renewed Communist Party, and Nikolay Bahrov, although registered as an independent candidate, is also supported by influential political forces like the Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea, the Agrarian Party, the Party of Interethnic Accord, and the Party of Social Guarantees. Again, Bahrov's side is taken by the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly, which adopted a decision to participate in the elections. As Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as transliterated] told IZVESTIYA's correspondent, the Assembly members analyzed all the candidates' speeches and programs and watched the exclusive interview with Nikolay Bahrov on the Crimean Tatar television program "Ana Yurt" [as transliterated]. It was noted that all candidates apart from him are calling for measures which will lead to a revision of borders, and this means conflict in the Crimea. Therefore, the Assembly has urged compatriots to vote against all candidates except Bahrov. As election day draws nearer, political tension in the Crimea grows. Cities are covered with leaflets. Every weekend there are several meetings, congresses, and rallies. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy brought some quite unexpected tones to the political battle between contenders for the presidency. He decided to help one of the candidates, and appealed to the people of the Crimea: "The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] considers the Russian Party of the Crimea [RPC] (leader, S. Shuvaynikov) to be the only party in the Crimea capable of defending the interests of Crimean or Russian people. Remember, the LDPR will be with the RPC in fighting for your rights. We will defend Russian people, wherever they may be." Vladimir Volfovich's appeal proves that the Crimean party's patron is simply out of touch. In fact, a scandal had occurred in the Russian Party the day before: Sergey Shuvaynikov refused to stand down in favor of a candidate from the "Russia" bloc and even spoke out against joining the bloc itself. Furthermore, he gathered together likeminded thinkers and they excluded those behind the idea for an electoral bloc from the Russian Party. In response, supporters of the bloc assembled their own confederation and excluded the chairman himself from the Russian Party -- that is, their own presidential candidate Sergey Shuvaynikov, who, incidentally, has already succeeded in proclaiming himself the Crimea's shadow prime minister. There was a positively savage attack on Anatoliy Los, leader of the Russian Society of the Crimea and the most fervent supporter of the electoral bloc. Medics at the hospital gave him 30 stitches, while Shuvaynikov, who stands accused of this terrorist act, issued his own statement on television, where he announced that he is "switching to an unofficial position" and requested protection from the security services and the prosecutor's office.
