He noted, however, that in the regions where elections had been properly prepared, they would be held according to schedule. Filatov believes that elections to the local governments should be suspended because it is still unclear what authority they would carry. The population must decide what their government should be like, he said. In each region the government should have its specific features, he added. He expressed concern about the violations in the election campaigns revealed in individual regions. Some electoral districts are formed up on the basis of the national principle, he said, and the electors' proportions are violated, too. Filatov stated that if these violations were politically tinged, a new wave of confrontation might rise and the process of national reconciliation might be slowed down.
