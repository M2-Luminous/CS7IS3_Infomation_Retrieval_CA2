In addition, it is necessary to exchange views with the British side, so we hope that the expert panel under the Airport Committee will call a meeting this month. The so-called "fourth financial package" was proposed by the British side early this month. The Spring Festival holidays interrupted the process, but the Chinese side still studied the package very quickly and immediately proposed the expert panel meeting. It indicates that the Chinese side is, as always, positive and practical in dealing with the Hong Kong airport construction project. The Chinese Government consented to the construction of a new airport in Hong Kong a few years ago. As far as this project is concerned, the Chinese side has been consistently saying that it is necessary to handle the matter in strict accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] signed by heads of both the Chinese and the British Governments and with relevant stipulations of the Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which not only abides by the mutual commitments made between China and Britain, but also safeguards the interests of Hong Kong residents and of the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. With the exception of these, the Chinese Government does not have any gains from the Hong Kong new airport project. Actually, the problem would have been settled long ago if the previous financial packages proposed by the British Hong Kong authorities accorded with the Sino-British MOU. When the "fourth financial package" was proposed, officials of the British Hong Kong authorities went so far as to describe it as "presenting a big gift," saying that it "meets every demand of the Chinese side." As a matter of fact, the wealth of Hong Kong belongs to its people, and there is no point in saying that the British side "presents a gift." Moreover, as far as the lately proposed "fourth financial package" is concerned, what needs to be studied is merely the question of whether or not it accords with the Memorandum of Understanding and meet other relevant requirements, and whether or not it meets the demands of the Chinese side is not a question in itself. A review of the past shows that even when China vehemently argued with Britain on the issue of electoral arrangements in Hong Kong, the Chinese side still extended its timely support to construction projects which accorded with Hong Kong people's interests. For example, the Chinese side consented to the construction of the Western District Cross-Harbor Tunnel and to the reclamation project from the Central District to Wanchai. Regarding the problem of financing the new airport, the Chinese side has already stated its views in a systematic manner at the Airport Committee meeting last August. However, the British side merely called for the reconvening of the Airport Committee meeting without redrafting the package so as to make it conform to the stipulations of the MOU. Only after the matter was delayed for almost half a year then the British Hong Kong authorities put forward the "fourth package," whereas during this period, they repeatedly broke the package into different parts to appropriate funds for individual projects. Even when the "fourth package" was sent to the Chinese side and the content was not made public, they allowed the Legislative Council, which did not have a clear idea of the package, to pass an appropriation of nearly 4.8 billion dollars for the new airport project. Hence, the Chinese side could not but state that before China and Britain reach an agreement on the financing problem, the Chinese side and the future SAR Government will not bear responsibility for any cost and debt incurred by the new airport. On the one hand, the British Hong Kong authorities put off proposing the overall financial package. On the other hand, they authorized, without the consent of the Chinese side, the appropriation for project expenses. People cannot but doubt whether or not they are sincere about working according to the understanding and agreement reached between China and Britain. What the Sino-British MOU asked for is that the airport project should be in line with the cost-benefit principle in order not to put a burden on the future SAR Government: Up to 30 June 1997, no less than 25 billion Hong Kong dollars of financial reserves and no more than 5 billion dollars of debts will be left over for the SAR Government. As far as the new airport project is concerned, all debts, whether incurred by the Airport Authority or the Airport Railway Company, must be finally undertaken by the SAR Government. If the total amount of all these debts exceeds 5 billion dollars, the Chinese side has to raise a query on it according to the MOU. As prescribed by Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, land granted before 1997 shall be considered and decided by the Sino-British Land Commission and the total amount of land to be granted shall be limited to 50 hectares a year, but an increase in the amount of land granted each year can be considered after proposals by British Hong Kong Government. Investing some of the proceeds gained by selling land along the new airport rail line in the airport project was the original proposal of the Chinese side. Land along the airport rail line granted before 1997 should be, of course, discussed by the Sino-British Land Commission. As shown by its performance over the past few years, the Chinese side always took a positive attitude towards this and approved sales over the annual limit of 50 hectares of land in many years. The Chinese side can guarantee that it will support the construction of the airport railway by granting land through the Land Commission. As a matter of fact, it is not difficult to settle the new airport financing problem as long as the matter is handled in accordance with the stipulations of the MOU and of the Joint Declaration. The people of Hong Kong hope that the Sino-British expert panel meeting to be held at the end of this month can conscientiously and profoundly discuss the matter and make preparations for calling the Airport Commission meeting and finally reaching an agreement.
