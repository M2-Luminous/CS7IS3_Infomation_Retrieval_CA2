Many of the articles are associated in this case with the name of Rostislav Yevgenyevich Alekseyev and the design bureau he established. However, some newly formed organizations also claim a role in building surface skimmers. There has been much criticism of the TsKB [Central Design Bureau] for Ground Effect Vehicles imeni Alekseyev. This is why I made a quick trip to Nizhniy Novgorod. V. Sokolov, the chief designer for this field and for surface skimmer planning, explained it to me: "No matter what is said, the TsKB for Surface Effect Vehicles is a huge organization possessing a design, experimental and production base, and it permits travel along the entire path from an idea to a plan's realization." Yes, the TsKB endured difficult times in recent years. The work volume of military orders, which were the main source of work, was dramatically reduced, while financing for civilian construction of surface skimmers has not yet been found. The TsKB drew up a federal program for development of civilian surface skimmer building, with the necessary feasibility study. The regional association LIKO-Prommarket (general director, V. Litvinenko) was one of the first among commercial structures to become a dependable partner in joint efforts to design passenger surface skimmers based on the Orlenok plan. Considering the complexity of the problem's solution and the relatively high cost of the work, the TsKB and LIKO are hoping to attract other investors both in Russia and abroad. The hope in Nizhniy Novgorod is that assets will also be allocated from the state budget, especially so as to ensure the needed life, reliability and certification of surface skimmers as a new form of transportation. This is unfortunately necessary. Why is it that today's commercial structures are not living badly, and that you could earn more working for them? Because they enjoy tax concessions, and their overhead is lower--no laboratories, no test benches. But despite everything the basic core of qualified designers has survived. Besides the TsKB, the commercial enterprises Amfikon (amphibious vehicles) and Transal (the Alekseyev transporter) are involved in the development of surface skimmers in Nizhniy Novgorod. But as foreign experience shows, the possibilities of small enterprises of this kind are extremely limited. Three types of surface skimmers are distinguished. The first has a low wing aspect ratio--up to 1. These are known as craft employing the dynamic principle of support. They have only a rudder, and they possess (conditionally) two degrees of freedom, like a car or a small boat. They are driven by boat captains. Craft employing the dynamic principle of support include, for example, the Volga-2 passenger boat and the Raketa-2 gas turbo-vessel. The second type is represented by surface skimmers with a wing aspect ratio of up to 3. They have three degrees of freedom, and they fly within the limits of surface effect. They are equipped with an elevator. This type of surface skimmers includes the KM, Strizh, Orlenok and Lun. The third type is surface effect aircraft. When necessary, they can fly at high altitude like airplanes. These are still just plans and models. Everything that could happen during testing has, including accidents and disasters. In all cases the commissions concluded that crew error was the main cause of the incident. During testing of the Orlenok its tail section disintegrated and broke off together with the sustainer engine. But the surface skimmer did not sink, and it was able to return to base on its own power using its starting engines. The surface skimmers KM, Volga-2 and Raketa-2 were described earlier in the No 11, 1991 issue of KRYLYA RODINY. Other designs are presented below. The small Strizh surface skimmer is a two-seat craft. It is intended for pilot training. It is capable of taking off and landing on a water and a snow surface. It may be used for patrolling, communications and business flights. V. Bulanov is the chief designer. Length--11.4 m. Wingspan--6.6 m. Height--3.6 m. Takeoff weight--1,630 kg. Maximum speed--200 km/hr, cruising speed--175/hr. Takeoff run (water/snow)--600/400 m, landing run--350/300 m. Flying range with a passenger--500 km. Ferrying range--800 km. Flying altitude above surface--0.3-1.0 m. Navigability: Takeoff and landing at a wave state of up to 0.5 m, capable of floating at a wave state of up to 1.3 m. Time of a training flight with one person aboard--3 hr, with two--1-2 hr. Engines--two rotary piston water-cooled VAZ-4133, 160 horsepower each. Fuel consumption--0.35 liters/km. The airframe is made from an aluminum-magnesium alloy. Structures are riveted together. The propellers are driven by a cardan shaft through a step-down one-step reduction gear and an automatic clutch. The propellers are five-bladed, 1.1 m in diameter, with fixed pitch. The engine nacelles are equipped with fire warning systems and electrically controlled fire extinguishing systems. The Strizh is based on shore under an awning (or in a hangar) on a special truck that simultaneously serves during flying as the means of launching and raising the surface skimmer when a ramp descending to a water depth of not less than 1 meter with a slope of up to 6 degrees is present at the base. The surface skimmer is serviced by one mechanic. The Orlenok seagoing surface skimmer was designed as an assault landing transporter for the navy, and it has been in operation since 1979 (chief designer, V. Sokolov). Basic data: Length--58 m. Wingspan--31.5 m. Height--16 m. Normal takeoff weight--125 tonnes. Overloaded takeoff weight (there is a limit on wave height during takeoff)--140 tonnes. Payload weight--up to 20 tonnes. Maximum fuel weight--28 tonnes. Cruising speed--350 km/hr. Range--1,100 km. Navigability: Takeoff and landing--up to 4 points, floating and flying--4-5 points. Amphibious capability: Emergence onto a relatively even shore with a slope of up to 5 degrees. Basing: Parked on special pontoon platforms or engineered shore platforms. Crew--nine persons. The Orlenok surface skimmer is a cantilever monoplane consisting of a streamlined fuselage with the hydrodynamic elements locating in its lower part, low wings with a low aspect ratio, and an elaborate tail. The fuselage has a relatively simple beam-and-stringer structure, and it is divided in its layout into three sections--nose, middle and tail. The nose section contains the crew cabin, starting engines and compartments housing the electronic equipment, including a radar station located in the nose tip and covered with a radiotransparent faring. Depending on the purpose of the surface skimmer the middle section of the fuselage may be designed as a passenger cabin or cargo bay, or it can be filled with special equipment. The tail section contains a compartment housing auxiliary engines and onboard machinery for starting the main engines and maintaining the performance of the surface skimmer's hydraulic and electric systems. Fuel tank compartments are in the left and right wing panels. As with the fuselage, the wing as a whole is a sealed watertight structure imparting buoyancy to the surface skimmer. The necessary stability and unsinkability are achieved in this case by dividing the lower part of the fuselage and wings into watertight compartments. The main propulsion unit consists of one sustainer turboprop NK-12MK engine and two starting turbofan NK-8-4K engines designed by N. D. Kuznetsov. The NK-12MK provides for economical cruising, and it is positioned on the surface skimmer's tail, at the intersection of the fin and stabilizer. This relatively high position of the engine is the result of the need for keeping it away from sea spray when the surface skimmer starts, lands and takes its landing run. It also reduces the possibility of salt contamination of the engine in flight by aerosols in the sea atmosphere, the saturation of which is known to depend on height above the surface. The starting engines work only when the surface skimmer takes off, and they are outfitted with swiveling gas exhaust nozzles for changing the direction of the engine exhaust stream: During the takeoff run--beneath the wing to create an air cushion (blow mode), and during transition to cruising mode--horizontal thrust, accelerating the surface skimmer to cruising speed. As with the engines themselves, the air intakes of the starting engines are designed flush with the outline of the surface skimmer's nose section to reduce drag. Blowing of the gas streams beneath the wings during the takeoff run helps to reduce hydrodynamic resistance and external hydrodynamic loads, which is especially important when the craft takes off over a rough sea. Blowing is also employed for these purposes when landing the surface skimmer in landing run modes. The main systems of the surface skimmer--control, hydraulic, electric power supply, life support, radio engineering and navigation support--are designed as aircraft systems. Redundancy and backup of systems and equipment are foreseen, which is necessary for safe operation of the aircraft. Layout of the 150 Passenger Orlenok Initial plans for seagoing surface skimmers intended for different purposes have been drawn up on the basis of the Orlenok at the TsKB for Surface Effect Vehicles. The seagoing passenger surface skimmer is intended for high-speed passenger conveyance over inland and marginal seas at a speed of 400 km/hr at a distance of not more than 2,000 from a port. The Lyuks variant carries 65-75 passengers; the single-deck variant carries 100-150; the double-deck variant carries up to 300 persons. There is a crew of five. The seagoing cargo surface skimmer is intended to convey express cargo. The weight of the cargo is 30 tonnes, and the dimensions of the cargo bay are 21x3.2x3.0 m. The seagoing arctic geological exploratory surface skimmer is used for geological and geophysical operations in shallow shelf waters of the Arctic Seas, and for their transportation support. The search-and-rescue surface skimmer is intended for search-and-rescue support to the seagoing fleet, for delivery of emergency rescue teams to places of accidents and natural disasters in the vicinity of offshore drilling rigs, to platforms, and to population centers on the coast, on the shelf and in island zones, and to provide assistance to and evacuate casualties and the public from these places. The air-sea search-and-rescue system consists of the Mriya airplane and the Orlenok surface skimmer. It is intended for effective search and rescue of people from sunken or distressed vessels through the combination of high speed and long range. System takeoff weight--600 tonnes. System speed--800 km/hr. Carrier range--6,000 km. Surface skimmer speed--400 km/hr. Surface skimmer range--2,500 km. Navigability--4-5 points. Number of victims taken aboard the surface skimmer--up to 150 persons. There are great possibilities for an experimental search-and-rescue surface skimmer currently under construction, code-named the Spasitel (chief designer, V. Kryllovykh). Its detail design was completed in 1991. Construction of the surface skimmer proceeded simultaneously with this at an experimental plant. It is 70 percent assembled. It should have a speed of 450 km/hr. Takeoff weight--400 tonnes. Capacity--up to 500 rescued persons. A hospital fitted out with surgical and resuscitation rooms and a casualty ward is foreseen. Had we possessed this surface skimmer sooner, we may have avoided the tragedy that befell the submarine "Komsomolets," in which 42 persons died. Unfortunately, conclusion of the construction of this unique rescue resource is in jeopardy. The main reason is a lack of financing by the client, a role played by the navy's search-and-rescue service. It would be a pity if this enormous amount of labor is wasted, and the unfinished surface skimmer is scrapped. But this is fully possible in our unpredictable times. COPYRIGHT: "Krylya Rodiny" 1993.
