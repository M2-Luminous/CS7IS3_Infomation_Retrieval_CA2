In a few weeks, U.S. federal agencies including the Commerce Department will complete the drafting of U.S. trade and investment regulations in Vietnam. Related tax codes are expected to come out too. Among the existing U.S. laws banning U.S. trade with Vietnam are the 1993 Foreign Aid Appropriations Bill and amendment laws to the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Officials from Treasury and State Departments will head for Vietnam for talks on U.S. Government and private property claims stemming from the war, estimated at between 140 and 200 million U.S. dollars. Washington said its share of Vietnamese market will worth six billion U.S. dollars a year. Before 1996, trade in aviation, telecommunications, heavy equipment and construction will be four billion dollars. According to the 110-member U.S.-ASEAN council, the lifting of embargo will generate more than eight billion dollars in new export opportunities for U.S. firms in five years. Since 1975, the embargo has costed U.S. firms 1.5 billion dollars in annual sales, according to the papers released by the council on competitiveness. Observers here said U.S. investment chances in Vietnam are mainly in power generation, medical equipment, transportation equipment, construction, engineering, telephones and commercial aircraft. Vietnam also represents a vast market for U.S. information technology, banking services, oil and gas exploration technologies, accounting and legal services. On the other hand, the lifting of trade embargo will boost Vietnam's exports of garments, textiles, shoes, toys and others to the U.S.. The JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, a major trade newspaper, reported today that as many as 300 U.S. companies stand ready to trade with Vietnam, like Boeing, Digital Equipment and Motorola. Already, three dozen U.S. firms have set up representative offices in Hanoi since U.S. dropped its opposition to loans to Vietnam by international financial institutions last July. Among the U.S. companies catching up quickly in trade with Vietnam are Pepsi-Cola International, Coca Cola, Eastman Kodak Co., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp. and Citibank. American Express will sign an agreement with Vietnam's Bank of Foreign Trade that permits the use of its credit cards in Vietnam. United Airlines is seeking permission to start flights between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City.
