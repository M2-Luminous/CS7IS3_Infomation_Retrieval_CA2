G. Pavelev, A. I. Kucheryavenko, S. G. Rubashkin, R. R. Salimzyanov, D. A. Pavelev; UDC 528.8] [Abstract] Revised experimental data on the magnitude of the refraction angle and refraction attenuation of radio waves in Venus's atmosphere are presented using the results of bistatic radar measurements of the planet. In order to describe the refraction effects, a theoretical model is developed. This model is used to determine parameters which are necessary to calculate radio communication lines in the troposphere using refractive index versus height. The experimental data are compared with the results of calculations made using a theoretical model. Ratios which link the length of the phase path and integral absorption of radio waves in the atmosphere with parameters of the theoretical model are obtained. These ratios may be used to calculate communication routes in Venus's atmosphere. Figures 4; references 16.
