De Klerk. The two men discussed possible ways open to the Netherlands and the European Union to bring pressure to bear on Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. His Inkatha Freedom Party has rejected repeated calls from President De Klerk and ANC [African National Congress] leader Nelson Mandela to take part in the April general elections. During his visit to South Africa the Dutch Prime Minister will not be meeting Chief Buthelezi. On Sunday Mr. Lubbers did meet members of another party boycotting the April poll -- the white Conservative Party. The talks were attended by Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans. After the meeting the Dutch Government delegation described the attitude of the Conservative Party as worrying.
