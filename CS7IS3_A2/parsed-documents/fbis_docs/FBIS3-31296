This measure is evidently aimed at averting the Slovak deficit in the trade balance and the resulting dollar payments to the Czech Republic. Will the Czech side react to this? [Klaus] [Slovak Finance] Minister Toth has been looking for a long time for some centralized restriction of trade flows to Slovakia, not only from the Czech Republic but also from the whole world, to prevent a deficit in the balances of trade and payments. He came up with this or that idea many times in the past, only to quietly drop it later. We can react only when we are notified of something through official channels. (Editor's note: The interview was conducted a few hours before the Central Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic announced that products without a certificate about their quality would not be allowed to enter Slovakia as of Friday [11 February].) [Krejci] Interior Minister Jan Ruml is working on a bill to make the StB [communist-era secret police] archives accessible. Has the government come to an agreement on this, or is that his private initiative? [Klaus] This issue has been discussed for a long time, and the minister of interior is reacting to it correctly, from the bureaucratic point of view. However, this matter has not been discussed as yet at the level of the coalition or the government. [Krejci] Deputy Interior Minister Zeman said that local elections and elections to the Senate should be held on 19 November. What is your opinion? [Klaus] These are only hypothetical speculations on the part of the deputy minister. No talks on this issue have been held thus far and a decision is yet to be made. [Krejci] Should the nationalist Zhirinovskiy arrive in the Czech Republic, or should he be declared undesirable? [Klaus] Undesirable in the general human sense of the word is one thing and "persona non grata" as a technical term in international politics--that is, whether some person will be formally permitted to enter the country--is another. Mr. Zhirinovskiy definitely is an undesirable in our country. We do not need him here, do not have to listen to his views, and I assume no one is curious to see him. I am not clearly convinced, however, that we should also resort to the use of the term "persona non grata" in the diplomatic sense. There is a discussion on this issue going on between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. One consideration is whether, by resorting to some extreme bans, we would not actually give this man more publicity than he deserves. [Krejci] The Czech-Moravian Federation of Trade Unions wants to submit a complaint to the International Labor Organization because the Czech Government is supposedly violating Convention 87 on the free association in the trade unions. [Klaus] This is an ill-considered and--the gentlemen trade unionists are free to feel offended--somewhat childish step. We should settle matters of this kind among ourselves instead of hiding behind someone more distant and stronger. The idea of complaining to some international organization that I failed to get my way at home rather reminds me of children at play: First I challenge some classmate to a fight, and, when he beats me, I go and ask the teacher for help. I find this approach absolutely unacceptable, disloyal, and wrong.
