The combined state run forests employ over 1.5 million people, have a total population of some 4 million people, and fixed assets of over 16 billion yuan. Since the founding of the PRC, state forests have produced for the nation some 1 billion cubic meters of lumber to ensure the needs of energy, railroads, disaster relief, major national construction projects and so forth, and continue to be responsible for the whole task of providing wood products under the state plan. However, because forestry districts have not truly implemented the guidelines of the forestry operations as a basic policy, because investment in the forestry industry has been woefully inadequate, and product and industrial structure remain irrational, the pace of economic development in the state forestry regions has been slow. At present the following problems beset the state forestry regions. 1. There is a crisis in harvestable timber resources. For example, in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forests the total area of harvestable mature and over-mature timber has decreased sharply. The area of harvestable mature and over-mature timber has fallen from a high of 12 million hectares at the time of Liberation to the present 5 million hectares, a drop of 53 percent. The reserves of harvestable mature and over-mature timber have been drastically reduced, from a high of 2 billion cubic meters at Liberation to the present 470 million cubic meters, a reduction of 76.5 percent. The quality of timber has also fallen. In the Heilongjiang forest districts, for instance, the average amount of reserves per hectare has fallen from a Liberation high of 143.2 cubic meters to the present 90 cubic meter level, a decline of 37.2 percent. The maturity structure of forests has also declined, middle and young growth now constitute almost 80 percent of total timber reserves. At present, the resources of mature and over-mature timber which can be felled in all of the state run forests nationwide are quickly being depleted, and continued lumber production is becoming difficult. 2. Forestry enterprises are in an economic crunch. With the reduction in harvestable timber resources, lumber production has fallen year by year, and with other cost increases, in 1990 for the first time the state forests as a whole ran at a loss. After two increases in the price of lumber, by 1992 some 30.3 percent of the state forest regions were still losing money, losses amounted to 510 million yuan, definitely an economic problem. In 1992, some 42 percent of the enterprises in the state forest regions in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia were suffering losses to the tune of 400 million yuan. It was very common for enterprises to withhold and delay the payment of workers' wages. The Heilongjiang forestry system was some 440 million yuan in arrears for workers' wages; in the Mudanjiang forest region the average was five months in arrears, with some enterprises reaching seven months. There was no way for enterprises to purchase the coal, fuel oils, steel and other materials needed for production and construction. Work stoppages and visits to higher authorities occurred. 3. The social burden of enterprises is great. In the past several years nonoperational expenditures have skyrocketed; totalling some 1.55 billion yuan in 1992 for the state forest regions, accounting for 96.9 percent of the year's sales profits. The Heilongjiang Forestry Industry Main Bureau was a prime example, with nonoperational expenditures for its enterprises reaching 760 million yuan, 138 percent of that year's sales profit. The enterprises historical burden is extremely heavy. As of 1992 forestry enterprises in the state forestry regions were in arrears to their welfare funds in the amount of 1.06 billion yuan. 4. Enterprises have fallen far behind in building production and social facilities. For example, of the 82 forestry bureaus established in the Northeast and Inner Mongolian State Forest Regions, although all have general plans, only two bureaus have completed construction; all of the others, to one degree or another, are putting individual phases into production as they are completed, and have no comprehensive production capabilities. At present that forest region has 156 final phase lumber mills which have not been constructed, and almost 90,000 kilometers of road which should be but are not yet built. Living quarters for the workers are on the average less than four square meters, and most is unsophisticated housing built in the 1950s and 1960s. To stimulate economic growth in state forestry regions, we suggest: 1. Continue reforms; create the conditions in structure and mechanisms to get the state forestry regions' industrial sector on the market economy track. In the near future we first must promote construction and completion of the four lumber industry conglomerates in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia; then use this reform as the starting point for comprehensive enhancement of the forestry industrial sector's overall strength, put to actual use the sector's internal superiority of mutual support, and the rational flow and allotment of funds, assets, resources and labor and other elements of production, which quite possibly might put life back into the entire sector. Second, we should comprehensively institute asset management of the state forestry resources among the Northeast and Inner Mongolian regions' enterprises, making a true division between their rights of ownership and their rights of use, and assure recompense for managing state forests. This will not only solve the problem of "one big rice bowl" in the state forests, but also possibly guarantee the continued existence of the forests. 2. Taking the market as the guide, efficiency as the heart, adjust the industrial structure and the product structure of the state forest regions. In adjusting these, we must turn to the international and domestic markets, but do it in light of the actual conditions in the state forest regions. First we must set our goals, seek new growth potential for economic expansion. While not exacerbating the consumption of forest resources, concentrate investment appropriately, disposing it according to sector policies and industrial plans, arrange for the construction of a number of artificial board and paper mills. Regarding the newly established or expanded forestry regions responsible for developing forests, we should set up, in synchronization with these undertakings, timbering and transportation and in appropriate scale, forestry byproducts and pulp and paper and related industries. As regards forestry timbering and transportation facilities being built which already have the necessary conditions, we can try to restructure their industrial structure while they are still in the process of being built. 3. The state must increase investment in forestry enterprises. This includes increases in potable water in forest regions, medical facilities, rehabilitation of condemned buildings, and other noneconomic operational investments; increases in operational type investments in developing artificial board plants, paper mills and other large and medium construction projects. Increase investment in forestry management, to include use of World Bank loans and other international financial institutions to speed up the nurturing of forestry resources. In addition, funds in the state budget and societal funds including foreign funds invested in the forestry sector must all be used for sectorial development. The state should continue to implement the relevant preferential treatment policies; and state regulated prices for wood products from the state forest regions should be deregulated as soon as possible.
