The organization led by Carl Denis and Gerard Bissainthe denounces the presence of a U.S. warship in Haitian waters on 2 May. Let us listen to Carl Denis: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Reporter Francois] Carl Denis, you are a leader of an organization that stands for the defense of Haiti's national sovereignty. We noticed a statement by the White House today: that no option is excluded in the case of Haiti, not even the military option. How do you interpret such a statement? [Denis] We interpret it as the United States having decided that in the case of a small country, particularly a small black country, it can afford to make mistakes it cannot make in other countries. No matter how strong it wishes to be, it cannot go into Bosnia-Herzegovina because it knows that it will be defeated. It also knows that it cannot go into Rwanda because they would not [word indistinct] because there, the armies are stronger. We think that President Clinton and the White House are acting thoughtlessly toward Haiti. We are indignant that following those statements, a U.S. warship is at less than 2,000 miles [as heard] from our shores. The ship was there at 1000 this morning. What did it come to do? It came to bring a message to our legislators so they do not apply articles of the Constitution that the legislators would like to adopt. Thus, instead of -- as the U.S. Government says -- it being the [Haitian] military who are putting pressure on our parliament, I see instead that it is the U.S. military putting pressure on our parliament so that [the legislators] do not work the way they should. We are very indignant about that. [Francois] You therefore condemn all these actions? [Denis] We strongly condemn the fact that Washington has stuck its nose into Haiti's affairs. We wish it would respect other countries, which are not its equal, but which have their own sovereignty, their own tradition. There was no reason for the crisis to have lasted so long had it not been for the harmful action of the international community. Finally, when you look carefully, the United States gives us two options: either we die under the commercial and economic sanctions that they impose on us, or they force us to accept a government that will kill us itself. You get to realize that the United States cannot be a friend to Haiti. [end recording]
