Yoruba Chief Moshood Abiola proclaimed himself winner of the said elections, annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida's military government on the grounds of electoral malpractices. In a full-page communique published in THE GUARDIAN newspaper, NADECO which is composed of prominent figures, retired Army officers, former ministers and state governors, appealed to Nigerians to boycott the 28 May second round of balloting to elect district delegates to the upcoming constitutional conference. The constitutional conference is scheduled to begin on 27 June in Abuja. NADECO had earlier called for the boycott of the first round held on 23 May. "It is obvious that the 23 May elections were a big failure," the coalition observed. "The massive boycott of the ward elections is a expression of defiance for Gen. Abacha's regime," the communique stated. The communique was signed by NADECO Secretary General Ayo Opadokun.
