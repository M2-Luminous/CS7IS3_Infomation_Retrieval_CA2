FBIS TRENDS-11MAY94-CROATIA Croatia-Slovenia-Italy Croatia-Slovenia-Italy Croatia, Slovenia Downplay Istrian Border Issue SUMMARY Apparently hoping to calm anxieties about the possible revival of irredentist claims to the formerly Italian Istrian peninsula, Slovene and Croatian officials have minimized the significance of the recent victory in Italy of the center-right coalition. END SUMMARY While acknowledging that the victory of nationalists in recent Italian elections has raised apprehensions in Croatia and Slovenia, officials of both countries have tried to calm fears and offer assurances of continued neighborly relations. Apparently referring to calls by Italian nationalists for restitution of Italian assets in Istria that were seized by the Yugoslav Government after World War II, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, during a 23 April visit to Istria, said that "some uncontrolled post-election statements in Italy are causing tension and fear in Croatia, although they do not represent the official Italian policy." Granic assessed bilateral relations with Italy as "good," noting that Italy was Croatia's second- largest trading partner. He emphasized that Croatia would respect the rights of its ethnic Italian minority "in accordance with the highest international standards and the Croatian Constitution" and said he expected that the Italian minority in Istria would serve as "one of the strongest links of friendship and cooperation" between the two countries (Vjesnik, 25 April). Similarly, at a 28 April Ljubljana news conference covered by Ljubljana Radio, Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle was guardedly positive about Slovene-Italian relations. He assessed cooperation with Italy "as positive on the whole," adding that in the future he expected good neighborly relations "that would set an example for others." Peterle told reporters that minorities in Slovenia are protected "in accordance with the highest European standards." He stressed that demands to abrogate the Osimo Treaty signed between Italy and Yugoslavia in 1975 and to revise Italy's borders with Slovenia made by "certain Italian politicians "--an apparent reference to Mirko Tremaglia, a deputy of the National Alliance/Italian Social Movement--were not the official position of the Italian Government. According to Peterle, recently revived property claims of Italians who left Istria and Dalmatia after World War II had already been settled by the compensation agreement signed by Italy and Yugoslavia in 1983, an agreement that Slovenia has pledged to honor. Although current Slovenian law restricts the purchase of land by foreigners, Peterle asserted that "within the process of joining Europe" he saw no problem with foreign citizens buying property in Slovenia, "as we have never differentiated among people." He expressed hope that Italy would therefore cease blocking Slovenia's association agreement with the EU and will finally withdraw its objections. Echoing his stance on the issue, Peterle's political party,' the Christian Democrats (SKI)), adopted a declaration on bilateral relations with Italy at their annual conference. According to the text published on 25 April by Republika, a Slovene-language Trieste daily, the SKI) opposes the revision of the Osimo Treaty and the revision of state borders, while advocating "sincere" cooperation between the two countries, without conditions, pressure or extort ion. The SKD declaration also stated that Slovenia, while not yielding to threats, would seek its place in Europe among those nations and countries that respect "Slovene national independence." Italian regional government leaders in the region bordering on Slovenia are also apparently anxious to avoid heightening tensions over Italian nationalist claims on Istria. The 21 and 25 April Republika reported that the leadership of Italy's Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, which borders Slovenia, supports cooperation with Slovenia and Slovenia's integration into the EU. Renzo Travanut, a Christian Democrat and chairman of the regional government, denounced Forza Italia's call to freeze relations with Slovenia and oppose Slovenia's accession to the EU. Such "bombastic statements and muscle flexing", he said, do not strengthen Italy's foreign policy, promote bilateral relations, or serve the business interests of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and especially do not contribute to the protection of the Italian minority" in Istria. Travanut emphasized that the border region wants to be involved in shaping policy toward "such a sensitive area" as "relations with our neighbors" (Republika, 21 April). Travanut's position has been backed by the Friuli-Venezia Giulia trade union organizations, affiliated with center to leftwing parties. The unions issued a joint statement supporting cooperation with Slovenia and Slovenia's integration into the European Union as the only means to increase economic prosperity, solve border issues, and protect ethnic minorities. The trade union statement denounced revanchism, which causes "unnecessary tension," and called on the regional government to intervene at the national level to support Slovenia's association agreement with the EU (Republika, 21 April).
