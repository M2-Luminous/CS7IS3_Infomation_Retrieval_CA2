Their list includes the Gas-Prom joint-stock entity and the Norilsk nickel concern that annually scoop up 1 billion in hard-currency revenues. This was stated here today by Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the Russian State Committee for the Management of State Property in the course of hearings on the Russian privatization drive being held by the State Duma's Committee on Property, Privatization and Economic Activity. According to Chubays, the Russian privatization concept has worked on the whole, with the state getting back 88 million privatization checks (out of the 148 million checks issued to the population that still has 12 million vouchers). The rest are wielded by commercial organizations and by the nation's 650 voucher investment funds. In his words, the voucher's price is bound to keep growing steadily. As a matter of fact, it has soared 50 per cent over the last two weeks when it became crystal clear that not a single political opponent could affect the pace of national privatization.
