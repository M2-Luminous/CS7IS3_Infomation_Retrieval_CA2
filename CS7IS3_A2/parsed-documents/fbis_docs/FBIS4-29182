Japan has already asked China to lower tariffs and remove nontariff barriers on some 3,800 goods. The total number of goods, if the items on the additional request are included, will become about 4,100. Regarding the 3,800 goods, the government submitted a demand last March and received a tentative answer from China in late May. However, since the contents of the response are not "satisfactory," (according to a government source), the government, in addition to submitting the additional request, plans to work on China during future bilateral negotiations to positively accept the demands. Regarding China's GATT membership, a GATT working-level meeting is scheduled to be held in Geneva starting on 27 June. It seems that Japan and China will have bilateral negotiations at that time.
