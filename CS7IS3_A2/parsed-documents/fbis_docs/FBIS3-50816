The official held a joint news conference with Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley within the framework of his official visit to the country, which ended on 6 January and during which he reviewed the present status of Chilean-Canadian economic and trade relations. Regarding the importance for smaller economies to associate themselves with the United States, Minister (MacLaren) said his party, the Liberal Party, had been in the opposition until last year and was a critical opponent of an agreement with the United States because it was involved in unfair practices and maintained subsidies. This situation was partly solved thanks to NAFTA and GATT, the minister said. Foxley and (MacLaren) outlined the growing Canadian investment in Chile, which reached $4 billion, stressing that it will continue to grow this year through the association contract between Codelco [Copper Corporation] Chile and a consortium that includes the Canadian firm (Luck Minerals) to exploit the Laura field. The minister on 6 January participated in a meeting with government authorities and Eduardo Aninat and Carlos Figueroa, [finance and foreign ministers-designate, respectively] two of President-elect Eduardo Frei's cabinet members.
