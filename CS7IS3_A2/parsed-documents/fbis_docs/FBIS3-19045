"France, like its allies, wishes to give these departure ceremonies all the importance linked to a military presence that contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall" in November 1989, Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. He was reacting to German Chancelor Helmut Kohl's decision earlier that no military parade should be held when American, British and French troops withdraw from the east German city in September. Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Kohl's decision stemmed from "internal and external pressure," and may be linked to the German government being miffed at not having been invited to join ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the allied landing on Normandy beaches on June 6.
