The Taoyuan District Court meted out the prison terms for taxi driver Yang Ming-te and his wife Pan Feng-ying after finding them guilty of air privacy. The couple said that they would appeal. Judge Chiang Hsiao-pei said that the court showed leniency to Yang because he surrendered [words indistinct]. His wife received the shorter term because she was only an accomplice, Qiang added. The couple could have been sentenced to death. The couple armed with a knife and fake explosives brought their son along when they hijacked the Russian-built Tupelov 154 run by the mainland Sichuan Airlines to Taiwan on September 30 and asked for political asylum. Their six-year-old son has been placed in an orphanage. A total of 10 mainland airliners were hijacked to Taiwan last year. So far (?talks) have been in a deadlock over whether Taiwan has legal jurisdiction over the hijackers. Taiwan in principle has agreed to repatriate hijackers after trying them, but the mainland does not recognize Taipei's jurisdiction or power.
