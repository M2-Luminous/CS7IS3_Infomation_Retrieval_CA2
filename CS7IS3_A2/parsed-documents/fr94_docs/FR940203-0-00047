FR940203-0-00047 FR940203-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG69 Disease Associated With Exposure to Certain Herbicide Agents AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This amendment is necessary to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that there is an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The intended effect of this amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions based on herbicide exposure. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective February 3, 1994, as provided by Public Law 102&hyph;4. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Bisset, Jr., Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a), 3.309(e), and 3.311a to establish presumptive service connection for Hodgkin's disease and PCT based on exposure to herbicides in the Federal Register of September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50528&hyph;30). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions or objections concerning the proposal on or before October 28, 1993. Since no comments were received, the proposed amendments are adopted without change. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.109 and 64.110.
