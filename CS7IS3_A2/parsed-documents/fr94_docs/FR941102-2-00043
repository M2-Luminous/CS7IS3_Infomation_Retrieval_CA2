SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of an application submitted by Ciba-Geigy Corporation, to conditionally register the pesticide product Irgarol 1051, containing an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Marshall Swindell, Product Manager (PM) 31, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 270, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6908). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of June 10, 1993 (58 FR 32533), which announced that Ciba-Geigy Corp., Additives Division, Three Skyline Drive, Hawthorne, NY 10532, had submitted an application to conditionally register the pesticide product Irgarol 1051, (EPA File Symbol 40810&hyph;RR), ~containing the active ingredient N -cyclopropyl- N '-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine at 96 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product. ~~ The application was approved on September 9, 1994, as Irgarol 1051 for use in formulating antifoulant paints in boats and vessels only. The product was assigned (EPA Registration Number 40810&hyph;11). A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of N -cyclopropyl- N '-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine,~~ and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of N -cyclopropyl- N '-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine ~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. This product is conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A). Additional ecological effects data and environmental fate data will be required from end-use formulators for antifoulant boat bottom paints. All data, especially data which is currently held in reserve may be required to be submitted for review. If these conditions are not complied with the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e). Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. ~~~~More detailed information on this registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on ~ N -cyclopropyl- N '-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine.
