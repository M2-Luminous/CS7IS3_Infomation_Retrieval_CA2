Zharinov: "We Have 34 Deputies, We Shall Elect the Rest in the Fall"] [Text] The overall results of the elections to the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies were made public by the chairman of the oblast electoral commission, L.N. Ustinova, on Wednesday at a news conference. She reminded the journalists that 202 candidates had been registered for 49 deputy positions. On 27 March 662,996 voters, or 33.6 percent of those included on the lists, expressed their attitude toward the contenders for the deputy mandate. In the rayons of the oblast 47 percent of the voters voted, and in the cities under oblast jurisdiction (Berdsk, Iskitim, Kuybyshev, Tatarsk, and Barabinsk)--31.6 percent, including Novosibirsk--25.1 percent. The overall number of invalid ballots (incorrectly filled out, damaged, etc.) was 54,697. A total of 69,113 people voted against all the candidates. Where were the elections held and who earned the confidence of the voters? The elections were declared to have been conducted in 34 single-mandate districts. These were mainly rural districts. In 15 districts of Novosibirsk the elections were not held because of low voter turnout. Let us mention these districts: Nos. 22 and 25 (Dzerzhinskiy Rayon), No. 28 (Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon), No. 33 (Kalininskiy Rayon), Nos. 35, 36, and 37 (Kirovskiy Rayon), Nos. 38, 39, 40, 41, and 49 (Leninskiy Rayon), Nos. 42 and 44 (Oktyabrskiy Rayon), and No. 47 (Sovetskiy Rayon). Repeat elections were scheduled for 30 October in these rayons. And so, the new representative power in the oblast is embodied by 34 deputies so far. What is the social, political, and occupational portrait of the new deputy corps? They are mature people who have learned from life's experience. As can be seen from an official questionnaire, they are "up to 55 years of age." Undoubtedly there are young ones as well. But the fact that altogether they are "up to 55" inspires hope and promise. Incidentally, of those who were elected, 11 are former people's deputies of the oblast soviet, which creates continuity in the activity of the representative organ. The elections confirmed the misgivings on the part of political parties and public movements concerning the desire of representatives of executive structures to enter the oblast soviet. Twelve heads of local administrations became deputies (almost one- third of the deputy mandates) and, naturally, they will basically determine the fate of any particular resolution considered by the soviet. Added to them are 10 leaders of industrial and agricultural enterprises who will probably defend departmental interests in the soviet. Among the other deputies, one represents public health and four-- public education, VUZ's [higher educational institutions], and scientific institutions. Notice that there is not a single worker, kolkhoz worker, or construction worker here. Just as there is not a single specialist with a higher legal education or representative of culture or business. This could cause some harm to the composition of the deputy corps, which may not represent the interests of many social groups. Suffice it to say that among the 34 deputies there is only one woman--chief engineer of the Suzunskaya Furniture Factory, V. Usova. There were considerably more of them in the last soviet. And, finally, about the political preferences of the voters. Only three representatives of political parties and movements earned deputy mandates: two (V. Kuznetsov and V. Karpov)--from the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], and one (N. Krasnikov)--from Russia's Choice. It turns out that it makes no difference to the voter whether the candidate is "red" or "white." As long as he is a good person. But still the main thing should be emphasized: Elections to the oblast soviet of deputies did take place. And in keeping with the law on the kray and oblast soviets, the kray and oblast administration: "The soviet shall function if two-thirds of the deputies have been elected to it." We have that number of deputies and they can hold a session at which they will elect a chairman and a deputy, working organs, and commissions. Apparently this will take place in the near future. More detailed information about the results of the voting and the elected deputies will be published in the next few issues of SOVETSKAYA SIBIR.
