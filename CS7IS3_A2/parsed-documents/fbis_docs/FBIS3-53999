We did not build our strategy on others' positions. Therefore, there has not been any change to Hamas' strategy of keeping up the struggle and resistance to occupation. [Al-Imam] How fair would it be to say that your opposition to the PLO leadership overrides your opposition to a political settlement? [Nazzal] Our objection to the ongoing political process was not prompted by our opposition to the PLO. Our differences with the PLO and its leadership are not personal. Our differences are about the approach. We are against the political settlement, given that it is not the right option for our people and that it will lead to the liquidation of our Palestinian case. [Al-Imam] How do you assess the recent alliance struck between Hamas and other Palestinian factions that do not share your negative view of the peace project and the principle of peace with Israel? [Nazzal] The meeting points between the constituent factions of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces may be summed up as follows: We are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord, which we will seek to topple with all possible means. Thus, we have transcended our political differences and concentrated on our common denominators. [Al-Imam] Looking ahead, what do you plan to do next? [Nazzal] For us, the Gaza-Jericho accord was stillborn, and carries the seeds of its demise. The agreement will not survive. We are counting on the political maturity of our Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses. Over time, they will discover that the PLO leadership has made unrealizable promises that will turn out to be a mirage which will not satisfy any thirst. Thirdly, [number as heard] we bet on the resistance option. Hamas, along with the rest of the decent and dedicated Palestinians, will carry on resistance to occupation and give it no security or stability. These are the bets for our cause's foreseeable future. [Al-Imam] Brother Muhammad: In the event of a change in the region's political landscape, and a number of Arab countries invovled in the peace process concluding deals with Israel, how will Hamas react? [Nazzal] We hate to reach the point where other Arab states will sign agreements with Israel. Assuming this did happen, Hamas would still stick to its strategic option of resistance to occupation and dealing it painful blows. This is our strategy and is not subject to change.
