It thereby assumes full responsibility for its future." (Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, candidate president of Kalmykia, March 1993). "No one will send us money and the republic's inhabitants will be in a lamentable state. Consequently, we must abolish the Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia and dual citizenship, proclaim exclusively Russian citizenship, and abide by the Russian Constitution alone in the territory of Kalmykia." (Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, president of Kalmykia, March 1994). The document adopted in place of the abolished Constitution of Kalmykia is called the "Steppe Code." "I Did Not Prepare the Population...." Ilyumzhinov's address to an enlarged session of the republic parliament, when he proposed to abandon the Constitution of Kalmykia, was stunning in its suddenness, as much as in its abolitionist zeal. "I deliberately did not prepare the population," he was to say several days later before a large audience. "I did not even warn my assistants. If you were watching television, you will have seen how the faces of people sitting in the auditorium fell." The president's legislative initiative has tempted people by the noble language in which it is couched: "To help Russia, to extend a helping hand to the Kremlin and to the Russian leadership, and to take a step in the direction of uniting Russia." Until now, there has been no organized opposition in Kalmykia. Now there is. It is a rare example -- perhaps the only example in all Russia -- of political antagonists, communists and members of "Russia's Choice," joining forces. Members of the Agrarian Party, the Republic Party, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the Oyrat-Kalmyk National Movement have cast aside their differences. The Union of War and Labor Veterans and the Union of Students have found a common language. Finally, a public committee to protect the Constitution of Kalmykia and Kalmyk citizenship and statehood has been born. Ilyumzhinov is extremely satisfied with this and has told the whole republic: "This was all planned beforehand.... I have exposed overt and covert enemies and people standing in my way in this process of restructuring and reorganization.... Lists will soon be published, practical conclusions will be drawn in a week, and I shall name names.... I have already dismissed four people. On Saturday, several leaders will write statements of their own accord." The prayer-like introduction of the published draft "Steppe Code" is disturbing: "Throwing ourselves at the feet of the great prelate who now turns the wheel of modern teaching...." Kalmyks account for 45 percent of the republic's population, and only one-quarter of them are believers. Local Christians and Muslims, let alone inveterate atheists, are certainly not obliged to "throw themselves at the feet" of Buddha. The draft invests the president of the republic with dictatorial powers. He may dissolve the People's Hural (parliament) before term if it "does not guarantee stability in society" (what boundless scope for interpretation!); recommend who is to be elected chairman of parliament and his deputy; recommend who is to be appointed head of the Supreme Court and the Court of Arbitration, chairman and deputy chairman of city and rayon courts, and so on and so forth.... "Replacing the Constitution by the proposed normative act will legally consolidate the authoritarian system of government established in the republic, which has consigned to oblivion the principle of separating powers," an extraordinary congress of the people of Kalmykia stated. However, a Constitutional Assembly (by the nature of its tasks, it would, of course, have been more appropriate to call it the Anticonstitutional Assembly) was hastily formed under the strict control of the presidential apparatus. This burial team was knocked together from 300 people: 10 from every rayon, 50 from Elista, 75 from the executive, 25 (the whole of parliament) from the legislature, and 20 from various parties and movements. Kalmyk statehood was ready for "burial" in three weeks. Bidding Farewell to Sovereignty It was "buried" on 5 April, Ilyumzhinov's birthday. Morning pickets outside the parliament building noted the intersection of these occasions with a placard: "The president's birthday should not be the republic's death day!" (Local political folklore was immediately enriched with an oral version along the same lines: "Kirsan did not slaughter a sheep for his birthday -- he slaughtered the Constitution"). The hopeless words fluttered in the wind: "Shame on the gravediggers of Kalmyk statehood!" and "Mr. President, our Constitution is not for sale!" Meanwhile, the crack troops of approval and support were entering the sessions hall. "I mount this rostrum with great excitement and a deep sense of responsibility," a nice woman, a local doctor from the rayon and first in a line of disciplined orators, began reading. "Kirsan Nikolayevich has initiated a new, peaceful revolution in our society...." Passing the baton of approval lasted four hours, plus an interval. A lone dissenter requested the floor, but the assembly unanimously refused his request. So the drafting commission proposed that the document be "adopted as a basis" (one vote against, one abstention), the president made an emotional speech of thanks, and the national anthem was played for some reason, despite the fact that the state no longer existed.... No Sign of a "Second Kuwait" "So you are exchanging sovereignty for federal subsidies?" The president was not at all disconcerted by my question. "What do you mean by exchange? There never was any sovereignty! Not real sovereignty. Only on paper. The republic has always been subsidized." "But a year ago you promised that the republic would live on its own resources. `We plan to build economic relations with Russia on a partnership basis and give up the billions in subsidies.' That is a quote from your election program." "Well, that I do not deny. Everything is being carried out. I still say we shall turn the republic into a single industrial, financial, and investment corporation. People ask: Where are the results? But it takes time for them to show. Only a year has passed since my election." Yes, a year has passed, and there is still no sign of Kalmykia being turned into a "second Kuwait." There is no offshore zone (that is, a zone virtually free of taxation), which, it was triumphantly proclaimed, would take no more than a year to create. Furthermore, one in five families in the republic do not have their own Mercedes as promised. There is none of this. There is an average wage of 36,500 rubles [R]. There is the desperate need of the collective farmer, who receives approximately R6,000 per month, to slaughter his own livestock and "hitchhike" with sheep carcasses along the Stavropol-Elista-Volgograd highway, selling them at R20,000 each -- approximately R1,000 per kilogram. Otherwise he does not have the means with which to buy sugar, salt, candy, and vodka (he gets everything else, apart from manufactured goods, from his own kitchen garden and pastures). Sheep farming and primary wool processing, which account for 80 percent of the republic's total output, have been devastated. The sheep population has fallen from 3.5 million to 1.5 million as a result of disease, theft, and forced slaughter. The catastrophic collapse of the economy and Kalmykia's total dependence on federal subsidies (in 1993 they accounted for 86 percent of budget revenue) are Kirsan Ilyumzhinov's main motives for selling the republic's sovereignty. But there are other reasons to do with politics and the Criminal Code. Request for Forgiveness As head of several dozen private companies, banks, and exchanges in Russia and abroad, the origin of Ilyumzhinov's billions in capital is a subject of natural curiosity -- as yet not fully satisfied beyond a shadow of doubt -- for the media and, basically, for anyone unsure whether this money has been honestly acquired. "The Internal Affairs Ministry and the Security Ministry spent five months investigating my commercial activity," he told me. "They found no criminal. Think about it: If I were involved in some shady business, would I have drawn attention to myself by running for president? I would have sat quiet and kept a low profile. Let them continue investigating: I have nothing to fear." Yes, it is possible that they will investigate further: The top Russian leadership has suddenly begun to take a lively interest in the origin of Ilyumzhinov's capital, although before it seemed totally unconcerned. A letter from Russian Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin to Russian First Deputy Economics Minister Andrey Shapovalyants has appeared in the press. It said that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry has discovered abuses of specially targeted credit worth R14 billion allocated on preferential terms by the Central Bank to the "Steppe" Commercial Bank (Kalmykia) to purchase wool. The document continues: "In order for Ilyumzhinov to profit from the the illegal use of credit resources, the "Steppe" Commercial Bank was set up in the city of Elista, the founders being commercial enterprises headed by him.... Under the guise of purchasing wool, Ilyumzhinov and his closest associates secretly converted money... and subsequently placed it in the accounts of foreign firms, including 2.5 million in the account of a private individual in Poland...." It is unlikely that Ilyumzhinov wants an investigation to be set in motion. Particularly since the president of Kalmykia forfeited the trust of the top Russian leadership with his peacemaking march on the White House to Aleksandr Rutskoy at the height of the October events. Thus the springtime efforts by Ilyumzhinov, hastily surrendering the sovereignty of his republic for use by another power, look like a request for forgiveness. For political sins. And for criminal sins, if the president of Kalmykia really is burdened with such, which no one has the right to say at present, other than the courts. Direct Speech "I will introduce a state of emergency in the republic and simultaneously announce a moratorium on rallies, demonstrations, and strikes. I will terminate the activity of all social movements and organizations and close down many newspapers. I will adopt an edict on disbanding all political parties, popular fronts, and movements." "I propose to introduce an economic dictatorship in Kalmykia." "In order to increase production, I will introduce a six-day working week for the male half of society." "When our standard of living is twice as high as that of other regions of Russia, democracy can run the show." "Kalmykia Needs a Khan" These public statements by Kirsan Ilyumzhinov are so definite and unequivocal that they hardly require any comment. Others, on the contrary, need to be clarified and explained. "I have invited Gaydar to become prime minister of Kalmykia and have received his preliminary consent." (Gaydar has not consented to take up this post, as he made clear in an interview). "We are to conclude agreements with Russia and other CIS countries on dual taxation." (Dual taxation in tandem with the republic's planned transformation into an offshore zone is economic nonsense, as the former cancels out the latter). "On instructions from Gorbachev, I went to the United States in 1990 as part of our delegation to discuss the question of buying grain." (Ilyumzhinov did not take part in this mission and did not have the official powers to do so). "I have been invited to take up the post of ambassador to Japan." (According to information supplied by the Russian Foreign Ministry, Ilyumzhinov has received no such proposal). "I have been nominated as mayor of Moscow." (Ilyumzhinov did not feature on the list of candidates for this post). "The republic's Internal Affairs Ministry will be equipped by France." (According to the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry, this question can only be considered after the appropriate accords have been reached between the Russian and French Governments. The federal Internal Affairs Ministry has no information on possible supplies of French specialist equipment to Kalmykia). These inaccuracies and exaggerations, to put it delicately, and this self-image -- instilled in the local public -- as a statesman renowned throughout Russia and the world are explained by observers in Kalmykia as a symptom of Ilyumzhinov's morbid vanity: "He wants to be first everywhere. He wants to be the person whose name day it is, the bridegroom at the wedding, and the corpse at the funeral." The Constitution Is Up For Sale. But Is Anyone Buying? The political market is like any other market: Demand is formed by supply. But will the center buy the Constitution of Kalmykia and hand over the billions Ilyumzhinov is demanding in return? Experts at the presidential administration's analytical center recommend that the Russian leadership "not make any long-term commitments with regard to giving Kalmykia subsidies and credits from the federal budget, issuing it with export licenses, and generally making concessions; all financial and economic relations with the republic should be arranged on a short-term basis." The Russian president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, was also cautious and restrained in his official statement responding to Ilyumzhinov's initiative: "The Constitution of the Russian Federation allows the status of a component of the Russian Federation to be changed only by the mutual consent of the Federation and the component in question.... The proposal made by K. Ilyumzhinov, as we are to understand from his words, deals precisely with the matter of changing the status of the Republic of Kalmykia. If it is proposed to retain republic status, however, Kalmykia must have its own constitution in accordance with the Constitution of the Russian Federation." Representatives of several Russian republics have spoken out, calling the president of Kalmykia "a traitor and an apostate." In short, Ilyumzhinov's proposal is not yet in broad political demand. He risks finding himself in isolation. Wishing to please everyone at once, he may please no one. The republic will not forgive his treachery (particularly if Moscow does not give subsidies and credits). The Kremlin will not turn a blind eye to his mysterious billions and political vacillation. Then the president of Kalmykia's "world renown," of which he never tires of reminding people, will only be prolonged by his regular visits to the Bulgarian prophetess Vanga and by his embraces with the Dalai Lama.
