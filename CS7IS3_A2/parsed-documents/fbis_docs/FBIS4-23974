In a communique published by the radical opposition media, UDPS said the humanitarian reasons put forward by France are "a mere pretext." "In reality," the communique said, "the French, after realizing that their protege, the late President Habyarimana's militia, which was armed and trained by them, is losing ground, are shamelessly preparing to give them a hand in order to recapture lost ground and to counterattack the democratic forces which are progressing in central Africa." The UDPS added that France is supporting "dictatorships in Africa," and declared that it will hold responsible "before history, any Zairian who helps in undertaking any act of aggression against Rwanda from Zairian territory." The UDPS concluded by saying that any French intervention in Rwanda outside the United Nations "would constitute a deliberate provocation against the progressive and democratic forces of central Africa."
