Scalfaro, looking ahead to the opening of the twelfth legislature of the republic, declared, "I think this Parliament has the right to work with tranquillity, to do well and do much." The people of Italy "expect much" of the new houses he said and went on to name the weighty issues of institutional reform, the battle against unemployment and monetary policy. The head of state said he felt it his duty to now break the silence he had kept during the campaign to speak out with "a truly great word of admiration for the Italian people who have", he said, given "great democratic testimony to themselves, to Europe, to the world." After referring to the new electoral law and the string of business and political corruption scandals which decimated the ruling political parties over the past two years, since the general election of April 1992, Scalfaro noted that the crucial Sunday [27 March] and Monday vote also marked "the exit from the scene of a series of figures even of the foremost rank, the birth of new and recent movements." All this, he added, "certainly represented a stage of great significance after that of the referendum, another stage of great importance," with reference to the national vote of April last year which forced the change in the electoral law. Driving home his main point, the head of state reiterated, "There is need for stability, for great solidarity" and said he himself, above the fray, could hope for the commitment of the new Parliament "to one thing: the interest of this, our Italy." On the institutional steps ahead of the inaugural session of the new Parliament, set for April 15, Cabinet Undersecretary Antonio Maccanico told newsmen that, the government led by Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in office since the end of April last year, will remain in office until a new administration is formed. "Before the new houses are convened, the cabinet will meet to consider law decrees requiring government mandates connected to the budget. These decrees will, obviously, be examined by the new Parliament," he added. On what is in the wings, Democratic Party of the Left leader Achille Occhetto declared, "The vote was clear, it gave the majority to the right. According to me, the president must give the mandate to the one mainly responsible for the right-wing front, that is, Berlusconi." Interviewed on the news program on the public radio and television corporation's third channel, the head of the party around which the Progressive Coalition battled against the Berlusconi's Freedom Front added, "Then we'll see whether Berlusconi is able to form a government on the platform and the plan of relations with his allies. If he's not able, we'll see later on." Occhetto went on to speak of the need now for unity and said, "The Democratic Party of the Left had a splendid result and is at the service of all in this direction, for the expansion of all the others." Moving over to another RAI interview, the party leader said the right is self-sufficient and should be able to stand on its own and promised "a severe, clear and precise opposition" from the left benches and work for "the creation of conditions for an alternative government." On the failure of the Progressives to top the right at the polls, Occhetto said, "I'm not blaming myself too much. We faced the general election in the same way we faced the administrative vote. There was an element of surprise. The speedy organization achieved with all the company instruments of the new political component acted as a glue for two different right-wings. This effect went beyond our expectations," he added. A key factor in the staying in power of Berlusconi's Freedom Front, the outspoken Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, applied a farming metaphor in saying issues were now on "shifting soil" whereas his League is the only force which is "compact enough within" to work for change. The man who sounded a sour note in the midst of victory hurrahs on the right last night, in saying he did not want to see Berlusconi in the premier's office and would never align the League in government with the neo-Fascist "lynch mob," said today that his alignment is the only one capable of "giving the country a government." Speaking in his stronghold in Milan, Bossi declared, "An enormous political responsibility has been laid on the shoulders of the League. We have to form a government and the only political force which is the elite in government at this time is the League. Now we are going to deal. We will take the first steps already in the upcoming 24 hours," added Berlusconi's ally in the north. He also warned, "If the press pushes for government formation, we have the duty to go forward with feet of lead because we are on shifting soil" and, he added, "if someone goes on a shopping trip in the League, I remind him we are compact and monolithic." On the right, Giancarlo Fini, who steered his neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] out of a political cul-de-sac to become the National Alliance in league with Berlusconi, spoke of the need for detente with Bossi in telling a press conference of his two conditions for reaching a government-forming understanding "based on documents and not on ideological slogans." First, said Fini, is "the impossibility" of a League member to become premier "because the League is an expression of a geographic area and not the entire nation." Second is that the mandate go to Berlusconi, "at least in the initial phase." Questioned on his "intellectual differences" with the League leader, Fini quipped, "Never use the adjective 'intellectual' with reference to Bossi."
