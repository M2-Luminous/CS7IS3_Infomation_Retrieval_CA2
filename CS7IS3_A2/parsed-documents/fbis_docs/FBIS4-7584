The National Committee accepted the party's Gypsy policy guidelines in 1992 and this has now been built into the current program. They stress the need to address the Gypsy population because, in their view, this community, the largest among the national minorities, is in the most difficult situation in the currently changing world. MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi said that their program contains short and long term crisis management. In the short term, they want to solve the problem of Gypsy unemployment. The MDF considers it important to have the traditional Gypsy handicrafts restored. In their view, in the long term, the problems of the Gypsy population will be solved through organizing their education. Hungary's first Gypsy middle school established by the Ghandi foundation is a good example of this. He called it unfortunate that the leaders of the national minorities enter the elections on party lists because, when they get into Parliament, they will have to fulfill the expectations of the party, then the parliamentary group, and they will only be able to represent their own national minority in third place. Two Gypsies are on the MDF's national list: Jozsef Raduly, the leader of a 100- member Gypsy orchestra, is in 48th place, and he is followed in 49th place by Florian Farkas, leader of the Lungo Drom Gypsy organization. Alliance of Free Democrats -- Not According to the Principle of Reciprocity The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] emphasizes that the national minority issue cannot be made part of the election campaign, parliamentary deputy Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said. He added that this applies both to the minorities living in and outside Hungary. Szent-Ivanyi believes that the rights of domestic minorities have to be guaranteed with agreements based on a broad consensus, and their parliamentary representation, which has not yet been resolved, also has to be ensured. In the SZDSZ's view, a mouthpiece organization for the national minorities would be set up by the domestic minorities forming a society that would delegate an ombudsman to Parliament every year from a different group, thus creating a rotation system. A separate chapter deals with the issue of the national minorities in the SZDSZ's election program: Their main principle is that the situation of the domestic minorities cannot be made dependent on the situation of Hungarians living beyond the borders. The principle of reciprocity does not apply in this case. The state is obliged to ensure the rights of national minorities: The program recommends practical solutions to preserving the identity, and to ensuring education and the use of the native language. The party will prepare to amend the national minority law at all points where it has not lived up to expectations and they also intend to place the national minority financing system on new bases. The Free Democrats [SZDSZ] have not consciously made an effort to have national minority representatives but it is no accident that there are many among them -- for example Antonia Haga, Boleszlav Pelcsinszki, Ferenc Wekler, and Tamas Freund -- because, owing to the SZDSZ's attitude, these people enjoy working in this party. Hungarian Socialist Party -- Violation of the Constitution? According to the Socialists [MSZP], the parliamentary representation of the national minorities has to be resolved, parliamentary deputy Csaba Tabajdi said. Unfortunately, the Constitution has been violated in relation to the national minorities in the past four years. If we become the government, we will immediately start inter-party talks on solving this issue. The current situation can be remedied either through by-elections or when local elections are held. The national minority law is a means, rather than a goal, for us: A change should take place in the life of the national minorities, for example, in education. An overall government program is needed to achieve this. We have to set up the two 500 million forint funds in the budget as prescribed by the law, and this has to be provided for two years. The MSZP's program also includes legal measures against negative discrimination, and its justification lies in the fact that some statements have been made and acts have been committed to offend ethnic groups and national minority members in recent months. Action against discrimination is not laid down adequately in the Hungarian legal system. Replying to whether the MSZP has any deputies belonging to national minorities, Tabajdi said that the Gypsy Tamas Peli and the ethnic Slovak Mrs. Robert Jakab are on the party's list. As for an ombudsman, Tabajdi said that it does not substitute for the parliamentary representation of national minorities, which is their right as citizens, because an ombudsman for national minorities can mainly remedy legal violations, while the parliamentary deputies can initiate the prevention of legal violations or can participate in the fight against discrimination. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] -- Strong Representation Needed in the Local Governments The KDNP's program has a separate chapter on the national minorities. According to Gyorgy Holvegyi, the KDNP's national minority expert, it is most important to strengthen the national minorities' sense of self-identity because this is the only way that they will be able to have representation in proportion to their size. Regardless of their size, the national minorities are due extra rights. The Christian Democrats emphasize that the national minority representations have to develop from the local self- governments to the highest level because this is the only way that their true level of organization and inner strength can be seen. In their view, the now frequent questioning of the legitimacy of the national minority federations can be avoided in this way. With the KDNP's deputy candidates, one's ethnic origin is not indicated but, for example, a number of ethnic German deputies are running in Baranya county in southern Transdanubia, who have established rather good relations with the organizations of Germany's Christian Democratic Union and the Austrian People's Party. They are expecting several visits from these sister parties during the campaign; however, on the basis of the electoral law, foreigners are always reminded that direct campaigning is not allowed.
