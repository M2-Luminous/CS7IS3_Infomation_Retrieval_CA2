Pinilla at the Council of State offices in Santa Fe de Bogota on 18 January; from the "National" newscast -- live or recorded] [Text] [Pinilla] Your attention, please. The Council of State has just asked the government for an explanation regarding the overflight of foreign aircraft and the presence of U.S. troops in our country. Mr. Amado Gutierrez, president of the Council of State, what have you requested of the president? [Gutierrez] The petition, which was approved unanimously during a plenary Council meeting, requests the president to inform us about the legal conditions under which he granted authorization for several military aircraft to overfly the city of Barranquilla and for foreign troops to remain in several areas of the country. [Pinilla] Why has the Council of State made such a request? [Gutierrez] The Council of State made the request because the Constitution expressly states that while the Senate is in recess, the movement of foreign troops may only be authorized by the president, with prior approval by the Council of State. [Pinilla] Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Amado Gutierrez, new president of the Council of State.
