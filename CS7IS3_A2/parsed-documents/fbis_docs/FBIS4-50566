Party and government leaders and civil affairs workers gathered together to discuss plans for reforming and developing civil affairs work. These discussions will play an active role in reforming, developing, and promoting social stability. We warmly congratulate the convocation of the conference. Civil affairs is a key work area for the party and government. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, civil affairs departments at all levels, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and led by the party and government, have revolved closely around economic construction and have self- consciously linked civil affairs work closely with the country's economic development and social stability, taken the job of ensuring the well-being of the daily lives of people -- the target of civil affairs work -- as a mission basic to the maintenance of social stability, upheld reforms, worked in a down-to-earth manner, and played a key role in creating a stable, unified, democratic, and harmonious social environment beneficial to socialist modernization. Reform has injected vitality into civil affairs work. Reform in disaster relief management and the unfolding of social old-age insurance in rural areas has promoted the development of social security in rural areas. Flourishing community services have brought a new outlook for urban social welfare services, and the activity of competing for the creation of "two-support" model towns (counties) has opened a new dimension in welfare work to provide preferential treatment, pensions, and home placements. Civil affairs work has scored various long-term achievements and is vibrant and flourishing. The Central Committee has stressed that seizing opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability is the overall framework for party and government work. Civil affairs work is a key integral part of government work. We must resolutely obey and serve this overall framework, fully exercise the functions of civil affairs departments, and satisfactorily pursue rescue and relief work, social welfare, the work of providing preferential treatment, pensions, and home placement, the construction of grass-roots political power and mass self-rule organizations, rural social old-age insurance, and social welfare and social management work, such as that concerning community bodies, marriages, child adoption, and funerals. The main responsibility of civil affairs work is to safeguard and protect, with state-given powers and according to the law, the people's basic living rights and interests. It represents a basic demand of socialism and shows the superiority of the socialist system. Civil affairs work concerns thousands of households and is connected with people's lives, intimately related to various socialist modernization projects, and strongly social in character. It involves mass participation. Civil affairs work departments must understand and study new situations emerging under the socialist market economy system, sum up new experiences, and solve new problems. Party committees and governments at all levels must strengthen leadership and put it high on their agenda. Concerned departments must care about and support civil affairs work and mobilize forces in various social sectors in a joint effort at civil affairs work. Its missions are arduous and responsibility great. We are convinced that guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress, and led by the party Central Committee and the State Council, civil affairs work will score greater achievements and make new contributions toward maintaining social stability and promoting socialist material and spiritual civilizations.
