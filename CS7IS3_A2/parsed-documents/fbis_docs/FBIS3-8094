Markiewicz learned of his dismissal at 1345 yesterday [1 March], one hour after a news conference at which he had publicly signed a document awarding PolSat Television a license to operate a nationwide television channel. Loss of the chairmanship of this Broadcasting Council does not mean loss of membership thereof, and Markiewicz is still a member. His duties, however, have been taken over by the hitherto deputy chairman, Maciej Ilowiecki. Ilowiecki was angry when he heard the news about Markiewicz. "That just shows how democracy works in this country," he said. "The president had no right to dismiss the chairman. That can only be done jointly by the Sejm, the Senate, and the president, and only if the president rejects a report by the Council or the chairman breaks the law on broadcasting. Therefore, I await evidence of such an offense." Andrzej Drzycimski, the presidential spokesman, said that the decision to recall Markiewicz was dictated by the fact that "Markiewicz had failed to observe the provisions of the law on radio and television broadcasting." According to Drzycimski, the Council wanted to grant PolSat a broadcasting monopoly. "Among the evidence of this is that PolSat was to be awarded a license to operate a nationwide channel and satellite channels at the same time, and was to be allocated regional frequencies," Drzycimski wrote in a communique. Drzycimski claims that Markiewicz's plan to merge local stations into larger networks is also a violation of the broadcasting law. Drzycimski did not mention PolSat by name but referred to all of the stations owned by Zygmunt Solorz, owner of PolSat. The president has already criticized the Broadcasting Council several times for granting PolSat a nationwide television license. Drzycimski's communique also mentions the controversial issue of documents on the subject of the companies that were competing for broadcasting licenses. The State Protection Office [UOP] is said to have conveyed these documents to Markiewicz before he made his final choice as to who would be awarded the broadcasting license. Drzycimski also claimed that Markiewicz was in the possession of material on the subject of some of the broadcasting license applicants that "gives reason to believe that there is a possible danger to state security." During the news conference, Markiewicz said that the UOP material contained virtually nothing that could disqualify Solorz in the eyes of the Broadcasting Council. He said there was certainly nothing on Solarz in the papers he received from the prime minister before the final choice was made, and nothing in the unofficial material he received from a high-ranking UOP official almost at the very last moment. "This unofficial material, which was not even signed, contained observations that discredited four applicants for the broadcasting license, but Solorz was not one of them. There was some speculation about Solorz. That is all," said Markiewicz. In the opinion of UOP spokesman Irena Popoff, from all of the documents he had received, Markiewicz could not have known any more about the applicants than the president and the prime minister. According to the prime minister's press secretary, Ewa Wachowicz, the UOP material supplied to the prime minister did not question PolSat's eligibility to apply for the broadcasting license. Markiewicz admitted that, on the day the license was awarded, he had held a bitter conversation with the president. Lech Walesa had accused him of accepting a bribe from Solarz. "As a Solidarity member, I find that accusation scandalous," said Markiewicz. On Tuesday [1 March], at 1500 hours, the Broadcasting Council, already informed of Markiewicz's demise, presented, in the presence of journalists, PolSat representatives with PolSat's broadcasting license. The license was signed by Markiewicz and by the Council's deputy chairman, Maciej Ilowiecki. Asked to comment on Lech Walesa's negative decision concerning him, Markiewicz said: "As a member of the Broadcasting Council, I am not at liberty to comment on decisions by the head of state. I received news of this decision at 1345, and I acknowledged it, which does not mean that I immediately began to study the broadcasting law. The law says that the president appoints the chairman of the Council but does not say who dismisses him." Andrzej Zarebski, secretary to the Council, said that the Council has resolved unanimously to petition the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Tribunal, and the Sejm to investigate whether the president has the right to dismiss the chairman of the Broadcasting Council. According to Professor Stanislaw Piatek, a media expert, the broadcasting law fails to define the precise manner in which the chairman of the Broadcasting Council is dismissed.
