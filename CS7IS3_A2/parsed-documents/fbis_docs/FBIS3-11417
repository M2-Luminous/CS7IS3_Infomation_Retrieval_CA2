This account led to the conclusion that a gigantic and fruitful effort had been made, which shows that the capabilities and combat readiness of our Armed Forces have been strengthened. Another important point analyzed was the FAR's [Revolutionary Armed Forces] agricultural-livestock activity toward the goal of supplying all the troops with food; a 30-percent increase toward achieving this objective is expected this year. During the Minfar's expanded military council, on the occasion of his 50th anniversary as a combat pilot, Enrique Carrera [last name as heard], hero of the Republic of Cuba, was promoted to the rank of division general.
