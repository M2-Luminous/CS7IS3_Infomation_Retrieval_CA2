I thank you for the courage and civicmindedness that you displayed in the first round of presidential elections, having given me over 45 percent of your votes. Notwithstanding systematic provocations and a stiff embargo on information, my team and I have felt your constant support. After 23 June, the distribution of forces in the political arena has fundamentally changed, since you not simply voted for the first president, but actually passed a vote of no confidence in the policy of the current Belarusian Government and local bureaucratic authorities. It is a turning point in the development of our society on the path toward democracy. I am sure that we will complete our task. There are only a few days left, and you will acquire the power which you want, in which you have believed, and which will not cheat you. I believe that the second round of voting will confirm your will. I appeal to all who voted for other candidates in the first round to determine -- with whom do you stand? Are you defending the old corrupt authority, which has lost touch with the people, or are you supporting a resolute renovation of our state? I appeal to you to go jointly on the path of honesty for the good of every one of you, my dear compatriots. I am sure that together we can preserve the peace and civic accord during these difficult times, and these will become a guarantee of Belarus' future flourishing.
