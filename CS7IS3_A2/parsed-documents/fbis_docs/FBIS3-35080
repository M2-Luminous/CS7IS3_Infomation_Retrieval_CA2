He blamed Syria and Lebanon on the grounds that Syria controls most of Lebanon and that all the activities of Hizballah and other organizations are carried out under its supervision, as he put it. Black September broke away from the Fatah Movement after the signing of the Oslo accord in September. It is led by Colonel Munir Maqdah, who is currently in Lebanon. In contacts with MBC this evening, a Syrian source rejected Israel's charge that Damascus is responsible for firing the Katyusha rocket at the Galilee. He emphasized that it is not Syria's task to guarantee protection for Israel.
