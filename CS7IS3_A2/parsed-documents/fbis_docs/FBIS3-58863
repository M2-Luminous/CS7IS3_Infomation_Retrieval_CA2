We want to play a leading role, too, with our own style and standards, and a loyalty to our origins." The People's Party had been in existence for a couple of hours -- from 1610 [1510 GMT] on 18 January 1994, to be precise, 75 years after don Sturzo's appeal "to free and strong men." Mino Martinazzoli, speaking softly, with head bowed, as though looking within himself, but without foregoing his recherche vocabulary, explained to the small group of guests -- the most prominent of whom were the speakers of the Senate and the lower house, Spadolini and Napolitano -- that the new PPI [Italian People's Party] is the sole heir to don Sturzo and De Gasperi and therefore to the DC [Christian Democratic Party], which no longer exists, as of yesterday afternoon. Proud and stubborn to the point of standing alone at a time when those who remain alone are in danger of disappearing from the political map, Martinazzoli supported his challenge with an argument that it will be up to the voters to either approve or disapprove: "Our ideas," he said, "are still fresh and current." Martinazzoli can see trouble on the political horizon. He described a scenario "laden more with cynicism than with civility, full of masks and disguises." A time when there is "a split between ordinary society, the parties, and the state, the consequent threat looms of a political vacuum, and of the decay of our moral unity." In this grim scenario, Martinazzoli threw down a challenge. This, without concealing the fact that "we do not have many chances of being reborn; we have only one." The PPI presents itself as a center party, "in line with a lofty philosophy of moderation, which is anything but moderatism, neutrality, or a conservative spirit." This citing of "moderation" embodied all Martinazzoli's antipathy for politics understood as a contest between a right and a left. "We," the People's Party leader proclaimed, "reject the logic of blocs, the radicalization of the contest, or the short-cut method of the face-lift. Since we reject the idea of the closed party, we therefore deny that this rationale can be transferred now to a broader but equally rigid ideological juxtaposition or to an artificial contest between cartels labeled in accordance with some vacuous mannerism. We are seeking, rather, points of contact consistent with our own identity and proposals, within the context of the liberal and democratic tradition." In fact, the meeting with [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni took place a while ago, and there will be no more before the elections -- no accord with the League, no understanding with Berlusconi, nor, still less, with the band of neocentrists who formed another party only a matter of hours earlier. The PPI will face the test of the elections supported only by its alliance with Segni, because what the League offered "was more of a death notice than an alliance." Martinazzoli met with [League ideologue] Maroni, because "I wanted to know what form this alliance would take in the electoral context. The answer was that in Lombardy the League would keep all the votes that they already have and would field their own candidates in every constituency. It was said -- with something of a smile, to tell the truth -- that the alliance would be on these terms: the League in the North and the DC in the South. That seemed to me like a death notice." Therefore "it is necessary to acknowledge the impossibility of a dialogue with the League. The offer of an alliance that it is making would be tantamount -- no more, no less -- to accepting the PPI's disappearance in the North, and that is unacceptable." But Segni is about to meet with Maroni. Is the pact with Martinazzoli already facing some danger? The People's Party leader clarified one thing right away: "The rules that apply to us in our relations with the other political groupings also apply to the rationale behind our relations with Segni." This was an explicit warning: If Segni forges agreements with the League, the agreement with Martinazzoli will be broken. Having closed the door to the right, is Martinazzoli perhaps thinking about opening negotiations with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], maybe after the elections, with a view to forming a government? He was very reserved on this subject. "It is clear," Martinazzoli replied, "that there is no possibility of an alliance with an interlocutor that is itself building another alliance. If I read the situation correctly, they are sending me messages via the newspaper headlines, while inviting the others to negotiations. That is a very different matter. In any case, I would have declined an invitation, because I do not believe that our role is to accede to one side or the other, as though we were some insignificant entity." But what will the PPI do after the elections? " We do not know what kind of parliament we will have after the elections. What we do afterward will depend on how much strength the voters grant us in a situation in which I no longer enjoy any consensus from before. We are contesting the elections for the first time, and we shall see what our dimensions and our strength prove to be. On that basis we will determine our political and parliamentary orientations." The electoral verdict will say whether Martinazzoli has won or lost his gamble, and will also say how many votes [neocentrists] Casini and Mastella have taken away from him. For the present, there were only a few words for the newly departed neocentrists: "Farewells, which are themselves painful, do not need to be combined with rebukes and criticisms. This will be my attitude, which will also be a wait-and-see attitude." He will wait and see, but "if they have left because they do not want to do what we are doing, I would like to know how I could have them back immediately afterward." Be that as it may, Martinazzoli will not contest the elections himself, because he has decided not to stand for reelection and will remain as People's Party leader "certainly not beyond the first congress." According to Martinazzoli, it is indeed "a contradiction in terms, in a parliamentary democracy, for a party secretary not to be a member of parliament." The congress will be held after the elections: "The imminence of the elections, which have implications for us regarding our very existence, does not permit us to hold a congress right away. We will do so immediately afterward." The PPI is newly born. As De Mita left, he was asked if it was a good day for him, too. After a moment's thought, he replied: "Yes." Then, after a further pause, he smiled, and added: "I thought about it before saying so."
