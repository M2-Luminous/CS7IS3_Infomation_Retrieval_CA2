At a CDU election campaign rally in Brandenburg, Kohl said that his prediction of five years [for the eastern laender to catch up with the west] could perhaps stretch to "seven or eight, but basically I have not been mistaken." At the same time the chancellor called for more tolerance between west and east Germans, since the people in the two parts of Germany had gone through different developments in the past 40 years. In his speech, which was disrupted repeatedly by applause and whistling, Kohl said that safeguarding peace and freedom and fighting mass unemployment were the most important objectives of European unification. Kohl also called for joint European efforts to solve the asylum problem and combat international crime. [passage omitted]
