For about two decades the world financial markets were liberalized and deregulated. Banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms were able to extend the limits of their activities further and further. But in the interim, supervisory bodies and governments have grown increasingly worried. They are afraid that the world financial system may have become crisis-prone. The concerns focus on the market for new speculative financial instruments known as derivatives. Like a bolt out of the blue the U.S. General Acccounting Office [GAO] issued a set of demands last week which ran into the opposition of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC], however. Still, the examiners who are looking into futures, swaps, and options at the request of several Congressional committees are now pressing for wide-ranging new regulations and taking aim at the heart of the financial innovations of the eighties in the process. [passage omitted] The Americans are not so much worried about the explosion of the derivatives trade, as such, as about the fact that 90 percent of that trade is concentrated on just seven banks and five brokerage firms. "If one of these large dealers goes bankrupt," the GAO noted, "it could endanger other firms, including those which are part of the U.S. deposit insurance system and, ultimately, the financial system as a whole." In view of the fact that the American taxpayer has already had to come up with several hundred billion dollars to pay for the collapse of the savings and loan industry, the GAO report went on to say, the government may be threatened with yet another drain on its resources in case of a derivatives crisis. The Bundesbank has similar concerns. It is not opposed to the new instruments in principle but it would like to "keep the risks involved in these trades from becoming a matter for the government to deal with," says Edgar Meister, who heads the Bundesbank's division of banks and regulatory activities. What Meister is saying is that the Bundesbank would be forced to prop up the financial system by pumping in large sums of money in the event of a major derivatives crisis. As part of the fifth amendment to the German credit industry law, which is presently being considered, the Bundesbank wants the banks to report their derivatives risks and their contract partners to the Bundesbank from now on just as they report normal major credits. This would provide the Bundesbank with information on the magnitude of the risks incurred by individual banks and on what firms are involved to what extent in the new market. The boom, at any rate, is quite formidable. At present, there are derivatives with a face value of 3,579 billion German marks [DM] in circulation. According to banking industry estimates this represents credit risks amounting to DM115 billion. Up to now, the Association of German Banks has been firmly opposed to the expanded reporting requirement because it is afraid that this will lead to increased costs for its member institutions. For some time now German credit institutions and insurance companies have had to maintain certain reserves against the possibility that their contract partners fail to meet their obligations. From now on the actual market risks are going to have to be secured with the banks' own capital. In other words, the banks will have to protect themselves better against the worst case scenario of derivatives becoming worthless. This really amounts to a blow at the banks' very resources. "For us it would be the worst case scenario," the director of a major bank says, "if the security deposits would make our derivatives business too expensive." The banks not only make a profit on their own speculation with swaps, futures, and options, but, above all, by trading these instruments. Such trades are attractive because the spread between the purchase and selling price is four to eight times as large as in the case of traditional securities. But if they would now have to put more of their own capital on the line, their profits would melt away. This is why the banks would prefer to calculate risk according to their own concepts, but the Bundesbank's Meister is firmly opposed to such an approach. "In the absence of minimal standards," he says, "we would reach a point where the banks would all be protected in completely different ways." The experts of the Basel Bank for International Settlements, the parent organization of all the large national banks, agree. The GAO report provides greater impetus to these efforts. "The United States should continue to play a leading role in the efforts aimed at harmonizing the international regulation of financial activities, including derivatives," the report emphatically states. The GAO categorically states that all those who deal in futures and options must have adequate capital resources to cover their activities and calls on the U.S. Congress to make this part of a new and rigid regulatory code. Congress should make dealers who have operated without any restrictions up to now accountable to the SEC, which is considered to be particularly strict. American derivatives traders have reacted to this demand with cries of outrage. The GAO also calls for uniform accounting rules for derivatives and a far-reaching requirement to provide information on contract partners, outstanding amounts and profits from derivatives. In addition, not only derivatives traders but end consumers of derivatives should be required to establish an airtight internal control and reporting system. Both the Bundesbank and the Berlin Credit Supervision Authority agree with a good many of these ideas. A joint task force is already trying to work out the exact requirements for the banks' internal control systems. The major German banking institutions themselves do agree that the traders should be under the internal control of individuals who operate on a functionally separate basis from them. One of the financial experts in the ministry of finance disagrees. "For that kind of job," he says, "you need people who are just as good as the derivatives traders themselves--but they would earn only one-half as much money." London derivatives dealers earn more than DM300,000 a year; those in Frankfurt earn a little less. Their exceptional knowledge of mathematics and statistics are well remunerated. The banks mollify the controllers by saying that the trade volume in the billions only represents nominal amounts while a mere three or four percent of the total is really at risk and most of that is secured by reciprocal deals. "By and large," says Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, director of the treasury division of Deutsche Bank, "we are playing a zero-sum game." In other words: contracts which are targeted to take advantage of rising stock prices are secured by contrasting deals. To be sure, it is often impossible to strike such a balance. And it is also unclear to what an extent those involved really do pursue such a defensive strategy. At any rate, it cannot overcome another problem. "Banks know their own partners but not their partners' partners because those are not subject to control in view of the fact that they are not banks themselves," says Axel Bertuch-Samuels of the Association of German Savings Banks. This can lead to unpleasant surprises, as in the case of the Metallgesellschaft. Nor would one have thought that Procter and Gamble, the conservative detergent manufacturer, would squander $100 million on diff swaps. Such losses do not push the world financial system to the brink of collapse, of course. But if a major bad speculation creates problems for a major banking institution the resulting crisis might quickly spread. Which is why the overseers are more than ever resolved to act. The heads of the national banks of the 10 largest industrial nations have been asked to work out proposals for reregulation to submit to the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank this fall.
