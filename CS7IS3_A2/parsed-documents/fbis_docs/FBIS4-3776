In an extraordinary anti-Patten outburst in the House of Commons, Labour MP Andrew Faulds challenged House of Commons leader Tony Newton to arrange a debate on Hong Kong. Mr Faulds said it was needed to "comment on the misguided and damaging conduct of the Governor of Hong Kong, and to examine the latest report on China from the Foreign Affairs Committee which is full of lunacies and produced by a committee of ignoramuses". But Mr Newton rejected the request. Then, during a recent visit to Beijing as part of a British trade delegation, Manchester MP Ken Eastham told Chinese officials: "Mr Patten, who was rejected by voters in Bath and imposed on Hong Kong by the (British) Government, is a fine one to talk about democracy. "Why was there no talk about democracy during the past decade when Britain was in charge?" The trip was organised by Chinese Consul- General in Manchester Xiao Houde as part of a concerted campaign to undermine support for Mr Patten among members of the Labour Party. Both parliamentarians have been privately disowned by their party leaders but other Labour MPs say they only reflected what many of their colleagues privately believe. Meanwhile, Mr Patten is finally cutting his links with the city of Bath, which he represented for 13 years until losing his seat in the 1992 general election. He has put his four-bedroom home up for sale with an estate agent for 135,000 (HK$1.53 million).
