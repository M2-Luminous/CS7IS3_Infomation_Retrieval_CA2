Interior Affairs spokesman Burkhard Hirsch said in Bonn it was an "unworthy situation" that, because of financial differences between the Federal Government and the land governments, these people are not given the status promised to them by law and thus the right of temporary residence. The respective provision in the Foreigners' Law was not applied, because granting residence permission required agreement between the Federal Government and the land governments. The "miserable" fate of many refugees hardly appeared to play a role. This led to civil war refugees such as the Kosovo Albanians being deported back to be doomed. The parliamentary initiative Hirsch announced to solve the problem is backed by Federal Commissioner for Foreigners Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen (FDP). Deputy Ulrich Irmer and Federal Executive Board member Guido Westerwelle also joined the initiative. Irmer said the treatment of civil war refugees in Germany also caused foreign-political harm, because words did not match deeds, and this burdened Germany's credibility. Hirsch said that according to the German law, civil war refugees are not entitled to asylum. However, since these people were not given the special status promised, they often applied for an asylum procedure without any chance of success. Therefore, they could also be deported. In addition, it also meant that people who worked and had a place to stay burdened the public welfare system against their will. According to the FDP politician, the conflict between the Federal Government and the land governments over the distribution of costs and quotas prevents the granting of special status under Section 32a of the Foreigners' Law. Hirsch demanded that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl now meet with the minister presidents. For example, the untenable situation led to the deportation of young Kosovo Albanians who had escaped military service in the Serbian Army, said Hirsch, Irmer, and Westerwelle. It was known that in the Serbian Army, they were mistreated, often tortured, and picked for extremely dangerous missions. The German deportation practice was not only profoundly inhuman, but also contradicted the spirit of the arms embargo against Serbia, because Germany even supplied the Serbian aggressors with soldiers. Hirsch said the federal interior minister had failed to renew a halt to extradition, with the argument that there was no agreement among the federal laender. This was intolerable, since no information had been given as to which countries pursued the extradition of refugees. The interpretation of the legal provisions contradicted their spirit, said Hirsch.
