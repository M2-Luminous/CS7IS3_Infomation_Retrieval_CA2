Paydar: "The Karabakh Crisis and the Need for Vigilance"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis is wrapped in ambiguity. Iran, which has always been involved in the Karabakh crisis and has exerted many efforts to find a solution to the war, has unfortunately remained silent on the outcome of the Bishkek conference and on the possible dispatch of military forces to the region. Unfortunately none of the sides--the Russians, the Azeris, and the Armenians--were ready to grant Tehran a role in the recent talks and they treated Iran more marginally than was apparent. At any rate, a country should know its own limits and how it can influence those around it. It is not logical for our country's political cadre and Foreign Ministry officials to be satisfied merely with some remarks by an Azeri or Armenian official on the importance of Iran's role in the region while being excluded from the scene with no hurt feelings. A new situation is in the making in the Caucasus region, and the geopolitical situation of the region will soon undergo more changes. Our diplomats' silence will not solve any problems. What is the use of assessing a situation after it is over? This call for vigilance is being issued today. We hope that the nation's officials will be more responsible in dealing with press reaction on political issues.
