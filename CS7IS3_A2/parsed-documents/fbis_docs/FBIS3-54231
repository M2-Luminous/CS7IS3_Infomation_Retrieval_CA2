An interim report submitted by the committee deals with the area that was to be included in the greater Jerusalem area by the national unity government in 1987 -- from Bet El in the north, Hebron in the south, Mitzpe Yeriho in the east, and Bet Shemesh in the west. The report states that "Jerusalem will wither" unless large areas within the greater Jerusalem area are treated as areas set aside for the city's expansion. The classified report was submitted two days ago to Mayor Ehud Olmert and three of his aides -- Uri Lupoliansky, Me'ir Porush, and Shmu'el Me'ir -- who are in charge of planning and construction at the Jerusalem Municipality. According to the committee's figures, 1.125 million people -- 55 percent of them Jews and 45 percent Arabs -- currently reside in the greater Jerusalem area. Some 47 percent of the greater Jerusalem area residents -- 72 percent of them Jews and 28 percent Arabs -- live in Jerusalem proper. The committee assesses that by 2010, the weight of the Arab population in Jerusalem itself will grow to 31 percent, with 69 percent Jews. According to the report, 48 percent of the greater Jerusalem area population -- 90 percent of them Arabs and 10 percent Jews -- lives outside Jerusalem proper today. An additional 5 percent of the population resides in "the rest of the district," mainly in the western part of the greater Jerusalem area. In one of the working papers submitted to the directors general committee on Jerusalem in the last few years, it was stated that "it will be necessary to operate in the greater Jerusalem area -- within the city's municipal borders and beyond them -- on the basis of two different sets of laws. At the same time, it will be impossible to act toward maintaining a demographic balance and to expand construction within Jerusalem's municipal area without implementing compatible, albeit different, moves across the Green Line." The interim report submitted by the committee outlines such moves. One of the experts involved in the Greater Jerusalem area planning work has said that what is involved here is a de facto annexation of the area surrounding the city, even if this is camouflaged in various formulations. According to the expert, the obvious intention is to award the Jerusalem area a special status within the framework of any possible future arrangement on the West Bank. Even if this area will not be under the jurisdiction of Israeli law, it will have a clear, practical link to Jerusalem. In order to attain this objective, the committee recommends expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of Jerusalem; linking it territorially to Pisgat Ze'ev; linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the Ramot neighborhood; and expanding the 'Etzyon Bloc toward Betar and the 'Adulam region. The committee recommends that road No. 45 from Modi'in to 'Atarot in northern Jerusalem be built immediately and that all the land necessary be expropriated toward that end. The committee's plans call for creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones" for industrial and tourism projects between Modi'in and 'Atarot along road No. 45. The committee also recommends separating Arab and Jewish residential areas and treating the greater Jerusalem area as a unified functional space with open borders and a joint economic framework with Jerusalem. The committee's steering team, which is continuing the greater Jerusalem area planning work, is headed by Shemaryahu Kohen, formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the Construction and Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazor.
