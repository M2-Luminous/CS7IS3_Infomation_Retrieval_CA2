The move was recommended by a government appointed committee, whose mandate was to come up with a new administrative structure for the island's financially-strapped banana industry. In a radio and television address, D'Auvergne said the SLBGA was bankrupt with current debts of 42 million dollars (one EC dollar ; 37 cents US), up from the 30 million dollars reported at the height of a strike by farmers last October. The farmers were pushing for increased prices for their fruit at a time when the industry was hit by a falling market prices and decreasing exchange value of the British pound sterling, the hard currency earned from exports. Since the strike, in which police shot and killed two protestors, the SLBGA has been spending nearly one million dollars weekly to pacify grumbling farmers through a programme of price support. D'Auvergne said in addition, the SLBGA now owed 56 million dollars to the local company which supplies cartons for the export of bananas and another 8.6 million dollars to input suppliers. The SLBGA also owes the National Commercial Bank (NCB) 10 million dollars in loans and overdraft, 6.4 million dollars to Geest industries, the marketing company, three million dollars in gratuities due to staff, and three million in cess credits due to farmers. Said D'Auvergne of the association's accumulated debt: "This figure continues to grow every week and it has become obvious that this situation cannot be allowed to continue." The SLBGA announced Tuesday that price support payments to farmers during last week amounted to 921,996 dollars or nearly 18 cents per pound of bananas sold. D'Auvergne said the government-appointed committee had recommended that a receiver be appointed to manage the SLBGA for a stated period during which certain forms of reorganisation of the association will be examined to determine which was to be adopted for ensuing the future viability and stability of the industry. He said banana growers here were being paid 31, 28 and 26 cents per pound for grades a, b and c fruit respectively which was higher than the 24.3 and 20.3 cents per pound for grades a and b fruit being paid to their counterparts in St Vincent and the Grenadines and the 25 cents per pound growers in Dominica were receiving. Government ministers plan to meet banana farmers Wednesday to discuss the state of the industry and plans to restructure it. That meeting will take place in the eastern village of Dennery, hotbed of the protest last October.
