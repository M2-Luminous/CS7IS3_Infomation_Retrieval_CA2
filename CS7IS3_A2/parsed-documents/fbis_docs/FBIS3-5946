The cause of independence and democracy in South Korea and national reunification is a showdown between the national forces for independence and the aggressive forces and between the patriotic forces for reunification and democracy and the fascist forces for division and it requires the unity of all the champions of independence, democracy and reunification, the paper says, and goes on: There is no reason that the forces for independence, democracy and reunification cannot achieve [word indistinct] Korea. Workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, urban dwellers, national capitalists and many other people are suffering under the colonial fascist rule in South Korea. The people, except the narrow privileged circles, cannot defend their vital interests unless the colonial fascist rule is liquidated. This is an objective condition under which South Korean people of various social strata can closely unite with each other under the slogan of independence, democracy and reunification. All the South Korean forces for independence, democracy and reunification oppose the colonial fascist rule and hope for the establishment of an independent, democratic government. It is a lawful demand in accomplishing the cause of independence, democracy and reunification that the South Korean people launch an all-people common struggle, irrespective of their isms and principles and their party, political and religious groupings. It is important in developing the mass struggle for independence, democracy and reunification to strengthen the political struggle of the workers and peasants, while closely combining it with the students' movement for political freedom and democracy and waging a common struggle with all other classes and circles interested in it. The South Korean patriotic forces for independence, democracy and reunification must, for the present, vigorously wage a massive common struggle to put an end to the domination, interference and pressure by outside forces and smash the treacheries, suppression, nonfrontationist [word as received] and divisive moves of the "civilian" fascist forces and head for the formation of a united front. This is the way of rejecting the domination and interference by outside forces, destroying the fascist dictatorial forces and winning independence, democracy and reunification. The South Korean people's righteous struggle for the three goals will surely emerge victorious.
