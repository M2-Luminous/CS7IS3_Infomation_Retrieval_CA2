Representatives of the Real Politics Union (UPR), the Conservative Party (PK), the Party of Christian Democrats (PChD), the Peasant-Christian Party (SLCh) and the National-Democratic Party (SND) believe that the coalition aims to recall members of the National TV and Radio Council and the board of the public television. According to PK leader Aleksander Hall, the process leads to the return of the monopoly on information in TV and "must be regarded as an attempt on freedom." Hall stressed that such tendencies are particularly visible in the present situation in the country, tense because of strikes. Hall also pointed to the fact that the way of thinking of the coalition is the legacy of the communist regime, when the mass media were considered to serve the ruling authorities. "We defend the principle of the independence of the mass media from the current leadership of the state," Hall added. Stanislaw Michalkiewicz from the UPR emphasised that the public television lives on taxpayer's money and no political power can claim to rule over this medium. "Television is not supposed to pay compliments to the authorities but to broadcast news", Michalkiewicz said.
