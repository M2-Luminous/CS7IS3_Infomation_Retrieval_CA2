Russia's current role in the European process is obviously not in keeping with its potential." The Russian MP [Member of Parliament] pointed to the need of Russia's joining all European political and economic structures. "The promptness with which Russia may occupy its due place in Europe will largely depend on the solution of internal problems," said Kovalev. The inter-parliamentary seminar, which opened today at the Moscow-based Russian Academy of Sciences, was organised by Europarliament and the National Assembly of France. Deputies of the State Duma take part.
