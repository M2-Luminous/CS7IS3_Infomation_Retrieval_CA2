The trial against Isaac Chavarria, accused of drug trafficking as a result of testimony by drug trafficker Meco Dominguez, is turning into a process against the MIR. The Dominguez file is a bomb that is beginning to take effect. According to Meco Dominguez' testimony, Isaac Chavarria was a powerful drug trafficker protected by the MIR. The drugs and documents found at Chavarria's house and farms, as well as the testimony of half a dozen arrested drug traffickers are confirming the charges made by Dominguez. Chavarria was an official MIR member. He obtained a MIR membership card in 1992 signed by Santa Cruz Prefect Rolando Arostegui and the MIR chief of Santa Cruz Department. A Chavarria employee who is now under arrest, (Wilbert Cox Molina), described how Chavarria purchased and sold drugs. (Wilbert) states: "I also want to mention here that while my employer, Isaac Chavarria, whom I guarded, was hospitalized in the Calacoto Clinic in La Paz, he was visited on several occasions by Colonel Jorge Velazquez, chief of the Government House aides de camp; Mrs. Edith Paz Zamora; and Rosario Paz Zamora, who took him flowers; as well as by [MIR president] Oscar Eid Franco, who paid the hospital bill. He gave Edgar Fernandez [another Chavarria employee] about $25,000 to pay the hospital expenses." Oscar Eid Franco has confirmed that he paid the bill. In this file we also find the answers to several questions. Meco Dominguez was arrested and taken to court when he broke his partnership with Chavarria and therefore with the MIR. Dominguez operated in the Regine discotheque, which has been closed by police investigations. Discotheque owner Juan Carlos Peredo Paz was arrested recently. Peredo Paz is a MIR member and a former official from the Agricultural Bank and the National Bank Superintendency. He has been a middleman in operations to launder dollars from drug trafficking activities. Peredo Paz has acknowledged that twice he received checks from Meco Dominguez for a total of $1.3 million. In the third section of Meco Dominguez' case file we find a letter found by the Special Anti-Narcotics Force [FELCN] in Chavarria's house. It is signed by Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who is currently at large. In this letter, Edgar Fernandez tells Chavarria, for whom he worked, that in November 1990 he was arrested by the FELCN in La Paz but was soon released from prison thanks to a telephone call that he, Edgar Fernandez, thinks was made by Susana Seleme [not further identified] from Government House. Two pieces of evidence that unfortunately involve former President Jaime Paz Zamora are missing from this file. One of them is a video found in the house of Chavarria that FELCN did not want to show to either the public or the court. The FELCN also did not send to court the conflicting testimony between Meco Dominguez and Chavarria. In the testimony, Dominguez said in front of Chavarria that when Jaime Paz Zamora was president of the Republic he had lunch with Chavarria in a Santa Cruz restaurant. Meco Dominguez was present at the lunch but he says he did not hear the conversation between the two. Two photographs, which already have been published in the newspapers, are also missing from the file. The first one, which was first published four years ago, shows Jaime Paz Zamora and Chavarria together. The second picture was published on 20 February by EL DIARIO and shows Paz Zamora, Meco Dominguez, and top MIR leaders together. The only explanation the MIR has given to the public so far is that, in effect, there was a friendship between Paz Zamora and Chavarria. The charges made by Meco Dominguez now must be proven or rejected in court. Has this friendship led Paz Zamora to cover up the illegal activities of Isaac Chavarria?
