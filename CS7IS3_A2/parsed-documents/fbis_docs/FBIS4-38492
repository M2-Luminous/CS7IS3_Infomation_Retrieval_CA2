Addressing the residents of Novosibirsk on Tuesday, Baburin said: "Rutskoy is the leader of Russia's nationalist movement only in the pages of the press." According to him, in the wake of last October's events Rutskoy displayed his unsuitability as a political leader and strategist. Baburin came to Novosibirsk to inaugurate a branch of his movement on Monday. According to him, this is the 50th affiliation to the Russian Pan-National Union. "The establishment of a mass of regional branches across Russia is linked first of all with our preparations for the upcoming presidential elections," he stressed. During the election campaign his movement, Baburin added, will be ready to cooperate with all patriotic-minded organizations, except the Liberal Democratic Party. With reference to the possible candidacy to be backed by the Union and by other nationalist organizations he said that it has not yet been determined. In comments on developments in and around the Crimea Baburin told Interfax that Russia must give the Crimea military aid by sending troops there. According to him, the deployment of Russian troops alone will induce Ukraine to "lower its ambitions toward the people of the Crimea and induce the Ukrainian government to enter into negotiations on the situation on the peninsula."
