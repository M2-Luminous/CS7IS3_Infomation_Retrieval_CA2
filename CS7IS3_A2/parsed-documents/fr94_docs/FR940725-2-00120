FR940725-2-00120 FR940725-2-00071 9. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Under the Deferred Contracts, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') is imposed on full or partial surrenders to reimburse the Company for expenses incurred in connection with the promotion, sale, and distribution of the Contracts. The CDSC applies only to purchase payments received within five years of the date of surrender. No CDSC is imposed on distributions made as annuity payments. In calculating the CDSC, purchase payments are allocated to the amount surrendered on a first-in, first-out basis. The amount of the CDSC is calculated by (i) allocating purchase payments to the amount surrendered; (ii) multiplying each allocated purchase payment that has been held under the Contract by a percentage corresponding to the period for which the payment was held; and (iii) adding the product of each multiplication in (ii) above. Under certain of the Deferred Contracts, the percentages are as follows: ␣ 1Years since payment 1Percentage 0&hyph;1 5 1&hyph;2 5 2&hyph;3 4 3&hyph;4 3 4&hyph;5 1.5 5+ 0 Under other of the Deferred Contracts, the percentages are as follows: ␣ 1Years since payment 1Percentage 0&hyph;1 6 1&hyph;2 5 2&hyph;3 4 3&hyph;4 3 4&hyph;5 1.5 5+ 0 In no event will the aggregate CDSC exceed 9% of the total purchase payments made. A Contract owner may surrender no more than once annually 15% of purchase payments less prior surrenders without incurring a CDSC. The Company may eliminate or reduce the CDSC under Company procedures then in effect. There is no CDSC imposed on Immediate Contracts. 10. For all Contracts issued in connection with the Variable Account, the Company deducts a mortality and expense risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average daily net assets of the Variable Account. Of this 1.25% charge, approximately .90% is for mortality risks and .35% is for expense risks. The mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its contractual obligation to make annuity payments after the Annuity Date for the life of the annuitant in accordance with the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts. The expense risk assumed by the Company is that all actual expenses involved in administering the Contracts, including Contract maintenance costs, administrative costs, mailing costs, data processing costs, legal fees, accounting fees, filing fees, and the costs of other services may exceed the amount recovered from the contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions 1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements that prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. 2. Applicants request an amended order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable Account under the Contracts. Applicants request that the Amended Order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of any other separate account established by the Company in the future to support variable annuity contracts offered on a basis similar in all material respects to the basis on which the Contracts are offered. 3. Applicants submit that their request for an Amended Order that applies to the Variable Account and to future separate accounts issuing contracts that are substantially similar to the Contracts is appropriate in the public interest. Such an amended order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for the Company to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Applicants further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. Investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by the Company by being required repeatedly to seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application. 4. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks undertaken by the Company and within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of the mortality risks, taking into consideration such factors as any contractual right to increase charges above current levels, the guaranteed annuity purchase rates, the expense risks taking into consideration the existence of charges against separate account assets for other than mortality and expense risks, and the estimated costs, now and in the future, for certain product features as well as an examination of comparable annuity products. The Company represents that it will maintain at its principal office a memorandum, available to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis. 5. If a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. The Company represents that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Variable Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum maintained by the Company at its principal office and available to the Commission upon request. 6. The Company represents that the Variable Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake, in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan. Conclusion Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Variable Account under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
