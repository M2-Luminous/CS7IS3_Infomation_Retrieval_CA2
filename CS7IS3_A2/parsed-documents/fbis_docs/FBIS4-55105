This will be at stake in the second round of the parliamentary elections, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto told a news conference tonight. "The Free Democrats are satisfied with their result, namely the acquisition of 20 percent of votes in the first round," Peto said. In his view, high voter participation is a success of Hungarian democracy. As a result, the government to be formed will have a great deal of legitimacy. "The SZDSZ has achieved its main goal: the government has been dismissed," Peto said.
