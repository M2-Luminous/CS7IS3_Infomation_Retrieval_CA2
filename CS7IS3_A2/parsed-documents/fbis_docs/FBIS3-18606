The time has come to change." This was one of the first statements made by Secretary of State Warren Christopher after Clinton came to the White House. His remarks reflected the thinking of the President, who was convinced that since the end of the Cold War economic rivalry has taken the place of the ideological kind in relations between nations. Indeed, in his international strategy Clinton has been as vague and contradictory on geopolitical problems as he has been steadfast and resolute on economic matters. Thus, while American foreign policy still lacks a guiding principle and a coherent sense of direction., U.S. international economic policy is regulated by a very precise premise: The world, Clinton says, has now entered the era of "the globalization of the economy" and America must adapt its conduct to this fact. Trade policy thus becomes an essential component of foreign policy and represents the point of contact between domestic economic development and expansion in the foreign markets. These two issues, the President stresses, cannot be separated but must be viewed from the same angle. The latest examples of this change of course in America's trade strategy came with Clinton's personal intervention to guarantee the U.S. aeronautics industry a giant $6 billion order from Saudi Arabia and his breaking off of the negotiations with Japan following the threat of economic reprisals. Although these issues are different in nature, they have in common the "aggressiveness" of the White House, which contrasts with the passive line pursued by previous Washington governments. The stakes were high with Saudi Arabia -- a $6 billion order to renew the entire Saudi commercial fleet (50 aircraft). The choice was between the offers submitted by two giants of the American aeronautical industry, McDonnell and Boeing, and the European Airbus consortium. Clinton intervened personally with King Fahd to ensure that the order went to the American firms, pointing out to the Saudi monarch that it was only Washington's intervention that saved his country from Iraq's aggression. The outcome is that this giant order will save the jobs of tens of thousands of people and will have positive repercussions on many activities connected with the aeronautics industry. To those who accuse him of having violated the principles of free trade, Clinton has been able to reply that he blocked a similar move by French President Francois Mitterrand in favor of the Airbus and that in any case the time had come for the United States to defend its industries by adopting the practices of intervention that its competitors have been using for some time. The issue of the trade negotiations with Japan is more complex. The negotiations to reduce the growing American trade deficit with Japan have been proceeding inconclusively for some 20 years, with agreements in principle not followed by concrete implementation. Meanwhile, the annual trade deficit with Tokyo has reached the unprecedented figure of $60 billion. At his recent meeting in Washington with new Japanese Premier Hosokawa, Clinton changed tactic. Instead of being satisfied with vague and ambiguous agreements, like his predecessors, he preferred to break off the negotiations. No agreement, he said, is better than a merely artificial and cosmetic agreement. The clash occurred over America's demand to set numerical levels for market shares for American products in the various sectors of the Japanese economy, which Hosokawa rejected. Unless he makes some concessions within the next month, Clinton reserves the right to adopt reprisals through the imposition of duties and other measures against Japanese products. Where will this trial of strength lead? There is obviously a chance that it will give rise to an outright trade war, but few people believe in such a development, which would be damaging to both countries and would disrupt the entire world economic outlook. The expectation, therefore, is that a compromise will be reached whereby Japan will allow its market to be opened up more to American industries, while, however, avoiding the rigid "numerical quantification" sought by Washington. Clinton's aggressive strategy is criticized in America by those who perceive in it the abandonment of the principles of free trade and a return to protectionism, albeit in disguised forms. The White House's reply is that to raise the issue in such terms means to fail to understand the fact that the debate now is not between the proponents of free trade and the protectionists, but between the theory of absolute free trade and that of the so-called cautious activism propounded by the head of the President's economic advisers, Laura Tyson, which envisages the possibility of limited interventions designed to support home industries abroad. The difference, Washington stresses, lies in the fact that, whereas protectionism entails the closure of the American market to foreign competition, thus reflecting the concept of a "closed economy," "cautious activism," on the contrary, aims to open up foreign markets to American products, thus reflecting the current expansive dynamism of the U.S. economy. This must be the starting point for understanding the significance of the commercial turnabout. A year ago, in the midst of the election campaign, Clinton lamented the "economic and technological" decline of the United States with respect to Europe and Japan. Now he himself admits that the situation has been completely reversed. It is not just that the increasingly solid pace of the American recovery contrasts with the continuing recession in Europe and Japan, but also the increasing U.S. successes in the technological field. The structural renewal of the automobile industry has enabled Detroit's big three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) to make exceptional increases in their profits, while the automobile industries in both Japan and Europe -- once feared rivals -- are now in a deep crisis. Furthermore, the United States has regained its primacy in the semiconductors field, and all its electronics and computer technology sectors are advancing more rapidly than any of their competitors. Clinton does not conceal the fact that his aim is to increase America's international competitiveness, especially in the high technology sector, through cooperation between government and private industry. This approach, which envisages a number of incentives for investment in technology and government interventions in the international field, does not, the White House stresses, conflict with the strengthening of free trade already achieved through the NAFTA and GATT accords. The common objective is to accelerate the creation of "open markets" throughout the world economy, with the advantage of creating new jobs in America and at the same time providing Europe and Japan with a useful means of emerging from the recession.
