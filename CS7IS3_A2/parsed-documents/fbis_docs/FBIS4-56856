Presidential candidate Andres Pastrana has made this statement as he expressed his support for the Colombian response to the 18 April U.S. letter questioning Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff's attitude. Pastrana said: "It is worrisome that as policies of submission are enforced, certain self-confessed criminals tarnish the names of other parties and even the image of an entire country so as to have their sentences reduced for allegedly collaborating with authorities." Pastrana also urged the two governments to reestablish the lines of communication, to normalize bilateral relations, and to reactivate the mechanisms of judicial collaboration to fight international drug trafficking. Meanwhile, Pastrana reiterated his opposition to the legalization of drugs, saying: "Should Senator Kerry or any other U.S. authority have substantial information that will contribute to preventing drug trafficking from interfering with Colombian politics, he must say so immediately by providing the details he knows."
