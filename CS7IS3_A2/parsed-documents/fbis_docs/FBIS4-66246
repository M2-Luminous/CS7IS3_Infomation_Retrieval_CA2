From this argument, some people have concluded that taking public ownership as the essence of socialism is "mistaking the method for the goal and trying to defend it." Being a method, public ownership is in a subordinate position when compared with goal of socialism. Development of productive forces is the end. Whatever ownership is conducive to economic development should be promoted. If the publicly owned sector of the economy gradually dwindles because it is unsuited to market competition, such outcome, from an overall viewpoint, is good for the development of our productive forces, the strengthening of our comprehensive national strength, and the improvement of the people's living standard. This view is an obvious mistake. Here, first of all, let us explain the relationship between social practice and the nature of society. Our social practice--for example, we take the quick development of productive forces as our primary task--is bound up with the fact that our society is socialist in nature. So any practice conducive to consolidating and developing the socialist system must be protected. Any practice with an adverse effect on this must be restricted and banned. From this viewpoint, building a modern socialist society is our end, while developing productive forces is the method to achieve that end. Sometimes we may say developing productive forces is our end, but that is based on the premise that our system is a socialist system--what we mean is that in socialist society we should take the development of productive forces as our work target or fundamental task. In fact, ownership hinges directly on the nature, or system, of society. Leaving primitive communist society aside, in slave society the means of production was owned by slave owners. In feudal society, it was owned by feudal lords, and in capitalist society, by capitalists. In socialist society it is, of course, owned by the whole people and the collectives. This is common knowledge. China is now in the initial stage of socialism. Because of our relatively backward economy and based on the experience and lessons drawn from the past, our party and government are carrying out a policy of coexistence and co-development of several economic sectors in order to speed up the development of social productive forces. This policy allows the existence of enterprises owned by individuals as well as enterprises run with private capital, with Chinese and foreign capital, and with sole foreign capital. Now, all these types of enterprises have developed to some extent. This is absolutely correct. Meanwhile, however, our party and government have unequivocally stipulated that the state-owned and collective economic sectors, that is, the publicly owned sectors, should still dominate our economy. The non-state-owned sectors, they say, should remain supplementary, or in other words, in a subordinate position. This is the basic principle for socialist modernization. Our socialist politics, culture, education, science and technology, and military affairs should all follow this principle and serve the purpose of developing social productive forces. Above all, they should serve the purpose of defending and reinforcing the mainstay position of public ownership. Failing this or acting to the contrary will impair our cause of socialist construction. To substantiate this, we would like to quote some relevant viewpoints held by our proletarian revolutionary teachers. In the preface to the 1888 English edition of "Manifesto of the Communist Party," Engels said: "The fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus of this Manifesto' belongs to Marx. That proposition is: In every historical epoch, the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange, and the social organization necessarily following from it, form the basis upon which is built up, and from which alone can be explained, the political and intellectual history of that epoch." (Selected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Vol. I, p. 237). This means that the nature of a society is mainly determined by the mode of material production in that society, or in other words, the condition of productive forces and the corresponding production relations in that society. With the development of productive forces, human history has developed from a low to a high level through five kinds of production relations, namely, production relations of primitive communism, the slave system, feudalism, capitalism, and socialism (communism). Commensurate with the different economic bases are five basic forms of society, which have appeared successively. They are: primitive society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, and socialist society (communist society). Therefore, to determine the nature of a society, we should, first of all, look into its economic base. Lenin said: "Only by attributing social relations to production relations and attributing production relations to the level of productive forces, can we have a reliable basis to view the development of forms of society as a natural historical process." (Collected Works of V.I. Lenin, Second Edition, Vol. I, p. 110) If the nature of society is determined by production relations, which are connected with the condition of productive forces, then there must be an inner link between the ownership system, which is the basis of production relations, and the nature of society. In fact, most people acknowledge that the ownership system is a major criterion for judging the nature of society. The fundamental reason for the socialist nature of contemporary Chinese society is that it has public ownership as its main foundation. Similarly, the fundamental reason for the capitalist nature of society of Western developed countries is that their society is founded mainly on private ownership. The link between the ownership system and the nature of society and the importance of the ownership system to social development were clearly expounded long ago by the founders of scientific socialism. In the Manifesto of the Communist Party, they declared to the whole world: "The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the systems of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few. In this sense, the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property." (Selected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Vol. I, p. 265) Now, everyone acknowledges that elimination of exploitation is the essence of socialism. But how is exploitation to be eliminated? By relying on the exploiters' mercy? Or by relying on open-minded rulers? These are merely utopian socialism. Can we merely rely on the development of productive forces to eliminate exploitation? If so, how come developed capitalist countries, which have a very high level of productive forces, cannot eliminate exploitation? To eliminate exploitation, it is imperative to replace private ownership with public ownership. This is an irrefutable truth. In addition, everyone acknowledges that elimination of polarization is also the essence of socialism. How can polarization be eliminated? The history of the world has proved that polarization cannot be eliminated in any society with private ownership. Peasants of feudal society once rose up to struggle for equal land rights, but their struggle ended in failure. During the bourgeois revolutionary period, some thinkers stood for the elimination of economic inequality, only to find that their ideal was no more than a beautiful bubble. Reality in the 20th century has made people aware that only by replacing private ownership with public ownership is it possible to eliminate polarization. As can be seen, elimination of exploitation and polarization is bound up with public ownership. Their relationship, it may be said, is just like the two sides of a coin. An inner link exists between public ownership and the essence of socialism, and there is no doubt about it. Productive forces are the most dynamic factor for social development. The condition of productive forces determines the nature of production relations, while the development of productive forces determines the changes in production relations. This, however, cannot be construed to mean that the condition of productive forces alone is a direct determinant of the nature of society. The histories of countries in the world have repeatedly proved that, under roughly the same condition of productive forces, the nature of society varies from country to country. For example, under the condition of modern productive forces, some countries have capitalist society, while others have socialist society. This is because their specific environments are different. Even under the same condition of productive forces, when a country is fettered by production relations that are incompatible with the condition of its productive forces, it may have one form of society, but after it has replaced the outdated production relations with advanced production relations that are commensurate with the condition of its productive forces, it may have another form of society. It follows that the condition of productive forces, albeit a vital determinant of social development, does not necessarily reflect the nature of society. The direct determinant of the nature of society is production relations. In other words, the nature of society is determined by production relations based on certain productive forces. Here, production relations refer to the dominant relations of production at a certain stage of the development of human society, that is, the basic economic system of society. Consequently, we may say that the basic economic system of society based on certain productive forces directly determines the nature of society. Is the conclusion that production relations directly determines the nature of society in conflict with the thesis that productive forces serve as the criterion for economic work? No. It does not deny the fact that productive forces are always the most revolutionary element of economic activities in society, and that the development of productive forces invariably determines the changes in production relations. Productive forces and production relations complement, condition, and promote each other. In China, persisting in using productive forces as the criterion for economic work is associated with adherence to the basic socialist economic system. All views and practices making them mutually exclusive are harmful. If we say that the idea "we would rather have the grass of socialism" is to sever from an extremely leftist stand the inner link between using productive forces as the criterion for economic work and implementing the basic socialist economic system, then stressing the importance of productive forces in an abstract, isolated, and lopsided way is to sever that link from a rightist stand. "To stress the four modernizations without stressing socialism is to forget the essence of the matter." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Vol. III, p. 204) Productive forces are connected with production relations both in substance and in form. In a certain sense, developing productive forces may be considered as the end. But this does not mean that public ownership can be downgraded to a low, subordinate position and is no longer a decisive factor for the essence of socialism. In any society, economic progress has to rely on a variety of methods. Undoubtedly, many methods have no inner link with the essence of society and may be considered to be in a low and subordinate position. For example, plans and markets may be used as economic methods by capitalism as well as by socialism, for they have no inner link with the essence of society. But this is not the case of public ownership. As a basic economic system, public ownership should in no way be downgraded to an unimportant, low, and subordinate position. Moreover, the end and method can be transformed into each other. As far as productive forces versus production relations are concerned, the former is the end. But, when we talk about the essence of socialism (liberating and developing productive forces and eliminating exploitation and polarization so as to finally achieve common affluence), the end is to "finally achieve common affluence," while developing and liberating productive forces are methods to achieve this end. In this case, can we say that development of productive forces is placed in a low, subordinate position? Obviously not. Development of productive forces and common affluence also complement and condition each other. In socialist society, on the one hand, development of productive forces must be subordinate to the objective of satisfying the people's material and cultural needs; otherwise, "production would be for the sake of production." On the other hand, without developing productive forces, it would be impossible to provide abundant materials and products and, hence, impossible to achieve common affluence. For this reason, we must take a comprehensive look at the relationship between developing productive forces and achieving common affluence. Even though development of production should be subordinate to the people's needs, development of productive forces is still the practical starting point and plays a dominant role in the whole economic process. So development of productive forces must be regarded as a fundamental task of socialism. To sum up, both productive forces and production relations play a vital role in determining the nature of society. Absolutely exaggerating the role of productive forces and believing that once we have developed our productive forces, we would not slip to the capitalist road no matter what ownership system we have adopted is as much a mistake as absolutely exaggerating the role of production relations and believing that with a large and collective organization, we would transit to a communist society despite our backward productive forces. Similarly, the thinking that socialism can be realized in the absence of public ownership is as absurd as the thinking that socialism can be achieved without developing productive forces and with a poverty-stricken society. Lopsidedly stressing that the ownership system is a method is aimed at nothing but weaken, eliminate, and change public ownership. Is it possible to get a better effect on developing China's productive forces by weakening, eliminating, and change public ownership? No. As shown by the history of the last 100 years or so, China did not quicken the development of productive forces whether it was dominated by the feudal system, semi-feudal and semi-colonial system, or bureaucrat capitalism. On the contrary, when such systems held sway, the people were often suffering hunger and cold, and sometimes dead bodies of the starved were found here and there. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the national economy quickly revived from the awful mess left from old China. On the heels of such revival was a large-scale economic construction. All these relied upon the socialist system based on public ownership. Though once we erred by arbitrarily pursuing a "large and collective" organization, we have never destroyed the socialist system. Since the 1980's, our productive forces have developed at a quickened pace. What we have relied upon is still the socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay. Public ownership as the mainstay is a very important aspect of Chinese socialism and a basic socialist principle we must keep to. The ongoing reform is a process of further improvement of the public ownership system. This improvement means a change in the system and mechanism of public ownership to meet the needs of developing productive forces. It differs radically from weakening, eliminating, and changing public ownership. Only by improving the public ownership system can we achieve better results in fulfilling the basic task of developing productive forces. This is a fundamental principle for building socialism. In China, the economic sector owned by the whole people and the enterprises owned by the state were and still are leading forces in ensuring the fast development of the national economy. In the first place, they have relatively advanced technology and equipment, large numbers of competent professionals, and the masses of hard-working and discipline-abiding workers. They are, therefore, the most advanced part of productive forces in our society and represent the orientation for the development of productive forces. Secondly, they always play a leading role in industrial production, transportation, financial affairs, and commodity circulation. Thirdly, they are the chief financial source for the state. Fourthly, they serve the people across the country and play a pillar role in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control. It is due to the leading role played by the economic sector owned by the whole people that China's economic construction and its reform and opening-up drive have scored such remarkable achievements as to attract worldwide attention. Some people say that enterprises owned by the whole people cannot compare with enterprises owned by collectives and individuals. They argue that our economic growth since the start of the reform and opening-up drive has resulted mainly from the growth of the economic sector not owned by the whole people. This viewpoint is superficial and groundless. It must be noted that the rapid growth of the economic sector not owned by the whole people has depended, to a great extent, on the support provided by the economic sector owned by the whole people. State-owned enterprises have provided necessary raw materials, energy, and transportation facilities as well as lots of technology, equipment, and manpower to the economic sector not owned by the whole people. Moreover, this economic sector has reaped a large amount of profits from the state's tax-reduction and exemption policy and, in particular, from the low prices of products made by state-owned enterprises. Because of this, the following situation has appeared in China: Despite its advanced equipment, competent work force, and enormous capital, the state-owned economic sector is growing slowly, while the whole economy and the non-state-owned sector are making quick headway. With regard to the above-mentioned situation, Vice President Rong Yiren said very clearly in his November 1993 speech in Tianjin: "Today, without support from state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, no other enterprise could enjoy lasting prosperity whether it is a township enterprise, an enterprise in the foreign-funded enterprise category, or any other enterprises not owned by the public. State-owned big and medium-sized enterprises were, are, and will continue to be the pillar of China's national economy." No doubt, this conclusion is quite correct.
