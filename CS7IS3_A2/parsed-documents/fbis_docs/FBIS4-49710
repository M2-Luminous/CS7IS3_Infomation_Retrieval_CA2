Zhu Guangyao, deputy minister of forestry, told a national desert survey and monitoring conference that the efforts include planting 1.6 million ha of trees, desert-control extension projects in 20 counties and nine experimental zones. Desertification is one of the world's ten major environmental issues, while China is one of the countries where desert encroachment is a serious problem, he said. Some 15.9 percent of the total land area, or 1.53 million sq [square] km are under serious threat of desertification. Zhu said 371,000 sq km of such land causes 4.5 billion yuan (about 520 million U.S. dollars) in direct economic losses annually to local people. To change this situation, the State Council, China's highest governing body, for the first time listed desert control as one of the major environmental control efforts in the ten-year program for national economic and social development in 1991. To carry out the program, the State Council has called two national desertification conferences and ratified ten-year desert control projects and enacted some preferential policies to this end. At present, some 600 development projects are being carried out in the desert areas in China so as to make the best use of desert resources for economic development. Despite these efforts, however, Zhu Guangyao warned that desertification is still a challenge for China, and environmental deterioration in desert areas remains a chronic problem. Estimates show that China's desert area will grow at a rate of 1.33 percent annually if effective measures are not taken in the upcoming ten years. This means that China would have another 2300 sq km of desert every year, the equivalent of a medium-sized Chinese county. Moreover, regional desertification looms large in some grassland, hilly and dry areas in Hebei Province, and the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions, where desertification is growing at a rate of five percent a year. Hulun Buir League, a grassland area in Inner Mongolia, is being threatened by four growing desert zones and serious dune flows. The large-scale exploitation of coal, oil and gas resources in the northwest will put new pressure on the region's fragile ecological environment, he noted. Viewing the reasons for China's desertification, experts said it is partly the result of global warming, escalating drought and weak environmental protection in some areas in face of booming economic development.
