FR940602-2-00166 FR940602-2-00094 Revised Special Use Permit for Recreation Residences The Assistant Secretary's appeal decision voided certain clauses of the term special use permit used to authorize recreation residences on National Forest System lands and adopted with the 1988 policy. Holders who had been offered and accepted these permits in 1988 were notified by letter that the clauses were voided and temporarily removed from the permit and would be replaced upon adoption by the agency of a final reformulated policy. The voided permit provisions were: Part VI.C.2, part IX.B, C, D, and E, and part X.B. The October 10, 1991, notice displayed the term permit in its entirety with the affected clauses reformulated to be consistent with the revisions to the proposed policy. There were 346 comments received on the proposed permit. Nearly all of the responses were directed to permit clauses not affected by the appeal decision. The Federal Register notice explained that only policy provisions, and permit clauses, affected by the appeal decision were subject to review and reformulation. Hence, only those comments directed to permit clauses affected by the adoption of the final policy were considered in this analysis. These were considered with the comments made to the corresponding parts of the policy and procedural guidance. Permit clauses are derived from basic statutes, regulations, and policy. Thus, in reformulating the policy for administering recreation residences, the agency must also revise the permit that is derived from this policy. Changes made to the policy require corresponding changes to the permit. This has been done in the adoption of this final policy. The reformulated permit is printed in its entirety at the conclusion of this notice (Exhibit 1 to FSH 2709.11, section 54.1). Permit clauses revised as a result of the reformulation of the recreation residence policy as described in this notice are printed in italic. Readers are advised that holders of permits containing voided clauses will be sent new clauses or new permits upon adoption of this final policy. New permits will contain the revised clauses but are identical in all other respects to the permit accepted in 1988. Revision of Dispute Resolution Provisions The October 10, 1991, Federal Register notice provided information on the agency's policy to resolve disputes concerning recreation residence permit administration (located at FSM 2721.23f in the 1988 policy). It pointed out that revision of the Department of Agriculture administrative appeal regulations made on January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3342) created a conflict with the dispute resolution provisions adopted in the 1988 policy. Revision of these provisions, although not addressed in the appeal decision, was necessary. The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23h provided direction to reduce conflict between holders and the agency by providing holders with the opportunity to participate in an issue resolution process. Proposed paragraph 1 of this policy required agency officials to consult with holders and their representatives, where practicable, before issuing written decisions on permit administration in order to reach a common understanding and agreement. Proposed paragraph 2 encouraged holder involvement in the public involvement process for Forest planning, project analysis, and the permit issuance analysis process (FSM 2721.23e). This paragraph also encouraged agency officials to meet with holders and their representatives to discuss and resolve issues prior to issuing a decision. Proposed paragraph 3 provided guidance on resolving actions that have been appealed, directing that the opportunities provided in the appeal regulations (36 CFR parts 217 and 251) be utilized by the authorized officer to resolve the appeal issues by means other than review and decision on the appeal. The Forest Service has carefully considered the direction in the proposed policy in its preparation of this final policy and determined that it adequately conveys its intent to resolve disputes with holders on recreation residence permit administration. Therefore, it is adopting without change the direction in the proposed policy (FSM 2721.23h). Readers are advised that further revisions to the appeal regulations occurred on April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19369). That revision encourages participation in the agency's public involvement processes by expanding opportunities for pre-decisional involvement of the public in Forest Service decisionmaking. A new part 215 was added to the regulations that would give the public opportunity to comment, prior to issuance of a final decision, on proposed actions that implement National Forest land and resource management plans. Parts 217 and 251, subpart C, of the regulations continue in effect. This final recreation residence policy at FSM 2721.23h was examined in light of the new appeal regulation and found to be consistent. Clarification of Other Provisions of the Policy In the February 15, 1989, appeal decision, the Assistant Secretary directed the Forest Service to clarify procedures by which annual fees are determined for recreation residence use. Specifically, the agency was required to explain its rationale in adopting 3 components of the fee system: (1) Use of the period 1978&hyph;1982 as the base period for determining current fees, (2) Use of an index, the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IDP&hyph;GNP), to adjust fees annually to current fair market value, and (3) Use of a factor of 5 percent applied to the appraised value to determine the annual fee. The Supplementary Information section of the October 10, 1991, Federal Register notice containing the proposed policy provided information on these three components of the fee policy. Readers were advised that the information was to be considered as supplemental, or background, information to the direction and procedural guidance appearing in the policy at FSM 2721.23d-Fee Determination and FSH 2709.11, chapter 30, section 33, Recreation Residence Fees. The information in the notice emphasized that the agency is required to obtain fair market value for the use of the Federal lands. Fair market value is determined by appraisal or other sound business management practice, such as market analysis or competitive bid. Annual fees for recreation residences are determined by appraisal. A factor of 5 percent is applied to the appraised value to determine the annual fee.
