A decision to do so was taken late this evening by members of the delegations of the two countries. The sides were unable to reach agreement on a number of points while working out an intergovernmental document dividing the Black Sea Fleet. The talks will be continued tomorrow with the same people taking part. Valeriy Shmarov, deputy prime minister of Ukraine, told journalists that the positions of the sides undoubtedly came closer together during today's talks, but there are still a great many unresolved problems. At the same time he confirmed the desire of the Ukrainian side to reach an agreement.
