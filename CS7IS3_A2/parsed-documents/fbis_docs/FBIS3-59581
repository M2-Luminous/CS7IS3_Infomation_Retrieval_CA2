Artificial Limbs Will Be Controlled by Nerve Impulses"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] Wednesday, 10 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--Scientists at Centro Nacional de Microelectronica (CNM) in Barcelona are working on the development of a new chip that, implanted in the human body, can receive nerve impulses and forward them to various parts of the body. Nerves destroyed (in an accident) could be replaced by them in the future. Artificial arms and legs could be controlled by nerve impulses for the first time by means of this chip. The idea for this originated already around two and a half years ago. But the man-machine communication had to be feasible, they realized at the CNM laboratory. An ambitious research project that the European Community is generously subsidizing within the Esprit program has sprung from the idea in the meantime. Together with five other laboratories in Germany, Italy and Switzerland, CNM's scientists are working on the development of a new microchip that could open up new pathways for medicine. However, Centro Nacional de Microelectronica is taking the main share of the "Intelligent Neuronal Interface" project. "We are still at the very beginning," Rosa Villa, who as a physician is watching over the CNM project, says, curbing overhasty expectations. The goal is the development of a chip that, implanted between the split nerve ends, is to act as a communication bridge between the nervous system and outside information processing system. A prototype has already been designed in the meantime: a silicon chip one square millimeter small that is like a miniature sieve. The microperforation was achieved by neutron bombardment, explains Jordi Aguiló, head of CNM's design department. "The only effective method by which the chip's circuits are not damaged." The development of a biocompatible material for the chip case has been likewise difficult. But this problem has also been solved by now. The chip's biocompatibility has by now been tested with success in experiments on animals, Rosa Villa attests. The chip was implanted in rats. The next phase of the research can begin. The nerve chip is to act as the receiver of rat-nerve signals that are interpreted by a computer. Additional findings for further development of the chip are hoped from this. Similarly to TV relay stations that amplify the signals for reception at more distant points, the chip already permits signal transmission from the brain to nerve intersection points. Rosa Villa explains the future capabilities that follow from this: "The chip could replace destroyed nerves and be used in order to control artificial limbs." If the latter sounds improbable, it is not in the opinion of the CNM researchers. After all, it is theoretically possible to decode signals from the brain at severed nerves, Jordi Aguiló explains. "Thus it must also be possible to forward these brain signals through the chip to an artificial arm or leg." Rosa Villa: Unlike conventional pacemakers that can only transmit commands, the chip will be interactive. "A miniature electronic brain that is compatible with the human nervous system can receive neural signals, process them and transmit them to various parts of the body or to artificial limbs." There is still a way to go before this point. "This is a long-range research project whose end cannot be foreseen yet today." Rosa Villa also knows that it will be a few years before this chip can be implanted in the first patient. "It will not be feasible before the year 2000."
