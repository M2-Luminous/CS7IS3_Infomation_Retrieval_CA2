But not frequent enough, according to distraught parents whose children have been involved with or killed by drugs: "They're blaming the kids for taking cocktails of drugs -- but why are the drugs available in the first place?" says Janet Murphy, whose daughter Jennie Hindhaugh, 16, is the fifth young person to die from drugs in Blyth in the last two years. Blyth, a once prosperous port, is a dignified town which seems to hold its head high in the face of economic decline. It is a town where old ladies are safe in the street and there is little violence except domestic punch-ups. But now it has a reputation for a flourishing petty drug culture that corrupts and kills. Blyth's new infamy came to national attention when Mrs. Murphy published a photo of her dying daughter, on a life-support machine. With it she published one of the formerly vibrant Jennie as a champion gymnast. In Operation Crackdown last week -- an exercise to reassure the public of police concern over drug dealers -- the 30 detectives in the South East Northumberland CID spent each weekday from 7 AM until 11 AM raiding the houses of suspected dealers. Out of 42 warrants, they scored 28 successes. The collection of small amounts of various drugs and bizarre items of drug paraphernalia showed what a small, squalid industry it is: "We found five grams of heroin recently, which was our biggest hit for months. There's nobody in Blyth with an ounce of heroin, no major dealers here," Det. Chief Inspector Ken Anderson said. So how can such a small-time drug culture have such a devastating effect? The death roll -- Beverley Nesbitt, 19, Suzanne Calvert, 16, Steven Tait, 30, Tracey Cavner, 21, and Jennie Hindhaugh, 16, -- reveals one obvious disturbing factor. Apart from Steven, a heroin addict, these were young girls who died from random mixtures of drugs. The popular term "cocktails," implying some kind of party chic, is misleading. The reality is sordid and pathetic. Whereas heroin dealing has a strictly professional aspect to it, the random cocktail is the result of low-level drug dealing, often from kids who have burgled chemists' shops and who sell unnamed drugs in clubs on Saturday nights to girls looking for excitement.
