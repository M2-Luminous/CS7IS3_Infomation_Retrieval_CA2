No Lifting of Blockade in Near Future"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Geneva, 10 Mar (ATS) -- Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in the dispute between Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], had a long meeting in Geneva on Thursday [10 March] with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. "There is room for a solution but obstacles remain," Mr. Vance said after the meeting in which he handed Mr. Papoulias a "document," the contents of which he did not reveal. The Greek minister welcomed the "excellent climate" which prevailed during this meeting. A second meeting will probably be held in "the near future," Mr. Vance said. Meanwhile, "our representatives will meet to continue the search for a means of breaking the deadlock," Mr. Papoulias explained. The question of the blockade imposed by Greece on FYROM must be "discussed." "I do not think that this blockade will be lifted soon," Mr. Papoulias stressed. The lifting of the blockade will have to "form part of an overall solution to the problem" of FYROM, the Greek minister said. Following his first meeting with the UN mediator, Mr. Papoulias left Geneva for Belgrade, according to his spokesman. No meeting therefore will be held in Geneva, as had been rumored, between the Greek minister and FYROM Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski, who meanwhile had arrived in the lakeside city. Damaging Effects Mr. Crvenkovski had a meeting with Mr. Vance late in the afternoon. The FYROM minister stressed the "illegal" nature of the blockade whose effects are "enormously" damaging for the FYROM economy. Mr. Papoulias reaffirmed to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday that Athens had decided on an economic blockade to defend itself from FYROM's "aggressive attitudes." Since 16 February, the passage of goods for FYROM through the Greek port of Salonika has been banned. In addition, the Greek Consulate in Skopje, capital of the FYROM, has been closed. Greece is demanding that the Skopje government abandon its flag, which shows the Vergina sun (symbol of the late Macedonian dynasty), and the name "Macedonia." This name, Athens points out in substance, implies territorial claims on the northern province of Greece which has been called "Macedonia" for centuries.
