Would you explain the reasons for this? [Abu-Sharif] My relations with brother President 'Arafat are still cordial. These militant relations cannot be weakened. Within the framework of the ongoing peace process, the negotiating team attracts attention because it is charged with this task. Meanwhile, many leaders not directly involved in the negotiations are charged with other tasks. Regrettably, I have read many articles and reports that try to distort things and misinterpret them. As you have noticed, I did not respond to these attempts, because we face difficult tasks now. No doubt, the current stage is one of the most difficult stages of the struggle; it is a sensitive stage on the internal level as well, in terms of negotiations, foreign relations, and inter-Arab relations. It is natural to see different viewpoints regarding tactical points and the working plan and mechanism that must be followed in the interest of our people to achieve what can be achieved through the peace process, despite its difficulties. The objective is full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory. This cannot be achieved by remote control. Negotiations are being held with the Israeli enemy. He is a difficult enemy, not an easy enemy. When we talk with the Israeli enemy we must not forget we are talking with an enemy, regardless of its delegations' visits to Tunisia and the meetings in Cairo. We must not forget it is an enemy who tries to achieve as much as it can within the land for peace equation. We believe the absence of coordination among the Arab parties involved in the talks will weaken the Arab position, or at least, strengthen the position of the Israeli negotiators. We see that the Israeli stand is united, despite the known differences between Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq Rabin. We also see that it is stronger, although we know Rabin's majority in the Knesset is very small and that the Likud is strong. When we talk about the working mechanism, there are points that must be tackled to strengthen the position of the Palestinian and Arab negotiators. I believe the existence of different views and detailed discussions are important so we can form a sound opinion in the service of our people. I would like to note the importance of Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, in particular within the framework of coordination among the Arab negotiating delegations. This must be united and capable of mobilizing Arab support. Without the unity of the Palestinian stand and the unity of the Arab position -- which must be supported by all Arab sides -- the position of each negotiating team will be weaker. Syria can negotiate in the Syrian track, but it will be stronger when it is supported by a united Arab position. This will make the U.S. Administration think carefully before taking any stand to appease Israel. I believe neither the initial agreement nor the periodic meetings of the Arab parties involved in the process are enough. There must be continuous meetings on general and special issues. The general issues relate to the Arab-Israeli talks. The specific issues deal with each track. This will save us from suspicion and from falling into Israeli traps. ['Awdah] I take it from what you say that the state of your relatonship with 'Arafat is fine? [Abu-Sharif] Yes, it is as you describe. ['Awdah] But you are in Amman now, while Tunis swarms with top Israeli, Russian, and U.S. officials, including Dennis Ross. Aren't you being marginalized? [Abu-Sharif] I haven't been to Amman for a long time. I am here visiting relatives and friends. I leave for Tunis tomorrow. I know that Israeli, U.S., and Russian delegations are in Tunis to promote the implementation of the latest UN Security Council resolution. ['Awdah] Hasn't 'Arafat invited you to join these talks? [Abu-Sharif] I am returning to my office in Tunis. ['Awdah] Do you have anything against the Cairo negotiations? [Abu-Sharif] People may have their own opinions about the peace process and the media handling of it. ['Awdah] Can you be more specific? [Abu-Sharif] Take the Hebron massacre, for example. The tragedy might have been seized upon to put Israel on the spot. The tragic massacre stigmatizes not only Israel but the entire West. We should have mounted a worldwide campaign that did not stop until Israel was forced into drawing up a timetable for the withdrawal of settlers from the occupied territories, simultaneously with the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The issue is not about disarming the settlers. The settlers and settlements are part of the establishment of occupation. This objective might have been obtained away from the battlefield or even the diplomatic front. Ninety-five precent of a campaign for such an objective must be fought through the media. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a black chapter in the annals of the West. We ought to have used it to mobilize world opinion and put all the governments of the West in the dock. Let me ask you this: Suppose a Palestinian extremist shot 10 worshipers at the Wailing Wall? How would the Israelis have handled such an incident? Wouldn't they have turned the world upside down? ['Awdah] And since, as you say, your relationship with 'Arafat is fine and you are his media adviser, what stopped you from launching this media campaign? [Abu-Sharif] No comment. ['Awdah] Then you are not 'Arafat's media adviser any more? [Abu-Sharif] I still hold that position. I have no regrets over my optimistic outlook about the peace process. ['Awdah] At the 20th session of the Palestine National Council in Algiers, you told me you were optimistic about the chances of an independent Palestinian state. Now, three years on, nothing significant has been achieved. [Abu-Sharif] I never had any illusions that the peace process would be not be long and arduous. Even now, I dare say that, in spite of everything, the peace process will move forward. The whole exercise is not up to the local players. There is the international community's will to put in place the land-for-peace formula, no matter how much time and effort, and even blood, that will take. Israel is in a difficult position. It is not as if it is being dragged to the peace process against its will. Peace advances its own interests. However, it is an illusion to think that the peace process will be an easy ride. After all, we are negotiating with an enemy. Once again, let me stress that without proper and real intra-Arab coordination, between the Palestinians and Jordanians in particular, we will get nowhere. ['Awdah] I would like to remind you that, in Algiers, you told me the peace process would lead to peace, an independent state, and Jerusalem. [Abu-Sharif] I still say the same. The peace process has not moved very far, but it will snowball as soon as Israel begins to withdraw from Jericho and Gaza. When withdrawal begins, the snowball will create its own momentum, grow larger, create a totally new psychological climate, and make it impossible for settlers to stay in a predominantly Arab environment that was usurped by colonialist aggression. We have to start the process, Once the withdrawal begins, it will continue until the end. ['Awdah] They say you have a personal view about unity between Jordan and Palestine. [Abu-Sharif] Union between Jordan and Palestine exists. What separates them is the Israeli occupation. Logically and psychologically, you cannot divide a family, half of which is in Amman and the other half is in Jerusalem. ['Awdah] Has 'Arafat assigned new duties to you? Have you anything to say about that? [Abu-Sharif] Certain duties do not need statements. This is natural. ['Awdah] You were the first to call for a Palestinian-Israeli meeting. Do you regret it? [Abu-Sharif] This is true, and I do not regret the initiative. I was the first to propose the implementation of the international resolutions through direct negotiations with Israel and under the slogan of establishing an independent Palestinian state that will live in peace next to Israel. It is not land for peace, but land and a state for peace. I still demand the same, and I call for the implementation of Resolution 242. By the way, this resolution applies to East Jerusalem, too. It is wrong to raise an argument about this issue and to deal with Jerusalem separately. Resolution 242 covers East Jerusalem automatically. Therefore, it is wrong to deal with the issue of Jerusalem as if it were a separate issue. Dealing with Jerusalem separately will enable other parties to say yes or no, while insisting on Resolution 242, which covers Jerusalem, means it is natural for Jerusalem to be included in Resolution 242. ['Awdah] You prepared for the political process before the Madrid conference. You may have read unpublished documents in which the United States made promises to President 'Arafat and then ignored them. [Abu-Sharif] Yes, Washington and the PLO exchanged documents, including the letter of invitation to the peace conference and the letter of assurances. These are documented. However, I can say a certain party may disavow such documents when the political situation changes. What is important is that the Arab front should remain unified to impose its respect on other parties. ['Awdah] Are there documents other than the letter of invitation to the peace conference and the letter of assurances? [Abu-Sharif] President Bush and President Clinton exchanged official letters and documents, which contain a U.S. pledge to implement the land-for-peace formula and Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, to give the Palestinian people their full legitimate political rights, and to guarantee Israel's security. All these documents were worked out before and after the Madrid conference. ['Awdah] Did the PLO and Washington exchange secret documents and letters? [Abu-Sharif] Undoubtedly. There are secret things and documents that have not been published. ['Awdah] Do you believe Washington's decision to abstain from voting on the paragraphs of the recent UN Security Council Resolution Number 904 pertaining to Jerusalem and the occupied territories reflects a U.S. retreat from pledges it has made to Palestinians? [Abu-Sharif] I do not believe this reflects a U.S. retreat. In the same vein, I cannot see it as reconfirmation of previous U.S. stands on the issue. Washington's abstention from voting on the paragraph pertaining to Jerusalem has clouded the issue. Hence, the U.S. position must be clarified. The U.S. Administration cannot provide an explanation for its stand unless Arab negotiators make a joint official demand, asking the United States to explain its position. For my part, I support His Majesty King Husayn, who recently said he will demand an official explanation for Washington's decision to abstain from voting, because abstention is neither yes nor no. We do have official letters from the United States, explaining its position toward occupied East Jerusalem. ['Awdah] You are reported to have had your own views toward the Cairo and Oslo accords. Given the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, what do you have to say? [Abu-Sharif] I believe events have superseded these two agreements. For example, in the Oslo accord, the Israelis did not acknowledge the need for an international presence in the occupied territories. But, in the aftermath of the massacre, the Israeli Government endorsed an international presence. This step forward is not enshrined in the accord. The Israeli Government agreed to deem two Israeli organizations extremist and terrorist to pave the way for evicting them from the city of Hebron. This is another step forward. Additionally, the release of a large number of Palestinians is an accomplishment, because it was not scheduled. Undoubtedly, the talks currently under way in Tunis are addressing the ways and means of implementing UN Security Council Resolution 904. The talks are addressing the definition of international protection. The deployment of Palestinian policemen in the city of Hebron was not enshrined in the Oslo accord. ['Awdah] You have deemed the Oslo accord an accomplishment, although you have not contributed to it. However, it is reported that your private comments on this accord are different from the public comments you make on it. How true is this? [Abu-Sharif] There is no doubt that the Oslo accord is a significant accomplishment. I have articulated this position in private and public. This is because we will establish Palestinian national authority on any inch of territory Israeli troops vacate, as the Palestine National Council sessions of 1977 and 1974 advocated. Israel has agreed to withdraw from the territories. Anyone who believes liberation is achievable by a knockout stroke is wrong. The liberation of our Palestinian territories is achievable only by degrees. The important thing is that we remain steadfast until the implementation of the international legitimacy resolutions, after which there will be comprehensive peace. Comprehensive peace will be the outcome of joint struggle by all Arab sides. ['Awdah] I would like to raise the question I first posed to you regarding the reports that Yasir 'Arafat has marginalized your role after he reached the conclusion that the Palestinian information institution has failed to pave the way for an agreement with Israel. Likewise, the Palestinian negotiators have failed to reach an agreement with Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinian secret channels have been successful in this regard. What is your comment on all this? [Abu-Sharif] Failure and success cannot be judged by a single specific issue. We should use the terms success and failure when we address the overall outlook regarding the accomplishments of the Palestinian information institutions, the magnitude and effectiveness of which vary. Hence, I cannot speak of the success or failure of the information institution, because there are actually various information institutions. But, the Palestinian information institutions can undoubtedly do more and do better to address events and developments.
