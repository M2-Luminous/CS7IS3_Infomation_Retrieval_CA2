Fomicheva and Yu. Trefilov: "A Rayon for Three"] [Text] The protracted struggle to merge three St. Petersburg rayons--Smolninskiy, Dzerzhinskiy, and Kuybyshevskiy--is over. At a meeting of rayon activists, which took place in the district Officers House yesterday, the city mayor introduced the head of administration of the new--Central--rayon. The person appointed to this job is 47-year-old Anatoliy Borisovich Chaus, who until recently was head of the Smolninskiy Rayon administration. "In creating the Central Rayon," said A.A. Sobchak, "we are bringing it closer to city standards. It will have a population of 330,000, which is in line with other rayons. The main point of this merger is the communality of interests typical of the center of the city. This involves first and foremost the restoration and reconstruction of residential housing and engineering communications. The rayon's enlargement is also dictated by the need to carry out large-scale projects--such as the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center, the Apraksin Mart, and the creation of a tourist center." There are 44,360 families needing improvement of their living conditions currently residing in the central part of the city. Practically no new housing is being built. If one old quarter after another undergoes reconstruction, however, this problem may be solved: this way, the refurbished housing stock may be increased two- to threefold. Anatoliy Aleksandrovich answered many questions, including on particular subjects. Regarding the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo Higher Navy Engineering School located in the Admiralty building, the mayor said that the initiative of moving the school out of it comes from the Leningrad Navy Base Commander V. Grishanov. After the notorious fire in the Admiralty, he appealed to the Russian Ministry of Defense to move the school to Pushkino. City residents asked the mayor about rumors of the imminent resignation of GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs] chief Arkadiy Kramarev. The mayor said that he does not have any personal dislike for the major general and considers him a good professional and a worthy person. However, in Anatoliy Sobchak's opinion, with all his positive qualities, the GUVD chief lacked the firmness to remove "old school" staff from the main administration's apparat, which affects the work of law enforcement organs. One of the mayor's negative comments was that, in selecting his cadres, he frequently prefers those who previously worked in party structures. "I hear both this sort of accusations, and the opposite. I select professionals for their business qualities on the premise that they leave all their old beliefs outside the door of their new offices and work honestly and conscientiously in the new environment."
