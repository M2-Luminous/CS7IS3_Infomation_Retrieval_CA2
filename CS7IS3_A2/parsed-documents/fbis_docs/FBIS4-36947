[Al-Hariri] They have been integrated into the system. Their leaders have handed over their weapons. Now there is a single army of 50,000 men, partly volunteers and partly draftees, within which the representatives of those armed groupings account for no more than 10 percent, which is answerable to a single defense minister and which is obedient to the Council of Ministers and the national Parliament. [Frescobaldi] What role do you think a new Lebanon can perform in the region? [Al-Hariri] First, a role as a catalyst in finance, trade, and the promotion of light industry, which are its traditional tasks. But also a role in stimulating culture and advancing democracy on the basis of its own experiences. I can cite evidence of this. In recent days we held the funerals of the victims of the latest bombardments -- outright massacres. There were tens of thousands of people there, but not a single shot was fired. Everything went calmly. This means that people no longer want anything more to do with trouble, and that they respect the power of the state, the police, and the Army. [Frescobaldi] In this situation a threat could nevertheless stem from Islamic fundamentalism. [Al-Hariri] I will answer you with a question: In a country where tourism is so important to everyone -- as are finance, culture, and openness to the world, for that matter -- in a multi-confessional country comprising both Christians and Muslims, what kind of role do you think the fundamentalists could have? Merely a trouble-making role. The fact is that the fundamentalists have no future in Lebanon, even if they may receive help from here and there. The majority of Lebanese have now converted to moderation. [Frescobaldi] We must not forget that this is taking place against the background of an overall peace process. How optimistic are you in this regard? [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you that the Arabs have decided to make peace and are ready in this regard. Now it is up to Israel to decide. It must decide what its role is to be in the region. If the Israelis want to be dominators, it means that they will have many problems. If, however, they want to be a country that lives in peace with its neighbors, then I think peace is very near. And with regard to the 12 percent of our territory that is occupied, it must be returned to us to the very last inch. [Frescobaldi] So can we talk in terms of a miracle in connection with Lebanon? [Al-Hariri] Why not? We are one of the few countries whose currency is not only stable but is also growing stronger, albeit not by much. Where investments are flowing in from all over the Arab world, where the private sector is forging ahead. As for the Europeans, they come here to work; to sign contracts; to sell supplies, especially for construction; and to bring know-how. [Frescobaldi] What does Italy do? [Al-Hariri] It too is taking part. It has concluded a good contract in the electrical field. As for your ambassador, he is causing us... [Al-Hariri ends] [Frescobaldi] The interview ended here because al-Hariri made me switch off the tape recorder. But he made me understand that the Lebanese Government would not be displeased if the ambassador were to be replaced.
