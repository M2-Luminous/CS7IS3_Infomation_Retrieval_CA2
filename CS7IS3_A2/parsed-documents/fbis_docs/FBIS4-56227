De Leon also spoke about the provisional constitutional protection decree issued by the Supreme Court of Justice in the face of this challenge. [Begin de Leon recording] The political aspect has been resolved. The executive branch no longer has anything to do with the elections taking place. This is now the Supreme Electoral Tribunal's problem. Challenges of this nature are common under a legal regime. The appropriate constitutional organizations, in this case the highest constitutional justice organization, will decide the constitutionality of the elections. The executive branch no longer has anything to do with that. I say this because once these phases are over and we have institutional and political stability and because we have seen positive results in these areas, we have to dedicate ourselves more fervently to resolving economic and social problems.
