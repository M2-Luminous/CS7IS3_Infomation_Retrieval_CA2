FBIS4-28189 "dreas110_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 North Korea ROK `Military Provocations' Denounced ROK `Military Provocations' Denounced SK0606110494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1046 GMT 6 Jun 94 SK0606110494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets have committed military provocations in an unbroken chain in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) in June, getting on our nerves, according to military sources. On June 3, they openly brought recoilless guns in the DMZ in front of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, in the central sector of the front, and two mortars in the DMZ in front of Maebong Peak in Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, in the Eastern sector of the front and installed them toward the North side and conducted fire service drills. More than 300 fully armed bandits of the puppet army who scrawled into the DMZ of the central sector of the front on June 1 and 2 maliciously got on the nerves of our People's Army soldiers, taking a sighting posture against the North side all at once. The South Korean puppets illegally brought over 2,500 armed bandits and 1,400 odd vehicles of different types in the DMZ from June 1 to 4 for war exercises, search operations and excavation of positions. Such military provocations and criminal acts were premeditated acts to incite the North-South confrontation and deliberately aggravate the situation in the DMZ. We cannot overlook such hostile acts of the South Korean puppets, still less because they timed to coincide with the bellicose outbursts of the U.S. military brasshats and traitors against the northern half of Korea. The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, deeply mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their military provocations and violations in the DMZ of the MDL along which the armed forces of the two sides stand in acute confrontation.
