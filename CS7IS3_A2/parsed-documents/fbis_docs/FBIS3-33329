Carlos Alejandro Tello, the designated Mexican ambassador to Cuba, said Mexico "will maintain its policy rejecting the U.S. blockade against Cuba, implemented more than 30 years ago, and will advocate its elimination because it harms the Cuban people." Asked if the Mexican Foreign Secretariat has asked its diplomats to report on the Chiapas situation in the countries where they are accredited, Tello said "we were instructed to tell the truth from the start of the incidents." He added that "if I am confirmed as ambassador to Cuba, I will do as I did in Moscow; I will say it is a local problem, a Mexican problem. There should be no foreign intervention and a political solution will be sought through dialogue." He said he has received no special instructions for carrying out his duties in Cuba. "Mexico will not only maintain the excellent and solid relations that currently exist, but will strengthen them by redoubling efforts in the areas of tourism, oil, and industry," he stressed. Tello, who has been the Mexican ambassador to Portugal and Russia, among other positions, expects to be confirmed ambassador to Cuba by a Congressional plenum on Wednesday [23 February].
