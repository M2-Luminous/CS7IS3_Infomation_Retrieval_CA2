What is the size of the deficit today? [Filkus] As of today, the deficit stands at Sk7.5 billion. This demonstrates that the assumption of a deficit at the level of Sk14 billion by the end of the year, which was viewed [by the previous government] as a realistic macroeconomic indicator, was not a realistic macroeconomic assumption.
