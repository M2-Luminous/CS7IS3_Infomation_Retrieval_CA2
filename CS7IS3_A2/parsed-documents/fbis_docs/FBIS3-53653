Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that according to Minister Sarid's announcement, the issue has never come up in the cabinet and no decision has ever been made. Minister Sarid said it would be appropriate for elections to be held after an accord with Syria is initialed. He believes that the government can win a solid majority in these elections since the peace and security package which will be presented to the public will be most convincing. Deputy Minister Gur said that the government would call for a referendum if called to make important concessions on the Golan Heights. In a Knesset debate on the future of the plateau, Deputy Minister Gur said that his remarks have the approval of the prime minister and the entire cabinet. He also said that Israel learned after the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting that Syria insists on receiving the entire Golan Heights in return for peace. He noted that in the negotiations with Syria, we will insist on all the security components based on our concepts. The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs opposes the motion by Likud Knesset Member Zakhi Hanegbi to hold elections prior to the signing of a peace accord which includes giving up any territory or which mentions the setting up of a Palestinian self- government in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the ministerial committee opposes the motion on the grounds that it refers to a clear-cut political issue.
