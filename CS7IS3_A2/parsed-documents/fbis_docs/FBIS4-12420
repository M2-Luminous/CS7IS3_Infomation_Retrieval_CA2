The representative of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, in Tehran described the stance of the UN Security Council as spiteful. He said: This proves that the Palestinian nation should not expect sympathy from the United Nations or the Security Council, because they have always remained silent in the face of the daily murder of Palestinian women and children by the Zionists.
