Moravcik met Horn during his visit to Bratislava before the elections. Nevertheless Moravcik, who was optimistic about chances of a Slovak-Hungarian dialogue when he came to power in mid-March, said he did not expect a basic inter-state treaty to be concluded before the parliamentary elections which will end his cabinet's term. Early elections are to be held on September 30 and October 1. "It cannot be expected that the whole process of preparation, conclusion, signing and ratification of the basic treaty of good neighbourly relations could be managed within such a short time span. This is technically entirely ruled out, but we can take important steps to this effect," Moravcik said. Bratislava hopes the treaty will confirm the existing border between Slovakia and Hungary, which were set by international conferences following World War One and which have been challenged by certain forces in Hungary. Budapest on the other hand hopes for an extension of the rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. Some 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live Slovakia, constituting about 11 percent of its total population. The two countries are also facing other pending problems, such as the a dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube, discords over the temporary division of the Danube waters, non-existence of a readmission agreement and the opening of new border crossings which Slovakia conditions by the conclusion of the readmission agreement.
