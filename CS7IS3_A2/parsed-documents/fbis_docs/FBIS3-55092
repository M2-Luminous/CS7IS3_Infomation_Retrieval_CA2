It was reported that Zviad Gamsakhurdia had committed suicide on the night of 30 to 31 December 1993 in one of the western areas of Georgia. The ex-president's last statement, issued today in Groznyy, makes the point that he performed this act consciously as a protest against the existing regime in Georgia. Nothing is yet known about the reaction of official Tbilisi to Zviad Gamsakhurdia's suicide.
