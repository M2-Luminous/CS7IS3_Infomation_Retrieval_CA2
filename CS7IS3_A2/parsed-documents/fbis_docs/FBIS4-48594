The transfer of three million hectares scattered throughout the province was effected in terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act, passed by the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly and assented to by De Klerk on April 25 this year. In terms of the legislation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, the sole trustee, will administer all tribal land in the province -- with the cost of administration being borne by the new regional government. It covers all the land for which the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly was established in 1971 and land acquired by the KwaZulu government under various proclamations and laws since then. It appears that under pressure from the KwaZulu government, De Klerk moved to prevent KwaZulu-administered tribal land from falling under state control -- the automatic effect of the new constitution, which kicked in on April 27 -- in an apparent sop to the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in exchange for its participation in the April poll. A source close to Andre Fourie, the former minister of regional and land affairs, said the land transfer had been part of negotiations between the National Party government, the ANC and the IFP. But ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa, who played a key role in the negotiations leading to the IFP's participation in the elections, denied this: "The Ingonyama Trust doesn't mean a thing to me; I'm hearing about it for the first time. I doubt very much that Nelson Mandela would have known about it. You are drawing a blank from me." President Nelson Mandela's office was yesterday unable to comment, as was the office of Zwelithini. ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal also appeared dumbfounded when approached this week. Regional supremo Jacob Zuma said he knew nothing of the transfer, and knew of no one else in the ANC who was aware of it. "It is surprising that this happened just before the election." And in a furious reaction, ANC Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimane said: "The fact that this was done behind the backs of people and through an illegitimate bantustan structure seems to indicate that it was aimed at undermining any constitutional accommodation of the king by the ANC. "It seems to have been aimed at ensuring that KwaZulu retained actual control of the land even if it was disbanded." Also unaware of the transfer was Roelf Meyer, the NP's [National Party] central constitutional negotiator; Conie de Villiers, director-general of land affairs -- who said "nobody consulted me about this Act" -- and the new Minister of Land Affairs, Derek Hanekom, who said he was "shocked" by the move. "Effectively the land that was KwaZulu is no longer state land," Hanekom said. "It's in private ownership, held in trust by the king." He added: "My ministry will be raising the issue politically and will be carrying out a full investigation to find out on whose ultimate authority the transfer was affected. "We have consistently tried to get a moratorium on the transfer and sale of state land, but we never thought bantustan land would be transferred. "There are potentially grave political implications and we're deeply concerned." He hinted that the National Assembly might overturn the legislation. Some IFP sources described the formation of the Ingonyama Trust as a "house-keeping arrangement" between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and De Klerk's governments before their demise -- and an attempt to protect the monarch from possible ANC rule in KwaZulu/Natal. "The chances of the land ever being alienated (from the king) are now remote in the extreme," said an IFP source. Zuma insisted the formation of the Ingonyama Trust was not part of the agreement that brought the IFP into elections. "We made an elaborate proposal for the monarchy so far as KwaZulu/Natal is concerned which we still have to iron out in the provincial constitution." Observers believe the legislation has far-reaching implications: it means that future governments in the province will have to gain Zwelithini's permission -- or the permission of his chiefs or any other representative he charges with decision-making responsibility over the trust land -- before engaging in any development on the land in question. It means that land earmarked for redistribution in terms of the ANC's land reform plans is no longer available to the central state. Barely 300,000ha [hectares] of state land is now available for redistribution. The formation of the trust also consolidates the relationship between Zwelithini and chiefs, as they will now be reliant on him for development in their areas -- and will reduce the prospect of an ANC-led government in KwaZulu/Natal winning major support among IFP- aligned traditional rulers. Lawyers contacted yesterday stressed the land deal had not gone before the Transitional Executive Council which had overthrown other land decisions. They also said that a challenge to the land transfer could be mounted. In terms of court precedents, changes to the ownership status of state land could not be made without consultation with the effected parties.
