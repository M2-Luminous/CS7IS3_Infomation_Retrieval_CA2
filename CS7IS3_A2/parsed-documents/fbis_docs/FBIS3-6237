"With the question of politicians and money drawing attention, Mr. Hosokawa has not told the truth of whether he was given the money or borrowed it, leaving the matter unresolved," Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said Sunday [13 March]. Mori, in a move to throw down the gauntlet to the governing coalition, warned that his party will refuse to begin a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee to discuss the national budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1, until the premier proves his innocence. Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a now-defunct parcel delivery company, in 1982 and repaid the money nine years later. But the LDP, toppled from power last summer for the first time in nearly four decades, has retorted it is unclear how the premier used the money and how he returned it to the creditor. Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, which has since been absorbed into Sagawa Kyubin Co., a Kyoto-based parent company, was embroiled in a massive money-and-mob scandal in 1992 and 1993 that implicated former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and disgraced LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru. One element compounding the matter is Hosokawa's inconsistent and less-than persuasive explanations about his receipt and repayment of the money. This has caused the LDP to suspect that it was not a loan that the premier obtained, but an illicit donation. Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo to the Diet that he borrowed the 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, former chairman of Sagawa Kyubin, through Tokyo Sagawa in September 1982 to buy a condominium in Tokyo and repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture, southwestern Japan. He also explained he paid back the money by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor, in addition to using the proceeds from the sale of a plot of land in Tokyo. But the LDP has pointed out that Hosokawa could not have received the retirement allowance before he finished his second four-year term as governor in February 1991, raising doubts about the premier's accounts. With the memo also showing that Hosokawa purchased the Tokyo condominium in July 1982, two months before he borrowed the money from Sagawa, the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) have charged that the premier used the money to secure his campaign funds for a Kumamoto gubernatorial election one year later. Furthermore, Hosokawa's failure to submit to the Diet all the receipts he must have accepted from Sagawa if he really repaid the money sparked a barrage of criticism from the opposition camp that the premier took the money as an illegal political donation, not as what he insists was a loan. Dissatisfied with Hosokawa's explanations, the LDP and the JCP successfully forced the lower house budget panel, in an unusual move, to ask the government to submit to the Diet detailed documents concerning Hosokawa's payment of the Sagawa money. Although the government presented some documents relating to the loan last Friday, the two parties laughed them off and refused to set a timetable for Diet discussion on the key budget unless the government submits further detailed documents. "If Mr. Hosokawa can have the public understand he really paid back the money, we believe we do not have to question him any further and discuss this matter any longer," Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee, said Monday. "But he has only widened doubts regarding the question of how specifically he returned it," Ozato said, adding that the party will leave the matter of setting a schedule of budget discussion up to a group of directors of the lower house budget panel for a little longer. The government and the ruling coalition aim to have the fiscal 1994 national budget passed through the Diet by mid-May and minimize the effects of the delayed Diet deliberations on the ailing Japanese economy. As Hosokawa postponed the formulation of the budget from the end of last year till early this year to concentrate on Diet deliberations on his cherished political reform, the start of budget debate has been delayed until mid-March or later for the first time since 1967.
