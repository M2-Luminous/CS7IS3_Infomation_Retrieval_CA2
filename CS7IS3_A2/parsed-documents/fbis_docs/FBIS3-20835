According to the bills on the Radio-TV which DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] and the SRS [Serbian Radical Party] have prepared, each on its own, the Assembly would reassume power over operation of television --from Appointment of the general director to definition of programming policy. According to the case made by the Radicals and DEPOS, television would thereby cease to be a one-party institution, and its pluralization would automatically terminate the influence which the Socialists have at the moment on the shape of TV programs. "We are in a big hurry," says Zarko Korac of the Citizens Alliance [GS], explaining that the reasons for this lie in precisely what television is showing and that the solutions proposed, again because of the hurry, can be referred to as "initial and transitional." The Bills One of the differences between the two opposition bills lies in the institution of the programming committee, an idea that is backed in DEPOS; it would have 20 members (half from among people's deputies and the other half made up of figures in science, culture and public life, along with three members from Radio-TV). The principal tasks of the programming committee, as seen by the people from DEPOS, would be to appoint editors in chief and managing editors, to establish overall radio and television policy and to set down the rules for presentation of party programs and candidates over radio and television during the election campaign. In their bill the Radicals assign these functions to the managing board, and both parties envisage the institution of an oversight committee, which is also quite well-known already. The Radicals try to solve the problem of the general director by having him chosen after each election, and DEPOS with a provision prohibiting him from any participation in a body of government or in the parliament itself (Milorad Vucelic, the present general director, heads the caucus of the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] in the Serbian Assembly). The Radicals and DEPOS differ in the way they solve the problem of allocation of radio frequencies. In the DEPOS version this function would also be assigned to the Assembly, that is, to a committee which it chooses, while the Radicals would leave the question of frequencies to the Government, which would allocate them according to criteria proposed in the Radical Law on Radio-Television. To be sure, the Government will also operate through a commission, but the influence of the Assembly would be that the Committee for Culture and Information would nominate to the Government candidates for membership on the commission. In addition to the attempt to solve the problem which is obviously the main one for the opposition -- television, in DEPOS they have gone a step further and also drafted a proposed Law on Information. The most important thing in that bill is that it envisages the existence of several, not just one, newspaper organization and the institution of the ombudsman. According to the conception, the ombudsman would be a single official elected by the Assembly and nominated by the relevant committee of the Assembly, and his principal task would be to protect the public's right to know. He would be chosen from among the ranks of experts in communication science, law and journalism; he would work independently (in response to complaints and requests of legal entities and individuals), and his decisions would be binding on those in positions of responsibility. Aside from the purely mathematical problem that would arise if the parties do not dovetail their bills and if they should get in a situation where they cannot get a sufficient number of votes for them, there are several other stumbling blocks for everything the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived. "Neither of the bills really gets to a mastodon like Radio-TV Serbia, nor do they establish new rules of the game," says Professor Dragor Hiber, himself a member of the GS, and he adds: "If the idea is to change one master for another, then that is a bad idea, and in addition it is condemned to failure for the simple reason that the opposition does not have the votes to get it through the parliament." Defects Professor Hiber believes that it makes no difference which majority party has a decisive influence on television, remarking that experience (both our own and abroad) indicates that at some point that influence can be cemented into place. Worst of all, once that happens, television and the person who controls it have every opportunity to help one another in preventing any change whatsoever. The problem which Professor Hiber mentions pertains to literally everything which the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived in their bills. All the good intentions will depend, that is, on the one who has the majority in the Assembly, so that what could easily happen in the future is that one of the figures of Radio-TV Serbia, hated by the opposition, might become the "fair-minded ombudsman," and the programming or oversight committee of television would go on doing the same things as the oversight committee for monitoring the election. The opposition, then, omitted to concern itself with the most important thing in this entire tale -- establishing clear rules of the game that would not depend on the momentary balance of power in the parliament and that would prevent all the well-known evils familiar to us, from bribery to blackmail. Neither of the sponsors has any explanation for this omission other than haste. The main issues have been left for some time in the future, when presumably there would be less haste and less fear of the "TV Bastille." At the moment the most important thing for the opposition is to change at least the turnkey in the ill-famed fortress. In Professor Hiber's opinion, there is a mistake even in that notion, since it could easily happen that the opposition's bill, if it should pass the Assembly, would be struck down in the Constitutional Court. "The constitution, which calls for a separation of powers, sees the Assembly concerning itself with general enactments, not individual enactments, while the DEPOS bill envisages a number of individual enactments through commissions that would concern themselves with particular matters, which is certainly unconstitutional." The Ground in Between Acknowledging that these bills nevertheless represent "transitional solutions," Dragor Hiber also said that the most important thing would be to take away from Radio-TV Serbia its undeserved title to the infrastructure (transmitters and frequencies -- the Radical bill contains something like that) and then to compel it to concern itself with its own programming, in which it would be subject to strict rules. The laws of the market (in obtaining frequencies) and those same rules of the game envisaged by law in creating programming that would apply to government television ought to apply to the other, nongovernmental, television stations, which on this occasion were not a concern of either the Radicals or DEPOS, which left them in some middle ground not regulated by anything, according to Professor Hiber. The Radicals, it is true, envisage certain rules for allocating and taking away radio frequencies, but even that concept breaks down as soon as one moves on to the parts of the bill concerned with government television. The essence of even their bill lies in minuscule limitation of the influence of the Socialists today -- that is, in taking control tomorrow if they get in power.
