FR941222-0-00008 FR941222-0-00002 9 CFR Part 94 [Docket No. 94&hyph;083&hyph;2] Change in Disease Status of Portugal Because of BSE AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations by adding Portugal to the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists, because the disease has been detected in native cattle in that country. The interim rule prohibited or restricted the importation of certain fresh, chilled, and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts from ruminants which have been in Portugal. The interim rule was necessary to reduce the risk that BSE could be introduced into the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 23, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Kathleen Akin, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 755, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7830. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In an interim rule effective September 9, 1994, and published in the Federal Register on September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47235&hyph;47236, Docket No. 94&hyph;083&hyph;1), we amended the regulations in 9 CFR part 94 by adding Portugal to the list of countries where BSE exists in ยง94.18. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before November 14, 1994. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.
