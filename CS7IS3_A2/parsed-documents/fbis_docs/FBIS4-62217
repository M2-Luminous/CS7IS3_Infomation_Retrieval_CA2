For this purpose a special regime should be imposed on the Russian capital similar to the one which was in effect during Olympic games of 1980. The LDPR faction in the State Duma suggested today that the parliament should consider a bill on the special regime in Moscow for a term of six months. "During this period of time the government of Moscow backed by law enforcement bodies could cleanse the capital of all guest criminals and socially dangerous elements", a statement of the LDPR press sevice said on Thursday. Zhirinovskiy's party believes such measure "will be praised by Muscovites who are living now under conditions of the unprecedented orgy of crime, violence, and hooliganism". According to the press service, Muscovites "identify this orgy with the present rule of democrats". Back in 1980, a few weeks before the begining of the Olympic games Moscow police and security staged a remarkable operation evacuating practically all prostitutes, tramps and petty criminals to at least 100 kilometres from Moscow. The operation was a success and carried out within a few days. But, of course, it was far less prostitutes and tramps in Moscow in 1980 than it is now.
