According to Pekkarinen, who spoke in Marttila, the result is clearly worse than expected both in regional policy and in the food industry. According to Pekkarinen, membership of the EU would create extra costs of nearly 10 billion Finnish markkas for next year's state budget. According to him, what is now fundamental is which national measures are to be taken. According to the minister of the interior, the national referendum should be arranged only after the Swedish national referendum.
