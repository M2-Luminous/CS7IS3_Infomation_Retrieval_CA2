However, it should be admitted that these problems have not diminished since then, but, as it seems, have only been aggravated. Nonetheless, according to competent people, possibilities for the normalization of Ukraine's external economic relations have not yet been exhausted. We have asked Serhiy Osyka, Ukraine's deputy minister for external economic relations, to tell us about current economic relations between Ukraine and the West. [Osyka] Let us look at things objectively -- many problems facing Ukraine's gaining a strong foothold in Western markets are caused not by economic factors, but by political ones. I will give only one example, but an exponential one. If one were to analyze the course of events connected with the problem of assets and liabilities of the former Soviet Union, one may discern an essential unbalance between Western countries' positions on this issue. This past year's decision by the Paris Club to defer the debts of the former USSR, in general, took into account only Russia's interests. The point is that the assets of the former USSR are still working only for Russia. However, these assets belonged formerly to all republics of the Union, including Ukraine. To assess more clearly how this affects our state interests, let us recall that these assets include the debt obligations of many countries of the former USSR (amounting to almost $100 billion), which may be used as stocks and bonds on international share markets; they also include a great deal of immovable property abroad, as well as know-how and technology, primarily in the branch of precision machine building; lastly, they include trademarks and brands, which bring in many millions [currency not specified] in income. A few more concrete examples. As a result of Ukraine's undergoing the routine of controls over space technologies, according to many politicians, the situation has become inequitable. A package of Russian agreements related to the joining of an international space program are being implemented to a large extent (practically 80 percent) by Ukrainian industry. First of all, these are such systems as "Zenith" and "Tsyklon," which are being produced in Ukraine. The second example: The Plodimport foreign trade association of the former USSR has automatically become Russia's foreign trade association. However, at one time in the past, the Plodimport production association sold the exclusive rights to use its trademark to the Pepsico company for a period of 20 years. This is an asset, too. Stolichnaya vodka has been produced with the significant participation of Ukrainian enterprises. Its trademark is one of the assets of the former USSR, as well. By now, this trademark is used by Russia only -- this means that we are cut off from this particular export market. However, annual profits for this export are measured in the billions. One more example: In 1992, President Yeltsin authorized sales of the Topaz-2 satellite system. The world was astonished by both this resolution and the ridiculously low asking price. Notwithstanding the fact that all the enterprises of the Topaz association are located in Ukraine, the Paris Club regarded their production as an asset of the former USSR. In this way, Ukraine is being cut off from markets which provide profits of many billions for goods and technology produced by generations of Ukrainian citizens. These are very essential limitations placed on the markets, from which Ukraine could draw money for its own work, instead of resolving its financial problems solely by means of credit. Thus, as you see, the worsening of the country's internal situation is connected with rather essential international factors, even though I do not exclude such reasons for our crisis as our legislative mistakes and many other problems which have been widely reported. However, without overcoming these negative external political factors, no resolute actions by the government and no new laws, on their own, will help us resolve this heap of problems. [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, these reasons, of which you has just spoken, cannot be easily managed. However, there are various internal problems in Ukraine, which are connected with exports and imports, are there not? [Osyka] One of the principal factors influencing the financial sphere and the stability of hard currency exchange rates is the following: The export capacity [eksportoyemnost] of Ukrainian industry and economy is much lower than our import capacity. Up to 1991, as you know, this problem was resolved at the expense of the USSR's export capacity. Our exports today are only a part of Ukraine's full export potential. They are practically incapable of securing our need for hard currency to upkeep the stable exchange rate of our currency; in addition, they secure our import needs only to the lowest degree, even in their most vital part. Ukraine's traditional exports are ferrous metals, chemical products, textile fabrics, and certain other goods. However, these very exports are faced with a sharp increase in production costs, which brings practically to naught the hard currency profitability of these products. For instance, fertilizer. The production of one tonne of carbimide or ammonia requires about one tonne of gas. Gas is priced at least at $65-70 per tonne, while carbimide is sold, depending on the season, at $75-100 per tonne. It is quite obvious that this product is becoming unprofitable. At the very best, output can be equal to input. Taking into account the energy-consuming production of metals (gas and coke are also involved), we see that the picture is much the same. Many products of the machine-building industry, especially new technologies as well as many products connected with machine-building services and installations, either are not allowed to enter external markets due to political reasons, or are again being considered as part of the former USSR assets. It should be no surprise to you that innumerable Ukrainian enterprises had been included in the closed production and technology cycles of the USSR. What was a production cooperative earlier, now must be restored by Ukraine on trade basis. It is, mind you, trade with imports. The consequence of all these factors is very simple: The export capacity, which is much lower that the import capacity, implies a hard-currency deficit. Due to such a situation -- regardless of whether mechanisms for regulating currency exchange rates include the policy of stock exchange sales -- the demand for hard currency always surpasses supply. This difficult situation makes it impossible to maintain a stable exchange rate by traditional methods (for instance, by National Bank interventions). We need a stabilization fund exceeding the demand for hard currency in a traditional situation to make use of Ukraine's full economic potential. Due to this situation, it is vitally important that we resolve a number of political and legal problems, in other words, to create a new legal area for the activity of Ukrainian entrepreneurs. Believe me, we are not sitting idly by. One of the principal directions is our active movement toward joining the GATT. Professionals, who are working on this endeavor (I am one of the heads of this group), assess the situation realistically. [Skachko] Serhiy Hryhorovych, you headed Ukraine's delegation to last year's GATT talks. What were the results of those talks? [Osyka] At that meeting, the GATT Council of Representatives approved a resolution on the creation of a working group for preparing a memorandum on Ukraine's joining GATT. Work on this document is still continuing. What kind of document is it? First of all, it is a detailed description of Ukraine's legislation connected directly or indirectly with various forms of foreign economic activity; in the first place, it is related to issues of foreign trade, administrative stages, custom duties, and tariffs. This is not simply a description of our laws; the memorandum is to include not only legislative bases, but also sublegislative [pidzakonny], departmental acts which constitute four-fifths of our legislative foundation. However, it is not all, either. The GATT document is to include a detailed analysis of the legislative situation in general, as well as, if necessary, additional explanations from individual points of view. We are asking GATT to grant us preferential status [rezhym], that is, the status of a country with a transforming economy. The memorandum is to supply the foundation underlaying a GATT resolution on our country. In fact, regardless of the talks on joining GATT, work on the memorandum is a good opportunity for ourselves to become familiar with the particulars of the law-governed state which we have today. Ukraine's second step toward joining GATT is in bringing its legislation in line with world standards, even if only to a minimal degree. It is a necessary condition for us to be equal trading partners with the world. There is a great mass of legislative work which must be carried out on a highly professional level. I would like to believe that a new parliament will include professionals who will be up to this task.
