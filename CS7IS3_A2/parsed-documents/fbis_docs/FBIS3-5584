Built by the Indonesian Army, it is home to 550 people who formerly carved out a subsistence life in the mountains. The village is part of the army's attempts to win the hearts and minds of the East Timorese. It features electricity, safe drinking water, a health centre, school, church, and satellite television, foreign and local. But despite such efforts to upgrade their living conditions, the East Timorese remain far from happy about Indonesian rule. "It will take a generation to integrate with Indonesia," says Marcus Wanandi, an Indonesian Jesuit priest who heads East Timor's largest school and the scion of a well-known Sumatera family. Indonesia's development spending in the province since it took over in 1975 from Portugal has borne some fruit; literacy has doubled from only 22 percent in 1980 to 44 percent in 1990. From a low of 61 schools under Portuguese rule, there are now more than 1,000. But 45 percent of the workforce are unemployed or underemployed and skilled people must migrate to find jobs. Much-needed investment from the rest of Indonesia is stymied by the perceived security problem and from outside because of East Timor's disputed status. The United Nations does not recognise Indonesia's takeover of the territory in 1975 after Portugal, the colonial power, left in a hurry. An even more fundamental problem blocking both development and successful integration into Indonesia is what the East Timorese see as Indonesia's failure to understand East Timor's culture. "Life for us did not begin in 1975," said Florentini Sarmento, head of Dili's largest grassroots aid organisation. "We have a different identity and a long history. East Timorese feel deeply misunderstood and mistreated by Indonesia." Bridging the cultural gap is not made any easier by the loss of virtually the entire Timorese educated elite, now resident overseas, mainly in Portugal and Australia. Senior Indonesians from other areas may find it difficult to believe that the poor who remain behind are anything more than an extremely backward native ethnic group similar to the many others found in the archipelago. [passage omitted] There are now hints, however, that Indonesia is coming to a realisation after almost 20 years that the approach used so far in trying to integrate East Timor is not very successful. At the same time, some formerly hardline Timorese an also willing to explore ways of moving forward. The recent discovery of oil offshore in the Timor Gap area could spur efforts to improve the political climate as it holds out the promise of higher economic growth. [passage omitted] But the development of East Timor will need to take into account cultural differences far more than is normal in Indonesia if it is to be successful. These need not, however, be a barrier. Indeed, to a foreign tourist, Timor's cultural differences would be seen a an asset, not a burden. If the East Timorese were treated as a potential asset and as partners in their own development, it is far more likely that they would appreciate Indonesia's efforts on their behalf. If not, their cultural pride could create major problems for Indonesia for some time to come.
