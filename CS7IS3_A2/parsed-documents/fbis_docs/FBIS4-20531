Thirty-four years after the discovery of the first laser, another generational shift in high-efficiency lasers is again approaching with the transition from tube technology to semi-conductor technology, or from gas laser to diode laser. In the areas of entertainment electronics and communications and information technology, the replacement of tube technology with semiconductor technology has already made possible and produced revolutionary developments. It is expected that a similar major advance in technology and development in [the area of] high-efficiency lasers will fundamentally shape future laser equipment technology and open up new fields of application. The German government intends to support this development with the joint Laser 2000 program, which Federal Minister of Research and Technology Paul Krueger has now introduced in Bonn. Preparing the generational shift in technology with high-efficiency lasers is the object and goal of the pilot project, already started at the beginning of the year, on high-efficiency diode lasers and diode-pumped solid-state lasers. It has to do with developing a small, compact, high-efficiency, low- maintenance laser. It is expected that such an generation of lasers will open up broad markets. Materials processing in particular is being considered in this context, as well as using laser technology for television. Substantial work was already done on the high-efficiency diode laser in the second half of the 1980's in America under the strictest secrecy in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory within the framework of the former SDI program. One important field of application which stands in the forefront is automobile manufacturing. The German government is hoping that with the current Laser 2000 program the present lead by the United States will be overtaken. So the project will be oriented toward the needs of industry. A project advisory council was formed representing Siemens, Janoptik, Rofin-Sinar, Haas Laser, Adlas and Baasel [as written] Lasertechnik. The pilot project is currently made up of three joint projects in industry and four joint research [projects]. Parallel to this, the four joint research projects will deal with basic research themes such as the preliminary research in securing technical scientific alternatives--for example, new technologies for high-efficiency diode lasers and new ytterbium-base solid-state lasers. The work of the four joint research projects is being financed with about 30 million German marks through the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology. For the three joint industry projects, financing in the amount of 35 million German marks is being projected, to which the Federal Ministry of Research will contribute around 19 million German marks.
