U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright told reporters that although North Korea had signaled reconciliation in talks with former American leader Jimmy Carter, President Bill Clinton instructed her to continue discussions with the council members on sanctions against North Korea. Asked how the new offer by North Korea would affect the push for sanctions, she said she could not disclose it as the U.S. Government was studying the proposal. In view of remarks by Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci that Washington would consider holding a third round of talks with Pyongyang, the members of the Security Council are expected to slow down their sanctions deliberations.
