"Taking into account that today's meeting was attended by prominent representatives of all branches of the German economy, we outlined immediate tasks not only for today or tomorrow, but for a period after the year 2000.

He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome given to him by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg, its Prime Minister Erwin Teufel whom Yeltsin had invited to visit Russia. "I am leaving Germany with good and friendly feelings. We are crossing out the word "war" from our relations and from German and Russian dictionaries," the Russian president said in conclusion.
