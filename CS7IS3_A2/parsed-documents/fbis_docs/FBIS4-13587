FBIS4-13587 "drnes077_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 SYRIA U.S. Blamed for `Evading' Peace Requirements U.S. Blamed for `Evading' Peace Requirements JN2104102994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 21 Apr 94 JN2104102994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Discussing the atmosphere surrounding U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, due to begin next week, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: This tour comes after a lengthy halt in the Washington peace talks and in the wake of a premeditated attempt by Israel to conceal the peace process behind a thick wall of blood and fire. Meanwhile, the Israeli rulers stabbed the peace process in the back, undermined it, and derailed it from the bases set for it. This has created a gloomy and disappointing atmosphere, making it hard to be optimistic over the possibility of extricating the peace process from the difficult situation created by the Tel Aviv rulers. Discussing the U.S. role in the region, the paper says: The full partner role, which the United States chose for itself, has not changed the situation. This is because the United States is evading the requirements of partnership, represented by a call for adopting the bases set for the peace process and respecting international legitimacy and its resolutions, in addition to holding discussions with the parties concerned to achieve and confirm this respect, and using all means available to convince the parties that reject international legitimacy and its resolutions and try to impose their will on others. AL-BA'TH asserts that a stand in favor of international legitimacy and its resolutions as well as standing alongside justice and peace are not a departure from the full partner role or from the role of an honest and effective mediator. Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria cooperated with the United States in order to establish a just and comprehensive peace that would be honorable and not humiliating--a peace that would secure the rights of all and respect international legitimacy without breaching it. The paper emphasizes that Syria will continue to support a just and comprehensive peace, international legitimacy, and anyone who champions these values, principles, and approaches. Syria, however, will never be alongside injustice, nor will it accept a false peace that would bring humiliation to future generations and consecrate the encroachments on our territories and rights. Also discussing U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The Arab parties welcome any effective and active U.S. efforts that would contribute to removing the numerous obstacles which are still impeding the peace process. They even used to call for upgrading the U.S. role to a level befitting the full, fair, and honest partner, so this partner will have a clear and frank say in determining the course of the peace process and preserving the bases and principles according to which the disputing parties attended the Madrid conference, particularly concerning a comprehensive solution and the land-for-peace principle. Discussing the intransigent Israeli positions, AL-THAWRAH says: If, during his visit, Christopher plans to provide an appropriate atmosphere to unleash the peace process anew, he will first face the intransigent Israeli position which is still creating obstacles, setting conditions and uttering no's, which make it impossible to achieve any real balance in the peace process. This is because the Rabin government persistently calls for relinquishing the Madrid formula and publicly rejects full withdrawal. Moreover, it does not accept any discussion on Jerusalem and the settlements, and always seeks to single out the Arab parties and peddle partial solutions that would squander the peace opportunity, territory, and rights. The paper adds: As part of a disinformation and deception campaign, the Rabin government is now calling on Syria to hold secret negotiations and conclude a separate solution away from other Arab tracks. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Everyone knows that Syria wants peace and does its utmost to achieve it. Syria and the entire world, however, believe that if peace is not just and comprehensive and if it does not regain the entire occupied Arab territories, it will not be real and firm, and will not last; it will simply be a temporary truce that can end at any moment. The United States should take this into account and begin devoting its efforts to promoting the negotiations toward achieving peace. Such peace will end aggression and occupation and will achieve justice and security for all.
