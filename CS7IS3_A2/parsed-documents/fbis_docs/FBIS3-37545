LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and two members of the party's State Duma group, Viktor Kobelev and Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, told reporters on Thursday that Wednesday's stated resignation of Kobelev from the LDP group in the lower house had been a stratagem to reveal "dissenters" within the party and security services' machinations. "We have never made it a secret that intelligence services, including the Russian ones, are taking systematic steps against the LDP and other patriotic parties," said Vengerovskiy, deputy speaker of the State Duma. He said that, aware of intelligence services' plans to "split" the LDP at its next congress, scheduled for April 2, 1994, the party leadership had resorted to a ploy "to reveal the possible sources of a split, all the people [that might cause it] and their contacts." Zhirinovsky said that now "everything was OK." in the party and its parliamentary group, while "some of the intelligence services will receive no bonus payments for February." Kobelev said he had "minor ideological disagreements" with Zhirinovskiy, taking a "milder position" than the party leader. As "the number-two person in the party," he would be meeting Zhirinovskiy more often now, he said. Zhirinovskiy said the maneuver had made it possible to expose "secret agents" in the central bodies of the party, and in its regional organizations in Krasnoyarsk territory, St. Petersburg and Vologda. As a result, some of the party's senior officers in the LDP, whose total membership he puts at 120,000-150,000, were fired, he said. He said that, following the party's victory at the parliamentary election, which came as a surprise to the whole world, "the intelligence services of all countries are concerned about the activities of the party" and demand information about it.
