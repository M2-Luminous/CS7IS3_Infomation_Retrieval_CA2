Ninety percent of the loans have gone to state key projects in basic industries and infrastructure, he said. "The 257 large and medium-sized projects covered by the bank's loan scheme have all received 50 per cent of their current year loan total of 57 billion yuan," said Chen. The bank, which began operation on March 17, was responsible for providing loans to finance state key construction projects. The bank plans to provide 2.8 billion yuan loans to the Beijing-Kowloon railway which is under construction and it has so far provided 2.1 billion yuan to the project. It has also pumped 1.25 billion yuan into the Three-Gorges project, 42 percent of the total lending the bank has promised for 1994. The operational capital of the bank comes mainly from bonds it issues to state specialized banks and other non-banking financial institutions. It plans to issue 65 billion yuan of financial bonds this year. It has raised 28 billion yuan so far and another 37 billion yuan will be raised in the latter half of this year. The bank has formed a special committee to conduct studies on the 16 projects applying for loans, including the electrified railway from Wuhan to Guangzhou and a Chang Jiang River bridge at Wuhu, Anhui Province. Chen revealed that the bank is considering extending working capital loans to projects completed this year. A dozen groups organized by the bank and the People's Construction Bank of China have been dispatched to provinces and major cities to find out the actual situation in the demand for working capital, Chen noted. The bank is also exploring other ways of raising funds, including issuing of bonds abroad, in order to secure long-term and stable sources of funds, Chen said.
