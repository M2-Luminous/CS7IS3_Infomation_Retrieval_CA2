Environment protection is no empty claim for Siemens, whose waste water treatment system is proving that an environment-friendly process does not necessarily cost more than traditional methods. The aluminum capacitor production plant of the Siemens Matsushita subsidiary in Heidenbeim, Germany has recently put into operation a dialysis system which enables about 80 percent of the acids used in manufacturing to be recuperated and reused in the production cycle. The investment required to set up this system amounted to 1.2 million German marks [DM] (Fr4.3 million), which is less than for a traditional system (DM1.7 million). In addition, the annual production costs have almost been reduced by a factor of four (DM0.6 million instead of DM2.3 million). Eliminating 6,000 Tonnes of Acid Sludge When waste waters are recovered after the aluminum etching stage in an aluminum capacitor production plant, they have strong concentrations of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids. Traditional water treatment systems include a neutralization phase followed by the separation of the liquid and solid parts. The liquids, which represent about 18,000 cubic meters per year in the Siemens Matsushita plant, are then drained via traditional sewers, while the solid matter, 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes per year, is dumped on a waste belt. The new system is based on the same principle as dialysis, with a membrane which directly separates the waste water into two parts, one rich in HCL and H2SO4 acids (up to 80 percent can be recuperated) and the other rich in metals. The former (460 liters/hour) can be recuperated for use in acid baths during the capacitor production cycle. The latter (470 liters/hour), composed essentially of alumina salt and a low percentage of acids, can be used in organic filtering stations where it acts as a bacterial precipitating agent.
