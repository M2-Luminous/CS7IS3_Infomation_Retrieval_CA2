FBIS4-21136 "jptdd016__l94015" JPRS-TDD-94-016-L JPRS Narcotics Reaction to the 1994 U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 6 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA NICARAGUA Various Officials Reject Report's Findings Various Officials Reject Report's Findings PA0604173094 Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 6 Apr 94 pp 1, 10 PA0604173094 Managua BARRICADA Spanish BFN [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] [Text] Although they were unfamiliar with the details, various official sectors of the country have rejected the U.S. State Department's International Report on Narcotrafficking Control Strategy, which states in 1993 "Nicaragua showed little progress" in the antidrug-trafficking and money-laundering struggle in the country. Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Pallais has said that the report "does not accurately reflect" the Nicaraguan situation and that "the U.S. State Department had told Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry officials Nicaragua was not a country that caused concern" regarding drug trafficking. "Furthermore," it added, since the date of the report until today, "Nicaragua has shown important progress in cooperating to confront international narcotrafficking problems." The U.S. document, to which BARRICADA gained access, states the National Police has delayed the antidrug-trafficking struggle and conducted its first operation, "jointly with the DEA" in early 1994. Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has recalled that John Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, had sent a letter congratulating the police corps for its antidrug-trafficking struggle. The annual report also states "the extension and importance of drug trafficking in Nicaragua is not fully known," but "there are hardly any doubts Nicaragua's tremendous financial and political problems make the country an obvious target" of narcotrafficking. A ranking police source has agreed that undoubtedly a large amount of drugs passes through our country, air space, and across our sea. The source added: "Concerning Nicaragua, one cannot speak, however, of official authorization of narcotrafficking flights or official protection groups for cocaine-unloading operations." The report has criticized Violeta de Chamorro's government for not progressing as the United States wants "in fulfilling the UN Convention of 1988, not passing new counternarcotics laws, not adopting measures against government corruption, and not progressing in bilateral and regional agreements signed in previous years." "It recognizes as facts, however, that Nicaragua is part of the executive secretariat of the Central American Antinarcotics Commission, that the Banco Central demands documents verifying transactions exceeding $10,000, and that a counternarcotics police unit has been created." Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar has said "there is no evidence of money laundering in Nicaragua," as the U.S. State Department claims. A police source has agreed with Cesar. "We cannot certify there is money laundering in Nicaragua." The source added the police cannot conduct an investigation "as long as there is no law authorizing us to do so." Luis Humberto Guzman, National Assembly president, has said that thus far, for lack of economic means, the legislative branch has not conducted an investigation on money laundering. He said: "If one examines the amount of financial activities in Nicaraguan banks, we cannot speak of money laundering." The U.S. report adds "although the Nicaraguan Government promised in 1992 to present a law, according to the UN Convention of 1988, it decided not to use any political capital for it." The report added Nicaraguan legislation on the topic is "obsolete," because it defines the problem as a "health" problem. The National Assembly has learned of a draft bill which, because of its complex nature, is taking awhile. It is hoped the law will be ready in eight weeks. Guzman has said the U.S. State Department "has false information" on the narcotrafficking situation in Nicaragua and that the deputies are "doing what we must regarding this topic (of narcotrafficking)."
