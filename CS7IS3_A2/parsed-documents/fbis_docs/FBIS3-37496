This is in accord with the position adopted by Russia which has expressed its opposition to missile and bomb strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today in the press center of the Air Force that the Russian Air Force Command considers that the Bosnian conflict must be resolved by political methods. Russian military airmen consider that with modern aerial equipment it is difficult to achieve high precision bombing of artillery positions. In conditions of mountainous, broken terrain in former Yugoslavia, the effect of aerial bombing will be insignificant. The Russian Air Force Command, in particular, is worried that totally innocent people and the civilian population could suffer during the bombing. The press center of the Russian Air Force rules out the possibility of any future participation by Russian Air Forces in the peacekeeping forces under the UN's aegis.
