The annual interest rate for the six-month-maturity nonphysical treasury bill will be 9.8 percent, and its interest will be calculated starting from 25 January 1994. The principal and interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 25 July 1994. The annual interest rate for the one-year-maturity nonphysical treasury bill will be 11.98 percent, and its interest will be calculated starting from 7 February 1994. The principal and interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 7 February 1995. After the issuance of the six-month-maturity and one-year-maturity nonphysical treasury bills ends, these nonphysical treasury bills may be transferred through the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market. The issuance of nonphysical treasury bills means that the state will not adopt the method of printing treasury bills, and that the selling and buying will be done through record keeping carried out over computers. In other words, paper will not be used in the issuance of nonphysical treasury bills. The nonphysical treasury bills will be sold on consignment by nonpolicy banks, securities companies, trust and investment companies, and other nonbanking financial organizations. The registration and clearing of transactions will be done through the computer network of the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market. Various securities and financial organizations which have established business links with the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market may, starting today, file applications for the consignment of the six-month-maturity and one-year-maturity nonphysical treasury bills to the State Debts Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Treasury Department of the People's Bank of China. Financial organizations which are not in a position to handle nationwide consignment but which possess the conditions to utilize the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market's network for transactions may act as sales agents and take part in the marketing of nonphysical treasury bills or buy nonphysical treasury bills from securities companies on behalf of investors. The nonphysical treasury bills will be mainly consigned to and purchased by banks and other financial organizations. Enterprises and business undertakings and individual investors who purchase more than 10,000 yuan of nonphysical treasury bills may open transaction accounts with distributors (mainly securities organizations which have transaction space at the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market). Various investors who already have stock exchange accounts with the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market through securities organizations may use their original accounts to purchase nonphysical treasury bills. It was also learned from the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market that to promote the issuance of nonphysical treasury bills, further simplify procedures, increase efficiency, expand sales, and provide convenience for investors, the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market has formulated plans for nominal quotations and the distribution of nonphysical treasury bills by agents. The distributors, after purchasing nonphysical treasury bills from the Ministry of Finance, may post nominal quotations within a prescribed period and act as sales agents. Stockbrokers who have space in the securities exchange market may use their own funds or act as agents for their customers to submit purchasing slips and buy nonphysical treasury bills through a selected underwriter [cheng xiao shang 2110 6906 0794]. The declared value [shen bao jia ge 3947 1032 0116 2706] should be the unified issue price of the treasury bills. The nonimal quotations for the six-month-maturity nonphysical treasury bills will be posted for seven days at the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market starting on 24 January. Various brokers may start to do business with investors from the date that the nominal quotations are posted until the formal announcement of listings for transactions by the Ministry of Finance. A responsible person at the Ministry of Finance pointed out that the reform of the method of issuing treasury bills seeks to meet the needs of the market economy and to promote the marketability of treasury bills. He expressed his hope that various securities organizations would strengthen the training of staff members, do a good job of publicizing the method, help various units and individual investors understand the investment procedures for nonphysical treasury bills, and facilitate their purchase. According to this responsible person, to satisfy the demand of individual small investors who want to buy treasury bills, the state will issue some physical treasury bills (namely in a printed form) within this year. The sales and purchasing methods are same as in previous years. The interest rate for physical treasury bills will be to a certain extent higher than that for bank savings accounts during the same period.
