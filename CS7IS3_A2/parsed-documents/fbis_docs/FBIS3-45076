Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education Commission, said at a national education telephone meeting here today that the plan is based on an evaluation of the total financial need in education during 1993-2000. He said that his commission has discussed with the Finance Ministry about issues of collecting education taxes from social services and exempting taxes on school-run factories, which will fall in line with finance reform this year. Insufficient education funding, which has dogged China's educational progress for years, remains one of the major problems. Another problem is low teacher pay. Zhu said that China will set up an education trust and investment company as well as an education development fund shortly, in an effort to solve these problems. Meanwhile, an evaluation system will be established to monitor and prevent misappropriation of teaching money. "The proportion of education investment prescribed in the state budget must see an obvious increase," he urged, also stressing the establishment and increase of a special allocation at the central and local financial levels for supporting compulsory education. He called on provincial governments and central ministries to determine suitable standards for school tuition fees, which are now too freely set. "We will study the idea to let education departments join the education budget-making process in the relevant governments, improve the policy to collect money for developing rural education, and build a mechanism to finance the building of classrooms," he said. As to raising teachers' salaries, he noted that a reform will soon be proposed by the Education Commission and the Personnel Ministry. And severe punishments will be imposed on those who delay paying teachers' salaries.
