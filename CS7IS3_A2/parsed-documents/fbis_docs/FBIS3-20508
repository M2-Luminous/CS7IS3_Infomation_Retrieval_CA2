I understood I was working beyond the retirement age and was ready to quit anytime. But I had always followed this principle: As long as the CPC Central Committee wanted me to stay in my post, I would try my best to do a good job. Over two months later, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office notified me a brainstorming session would be held for leaders from these four units: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the foreign affairs department of XINHUA SHE, and the working committee of XINHUA SHE Hong Kong office. I was asked to send three participants from the XINHUA SHE Hong Kong office. They did not give me any names, so I decided that Li Zhuwen [2621 6308 2429] and Zheng Hua [6774 5478] should attend the meeting with me. Looking at the list of conference participants, I saw that the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office was represented by Li Hou and Lu Ping; the XINHUA SHE foreign affairs department, Li Zhongying [2621 6945 5391]; and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Nan [0719 0589] and Ke Zaishuo [2688 0961 7007]. At it turned out, Ke Zaishuo went on leave and did not attend. (There is no way of telling whether he really had other business engagements or was just trying to avoid the meeting.) The brainstorming session took place at Zhongnanhai and was presided over by Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378], who asked me to address the gathering as the session began. I had a feeling the meeting was targeting me, so I said, "I don't know what to say. Why don't you air your views first?" Li Hou was the first to speak. He said that I had mishandled Sino-British relations without, however, giving any concrete examples. All he did was to go over Zhou Enlai's instructions on diplomatic work, the gist of which was that on diplomatic matters, the CPC Central Committee has delegated only limited power to organizations stationed overseas and that when it comes to important things, one must ask for instructions and not make decisions without authorization. Li Hou argued that XINHUA SHE was also a diplomatic organ and must not depart from this principle. He mentioned no names, but in reality he was attacking me for violating this particular instruction by Zhou Enlai. The next to speak was Lu Ping, who talked about mass work. He said that after I went to Hong Kong, I assumed too high a profile in mass work, in some ways giving people the impression that I had created a second power center, that I had transplanted to Hong Kong the way of doing things back home. Zhou Nan devoted the bulk of his speech to criticizing me for a point I made in a report on the principles of Hong Kong work: "The Hong Kong society is in a state of great upheaval, deep division, and extensive transformation." Calling this statement inaccurate, he said that the vast majority of Hong Kong people were patriotic and there was no such thing as "upheaval," "division," or "transformation." He also said that these were Mao Zedong's words and should not be repeated. The morning was devoted to these three people's speeches, which appeared to be a prearranged division of labor. I spoke in the afternoon responding to their speeches. I also touched upon three topics: my interpretation of the situation, the Sino-British dispute, and united front and mass work. "Great upheaval, deep division, and extensive transformation," I explained, represented the reality in Hong Kong after China and Britain began negotiations on Hong Kong. While there had been some dissatisfaction with British rule in the past few decades, by and large people were content because of the way the economy had developed. In contrast, they harbored doubts about China. Logically speaking and out of national sentimental feelings, some people embraced the idea of returning Hong Kong to China. Others did not care for it but could not bring themselves to say it. Even those who supported the return of Hong Kong to China also worried that their lives in the future would be affected by changes in the social system and felt uneasy. Unwilling to turn over Hong Kong, Britain had resorted to the old ruse colonialists always used when forced to withdraw. The fact of the matter is that it was trying to divide Hong Kong, already split over the issue of China takeover. British actions only served to deepen the division in Hong Kong. Among the more tangible signs were these: the strong support for the proposal of Britain giving up sovereignty over Hong Kong in return for the right to rule it, the rejection of our suggestions, the increasing number of people immigrating overseas, and the rising outflow of funds. All this pointed to turmoil and growing division. Bipolarization in Hong Kong was sharpening by the day in terms of social stratification, ideology, and along the pro-China versus pro-British line. Needless to say, there were people who trusted neither side and chose to leave Hong Kong instead. Social transformation had reached unprecedented proportions and was becoming more and more obvious. I said, "One may or may not use the word `great' in our analysis of the situation. It is not necessarily wrong to use the word. Chairman Mao Zedong made mistakes in his old age, but that does not mean everything he said is unspeakable." Regarding Li Hou's arguments, I noted that in terms of status, Hong Kong is different from other foreign countries. It is foreign (because it is a British colony). But China does not recognize its legitimacy as a colony and want to resume sovereignty over it. "XINHUA SHE Hong Kong office is a diplomatic organ, but only up to a point. As long as Hong Kong is not returned to China, the British remain the prime protagonist. We deal with the British every day. If we act like a diplomatic organ and ask Beijing for instructions in everything, you will be bothered no end and we won't be able to get anything done. On major things, I would ask for instruction. But I cannot do so all the time like a full-fledged diplomatic organ." "As for the second-power-center claim, is that really the case? We need not get into that. In Hong Kong I do my level best to avoid giving that kind of impression. But with the prospect of China taking back Hong Kong looming on the horizon, isn't there a need for XINHUA SHE Hong Kong office to do work in the open? Since the CPC Central Committee and State Council sent me to work over there, it is my duty to do mass work and united front work on their behalf. Certainly, there should be differences in method, style, and substance from mass work and united front work on the mainland. But the bottom line is that we must work in the public arena. Otherwise, we would be tying our own hands, wouldn't we?" (Installment No. 64) [8 Jul p 2] [Text] Brainstorming Session (Part Two of Two) Li Zhuwen and Zheng Hua were asked to speak the next day; Li Zhuwen made exactly the same points as Li Hou, Lu Ping, and Zhou Nan. Only later did I learn that as soon as he arrived in Beijing, Li Zhuwen went to look up Wu Xueqian [0702 1331 6197], his old boss from the days of the Shanghai underground party, and became privy to what the meeting was all about, which was enough to make him do a complete about-face by siding with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and criticizing me. Zheng Hua made some remarks critical of me and offered a number of explanations. After we spoke, Li Hou and Lu Ping made some additional comments. The former spent most of his speech attacking me, calling me arrogant and totally unresponsive to their opinions. Lu Ping argued that the conflicts in Hong Kong were multifaceted, with different conflicts taking center stage at various points in time. Therefore, he said, we could not consider the Sino-British dispute the main conflict in Hong Kong. I was asked to speak after they finished. I said I would address the gathering the next day since time had run out. At that point Ji Pengfei opened his mouth and spoke for a dozen minutes, criticizing me for making "leftist" errors in my work in Hong Kong. That was not what I expected. I thought they were going to criticize me for being "rightist." Now I was branded a "leftist." Only then did I realize the errors they cited, including such concrete examples as the Kowloon Walled City incident and particularly the "copy controversy," were all "leftist" errors. (Deng Xiaoping's endorsement of the "copy controversy"--"well said"--came after this meeting.) After the conference, I thought about the position taken by Ji Pengfei and realized the unusual nature of this meeting. It was touted as a brainstorming session, but they took full notes and had them printed as a "summary." Actually it was anything but that. Every speech was recorded in full and included in the "summary," copies of which were sent to the CPC Central Committee, secretary of the CPC secretariat, the premier, and the vice premiers. The fact that it was made available to all these people showed the seriousness of the matter. The fact of the matter was that the meeting was called to "criticize and denounce" me. It was a continuation of the Beidahe meeting and these people came ready to do battle. Even as Zhou Nan, Lu Ping, and others were criticizing me in detail, Ji Pengfei had already made up his mind: Call Xu Jiatun a leftist. From my party struggle experience, I knew that nothing I said would do any good, at least in this case. I changed my mind and decided not to say another word at the meeting. Ji Pengfei opened the third day of the meeting by calling on the three of us from the Hong Kong and Macao working committee to speak. Li Zhuwen said he totally agreed with Ji Pengfei's criticisms, taking me to task for having committed "leftist" errors from the higher plane of principle and two-line struggle and giving a litany of examples that he said showed I was "leftist." Zheng Hua did some explaining. I stated my attitude concisely and to the point, "Originally I planned to make a speech but have now decided against it. While I would consider your views, I reserve my own judgement. A CPC member operates in accordance with the party constitution. In future I would ask for instructions from you as far as major matters are concerned. I would do whatever you say." They saw where I stood and, realizing the meeting could not go on, wrapped it up sullenly. Li Xiannian [2621 0341 1819] Advised Me To Resign (Part One of Two) -- Deng Xiaoping Wanted Me To Remain in Hong Kong; Ji Pengfei Agreed to Make Li Zhuwen Retire The brainstorming session was barely over when Li Xiannian's secretary telephoned me to say Li Xiannian had been in failing health recently. I replied that I was going to visit him, which I did at his home that very day. Li Xiannian made no reference to the brainstorming session. After a little small talk, he said, "You are getting on in years. Just quit." I replied, "I have wanted to quit a long time. It is the CPC Central Committee that asked me to take the job." He asked, "Who wanted you to stay?" I said, "Hu Yaobang said not long ago he wanted me to take the job." "Li Xiannian then said, "If Hu Yaobang wants you to do it, you better remain on the job." Leaving Li Xiannian's house, I mulled over his words and realized they were not said by accident. Zheng Hua told me Zhao Ziyang sent for him in the afternoon the very same day and questioned him at length about the meeting. After he heard what Li Zhuwen had said, Zhao Ziyang asked, "If that is the case, how can they continue to cooperate?" While in Beijing I met with Xi Zhongxun and Yang Shangkun, who commended me for doing a good job in Hong Kong. Xi Zhongxun even said, "Some people say you are Hong Kong's Deng Xiaoping. The CPC Central Committee is very pleased." This was in sharp contrast to the attitude of Ji Pengfei and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. I must straighten this out with the CPC Central Committee. I first went to see Hu Qili and told him I wanted to talk to Hu Yaobang. Hu Qili wanted me to see Zhao Ziyang first. So I tried to set up an appointment with the latter through his secretary. However, Zhao Ziyang did not get back to me right away. I wanted to talk to Deng Xiaoping too, but felt that the matter was too detailed, too bothersome. Besides, I was involved in it personally, which would make any approach to Deng Xiaoping about this matter an inappropriate thing to do. Just as I was hesitating, Deng Pufang came to see me. In the past I saw Deng Pufang every time I visited Beijing. Sometimes I looked him up; at other times he took the initiative to call on me. I told him what happened at the brainstorming session. Maybe he went back and briefed Deng Xiaoping. Two days later Zhao Ziyang asked to see me. I was aware that he had talked to Ji Pengfei earlier for 10 minutes or so. Zhao Ziyang began by praising my work in Hong Kong. Then he told me, "Comrade Deng Xiaoping has decided that you should remain in your job in Hong Kong for a while." I told him that personally I was not interested in keeping the job but that I would comply with the CPC Central Committee's decision. My plan was to keep working only until the 13th CPC National Congress (scheduled to be held in late 1987). Zhao Ziyang was surprised to hear this but did not say anything. He asked me, "You and Ji Pengfei are old colleagues, aren't you? How come you cannot get along with each other?" I smiled but did not say a word. I told Zhao Ziyang that the Central Organization Department had so far failed to send me a deputy. The absence of a competent assistant had hampered my work. There was also the need for a successor. Hu Yaobang had considered several people, but none of the prospects worked out. I told Zhao Ziyang I hoped the CPC Central Committee would give the matter additional thought. I also asked that the leading group of the working committee be further reshuffled. Zhao Ziyang agreed and asked me to work out the detailed personnel arrangements with Ji Pengfei and report them to the CPC Central Committee. He also asked me to have a word with Ji Pengfei before returning to Hong Kong. This conversation too lasted a dozen minutes or so. I went to see Ji Pengfei right away after the meeting to brief him about what we had discussed. Apparently he and Zhao Ziyang had gone over the same territory; he was aware of just about every point in our discussion. When told that Zhao Ziyang wanted me to consult Ji Pengfei about personnel changes, he was very moved and said, "Zhao Ziyang always has respect for people." He indicated his approval. I asked his opinion about making Li Zhuwen retire. He agreed instantly. (Installment No. 65) [9 Jul p 2] [Text] Li Xiannian Advised Me To Resign (Part Two of Two) -- Brainstorming Session Showed Li Zhuwen To Be an Opportunist; Appointment of Zhou Nan as Successor Stalled at Central Organization Department Li Zhuwen and I had worked together for over 3 years now. At the beginning I was extremely trustful of him and relied on him a good deal, almost invariably following his advice. I also gave all-out support to his work. It was not long before someone from the XINHUA SHE foreign affairs department told me that he was criticizing me in private and that he had set his sight on the directorship. I shook my head in disbelief. Wu Xueqian, vice premier and concurrently minister of foreign affairs, passed through Hong Kong during his several trips overseas. Li Zhuwen went to the airport to welcome him, never once telling me, and accompanied him to Shenzhen, preventing me from coming in contact with Wu Xueqian. I never had any suspicion. It was part of Li Zhuwen's job to handle foreign affairs, which made Wu Xueqian his direct boss. I thought it was just an oversight on Li Zhuwen's part that Wu Xueqian and I did not get to meet each other. A number of old comrades who had worked in Shanghai later told me that Li Zhuwen already was a double-dealer back in Shanghai, someone who trimmed his sails. Zhao Xingzhi [6392 5887 1807], formerly deputy secretary of the Shanghai municipal CPC committee, worked side by side with Li Zhuwen back in the underground party days; the two were good friends. After the gang of four was crushed, Su Zhenhua [5685 2182 5478] and Peng Chong [1756 3095] were in control of the Shanghai municipal CPC committee. During this period, Li Zhuwen saw eye to eye with the municipal party committee and Zhao Xingzhi in everything, fulsomely praising Zhao Xingzhi everywhere. When Hua Guofeng came under criticism, however, Chen Guodong [7115 0948 2767], Hu Lijiao [5170 4539 2403], and Wang Daohan [3076 6670 3211] were sent by the CPC Central Committee to run the Shanghai CPC Committee. These people launched an attack on the Shanghai party committee headed by Su Zhenhua and Peng Chong. Right away Li Zhuwen changed his political stand one-hundred and eighty degrees and started criticizing Su Zhenhua, Peng Chong, and Zhao Xingzhi openly. Old comrades in Shanghai called him a "trimmer." They warned me, "Be careful." I was half skeptical. After working together with Li Zhuwen for more than 1 year, I learned that he had a knack for detailed work but was not suited to be a leader, who has to make comprehensive planning and get the work done step by step systematically. Although he might do a good job on his own, he lacked the talent to mobilize the rank-and-file cadres to work with him. I figured this probably had something to do with his long-standing but narrow background in religious work. I asked him repeatedly to produce a plan for united front and religious work, which fell within the scope of his responsibilities, yet he did not come up with anything for a long long time. This convinced me he lacked the aptitude for and experience in taking charge of a broad area of work. He was thought well in society but there were also some negative views. In the KMT era, Li Zhuwen was a priest at the Shanghai Xu Jiahui Catholic Church where he baptized some members of the "Shanghai gang" now thriving in Hong Kong and their children. These people privately said that the CPC was fearful and considered Li Zhuwen inscrutable, someone who thought in one way and behaved in another. Within the organization Li Zhuwen was perceived much less favorably than in society at large. The several departments under him had complained that he neither delegated nor trusted his subordinates. The only people he had confidence in were the handful he had transferred to Hong Kong from Shanghai. Moreover, he grew angry and started swearing at the drop of a hat. This I regarded as a matter of personal temperament and training. He transferred some people from Shanghai to Hong Kong but never consulted me beforehand. Nor did he inform me after the fact. It was by asking questions when I saw a strange face at a meeting that I came to know what was going on. He was in charge of Taiwan work but kept me in the dark about some secret contacts in Taiwan and the United States, revealing to me only their codes. He did not inform me about his dealings with them, not beforehand, not afterward. Only when he needed my signature on the report to the CPC Central Committee did I have a chance to find out. What he did was against organizational rules. He should have told me about the contacts, however important they might be. The reason was that the CPC trusted me and sent me to Hong Kong to be in overall charge. He should not have done what he did, unless the CPC Central Committee had said to him, "Xu Jiatun is untrustworthy. Don't tell him." Be that as it may, I maintained a cooperative relationship with him as colleagues. His conduct at this particular brainstorming session, however, proved that he was indeed a "trimmer." When the principles were under discussion by the working committee, he was all for them. Now he had done a complete about-face by repudiating and criticizing them. In doing so, he adopted an interpretation of Hong Kong work that was different from mine. When it comes to Hong Kong work, both my understanding and practices had been endorsed by the CPC Central Committee. In contrast, siding with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhuwen rejected them completely. How could we continue to cooperate? Besides, he had reached retirement age and should step down. Reviewing the brainstorming session, I saw that it was in fact masterminded by Ji Pengfei and Wu Xueqian aimed at driving me out of office. Thwarted in their attempt to circulate a notice against me at Beidahe, they now worked to turn this brainstorming session into a criticism meeting, a public accusation meeting. They even had the proceedings of the conference printed and issued in the form of a "summary," which was in reality anything but a summary. The idea was to influence the thinking of the leaders on the CPC Central Committee. That Li Xiannian advised me to retire and Zhao Ziyang questioned me about my relations with Ji Pengfei suggested that some people on the CPC Central Committee wanted to see me step down. Rumors were making their rounds in Hong Kong at the time that I was about to be transferred back to the mainland. Other rumors in Beijing said that Zhou Nan would be sent to Hong Kong to take over my work. I queried a deputy director in the Central Organization Department in charge of Hong Kong and Macao cadres. He emphatically denied the CPC Central Committee had been assigning tasks and did not plan to do so. He said, "Zhou Nan does not have the right stuff. He only has diplomatic experience, but what Hong Kong needs is a politician. This is also why we have not been able so far to find a right-hand man for you." He added, "He was transferred back from the United Nations because he had made a mess of personal relations. There were problems with his private life too, which gave the foreigners a handle against him. It was feared he would become a big headache. How then could we send him to Hong Kong?" Apparently the plan of having Zhou Nan succeed me went nowhere with the Central Organization Department. A decision was to be made after the "brainstorming session." I raised this matter with Deng Pufang for the sole purpose of clarifying the matter. My desire to retire was genuine. Hence my statement to Zhao Ziyang about working until the 13th CPC National Congress. (Installment No. 66)
