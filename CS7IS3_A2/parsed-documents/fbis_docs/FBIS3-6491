What do you think of Japan? [Kim] I lived under Japanese colonial rule when I was child. There were many things I witnessed for myself. Our nation was liberated from Japanese colonial rule when I was a third-year student at junior high school. It is no exaggeration to say that I am well aware of what happened at the time. I have thought long and hard about the position of South Korea in the world during my time in politics and I have come to believe that although our people cannot forget Japan's past colonial rule, they must pardon it. Prime Minister Hosokawa has called Japan's past war an aggressive one and sincerely apologized for it. I rate the Japanese prime minister highly for taking such action. Successive past Korean Governments have asked the Japanese Government to compensate Korean comfort women. I have said we do not need such compensation. We do not need compensation at all. It is said that although Japan and South Korea are geographically close, they are far apart in other respects. I think the expression should be changed. The two nations are now close neighbors. [Kuniya] I think some Koreans still believe Japan should be asked to compensate for its past colonial rule of Korea. [Kim] Forty five million people live in our country and, yes, some of them feel that way. A majority of the Korean people, though, think my civilian government is different from previous governments. I head the civilian government and I was elected president fairly by popular vote. I am the president they chose. The people, therefore, think my civilian government is different from previous governments. There some Koreans who feel Japan should be asked to compensate for its past colonial rule, but they do not represent a majority of the Korean people. I am sure of that. [Kuniya] It has been said that an exchange of culture between the two countries would serve to erase an lingering ill feeling between the two countries. South Korea has a policy of preventing Japanese popular culture from flowing into it. Looking at the reality, however, Japanese popular culture such as popular songs and comic books have already infiltrated South Korean society. Are you considering changing policy and allowing Japanese popular culture into South Korea in the near future? [Kim] If I decide to allow Japanese popular culture into South Korea in a forced way, it would adversely affect friendship between South Korea and Japan if things go wrong. Therefore, I think it best that Japanese popular culture is allowed into South Korea in a natural way over a period of time. I believe it is desirable to think of introducing Japanese popular culture into South Korea step by step. I think it will be good for the mutual, friendly relations of the two nations to deal with the matter in a steady manner rather than to be too hasty about it. [Kuniya] Do you think this can be realized sometime during your term of office? [Kim] Yes, I think so. I think this can be resolved during my term of office. The governments and people of the two countries need to make efforts toward that. [Kuniya] You decided to tear down the old Japanese Governor-General's Office in Korea which is considered a symbol of Japanese colonial rule and has for so long been subject of a debate as to whether or not it should be torn down. Talking about ramifications of what you said just now and the thinking that led to your decision on the building, could you dwell on the background to making that decision? [Kim] I thought for a long time -- for a long time before I was elected president -- that it is not desirable to leave the Japanese Governor-General's Office as it is. That is because the building represents a symbol of colonial days. Its existence reminds the people of the past. Every time they pass by it, they see it and are reminded of the past. It is not desirable to let the people recall the past forever. I think we can free ourselves from the past. Removing the building is indeed a way of freeing ourselves -- a way of securing peace of mind. I have always thought tearing it down would provide a way of enabling us to be freed from the past, and thus will be to the benefit of relations and friendship between the two nations. [Kuniya] If there is anything that represents a change in Japan-South Korea relations most symbolically, I think, that would be a visit to South Korea by the emperor. What do you think, Mr. President? Do you think the emperor's visit will be realized during your term of office? [Kim] I think the emperor's visit to Korea has much meaning. You asked if it would be realized during my term -- I expect that his visit to South Korea will be realized during my term of office. In order to help this take place, it is very important that the people of the two nations create an atmosphere of sincerely welcoming the visit. Very important is the atmosphere wherein the people of Japan would think the emperor's visit to Korea is desirable, and the people of Korea would sincerely think it is good to have the visit realized. [Kuniya] You will soon visit Japan. How do you plan to deal with the question of the emperor's visit? [Kim] I would like to convey the wish to invite him. I am not supposed to say this in advance. [Kuniya] In the past year, you have done so much to remove corruption from the business world, military, and government. Your campaign is even called revolutionary. What do you think is the reason for the campaign's success. What is its secret? [Kim] It cannot be called a secret. It was possible because of my firm conviction. Injustice and corruption were deep-rooted in South Korea as a result of military rule for some decades. There was the need to drive out this injustice and corruption, and to correct the people's wrong sense of values. In order to do that, I thought it was necessary to change the perception of the people and public officials. What I kept on emphasizing was the need for political reform. It was my belief that elections must be conducted in a clean and fair manner. I talked about this every time there was a chance to say it. And now, finally, the political reform bills have been enacted. This is a great feat that can be called almost a political revolution. [Kuniya] You have done so much in a one-year period. On the other hand, there is criticism saying that with so much power given to one person as president, it is nothing more than civilian dictatorship. What is your comment on such a view? [Kim] That is erroneous thinking. What I have done so far -- all of it -- is based on law. South Korea's government system is a presidential system like that of the United States. The president, elected by the people's will, is entrusted with performing all the responsibilities. His rights are guaranteed by the constitution. The president needs to guide the nation under his responsibility. In Korea, freedom of speech is such to be called excessive. There are people who talk about civilian dictatorship, but they are wrong. I have pointed this out to the mass media every time there is an opportunity. It is only natural that a president in a nation with a presidential system must perform his duties under his responsibility. [Kuniya] So, you think strong leadership is needed in South Korea of today -- if it is to change, right? [Kim] Yes, I think so. After all, the destiny of a nation is determined by its leader. That is clear if we see the history of other nations. That applies to Korea too. [Kuniya] As far as South-North Korea issues are concerned, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] recently conducted a nuclear inspection of North Korea, though the agency was unable to conduct complete inspections. What is your view on the nuclear threat of North Korea? [Kim] The latest nuclear inspections by the IAEA were imperfect, and the IAEA could not check two important nuclear sites. This is a very regrettable thing. The issue of conducting nuclear inspections in North Korea is very important from the international standpoint. The nuclear inspections of North Korea are also very important for South Korea and we cannot help being jittery. North Korea's suspected nuclear development must be cleared up. [Kuniya] You have said that you are willing to hold a summit meeting with North Korea, if necessary, to put a stop to the nuclear threat. If a summit meeting becomes a possibility, what will you say to President Kim Il-song? [Kim] If the summit meeting is held, the nuclear issue will be raised for discussion. I intend to discuss with my North Korean counterpart how North and South Korea should move toward reunification while building a relationship of trust between them. As for how the two countries should be reunified, I think the method used in Germany -- where one country absorbed the other -- is not desirable. I intend to unify North and South Korea eventually through a national federation formula while acknowledging the recent North Korean system. It may be a longer way of achieving the goal, but I think it would better. [Kuniya] Mr. President, you like to climb mountains and you have said that some day you want to climb Mt. Paektu, the highest mountain in the North. When do you think that will become possible? [Kim] It is impossible to predict when the reunification of South and North Korea will become a reality. It might come in the near future, but it might take a rather long time. My dream is to be able to climb Mt. Paektu in the not too distant future -- while I am still alive.
