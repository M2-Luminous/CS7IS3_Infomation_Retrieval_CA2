The question in this context is whether an attempt of this kind will unsettle the relations between Israel and the Arab world, and most notably those between Israel and Egypt. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks reflect his emphatic endorsement of the Israeli-Egyptian relations: [Begin Rabin recording] I believe in the strength of Mubarak's regime. I believe the majority of the people support him. Yet there are radical elements, a phenomenon characteristic in many Arab countries in which terrorism is not repudiated. We have learned that terrorism is an integral part of the essence of many Arab countries, and it is not exclusive to the Palestinian, Lebanese, or Israeli context. The peace process must be pursued despite the difficulties, of which we are aware. As for peace in Egypt, I believe in the fortitude of Mubarak's regime in that country. [end recording] This was Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's first public reaction to the news of the assassination attempt against President Mubarak. The issue of terror, to which Mr. Rabin referred, constituted a considerable part of his conversation with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. The two men discussed Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, among Palestinians, in Sudan, Lebanon, and in countries closer to Spain, such as Algeria. It was disclosed in Prime Minister Rabin's meeting with Gonzalez that Spain will assist Israel's efforts to advance its ties with the Arab world. It should be stressed that Spain has very good relations with many Arab countries in North Africa, the Persian Gulf, and particularly monarchic regimes. Prime Minister Gonzalez prefers to work quietly and not to advertise the Spanish efforts, but he promised to advance Israel's interests in Arab countries. [passage omitted]
