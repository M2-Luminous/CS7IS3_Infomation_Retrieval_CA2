Noting that North Korea and the PRC have exchanged military delegations almost every year, some people think it is not a new factor of tension. During the past two to three years, the two countries have intensified military cooperation more than ever. A North Korean military delegation of functionaries of the Foreign Affairs Bureau visited the PRC on 28 February this year. When, delegation leader Major General Kim Hak-san, director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the North Korean Army, met on 2 March with Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff of the PRC Army, interests were focused on their "submarine deal" but nothing concrete was revealed. However, the majority of the public find analyzes the visit to be unusual because the delegation is being led by General Chief of Staff Choe Kwang, and because of the significance of its timing. It is suspected that Choe Kwang's trip is a move to prepare for "an emergency on the Korean peninsula" since he is the one who controls the general command of "military operations" under the Supreme Commander and Chairman of the National Defense Committee, Kim Chong-il. Even more significant is the North Korean military delegation's visit to the PRC in a situation where the UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency are discussing sanctions on North Korea and in which North Korea announced that sanctions would be regarded as "a declaration of war" for which it is willing to risk war. This seems to illustrate the close military cooperation in North Korea's defensive position concerning the nuclear issue. Military cooperation between North Korea and the PRC is significant enough to worry the ROK and the United States under circumstances where it is uncertain whether the PRC will join in the UN Security Council's decision to implement sanctions on North Korea. While no concrete results are expected to be announced after the military exchange, as in previous military delegation exchanges between the two countries, it is not difficult to speculate that the two parties will assess the effect of sanctions on the situation of the Korean peninsula and discuss joint measures to cope with this. So far, there are no signs that the PRC regards the situation on the Korean peninsula as a military emergency. However, it is highly probable that the PRC will convey the message that "the development of nuclear weapons is impossible under any circumstances" during the face-to-face meeting with North Korean military leaders because the PRC has strongly opposed North Korea's nuclear weapons development. On the other hand, since the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance (military alliance) between North Korea and Russia was actually invalidated during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia, North Korea is expected to repeat its intention to maintain and reinforce the treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the PRC.
