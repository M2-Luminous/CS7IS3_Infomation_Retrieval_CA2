[Slota] The HZDS will achieve the largest percentage of votes, in my opinion. That is what I believe. I am convinced of this because, in the course of the past two weeks, I have taken part in several conferences in the east and south of Slovakia--in the Magyarized city of Filakovo, for example, where Slovaks represent 30 percent of the population. I think that my prediction that the Slovak National Party [SNS] would win between 15 and 18 percent of the vote is realistic. If we assume that the HZDS might reach approximately 30-35 percent of the vote, this would essentially mean the possibility of forming a majority [HZDS-SNS] government. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Where lies the originality of your party that might have it attract 15 percent of voters, as you predict? [Slota] The SNS is the oldest political party in Slovakia, with a tradition of over 130 years. From the very beginning, we have pursued the main programmatic goal of obtaining for Slovaks the rights of a state-forming nation, even though it was not a state-forming nation at the time. [passage omitted] We have achieved statehood and have a Slovak Republic, yet the rights of a state-forming nation have not yet been achieved, and the interests of Slovaks remain unfulfilled. We still cannot say that these interests are clear and comprehensible to the nation. This is because there still exist forces posing as representatives of this nation that, by their interests and their conduct, are seeking the exact opposite. [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess the dismissal of the former Meciar-led government and your subsequent transfer to the opposition? [Slota] I would call it a normal putsch. It was a normal putsch staged by people who no longer had any business being in this parliament. They had betrayed their own parties and movements. They had betrayed their programs and voters. The voters did not vote for people but for programs. They voted for a program and for a party. Had these people in parliament been men of principle, they would have left parliament. But, instead of leaving, they staged a putsch. There was no political destabilization in Slovakia [as claimed by the then opposition]. They overstepped the borders that would bring about a stabilization of the situation. It is self-evident in Western parliaments that a deputy who leaves his political party can only act as an independent deputy. On no account can he set up a new party because he did not receive anyone's mandate to do that. They represent only themselves. They do not represent any voters because, at the time of the elections, there did not exist any alliance or democrats [reference to Alliance of Democrats, set up by deputies who broke away from the HZDS]. Whom do they represent? No one. [passage omitted] We all speak about democracy and brandish the word in all its variations enough to make you sick. For example, who will ever remember that the French Government adopted a discriminatory language program that runs clearly counter to the Copenhagen [CSCE] agreements? No one criticizes that; it is completely in order. But, when the Slovaks want to enshrine some language as official, the world almost collapses and the globe almost begins to turn in the other direction. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Why did Vladimir Meciar not obtain the necessary number of signatures for a referendum on excluding these "defectors" from parliament? [Slota] We naturally accept that Michal Kovac is the head of the Slovak Republic. Nevertheless, I cannot help but say, in my capacity as deputy, that, when we discount various provocateurs who made deliberate mistakes, 350,000 out of the 420,000 signatures that had been collected were definitely legally valid. I daresay, however, that, even had there been 700,000 valid signatures, the president would have found some pretext not to call the referendum. I am convinced of that. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Under the Constitution, however, the president must call a referendum when there are 300,000 [figure as published, correct figure is 350,000] signatures asking for one. In other words, one could almost speak about fraud in this case. [Slota] You were the one who said that. I clearly said that he would have found a pretext. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Speculations have appeared in the Czech press about attempts by the Czech Social Democratic Party to restore Czecho-Slovakia. [Slota] I beg your pardon, these are utopian delusions. I personally think that the best thing for the Slovak and Czech nations would be to cooperate, but with everyone staying in his own backyard. [passage omitted] [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you personally assess the fact that, through the medium of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], former communists have returned to government after less than five years? The same thing has happened in Poland. and everything suggests that the situation in Hungary will not be too different. [Slota] Look, I am known for being an anticommunist out of principle. Naturally, I am not pleased by this and regret very strongly that these "neocommunists" have regained power after such a short time. This is very dangerous, also from the viewpoint that, if left-wing forces are victorious in Hungary as well, a left-oriented bloc would again come into being. I personally believe that this is one of the greatest dangers, not just for Slovakia but also for Central Europe as a whole. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Shortly before the declaration of the Slovak state, you supposedly said that those who opposed the declaration of Slovakia's independence would be steamrollered and tried in court. Could you return to that statement, provided you actually made it? [Slota] I said it in a completely different context. About two sentences were torn out of the interview. It was an instance of irresponsible work by journalists. I am convinced that they are paid by certain forces in the Czech Republic because Prague is a bastion of these forces, which always try to portray people with different opinions in such black colors. Unfortunately, one who gives such an interview and does not authorize it does not have a chance to comment on its text--for example, when he is abroad at the time of publication--so they portray him in such colors as their character and ethics permit. I can only add that I meant it figuratively when I said then that people opposed to Slovak statehood would be steamrollered. And the Public Against Violence [VPN] movement, which was a clear advocate of the Czechoslovak state from the very beginning, really has been steamrollered. What I said then in figurative terms has become a reality. As for the courts, I would really protest fundamentally against such a statement being attributed to me. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Your unusual assessment of Mr. Zhirinovskiy has intrigued the public. Could you return to this issue and tell us whether the assessment that appeared in the press was not distorted? You have supposedly invited him to Slovakia. [Slota] Because I am an honest person, I reply to every journalist. When I was asked directly my view of Zhirinovskiy, I replied: "He is an interesting man." And, because I am a dynamic person, they immediately started portraying Zhirinovskiy and me as good friends and such. In my entire life, I have never seen him with my own eyes, nor have I ever heard him with my own ears. I only know his picture from television and the commentaries about him. The only thing I have claimed is: Zhirinovskiy is an interesting man. The whole world writes about him. Were he not interesting, they would not write about him and would not show him on all of the television channels. Is he interesting, or is he not? In my opinion, he is. And I do not know what is wrong with saying that, whether my attitude toward him is positive or negative. As I have said already, I do not have any attitude toward him. That is all. [DENNI TELEGRAF] And what about the invitation? [Slota] I do not know of any invitation. If someone from Slovakia has invited him, I do not know about it. [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess current Slovak-Hungarian relations? [Slota] Look, relations between Slovakia and Hungary should be, first and foremost, friendly. When these relations are unfriendly, it is to the detriment of both sides. Unfortunately, there exist certain forces--naturally, on the Hungarian side--that bring permanent pressure to bear on Slovakia, with their excessive demands. I was in Filakovo, and the Slovaks there are afraid. They represent 30 percent of the town's population and are afraid of saying anything critical about the Hungarians. They are afraid and frightened. It is abnormal for a member of the state-forming nation to be afraid on his own sovereign territory. It is absurd. Look, the Czechs had the very same problems [with the Sudeten Germans] in 1938, and they managed to cope with them. This is not to say that I agree with the system that was used. I disagree with it, of course, with the killing of the civilian population and all that. You know, everyone should therefore sweep his own doorstep first and only then criticize someone else. They deported 3.5 million people, and you are going to advise us on how to deal with the situation in southern Slovakia. This is not well intentioned, to put it moderately. The Benes decrees should definitely be abolished. [DENNI TELEGRAF] So it is the existence of Benes that is a problem for you and, naturally, also for us? [Slota] I personally believe, and have said so on a number of occasions, that speaking about Benes is a waste of time. He always had some plan [plan] and it was called airplane [aeroplan]. [sentence as published] The entire Czech nation had to pay dearly for this man. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Slovakia, too? [Slota] Of course, indirectly and by proxy, Slovakia had to pay, too. After all, he made it possible for the communists to seize power. Had he been a man of principle, developments might have taken a completely different course. [DENNI TELEGRAF] A while ago you spoke about journalists who distort statements, and not just yours, and about your conviction that they receive their pay from certain circles. Could you be somewhat more specific? [Slota] You are asking me something that you should be able to answer yourselves. Ask yourselves who is paying you. [DENNI TELEGRAF] Thank you for the interview.
