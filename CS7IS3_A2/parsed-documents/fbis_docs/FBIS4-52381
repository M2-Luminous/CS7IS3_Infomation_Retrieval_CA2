The government authorized businesses to purchase about 7,223,000 U.S. dollars worth of end products made through processing-on-commission from North Korea in the first four months of this year, about nine times that of a year earlier or 1.6 times that recorded in the whole of last year. A government official expected that purchases of processing-on-commission goods from North Korea would reach at least 20 million dollars by the end of this year. The approval amount for purchasing such goods was the monthly maximum of 3.1 million dollars in April, rising from 1.81 million dollars in January, 970,000 dollars in February and 1,345,000 dollars in March. South Korean businesses' sales of raw and subsidiary materials for processing-on-commission to the North also rose. Goverment approval for selling such materials totaled 4,806,000 dollars in January-April this year, up about 700 percent from the same period last year. Seoul's approval for total inter-Korean trade including other kinds of goods increased 11 percent to reach 64,670,000 dollars in the four months from a year ago. Inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade includes mainly trousers, coats and duck-down jackets, but not high value-added clothing including suits. A government official said, "With inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade in a stable stage and visits to the North having become impossible, South Korean businessmen are focusing mainly on processing-on-commission trade." Government permission for purchases of processing-on-commission goods amounted to 23,000 dollars in 1991, 556,000 dollars in 1992 and 4,385,000 dollars last year.
