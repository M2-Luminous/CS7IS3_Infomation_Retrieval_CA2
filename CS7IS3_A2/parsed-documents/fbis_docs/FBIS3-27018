Only when we direct the focus of economic work to raising economic efficiency and dealing conscientiously with the relationship between speed and efficiency can we maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the national economy. In order to promote the raising of economic efficiency, as of today the committee for the extensive and in-depth survey of economic efficiency in China, and the RENMIN RIBAO Theoretical Department jointly open an "Economic Efficiency Forum" column. Readers' participation in this in-depth discussion on ways to raise economic efficiency in the form of articles is most welcome. Raising economic efficiency was the premise and fundamental objective for Comrade Deng Xiaoping when he was outlining his blueprint on China's reform, development, and stability. It is a key integral part of his economic theory. In his southern inspection tour addresses in early 1992, with characteristic historical perception and courage to take on the future, Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed more than once the problem of raising economic efficiency, and he urged the people of the whole nation: "In future modernization, it is both necessary and within our grasp to achieve a certain number of stages where there is a better rate of development and high economic efficiency. We must aspire to this!" An intensive study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings on raising economic efficiency helps us understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party Central Committee's overall strategic layout for speeding up the establishment of a socialist market economy system in order to promote economic development and social progress. I. "Work for Efficiency in an Down-to-Earth Fashion" -- Relationship Between Efficiency and Development Speeding up development and turning our country into a socialist power were the lifelong ideals and goals for proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, as well as the main theme forever occupying a prominent space in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory and practice. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, socialist China was under external pressure: The international socialist movement had entered a low tide; the world's economy was moving into different blocs and increasingly integrated; and there was the rapid economic takeoff of the Asia-Pacific circle. There were also internal difficulties: Deep-layered economic contradictions remained; there was an irrational production structure; and there had been no fundamental improvement in the low economic efficiency. At this critical juncture, where challenges and opportunities coexisted and difficulties and hopes ran side by side, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed the vital importance for China's future and fate of the general development goal of speeding up development and quadrupling the GDP. He made a series of expositions on how to speed up development and achieve the general strategic goal of quadrupling the GDP, a question that turns on the mode of development. On how to achieve the general strategic goal of quadrupling the GDP, Comrade Xiaoping makes two fundamental requirements: First, according to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, he stresses that the economic quadrupling must not be "diluted" but "real and solid," for he is "not encouraging high speed in disregard of practical conditions." Second, on the principle of the party serving the people, the fundamental criterion will be whether or not the people support and favor the program. He stresses that "doubling the GDP ultimately must be reflected in people's living standards, which is, moreover, a gradually rising one." "The people are highly sensitized to this problem. Our bookkeeping can in no way beat theirs, for theirs is the truest." These two fundamental requirements determine what Comrade Xiaoping stressed, that increasing the rate of development must be premised on raising economic efficiency, and the development rate he was stressing is of necessity one with good efficiency. Comrade Xiaoping has explained this clearly: In the article "The First Decade as Preparation for the Following One," he pointed out clearly: "The target for our struggle should have been in place toward the last 20 years of this century, and that is quadrupling both industrial and agricultural output value under the premise of increasing economic efficiency." In the article "All Tasks Must Be Conducive to the Establishment of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," he pointed out: "We must attach importance to raising economic efficiency and should not go after only growth in output volume and value." In his southern inspection tour addresses, he said: "Economic development in our country is such that every few years we will have to move into a new dimension. Of course, this does not mean that we are encouraging impractically high speed. We still have to be down-to-earth and value-efficient, and develop in a steady and coordinated fashion." On the question of how to speed up economic development, there have always been two models in the history of China's socialism: One is "rate-pulled efficiency." The traditional planned economy increased the rate of economic development mainly through expanding investment, opening up new fronts, and launching new projects. The economy was pulled into high-rate growth momentum by means of speed, and particularly by means of expanded fixed-asset investment, which naturally also raised economic efficiency. We can say that this model, through inertia, still plays a role to this day. Two, the "efficiency-propelled rate," raising economic efficiency through increasing internal reproduction capacity, and from it increasing the rate of economic development. This is precisely the model Comrade Xiaoping is advocating. In the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Comrade Deng Xiaoping brought up more than once the lesson of 1958, pointing out: "The development of `leftist' thought led to the `Great Leap' and People's Commune Movements in 1958. That was a big mistake, and we were punished for it. During the three years of natural calamities between 1959 and 1961, industrial and agricultural output went down, and there were only a few commodities on the market. People did not have enough to eat and their production motivation suffered." "Our objective is quite realistic, and raising people's living standards is a long struggle. The several mistakes we have made since the founding of the country all were caused by excessive zeal and unrealistically high targets, which did not match with China's practical conditions. Development actually was stalled." Only by adopting the "efficiency-propelled rate" model can we genuinely speed up the rate of economic development. This is the historical conclusion given us by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Guided by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "CPC Central Committee's Decision on Certain Problems Related to Building a Socialist Market Economy System" also stresses the fundamental thinking of raising economic efficiency. The "Decision" stresses: It is necessary to "raise the proportion of financial revenue in the GDP through developing the economy, raising efficiency, and expanding sources of income." We must firmly bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical conclusion, based on his experience and high wisdom and on the spirit of the "Decision." Only the increase of rate premised on improved economic efficiency is a genuine "undiluted" increase in rate, a genuinely and solidly fast rate, not a false and illusory fast rate! The development of China's economy must follow this development model of a genuinely fast development rate! II. "Once Reforms Are in Order; Efficiency Comes Automatically" -- Relations Between Efficiency and Reforms Comrade Deng Xiaoping never stressed development without simultaneously emphasizing reform, because development premised on the improvement of economic efficiency can be achieved only and primarily through reform. Development by external and extensive expansion typified by the blind pursuit of rate is achievable under a traditional planned system. We will understand better Comrade Xiaoping's series of expositions on speeding up reform and opening up if we approach them with raising economic efficiency as the controlling concept. Efficiency is the ratio between input and output, and represents products or services demanded by society. In a traditional planned system, "high input, with low output and efficiency" remained entrenched and beyond touch. "Years of experience prove that the pat traditional system is incapable of developing productive forces." To raise economic efficiency and develop social productive forces, it is necessary to shatter the old planned economy system. As early as 1978, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out sharply: "To raise the economic development rate, it is necessary vigorously to pursue the specialization of enterprises, greatly improve the technical level of the work force, conscientiously train and test workers, tighten up enterprises' economic auditing, and raise the labor productivity and capital profitability rates. Therefore, there should be significant technological, institutional and organizational reforms on all fronts. The pursuit of these reforms represents the long-term interests of people throughout the country, else we will forever remain backward in production technology and management." He pointed out even more explicitly on a trip to Tianjin in 1986: "Tianjin Port has significantly raised its economic efficiency since its deregulation two years ago. The people and land remain the same, but economic efficiency was achieved through reform." Reform is the only and primary path through which economic efficiency can be raised. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping said very firmly: "No one can stop China from continuing with its reform and opening up. Why? It is simple: There will be no development without reform and opening up; the economy will coast and reverse, and people's living standards will fall. The trend of reform is unchangeable." The objective of reform is to establish a socialist market economy system, and raising economic efficiency is a basic requirement for establishing a socialist market economy system. As the ratio between input and output is determined primarily by the mode of resource allocation. Under a planned economy system, resources are allocated by a highly centralized administrative system, under which input and output cannot be rational, and there cannot be any economic efficiency (and in fact, there is none). Only under a socialist market economy system -- under which enterprises are economic entities that operate independently, and are responsible for their own profits and losses, development, and restraint -- can the improvement of economic efficiency become a fundamental objective for our economy. Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific conclusion, the 14th party congress made the establishment of a socialist market economy system the objective for our country's structural reform. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee then outlined a basic framework for the socialist market economY system, thus providing an institutional guarantee for the improvement of economic efficiency. Speeding up the development of productive forces and raising economic efficiency through fundamental changes in resource allocation -- this is Comrade Xiaoping's outstanding and enormous contribution to the theory and practice of reform and opening up. As reform necessarily requires raising economic efficiency, raising economic efficiency will provide a fundamental economic guarantee for the steady pursuit of reform. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "In the process of reform, it is good enough to keep production at a certain growth rate. We should not overreach our limits in the pursuit of high speed. Of course, it will not do if the rate is too low. The rate in the past decade was not low. If we can keep development at a relatively good rate for the next few years, we will run a much lower risk in deepening reform." Reform is the second revolution for our country. It involves an adjustment in the interest pattern and an economic reintegration. Therefore, reform must promote the improvement of economic efficiency in order to create a less demanding situation against which the deepening of reform proceeds. Otherwise there will be capital shortages and weak markets, seriously affecting the reform process. This is the underlying truth of Comrade Xiaoping's famous dictum "once reform is in order, efficiency comes automatically." Based on Comrade Xiaoping's thoughts, the "CPC Central Committee Decision on Certain Problems Related to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System" pointed out explicitly: "Enterprises run production and operations according to market demand, and in pursuit of raising labor productivity and economic efficiency." "The development of our rural economy has entered a stage characterized by structural adjustment and raising economic efficiency. The rural economy must adapt to changes in market demand for agricultural products; optimize its product mix; and develop agriculture in the direction of high yield, high quality, and high efficiency." This embodies the fundamental requirement for establishing a socialist market economy system to raise economic efficiency, as well as the close inner relations between deepening reform and raising economic efficiency. III. "What Hazards Could There Be if We Are Mindful of Economic Efficiency?" -- Relationship Between Economic Efficiency and Stability Both reform and development require a stable environment. Basically, growth in social productive forces and considerable improvement in economic efficiency will provide a fundamental guarantee for social and economic stability. As Comrade Xiaoping said: Regarding treatment of social environment, the real and ultimate way lies in improving the economy." First, we can avoid serious economic damage and fluctuations if increases in the rate of economic development are premised on raising economic efficiency. Comrade Xiaoping said: "One of the things we learn from our experience is that we should be able to see where problems might come from, even when development is going well. Development must proceed at the right pace. Problems will arise when the economy is overheated. In short, be practical when formulating policies. As long as we can do that, we will not make big mistakes." He said on his Tianjin tour: "What hazards could there be, even if one or two localities borrow $10 billion or so in 10 years, if they are mindful of economic efficiency? There is nothing to worry about, even if they borrow $20 billion." Thus raising economic efficiency was made the premise and fundamental guarantee for preventing economic hazards. Early last year, Comrade Xiaoping said in Shanghai: "In economic work, we must seize opportunities and accelerate development while keeping an eye on stability so as to avoid damage, especially serious damage." Thus we are further reminded that we must really carry out the job of raising economic efficiency in economic development. Second, if economic development is based on higher economic efficiency, it will guarantee the improvement of people's living standards and will promote social stability and unity. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out emphatically: "The most fundamental element is the rate of economic growth, the benefit of which, moreover, must be reflected in people's gradually rising living standards. People will settle down when they witness the benefits of stability and of the current institutions and policies. If we can do that, then whatever changes there may be in the international major climate, things will be steady as a rock." What needs to be pointed out and emphasized is that while raising economic efficiency is an economic problem, it is also a process that calls for a spirit of arduous enterprise and involves fight against corruption. This is highly significant for the pursuit of socialist spiritual civilization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out sharply as early as 1980: "The drive against privileges is only one of the aspects of arduous enterprise. The biggest problem is how to stamp out waste, raise labor productivity, cut the output of products for which there is no demand and of junk products not meeting quality requirements, reduce total costs, and raise the rate of capital utilization. We must make everyone understand how hard it was for us to obtain this capital and make these products. Any kind of waste is a crime." In 1985, he pointed out: "A too- rapid development rate causes many problems, and affects reforms and social climate. It is better to be slower, but more stable. The scale of fixed-asset investment must be kept under control. Do not overstretch ourselves in launching capital construction. Management and quality get top priority. Only a development rate that helps both economic efficiency and social benefits is genuine." He said in 1989: "The more developed we are, the more we must emphasize arduous enterprise. Advocating a spirit of arduous enterprise helps overcome corruption. Since the founding of the country, we have been advocating the spirit of arduous enterprise. Later, when things improved, we started encouraging high consumption, and there was waste everywhere." Raising economic efficiency and fighting corruption are completely identical. Only then can we genuinely unify the masses and build socialist spiritual civilization, and hence promote the triumphant march of the socialist cause and the stability and unity of society as a whole. Our country is at a critical juncture where the planned economy is changing toward a socialist market economy system and the traditional development model is changing to a modernized one. Raising economic efficiency is a premise and guarantee of fundamental import for our reform, development, and stability. We should actively conduct studies, investigations, and publicity campaigns for the effort to raise economic efficiency, and should include such an effort as part of our action programs, and hence promote the sustained, rapid, healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our country's economy.
