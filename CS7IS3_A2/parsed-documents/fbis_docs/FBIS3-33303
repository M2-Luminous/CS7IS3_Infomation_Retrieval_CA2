The Chamber of Deputies president said the announcement of a reduction in U.S. cooperation in the field of alternative development will prompt "dissatisfaction" among coca producers. Bedregal pondered: "We will have a very serious political conflict if the crops are reduced just to reduce them, without the proper alternative development planning. The poor coca producer, who is tied to the crisis in Bolivia, will be hard hit." Bedregal wants the announcement handled "with much care," but announced that the discussions to approve the national budget will consider the issue when establishing our country's drug enforcement activities. He said the deputies may discuss this issue after the carnival adjournment. Guillermo Richter, the Senate Government and Drug Trafficking Committee chairman, said he agrees that repression mechanisms should be "as efficient as possible" to prevent illegal activities. Richter said: "I would have liked greater support in economic and financial terms -- not just from the Clinton Administration, but also from the international community -- to help our country and other states that are troubled by this scourge promote alternative development." The U.S. Government's announcements mainly involve countries that produce raw materials to process drugs -- like Bolivia which produces coca leaves that are traditionally used for medicinal purposes, and cocaine. While opinions on the U.S. President's announcement were voiced in Congress, executive branch sources linked to this issue -- the Ministry of Government and the Social Defense Secretariat -- did not comment. Unofficial sources announced that the government will wait for the return of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who went to Oruro yesterday, before adopting a position or beginning discussions to establish the drug enforcement policy that will be implemented in our country.
