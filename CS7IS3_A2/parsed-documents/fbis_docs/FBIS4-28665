Hosokawa told a party convention of its representatives nationwide that "the JNP should play a pioneering role in the second stage of political realignment even with a resolution to dissolve the party for the sake of reform." Hosokawa also demanded that the opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] return to the ruling coalition, saying, "if the SDP decides to join hands with us, we will not spare any effort (to bring that about)." The national convention is the first since the JNP was established in May 1992. More than 70 members of both Diet chambers and representatives from local chapters attended the meeting, at which they will set the party's key policies and reappoint Hosokawa as party leader. Hosokawa told reporters Friday [10 June] night that the parliamentary group "Kaishin," of which the JNP is a member, is likely to evolve into a new party within a few months. He said Kaishin, whose members include the JNP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), will seek broad participation, including the SDP, the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the new party Sakigake. He said before Kaishin becomes a political party, it needs a few months until a new electoral map is drawn for 300 single-seat districts under the new electoral system. A new political reform law for the lower house enacted in January calls for electing 300 legislators from single-seat districts and 200 via proportional representation. On allegations that he received 100 million yen as illegal donations from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group, Hosokawa told the JNP convention that Diet testimony by his former aide Masatoshi Miyama will show his innocence. Upon demand by opposition parties, Miyama is to testify under oath Wednesday at the House of Representatives budget committee on the money scandal. Hosokawa's questionable personal finances led his resignation as premier in April in part to take responsibility for a delay in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget. "Through the testimony by my former secretary Miyama, I think (the opposition) can understand what I have said," Hosokawa said. Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an illicit donation, saying he took the 100 million yen from Sagawa as a loan in 1982 and had repaid it with interest by 1991.
