[passage omitted]. In his address to the CA, President Museveni called upon the delegates to facilitate the making of the constitution that will mainly create a modern industrialized society so that the people of Uganda are able to emancipate themselves from manual labor and protect their sovereignty. He also urged them to evolve a constitution that can quickly galvanize a Uganda people into a cohesive force. He said the constitution they are going to do shall be able to ensure unity in diversity with a clear vision and emphasis on integration and modernization. [passage omitted]. He told the delegates that they should create conditions for the modernization and industrialization of Africa with a wide spectrum of raw materials, a large skilled labor force, and a large internal market, all essential for feasible integration. He impressed upon the delegates the need to ensure a healthy and not [word indistinct] Uganda. He urged them to design a constitution that puts in place maximum freedom for the direct producers of wealth whom he categorized as farmers, industrial workers and industrialists, artisans, and the people working in the services sector. He said these direct producers of wealth should have minimum inconvenience from governments and bureaucrats, and the entrepreneurial class must be left to evolve freely, so that the middle class will be a stabilizing force and integrative elements for our society are formed. Mr. Museveni further urged the delegates to avoid the temptation to transplant management models from elsewhere, declaring that political institutions cannot exist in the air without a social basis. He therefore noted that Uganda must ensure that our political institutions spring from our social structure on a healthy basis. The president reminded the delegates that what has happened today is the fulfillment of what the NRM [National Resistance Movement] envisaged, promised, and set out to do way back in 1981.
