Questar Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;159&hyph;000] Take notice that on December 23, 1993, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) of 79 South State Street, Salt Lake City, Utah 84111 filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;159&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to abandon minor pressure regulating facilities under the blanket authorization issued by the Commission in Docket No. CP82&hyph;491&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Questar proposes to abandon its Huntington District Regulator Station (HU0005 DRS) located adjacent to its six-inch Jurisdictional Lateral (J.L.) No. 44 located in Emery County, Utah, used in conjunction with providing gas service to Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), Questar's local distribution company affiliate. Questar states that the facilities to be abandoned at the HU0005 DRS comprise approximately 100 feet of three, four and six-inch piping and one pressure regulating valve assembly. Questar states that the investment associated with the facilities to be abandoned is $15,129. Questar states that because these facilities function solely to reduce delivery pressures for individual downstream sales and transportation delivery meter stations, no actual deliveries were made directly through these facilities. Questar states that following abandonment, the 3-inch Huntington Tap will remain in service. Questar states that because Mountain Fuel will continue to deliver to its customers via individual meter and regulating stations along the length of J.L. No. 44, there will be no abandonment of gas service to Mountain Fuel or its customers as a result of granting it permission to abandon the HU0005 DRS. Comment date: February 17, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 3.
