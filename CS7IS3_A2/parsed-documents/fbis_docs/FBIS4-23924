He made this point during an address at a conference of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA (Contralesa) in Johannesburg. Saying the creation of the volkstaat [homeland] council was aimed at resolving the question of an Afrikaner state in a responsible manner, Mr Mandela said discussions with Dr Hartzenberg had already seen the CP leader shift away from the Afrikaner weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement]. "We want to bring the right wing into the same process that the National Party finds itself in to prevent bloodshed in our country. "As a result of our discussions, we got General Constand Viljoen to move away from the rigid position of the Afrikaner volksfront. Similarly, we have been able to get Dr Hartzenberg away from the Eugene Terreblanche's AWB," he said to loud applause. "We as a government of national unity have to be responsible when we deal with their (the Afrikaners') demands. If the Afrikaners decide they want a volkstaat, we will deal with it in a particular manner. "But before that, we want to know whether they do represent all Afrikaners in our country," Mr Mandela said. Regarding structures for traditional African leaders, the president said it was imperative greater urgency was given to creating the bodies catered for in the interim constitution. "I refer to the setting up of the houses of traditional leaders in the provinces where this is required; the constitution of the National Council of Traditional Leaders and the drafting of legislation regarding the functioning of these institution. "In consultation with the provinces, we shall ensure that the relevant ministries as well as the commission on provincial government immediately set this process in motion." Mr Mandela added that his government recognised the equality of all traditional leaders and kings. "Whilst we do acknowledge that there are regional varieties, this cannot be interpreted to mean that traditional leaders in any given area should occupy a rung above the others. No king is above other kings in our country. All our kings will enjoy the same status," he said. Also present at the conference were Minister of Constitutional Affairs Mr Roelf Meyer, his deputy Mohammed Valli Moosa and Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology Mrs Winnie Mandela.
