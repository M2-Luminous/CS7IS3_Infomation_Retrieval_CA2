To "punish" one of the warring sides in the tripartite civil war is odious. To attempt do this by air strikes, even "surgical" strikes, in a country seemingly created for carrying out guerrilla wars on the ground is worse than stupidity. So what can be done? The photograph shows the spot in Sarajevo where six children died from a mine explosion at the end of January. The Muslim authorities accused the Serbs, while the Serbs accused Muslim fanatics who, according to them, are killing their own people in an attempt to get Serbian positions bombed. That very day Bosnian Government head Haris Silajdzic called for air strikes. In a letter to the UN and NATO secretaries general he asked: "What else has to happen before the UN resolutions (on the use of aircraft in Bosnia -- S.S.) are finally carried out?" The next bloody tragedy was not long in coming -- 68 people were killed and around 200 wounded in one of Sarajevo's crowded marketplaces. Some people are trying with brutal methodicalness to embroil the United Nations and NATO in the Bosnian chaos. They are bent not so much even on provoking air strikes "to get the siege of Sarajevo lifted" as on embroiling them precisely in the war. It is clear to anyone with the slightest knowledge of the real situation that if NATO aircraft start bombing Serbian positions around the city it will not be possible to avoid heavy civilian casualties. It will be extremely difficult to hold back well armed detachments of Serbs by discipline alone and under a single command. Groups of "avengers" will start "punishing" UN soldiers, who will overnight have been transformed from neutral forces into military adversaries... Moreover, "lifing the siege of Sarajevo" is a purely superficial pretext. To achieve this you need sufficient goodwill on the part of the warring sides. The Serbs have already stated that they are ready to hand Sarajevo over to UN control, given security guarantees for the Serbian part of the the city. Paradoxical as it may seem at first sight, the Muslim leadership has a different perspective on the problem of lifting the siege. Not so long ago Rasim Delic, the commander of the Bosnian Muslim Army, let drop the following remark in conversation with local journalists: "It is of no advantage to us at all to break through the encirclement, for more than half the population of the city will then leave." The Delic plan, which has been referred to many times in the press, is to increase the scale of the war, to carry it into the territory of Croatia and Serbia (Kosovo), to upgrade the 200,000-strong Muslim army's weapons by getting the arms embargo on Bosnia lifted, and to exact military revenge on the battlefield. The threat this poses to the Balkans is well known from history. Fortunately, NATO contains enough level-headed politicians who are conscious of the potential consequences of simple solutions in Bosnia such as bombing the Serbian guns around Sarajevo and who are ready patiently to seek ways that are actually capable of leading to a settlement of the very complex Bosnian problem. On Wednesday the North Atlantic bloc have the opportunity to propose such a way. It will consider a French proposal which chimes with the recent Russian initiative and amounts to putting pressure on all three Bosnian sides rather than just the Serbian one. NATO members will probably agree to demand that both Serbian and Muslim heavy armaments be placed under UN control within one month. So we will very quickly be able to see for ourselves who seeks peace and who wants to prolong the war.
