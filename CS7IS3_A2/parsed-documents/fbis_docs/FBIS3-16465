Meanwhile, a delegation from Azerbaijan has arrived in that capital. Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov are among the members of the republic's delegation. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Center told a Baku Radio correspondent that the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers is expected to deliberate on 11 matters related to the convention on the rights of national minorities, the agreement on collective security, territorial integrity of the CIS countries, mutual relations between the CIS and the CSCE, consultations among the CIS countries on the realization of the program for cooperation for peace, and other issues. The republic's delegation intends to try to have the proposals Azerbaijan submitted during the CIS heads of state summit on collective security in Ashgabat on 24 December included in the agreement on collective security. Azerbaijan is convinced that the agreement's provisions must not only apply to foreign aggression against the CIS countries, but they must also apply to internal attacks. The delegation plans to submit another document to the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers for approval by the CIS leaders. That is a draft declaration of respect for CIS members' sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect for the inviolability of their borders. The declaration notes that the principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs must be the essence of friendly relations and cooperation among the CIS countries.
