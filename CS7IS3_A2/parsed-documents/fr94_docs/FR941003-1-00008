Subpart C_Production and Disclosure of Records Under FOIA ยง2604.301 Requests for records. (a) Addressing requests. Requests for copies of records may be made in person or by telephone, (202) 523&hyph;5757, during normal business hours at the Office of Government Ethics, 1201 New York Avenue NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3917 or by mail addressed to the General Counsel of OGE. Although oral requests may be honored, a requester generally will be asked to submit his request under the FOIA in writing. In the case of a written request, the envelope containing the request and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request. (b) Description of records. Each request must reasonably describe the desired records in sufficient detail to enable Office personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort. A request for a specific category of records will be regarded as fulfilling this requirement if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive of Office operations. (1) Wherever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. (2) If the General Counsel determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, he will either advise the requester what additional information is needed to locate the record, or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. The General Counsel will also extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with Office personnel with the objective of reformulating the request in a manner which will meet the requirements of this section.
