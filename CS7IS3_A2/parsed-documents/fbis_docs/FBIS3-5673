In the DAB declaration, dated 4 March, Gen. Saw Bo Mya cited SLORC's inability to implement basic human rights and democracy in Burma and looking at SLORC's present activities it clearly indicates their intention to cling on to power through the use of military force. At present, SLORC does not deserve to be invited to the annual ASEAN ministerial meeting. The letter also noted ASEAN need to wait-and-see the improvements in SLORC's records before considering such an invitation. It has been learned that Gen. Saw Bo Mya sent similar letters to other ASEAN members. The annual ASEAN ministerial meeting will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in July. The Thai Government intends to invite the SLORC military regime as guest to the meeting.
