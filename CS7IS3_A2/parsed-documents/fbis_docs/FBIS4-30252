The police had been rounding up those students actively involved in the commandeering of a passenger train near here and subsequent violent clashes with police in Seoul over the weekend. So far, 185 students were caught, of whom 38 were placed under arrest and 25 others booked without physical restraint. Nine were still being questioned and 113 were set free, a police source said. The stoppage of the police action came hours after a group of civic leaders in Kwangju called at both the police and the Namchongnyon student organization. Meeting with South Cholla Police Commissioner An Pyong-uk at his police office, the civic leaders asked him to refrain from using his police force excessively. Also calling on Namchongnyon Chairman Yang Tong-hun at Choson University, they stressed that apart from the cause of the recent incident, it would be proper for his organization to admit to mistakes displayed in the course. The nine met over breakfast Thursday morning and decided to mediate between the police and students. They included Profs. Myong No-kun and Yi Kwang-u of Chonnam University, Lawyer Yi Ki-hong and Catholic Father Cho Pius.
