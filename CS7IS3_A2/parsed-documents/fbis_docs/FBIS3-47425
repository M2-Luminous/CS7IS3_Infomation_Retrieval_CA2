"Through their diplomatic channel, the two countries have substantially narrowed difference on the question of fixing an air control transfer point between them, which had in the past been a major obstacle to signing an aviation agreement," the source said. The upcoming meeting, therefore, is expected to register a major progress, making it possible for the two countries to open a direct Seoul-Beijing air route within the first half of this year. The source said that Seoul and Beijing have in effect agreed to draw the air control transfer point along 124 degrees of east longitude so far as the Seoul-Beijing route is concerned. The 124-degree point was determined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1960 and advocated by South Korea. But, Beijing had rejected it in the past on the ground that the transfer point was set by an ICAO participated by Taiwan. For the Seoul-Shanghai route, the two sides have tentatively agreed to keep the control transfer point at 125.2 degrees of east longitude as now. They also decided to fly chartered planes only, instead of regular flights, along the Seoul-Shanghai route, the source said. An official close to Chinese civil aviation authorities said prospects are not necessarily bright because China has set forth various conditions in return for agreeing to these. "But, since both Seoul and Beijing feel the need to open a direct Seoul-Beijing route early, there is much possibility that a major breakthrough will be made at the coming talks," the official added.
