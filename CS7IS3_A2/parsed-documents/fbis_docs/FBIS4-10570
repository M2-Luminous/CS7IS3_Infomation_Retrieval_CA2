Dr. de Greiff clearly refuted U.S. Senator John Kerry and revealed the text of a letter his office sent Kerry days ago indicating the mistakes and untruths presumably contained in the senator's statements on the drug trafficking problem in our country and on the efforts of the Prosecutor General's Office. The prosecutor general also criticized the national government and -- if you read between the lines -- the Justice Ministry. De Greiff told reporters that the justice minister -- on behalf of the executive branch -- defended [words indistinct] as it is commonly said, before Congress, a bill that would later become the nation's new penal code, which is the center of controversy right now. De Greiff also lashed out at certain media, accusing them of not having read the documents in question. He accused the media of distorting his position toward La Quica [Dandeny Munoz Mosquera] and the letter he sent the U.S. judge handling the case. In sum, the prosecutor's decision not to step down will leave much to be done and ample material for comment by the media. Prosecutor General de Greiff urged the national government to work together against the drug trafficking cartels. He recalled that the executive branch worked intensively in discussing the issues and drafting the penal procedural code. As previously mentioned, the prosecutor general criticized the justice minister and said he does not understand why a decision that was discussed and jointly adopted is now being criticized. That collaboration, that harmony among the various branches of public power to establish a common front against drug trafficking, was also demanded in due time by an official who has appeared to be conciliatory, who has served as a bridge in the reestablishment of talks between the prosecutor general and the president as well as with the justice minister. We are talking about Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. Good morning, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta. [Arrieta] Good morning. How are you? [Reporter] What is your opinion about the documents revealed to the general public yesterday by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff and about his news conference, especially the last part of it, when he requests greater harmony and cooperation among the branches of government to fight drug trafficking. [Arrieta] I think it is the most important part of the document. I am talking about the latter part, where the prosecutor general urges the executive branch to cooperate in the entire process, with the criminal policy, with the (?repentance) policy. He pledged to do his part. De Greiff also reaffirmed his determination to continue fighting drug trafficking. We all want to deal with the core of the problem [words indistinct] in the past months. I think that if the Prosecutor General's Office is clearly determined to contribute and participate in the [words indistinct], then we have taken an important step toward breaking the deadlock. [Reporter] The media have reported that the prosecutor general agreed, as the president did this week, with the presentation of a bill to Congress to reform certain rules of the penal procedural code. You met yesterday morning for several hours with Prosecutor General de Greiff. Were you able to discuss which chapters or issues of that penal procedural code should be reformed? [Arrieta] Frankly, this was an idea we had discussed on several occasions. We also discussed it with certain government officials and, fortunately for the country, there has been progress. There is a consensus on the need to review certain points of the penal code and the code on penal procedures. The penal code brings together a series of legal provisions which, as I mentioned, are dispersed in more than 50 or 60 regulations. We need to review sentences and adjust certain aspects of the code on penal procedures that I think merit review, such as that which concerns automatic advantages [ventajas automaticas] and the implementation of certain benefits. I dare say that there is almost a consensus, and I expect our proposal to be accepted so we can form a working group that will be able to quickly present a coherent draft to Congress. We cannot make mistakes. We will take a week to do things right, but I do hope that we will be in the position -- I repeat -- to present a draft to Congress in two or three months with the suggestions we have made plus those that the Prosecutor's Office feels are important, because Congress believes that it is vital that this draft be presented correctly. [Reporter] Based on what you just said, we can surmise that there are three basic aspects: the [word indistinct] of 50 or 60 regulations that are dispersed in various codes; the review of sentences that seem to be too short -- there is a consensus about that in the country; and the review of what you termed automatic advantages and certain benefits for those who turn themselves in. Are there points of disagreement? [Arrieta] As for [words indistinct], I do not think there is any discrepancy. In that specific aspect, I do not think there is any disagreement; on the contrary, there is a consensus. I feel it is also important to mention the famous Article 369E, which was so controversial in its own time. Do you remember a couple of months ago when it was implied that certain people were being investigated by the prosecutor general. [Reporter] Is there a consensus on reforms to Article 369E? Does the justice minister, who so vigorously defended the way it was drafted at Congress, agree with it? [Arrieta] [Words indistinct] a small disagreement but precisely the work of the commission, made up by the group I mentioned, is aimed at ironing out differences so we can present a project on which we all agree. [Reporter] Could domestic and foreign critics be right in saying that we are lax in dealing with drug traffickers. [Arrieta] I think we must realize that the surrender policy and the methods by which it is implemented have had excellent results, but they have also created some problems. We must learn from our mistakes to improve the process. No one thought we would would perform miracles in one or two years. An important procedure was designed and it has had some clear results. We must learn from the mistakes made in the implementation of this policy. We must perfect the process until we have tools that will strengthen the state and allow us to have a clear and effective criminal policy within our laws. When we talk about doing a review, it does not mean that what we did before did not work. It is something we must keep working on to fine tune these tools until they are right for the purposes for which they were intended. [Reporter] So you are telling us that we need a legal interpretation of how the principle of favorableness [principio de favorabilidad] of the criminal code will be applied in the event that standards that are currently considered favorable are reformed, making them stronger and more strict for people who are going to be tried. [Arrieta] You are right, just as you usually are when you comment on legal matters. The truth is that the principle of favorableness implies that some of the changes, especially substantial ones, could be applied only for crimes committed in the future. This is important because it has a preventive effect, an effect that could be useful for the country. [Reporter] What can be done so that U.S. officials, so Mr. Kerry or the U.S. attorney general, can agree with [words indistinct] penal code? [Arrieta] I truly do not believe [words indistinct] agree or disagree because Colombia is independent in that sense. I think the basic problem with the United States is a lack of communication. They should understand the vicissitudes, the difficulties, and the characteristics inherent to our national problems. I do not think they simply want us to have legislation that is similar or comparable to the existing legislation because the circumstances are very different. The idea is to come up with legislation that will be in keeping with our situation and that will give us the tools to fight crime and prevent impunity. I believe that [words indistinct] they will understand in the end. If one looks back one will find that there were very controversial decisions in the judiciary which could seem weak, but when they are analyzed under the current laws, they were not controversial per se, such as the [name indistinct] case, the case of the Ochoas, which involved [word indistinct] that, within the Colombian context, were very negative but in the end, the North Americans understood. That is why I say that the problem is not whether they accept or reject it, because Colombia is independent in these matters. It is a problem of [words indistinct] in consensus. [Words indistinct] in the face of controversial decisions [words indistinct] two or three behind [words indistinct] reasonably explain why certain decisions were made, and they understood in the end. [passage indistinct] have been asking [words indistinct] for coherence among all those concerned with this issue because [words indistinct] can present a united front with wise and reasonable explanations there is no reason to [words indistinct]. Our experience in these matters shows that the North Americans have not been [words indistinct] we have been the problem and thus we must think about our own laws in terms of our own criteria and what is best. [Reporter] With all due respect, Mr. Attorney General, one can understand correspondence and opinions coming and going between Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff and Mrs. Reno. What one cannot understand, as a Colombian, is why pay so much attention to what Senator John Kerry has to say? Who is Sen. John Kerry? He is a U.S. senator, he is a very important person, he is very respectable, he is a writer for THE WASHINGTON POST, and so on, but is that enough to have a whole country paralyzed, to have its people divided and waiting for what a U.S. senator has to say? [Arrieta] That is why it is important to nip this in the bud. I found his statements yesterday interesting, from a certain standpoint. He defined the true dimensions of the problem and highlighted the basic fact that he does not have a full understanding of some areas. I do agree with you, but this is not just any old senator. He is the chairman of the Senate Narcotics Commission. Nevertheless, I believe that as we move on and we explain these things to this fellow, we will surely be able to solve the problem in the end. In general terms, though, I do agree with you on this. [Reporter] Thank you sir. I have three different issues here. First, is it true that the Attorney General's Office has almost taken over the Administrative Department of Civil Aeronautics? [Arrieta] I would not really say takeover is the appropriate term. We have been working closely with them and we have had the full cooperation of the department's directors in solving several delicate problems. There were in fact a great many problems regarding investigation and such, so we decided to implement a permanent surveillance system. This was not just to solve the internal problems we found in security, corruption, and mismanagement in the area of licensing. Through this surveillance operation, without affecting the investigative process, we expect to assist them in the implementation of corrective measures within the department, in order for it to operate much better. To that end, I repeat, we have had the full cooperation of the department's administrative personnel. We are very pleased about this, because we can find the solutions if we continue to work together. We have found several very serious problems there and this cooperation system has allowed them to explain the situation. We will continue to have a permanent presence and continuous surveillance there. [Reporter] Another question. Is the prosecutor general getting his way, from a legal point of view, following the decision to transport five of Pablo Escobar's former lieutenants to participate in judicial proceedings going on Antioquia? [Arrieta] I do not think so, Dario. I do not think anyone is getting their way. I think that this is a way of finding understanding among the parties. On the one hand we have the prosecutor general's wish to have these people in Medellin so the proceedings can progress. The government is getting its way as well, because there will not be a mass transfer, but one person at a time. That way we will not see any of the public security problems they believe could have occurred. I believe that what we are seeing here is a negotiated solution which tries to avert any possible public disturbance, while serving the prosecutor general's legal purposes. I do not think, then, that anyone is getting his way. [Reporter] Very well, we will have individual transfers. Will their stay at the Itagui Prison, in Medellin, be temporary or indefinite? [Arrieta] I believe it will just be temporary, Dario, until certain legal activities are completed, to ensure normal progress of the various cases. As soon as they finish they will return to Bogota, unless the conditions that led the government to object to the transfers still prevail. [Reporter] We thank you for this interview with Caracol, Mr. Attorney General. The last issue has to do with the order issued by the Attorney General's Office and carried out by the Armed Forces and the president. This was the dismissal of Gen. Jesus Armando Arias Cabrales. You had a full year to overturn the special prosecutor's sentence following the investigation and the legal proceedings. Why did you decide not to overturn that ruling? Why did you ratify your predecessor's ruling? [Arrieta] I think it is important that we set the record straight on this issue. This office could not legally overturn my predecessor's ruling. Legally, given the circumstances at that specific time, the ruling could not be revoked, whether I agreed with it or not. According to the law, once a case is filed under the jurisdiction of the administrative legal authorities, and that authority rules on the charges, their ruling cannot be revoked. The attorney general could not legally revoke the ruling, whether he agreed with it or not. [Reporter] Under the law and in your mind, did you agree with your predecessor's ruling? [Arrieta] Dario, it is very difficult for me to answer that, but let me say what I have said on several occasions. When we examined the case we found that there were certain additional issues that should have been investigated, particularly in two areas. The first question was which higher ranking officer gave Gen. Arias Cabrales certain orders regarding the operation? I do not mean civilian authorities; I mean the military authorities that participated in the operation, besides Gen. Cabrales. Then there is a question of who was involved in the specific action that prompted the Attorney General's Office to investigate -- the events that took place in the restroom located between the third and fourth floors of the Justice Palace. I think it is important to make one point here, Dario. When the Attorney General's Office examined the case, it did not examine the operation in general. Many believe that the office's decision was against the reaction, the use of the tanks, the fierceness, the violence, and so on, and that is just not true. The ruling has to do with the specific and precise events that took place on 6 and 7 November -- particularly 7 November -- in the restroom between the third and fourth floors. [Reporter] You mean the alleged abuses and excessive use of force the Armed Forces displayed? [Arrieta] Dario, the Attorney General's Office argued that when these events took place, the Palace had almost been recovered and there was almost no resistance. The hostages were concentrated at specific locations and the rebels were also grouped together. The Attorney General's Office found what went on in the restroom between the third and fourth floors merited some degree of admonishment. The troops opened a hole in the wall using dynamite or a rocket and shot into the room with a machine gun, against rebels and hostages alike. The Attorney General's Office ruled against that specific line of action. That is why the attorney general sentenced Gen. Arias Cabrales. [Reporter] It was not because he followed orders from higher ranking civilian and military authorities, but for that specific incident? [Arrieta] I think the debate has wandered off in that direction. The orders he received are not in question. No one said that obeying orders frees you from all responsibility, as long as these orders are carried within the law. I cannot but agree with the justice minister, because I do not believe there was a specific and direct order to open fire with a machine gun into a room containing 60 or 70 people. That is the part that has created the controversy. There is a question of whether Gen. Arias Cabrales is in fact directly responsible for these specific acts and I have found no specific evidence in the file to prove that. This is why I am in no position to give you a specific answer to your question. I do believe it would be beneficial to offer the people a more detailed explanation about why the Attorney General's Office made this decision. [Reporter] Why has the president remained so silent. At the time he was a congressman and a spokesman for presidential candidate Virgilio Barco. He strongly criticized Former President Belisario Betancur, the minister of defense, and other high government officials for having issued the orders? [Arrieta] Dario, I cannot answer that question. [Reporter] Thank you, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta, for accepting this interview for Caracol.
