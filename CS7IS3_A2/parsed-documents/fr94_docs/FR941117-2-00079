FR941117-2-00079 FR941117-2-00054 As evidenced by the Complaint, proposed Consent Decree, and Competitive Impact Statement filed with the Court, the Department concluded after an extensive and thorough investigation that specific Microsoft practices were unlawfully restraining competition in the PC operating system market, and sought to enjoin such practices in the proposed Final Judgment. The government's Complaint and the proposed Decree do not suggest that Microsoft should be penalized for success or merely for obtaining a larget market share. III. The Legal Standard Governing the Court's Public Interest Determination When the United States proposes an antitrust consent decree, the Tunney Act requires the court to determine whether ``the entry of such judgment is in the public interest.'' 15 U.S.C. §16(e) (1988). In making that determination, ``the court's function is not to determine whether the resulting array of rights and liabilities `is one that will best serve society,' but only to confirm that the resulting `settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest. United States v. Western Elec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1576 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 487 (1993) (quoting, in turn, United States v. Western Elect. Co., 900 F.2d 283, 309 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 911 (1990); United States v. Bechtel, 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981); United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975) emphasis in 993 F. 2d)). 4 4 The Western Electric decision involved a consensual modification of an antitrust decree. The Court of Appeals assumed that the Tunney Act standards were applicable in that context. Thus, under the Tunney Act, the district court plays an important but limited role. It properly reviews the government's reasons for proposing the decree, as explained in the competitive impact statement and the response to comments, to ensure that the government is not acting irrationally. But the court may not reject the proposed decree ``simply because the proposal diverge[s] from its view of the public interest.'' Western Elec. Co., 993 F.2d at 1577. Rather, the public interest standard requires the court to enter a proposed decree ``that the Department *␣*␣* reasonably regard[s] as advancing the public interest.'' Id. at 1576; see also United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975). The court may reject the decree ``only if it has exceptional confidence that adverse antitrust consequences will result_perhaps akin to the confidence that would justify a court in overturning the predictive judgments of an administrative agency.'' Western Elect. Co. 993 F.2d at 1577. Moreover, review under the Tunney Act is confined to the terms of the proposed decree and their adequacy as remedies for the violations alleged in the complaint. To the extent that comments raise issues not addressed in the complaint, those comments are irrelevant to the court's Tunney Act review. The Tunney Act does not contemplate that the court will evaluate the wisdom or adequacy of the government's complaint or consider what relief might be appropriate for violations that the Department has not alleged. In describing the factors that may be considered by the court in its public interest determination, the Act refers to ``the competitive impact of such judgment'', the ``termination of alleged violations '' and the impact of the judgment upon ``individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint .'' 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (1988) (emphasis added). There is no suggestion in the Act that the court should consider whether the government should have challenged other practices beyond those detailed in its complaint. The limitations on the scope of a court's Tunney Act review have been explained by two Courts of Appeals. In United States v. Western Elec. Co., 900 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir.), cert denied , 498 U.S. 911 (1990), the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit considered whether the public interest required the continuation of a consent decree provision designed to protect competition in information services markets, notwithstanding the agreement of the parties in the case that the decree provision should be rescinded. 5 The court noted that the government's case ``centered exclusively on AT&T's activities in the interexchange-service and equipment manufacturing markets,'' and did not involve the information services market. Id at 307. Because of that, the Court of Appeals concluded that if the parties had proposed a decree that did not include provisions to protect information services markets, that decree nonetheless would have been in the public interest. Id. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized the same principle: the Tunney Act ``does not authorize a district court to base its public interest determination on antitrust concerns in markets other than those alleged in the government's complaint.'' United States v. BNS Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462&hyph;63 (9th Cir. 1988); see also In re International Business Mach. Corp., 687 F.2d 591, 603 (2d Cir. 1982) (Department's decision to dismiss without prejudice an antitrust case it previously had filed does not require court approval under the Tunney Act); United States v. Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., 547 F. Supp. 399, 400 (N.D. Cal. 1982) (same). 5 Although there is arguably a distinction between the entry of a consent judgment and the modification of the consent judgment, modifications of the consent judgment in this case generally have been governed by Tunney Act procedures and the Tunney Act's public interest standard. See Western Elect. Co., 993 F.2d at 1576; Western Elec. Co., 900 F.2d at 295; United States v. American Tel. & Tel., 552 F. Supp. 131, 143 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd, Maryland v. United States 460 U.S. 1001(1983).
