In an interview with BILD AM SONNTAG, Kinkel said: "Yes, there are human rights violations in Turkey." Kinkel once again said that delinquent Kurds should only be deported in absolutely exceptional cases. Anyone who commits a crime belongs before a court and in prison. The government is currently examining whether it is safeguarded that those that are deported will not face torture, death penalties, or anti-constitutional treatment.
