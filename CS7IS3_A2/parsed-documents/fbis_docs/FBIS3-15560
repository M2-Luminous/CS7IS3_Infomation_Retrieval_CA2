The talks focussed on Georgia's request to despatch U.N. peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia and prospects for widenning U.S. aid to Tbilisi. At the end of the talks the two leaders signed a declaration of principles of relations, and also an agreement on mutual encouragement and protection to investments. During the meeting President Clinton said that the United States decisively supports chairman Shevardnadze and the territorial integrity of Georgia. He mentioned difficult times which Georgia is living through and expressed belief that the Georgian people will overcome hardships and build a calmer and more flourishing future. He assured the guest that if the Georgian-Abkhazian talks crown with a durable political settlement, the united states will be inclined to support a U.N. peacemaking operation in Georgia. However, the U.S. President added that the American armed forces must not participate in it. The U.S. President noted that his country intends to render humanitarian aid worth 70 million dollars. We affirm our readiness to broaden economic and technical assistance to Georgia while it keeps moving towards peace, Clinton said. "Georgia, like other states of the former Soviet Union, needs foreign aid," in turn, Shevadnadze said. "Without Western assistance we cannot succeed in the transition towards democracy and a free market economy... Georgia supports the 'partnership for peace' programme put forward by Bill Clinton, and hopes to take an active part in implementing it. I have appraised the president of our approach towards finding a solution to the Abkhazian conflict, and intend to furnish our stand on this problem in detail during the U.N. Security Council session on this problem to be held on march 9," Shevardnadze said. "During the talks we also discussed events in Russia. I spoke in favour of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the policy he is conducting. We exchanged assessments of tendencies of the develoment of the situation in russia. We share an interest in strengthening democracy in Russia. Events in moscow will inevitably have great affect on contiguous countries," Shevardnadze emphasised. The Georgian head of state began the official part of his visit with an address to the U.S. government corporation of private capital investments abroad. "We are in a desperate state," he said addressing representatives of the American business world. "The country is on the verge of hunger. If no U.S. aid had arrived, we would have been facing hunger in its true sense," Shevardnadze said. He called on American entrepreneurs to broaden the volume of capital investments in the Georgian economy, assuring that the maximum possible favourable conditions will be for them in Georgia. "A turning point will come in two-three years. I would not have come here, if I were not absolutely confident that Georgia's transition towards a free market economy and democracy is irreversible," the Georgian head of state noted. The same day Shevardnadze visited the Pentagon, where he held talks with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalkashvili. At the end of the meeting the two sides signed a memorandum of cooperation between the two countries in the military sphere. On Monday Shevardnadze also held a meeting with director of the U.S. Agency for International Development Brian Atwood. They discussed questions concerning the implementation of the U.S. Programme of techinal and economic aid to Georgia through channels of this federal department.
