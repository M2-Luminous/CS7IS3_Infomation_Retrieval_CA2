The campaign for "summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer field management [three summers]" is making its progress from south China to north China. The year 1994 is crucial for China to establish a socialist market economic system. The success or failure of agricultural work and whether or not a bumper harvest is reaped will determine, to a great extent, the speed of development for the entire national economy. The Agricultural Department specifically pointed out: The general objective for this year's efforts is to increase peasants' income and to ensure the supply of essential agricultural products. It has important significance for arousing the enthusiasm of peasants for production and for promoting the development of a market economy. In light of China's farming situation, we should focus the entire year's agricultural work on "three summers." If we want to reap bumper harvests the entire year, first we must strive to succeed in doing "three summers" work. Tens of thousands of peasants have rushed to the forefront of "three summers" and the party and government departments in all areas have assigned a large number of cadres and technicians to draw up specific plans and to guide summer harvest, summer sowing, and summer field management. Materials, transportation, grain, and banking sectors have already allocated various materials, funds, farm machinery, and vehicles necessary for "three summers" to their proper users. The broad masses of peasants are getting ready to give full play to their abilities on the "three summers" battlefield. Thanks to the importance attached by the party Central Committee and the State Council stabilizing the agricultural sector and to vigorously promoting agricultural production, coupled with the propitious weather this spring, crops are growing satisfactorily. To really obtain summer grain, all major grain producing areas should use all the manpower, material resources, machinery, and facilities at their disposal to harvest any plot of farmland with ripe grains, thresh grains immediately after they are harvested, and store every harvested grain in warehouses. Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and other major grain producing provinces already joined the forces of large combine harvesters to harvest wheat from provinces in south China to those in north China according to the time when wheat becomes ripe in each province. The interprovincial operation expedited the harvest's progress and improved the utilization ratio of large farm machinery. Owners of wheat farmland were satisfied and harvester operators were pleased. It was as good as a kind of creation by peasants under the new situation of a market economy; and it expedited, to a greater extent, the process of agricultural modernization. Summer grain will be harvested soon. Grain procurement departments should prepare adequate grain-storing facilities and procurement funds, and should create every favorable condition whereby they can immediately buy up the grain once it is delivered. They should pay cash to peasants for the grain delivered. According to the requirements of the party Central Committee and the State Council, grain procurement departments are prohibited from issueing IOU's, refusing to buy available grain, and retaining payments for peasants' grain under various pretexts. Protecting peasants' enthusiasm in producing grain is a major principle that overrides all other minor principles. China's autumn grain production is a major event. Pursuing the principle of enhancing productivity, efficiency, and quality, various localities should pay attention to weather conditions and make use of favorable geographical positions. Once a piece of farmland has been harvested, we should promptly sow seeds on it. If the topsoil is moist, we will use it immediately; otherwise, we will wet the topsoil before using it. We should create all favorable conditions so as to adequately and properly plant autumn grain. We should take realistic and effective measures to resolutely reverse the decrease in the acreage of farmland so as to maintain a steady rise in grain production. Such moves are not only prerequisites to ensure an effective supply of grain, but are also requirements to stabilize the agricultural sector as the foundation of the national economy. Proper summer field management will ensure a bumper harvest for the entire year. As the saying goes: "Planting tasks will contribute to 30 percent of the outcome, whereas management will make the other 70-percent contribution." Planting is the foundation and management is the key. Mismanagement in flood-prevention, drought-resistance, weeding, pest-termination, or fertilizer application will adversely affect the entire year's harvest. Raising investment to enhance scientific and technological progress is an important link in summer field management. According to predictions, various pests will still be serious in certain localities in 1994. Bollworms, in particular, caused a massive reduction in cotton output in some major cotton-producing regions in 1993. Various cotton-producing regions should mobilize corresponding scientific and technological personnel to strictly terminate bollworms. Various scientific and technological departments in the agricultural sector should earnestly apply scientific and technological achievements in the field and integrate summer field management as a part of the comprehensive scientific and technological services, which include checking the conditions of seedlings, preserving the water content and fertility of the soil, preventing pests, and enhancing the plants' growth. Now that the "three summers" tasks are being carried out, we can expect a bumper harvest of summer grain soon. So long as the leadership and the rank and file make concerted efforts in unison, let the market economic mechanisms play their full levering-roles in the economy, and victoriously complete the "three summers" tasks, we can lay a firm foundation for a bumper harvest in the agricultural sector for the entire year.
