'Ali Nijm, former governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, believes that the new customs tariff is not protectionist, which was a foregone conclusion once Egypt signed the GATT agreement whose implementation is overseen by the World Trade Organizaiton. He said that it is common knowledge that the Organization seeks to fully liberalize the foreign trade of member states and that all countries are therefore proscribed from any protectionism (against imports), subsidies (of exports), or dumping (of their products in other markets). In fact, liberalizing foreign trade carries with it several advantages that the richer big countries may enjoy ahead of the poorer ones. Those advantages provide wider opportunities for investment, for workers, and for profit. "Despite the reservations we have about the new tariff, it is only fair to say that it was necessary in order to avoid isolating us from the rest of the 95 other countries of the world that signed the GATT agreement and allowed the exchange of foreign trade among them. "On the other hand, since we are a developing nation, the government should have carefully and thoroughly scrutinized the tariff to preclude those distortions that gave less consideration to economic impact than to levies and boosting revenues. "Before it directs Egyptian investors and producers to improve and boost production, the state must first use certain laws, and whatever strategies it deems suitable, to address businessmen's and investors' complaints about the new tariff's negatives, such as raising the levy on production requirements. Such a step would maximize positives and alleviate the impact of negatives." Wanted: Egyptian ISO [International Standardization Organization] Dr. Ibrahim al-Siba'i, vice chancellor of Cairo University's College of Commerce, emphasizes that protection is lacking and says that "it is a mistake to believe that reducing customs tariffs does not remove the umbrella of protection from domestic industries. Whatever protection officials envisage is in the new tariff is passive and not positive. The government has reduced the fees on foreign competition at the same time it has imposed a levy on the production requirements of domestic industries. As if that wasn't enough, it levied other fees under different names in order to boost revenue returns and make up for lowering the customs duties. "The government has forgotten, or has chosen to forget, that this would inevitably increase the cost of Egyptian products and consequently raise their price vis-a-vis foreign products in competition that is not at all fair, especially since most of our industries are in the infant stage and still need government support in the form of incentives that would help them improve quality. That is why Egyptian goods will not be able to persevere against their imported counterparts and will not be able to penetrate world markets by passing ISO's international standards of quality. "The least the Egyptian government can do, in turn, is to insist on strict application of ISO standards for its imports and on not opening its markets to any product that does not meet those standards. Some of the Gulf countries have already done so." A National Role, Absent Dr. Hasan Abu-Zayd, chairman of the Accounting Department at Cairo University's College of Commerce, says: "We lack a distinct course and a defined target. If there is a consensus that the objective is to improve the quality of Egyptian products and boost exports, where then is the national role performed by the government in order to realize that objective which, in itself, represents our salvation from all economic woes? "The government has not made production requirements available at economic prices. Consequently, the new customs tariff did not remove production impediments. Recent customs modifications considered [treated] our national industries, most of which are still in their infancy, as if they were strong industries in no need for production requirements, and therefore considered them as finished products subject to duty in full. Only a few such requirements have been excepted, and the duty on them has actually been cut. But those reductions, unfortunately, are in form only and not in actuality since those few items have been made subject to additional fees under different tax categories. "Most countries of the world protect their vital industries. Even America insisted that the GATT agreement cover its movie industry in order to ensure full protection for that industry. We are no less than those countries. "The state must endeavor to supply production requirements at economic prices, to remove impediments to production, and to improve the investment climate in Egypt. Very briefly, it must provide for the Egyptian investor in our country the same conditions under which foreign investors operate in their own countries." Investor Rida-Allah Hilmi (from Tenth of Ramadan City) also calls for comprehensive studies of each individual producer in order to identify its means of production. Lacking that, grave mixups would occur, as proved by the new tariff, and many production requirements would be treated as finished products subject to maximum duty. He added: "We are not asking the impossible but we call for fairness...as most countries of the world do." Between a Rock and a Hard Place General Salim Zaki (from Tenth of Ramadan City) said: "I was surprised to find the new tariff totally different from what officials, including the prime minister and the minister of finance, led us to expect. They said it would provide great reductions for all means of production, but we see no reductions at all. What we see is a bizarre approach to the means of production, which the tariff treats as finished products, rather than semi-manufactured raw materials. "How, then, can officials expect us, as investors, to produce output of higher quality and lower price? The situation is very thorny, and we find ourselves between a rock and a hard place. Either we change our profession and activities from producers to merchants, or we close our factories in the face of the frightening losses that will accrue as a result of the latest customs modifications and seek another location that provides a better climate for investment." Gen. Salim Zaki emphasizes that the situation is in urgent need of review and cannot tolerate a long wait, as officials are wont to do. "We must reduce the duty on the means of production in a real way that will enable investors to produce Egyptian products of high quality at a cheap price in order to enable us to compete with foreign products in a marketplace that has no mercy." Chemist Lewis Bisharah says: "It is illogical for the new tariff to impose a 60-percent duty on the means of production required by local industries." (He was referring to the ready-made garment industry where the new tariff imposed duties of 60 percent on shoulder pads for mens and ladies suits, blouses, and mens belts, and of 40 percent on chest padding [hashawa al-sadr], and other items. He emphasizes that this can only mean that prices of Egyptian products will be double those of their foreign counterparts and sometimes even more. He said: "How could the officials have overlooked that? If they consider the new tariff to be an inevitable step along the road, then we as investors see a need to follow this step with other urgent steps that take domestic industry into consideration and provide it with the means of protection...exactly as do other countries keen on providing better climates for investment until we reach the international level of customs duties that are paid by our investor counterparts in foreign countries." Chemist Lewis Bisharah demands that spare parts be treated as machinery and equipment are treated and not as finished electrical products, because spare parts are as important as machinery and not less so. "How, then, can the new tariff subject them to higher duty than that imposed on tools and equipment? We are in urgent and pressing need for a reassessment and for solutions to all the problems generated by the new tariff."
