Because once again, this proves foreign intervention and conspiracy against Cyprus during a new decisive phase of the Cyprus issue. The president did not reveal who the third parties trying to prevent implementation of the new defense doctrine are. The doctrine actually means the accession of Cyprus to Greece's unified defense space. There was no doubt of the fact that foreigners would conspire against the new defense doctrine. In any case, the reaction of the British and Americans on the issue of the National Guard's arms program and the representations made, at times, toward France and other countries that sell arms to Cyprus, are known. However, what is nice is that both the Cypriot and the Greek Governments reject the interventions by the third parties on the new defense doctrine and methodically proceed with its implementation. Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis' visit to Nicosia next week is indicative of the decisions by the two governments not to take seriously the intervention of the British and Americans, and not to back down on the issue of the unified defense space. The Greek defense minister along with the Cypriot Government and military leadership will study ways for quicker implementation of what has been decided in Athens between President Kliridhis and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. In the meantime, people are outraged by the foreign interventions that have to do not only with the political but also with the military aspect of the Cyprus issue, because the British and Americans, and whoever else, are not bothered and concerned with the presence of 35,000 Turkish troops and 70,000 settlers in Cyprus. On the contrary, they are bothered because it was decided that Cyprus' defenses should be put on a new basis so that the island will not be under constant threat from a new Turkish offensive. This "concern" expressed by the foreigners raises many questions that should teach us a lot. Because, the foreigners want an undefended and weak Cyprus that will always be under foreign influence. It is a blessing that the two governments rejected the foreigners' efforts and, systematically and quietly, have proceeded with the implementation of the unified defense goal.
