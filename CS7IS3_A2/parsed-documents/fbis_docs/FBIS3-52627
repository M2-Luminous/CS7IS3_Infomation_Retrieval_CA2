These remarks make it necessary to give the following explanations. Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said about foreign debts: "It is true that in the current year we have been unable to repay some of our foreign debts. But the media are wrong in reporting that these debts are high." Of course, it is a source of pleasure that the president, as the highest ranking executive official of the country, has, at any rate, accepted the fact that we have not been able to repay our foreign debts on the due date in the current year. When the country's high-ranking officials have correct information on this issue but do not place this information at the disposal of the people and the mass media, then rumors start. There is no doubt that under such conditions each person refers to one figure or another. But we know that the total amount of our foreign debt is somewhere near $28 billion, of which $10 billion are for goods that we have committed ourselves to purchase but which have not yet been delivered. If the government wants to, it can cancel these orders and not add to the $18 billion of debts that we already have and out of which $8 billion had to be repaid by the government this year. If this problem is not solved, this figure will increase in the coming years. These are figures and information that the press has been able to gather from here and there. But what is Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticizing? Does he believe that the press should not tell the truth? Or is he criticizing the fact that the figures were published? Does he believe that these figures are incorrect? Then why do the officials not come out and state the true figures to the press? Naturally, the best way to prevent incorrect reporting is through a realistic approach by the officials. The president also said: "If there are pressures as far as the repayment of debts is concerned, it is because our creditors are not our friends and the plans that they have drawn up are such that they have not given us enough time for repayment." This statement in itself shows that Iran should have been more careful about which country it received loans from. Frankly speaking, what need was there for us to get loans for our reconstruction and economic development from countries or companies that are not our friends? Does this mean that we have asked for loans and assistance from our enemies? How can this be justified? What need is there for us to carry out transactions with someone who is not our friend? But we deal with countries like Japan, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries that Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government has repeatedly described as friends of the Islamic Republic and he has called for the expansion of relations with them. However, when the press questioned the quality and the quantity of our relations with these countries, our officials described these efforts by the press as a type of obstructionism in Iran's foreign relations and told us that we cannot avoid relations with a country that wants to be our friend and that the press should not resort to such obstructionism. Then how is it that these countries were our friends then and have now become our enemies and are obstructing matters? Is it not that we resorted to an unrestrained expansion of relations with these countries without taking true conditions into consideration? Is it not that we set foot on a wrong path without carrying out the necessary calculations? The other point is that it has been repeatedly stated that foreign loans and investments were in economic and fundamental fields that promised immediate returns that would ensure the rapid repayment of these loans. But this has not happened. Was this because of wrong policies? Is it correct for us to receive a loan from the World Bank and build the huge building of the Central Bank and other such projects instead of using it for profitable fields such as agriculture and so on? Naturally, when a foreign loan is taken out for the Central Bank, it will not have any economic returns and cannot ensure an income with which we can repay a loan when it expires. Is it correct for us to allocate World Bank loans to development projects and then face a difficulty in repaying them? Basically, why do we expect the repayment time for our debts to expire and the creditor not to request payment, and then--if he expresses lack of confidence in us--to think that he is our enemy? This is an irrational expectation. We should plan so as to avoid difficulties when it comes to meeting our commitments. If from the very beginning we had foreseen all these conditions, it would have been better for us not to seek loans at all. It would have been better if the reconstruction of Rudbar and Manjil had been completed a year late, if the huge Central Bank building had not been constructed, and if the plan for the surface waters of Tehran and its suburbs had not been completed rather than for us to pawn our country's prestige for such development projects. Stating these points is not critical or antagonistic. It is only a realistic belief that the people should be informed about such issues, that the officials should be broad-minded enough to realize that the press is reflecting problems in an unbiased manner, and to compile programs to solve these problems.
