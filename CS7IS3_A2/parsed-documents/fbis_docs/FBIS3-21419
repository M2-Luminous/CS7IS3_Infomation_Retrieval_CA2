The widespread contrary impression, that the Indo-U.S. relationship is at a "low ebb," he attributed to the media's proclivity to play up differences, "real or imaginary," rather than positive developments. Mr Brill was, of course, doing his duty as any good professional diplomat would, especially if he carries the heavy burden of running one of America's largest embassies which has been without an ambassador for nearly a year. Moreover, and more importantly, most of what he had to say was doubtless factually accurate. Big Leap It is a fact, for instance, that economic relations between India and the United States have taken a big leap forward. A fifth of all Indian exports do go to America, and the two-way trade in 1993 seems to have touched the record figure of $7 billion, compared with $6 billion in the preceding year. Equally, if not more, welcome is the dramatic rise in U.S. investments in this country, more American funds having been invested during the last 12 months than in the previous four decades. And, although Mr Brill did not say so, the formation of an India Interest Group by a number of U.S. corporate giants is a fact of great importance and something to be built upon. At the same time, all this adds up to a classic case of facts obscuring the truth. For, if it is wrong to overlook or underplay the significant upswing in Indo-U.S. relations, it is equally erroneous to concentrate only on positive developments in the economic sphere and brush aside, with a flippant wave of the hand, the very real and, at times, hurtful differences of a political and strategic nature. These are neither imaginary nor inconsequential. In any case, to Mr Brill's ill-luck and this country's growing dismay, shattering blows have been delivered to his basic thesis within days of the publication of his article. This was done first by Ms Robin Raphel, arguably the most powerful assistant secretary of state and the Clinton administration's "pointsperson" in running South Asia policy, in her speech to Asia Society. And now President Clinton has added insult to injury by "sharing Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir." This was no off-the-cuff remark. It was a statement of U.S. policy on the occasion of the presentation of credentials by Pakistan's new ambassador, Ms Maleeha Lodi, who had not only embarked on an anti-India tirade but also invited the U.S. President to use his "good offices" to "put the Kashmir issue on the front-burner of world attention." Mr Clinton's subsequent and feeble remark--that his country also opposed "infringement of individual human rights as a result of extremism and fanaticism, whether of religious or secular nature, wherever it occurs"--can in no way diminish the deep offence he has caused to this country. Doubtless, strenuous efforts would be made in the coming days by Washington to try to limit the damage done by the U.S. President who is known to have little time for foreign policy (witness the eight minutes out of 63 devoted to international affairs during the State of the Union speech) and whose understanding of the complexities of problems like Kashmir is even more limited. There would, once again, be homilies that India should not "over-react" to what has been said. But no amount of special pleading can explain away the wounding element in the U.S. policy towards India which remains a complex mix of the good, the bad and the indifferent. In order to understand what is really going on, Mr Clinton's latest performance has to be viewed in the context of his own two recent letters--which have given great comfort to the merchants of terror and secession in both Kashmir and Punjab--and the words and deeds of his hand-picked assistant secretary of state for South Asia. Vigorous Protest No one could have forgotten that, after Ms Raphel's Asia Society speech, the official spokesman of the external affairs ministry, not just the much-maligned Indian media, had protested vigorously against her extraordinary attempt to equate the civil war in Afghanistan (at least partly a product of America's massive support to rival Mujahideen groups through the conduit of Pakistan's infamous ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence], now busy in Kashmir) and the Pakistan-backed scattered insurgencies by various militant groups in the Indian state of Kashmir. The sentiment on this score at a subsequent meeting of Parliament's consultative committee on foreign affairs was even stronger. It would, of course, be churlish to pretend that all policy statements on South Asia, emanating from the Clinton administration, are entirely negative. In Ms Raphel's speech at Asia Society, as in her earlier testimony to a special panel of the Senate foreign relations committee, there was a lot about India which was positive and friendly. Indeed, what makes Mr Clinton's statement on human rights abuses in Kashmir as puzzling as it is pernicious is that its spirit and tenor run counter to what happened at the Senate panel's hearing on this subject. In her presentation Ms Raphel had repeatedly emphasised the various actions India has taken to enforce the observance of human rights in Kashmir and to punish those who did commit excesses. So much so that Senator Jesse Helms, a known India-baiter, interrupted Ms Raphel to exclaim: "But killings took place in Kashmir last week." To which Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now on a visit to Delhi, retorted: "And they will take place next week, just as they will take place in Belfast." Little of this percolated to the Indian public but surely the White House could not have been unaware of the proceedings. That is where the conclusion is inescapable: that there is a connection between what the U.S. President has just said and the Kashmir policy, as enunciated at Asia Society by Ms Raphel. Full Backing It is noteworthy that, while equating Afghanistan and Kashmir and announcing her government's determination to do something to bring "warring parties" in both places to the "conference table," Ms Raphel had told all concerned that this was not her personal policy but had the full backing of Mr Clinton. The President's remarks obviously confirm this which means that Ms Raphel's observations, especially on Kashmir, require close scrutiny. Even while conceding that there were "limits" to what the United States could do about Kashmir, she had emphatically asserted that Kashmir would remain "high" on "my agenda." It is legitimate to wonder what that agenda might be. Time was when it appeared that the United States needling, prodding and hectoring of India over Kashmir was but a ploy to force it to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This no longer holds water as any number of ranking Americans have acknowledged that India would not sign this treaty, no matter what. It follows therefore that pressures on Kashmir stand on their own. In this context, is it purely accidental that China, in top-level talks with Pakistan, has vehemently opposed the idea of an independent Kashmir which, according to Beijing, is sponsored by the United States? This brings me to what the Americans would call the bottom line. Economics may have become the principal factor in international transactions. But burgeoning economic relations between India and the United States by themselves cannot make for a friendly relationship if, at the same time, India's unity, territorial integrity, supreme interests and deepest sensitivities are sought to be trifled with.
