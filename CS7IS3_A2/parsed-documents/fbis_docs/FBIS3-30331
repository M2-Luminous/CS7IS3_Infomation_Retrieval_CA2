The practice of putting forward "no-confidence votes" is by no means the result of a long-term, well-considered strategy. Regardless of the increasing "Bolshevization" within the SDS, the Union has not yet reached the discipline of semi-democratic centralism characteristic of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. Hence, the decisions of the SDS are usually the results of momentary balances of forces within the coalition, of opportunistic considerations, or even of mere coincidences. The two gentlemen Filip Dimitrov and Edvin Sugarev are the most influential SDS leaders today, and it is they who introduce these no-confidence votes (not that this means that the cabinet deserves any confidence, as a matter of fact). "Well, let us move another no-confidence vote; perhaps we can overthrow the government some day or other after all!" -- this is the unexpressed motive behind their "strategy." However, some of the SDS deputies are by no means eager for new elections (which applies to Parliamentary Chairman Mr. Yordanov, who is very concerned about his post, and also to numerous undeclared rank and file members, who long for an eternal parliament). The "eternal" deputies do not dare openly to declare themselves against a course that leads to new elections. Hence, they are forced to support the series of no-confidence votes. Should the cabinet fall, they too are ready to join the "victors" who are driving the SDS toward an election defeat. If the cabinet does not fall -- every unsuccessful no-confidence vote is likely to prolong their existence as members of parliament, which is the most pleasant physical condition for them.
