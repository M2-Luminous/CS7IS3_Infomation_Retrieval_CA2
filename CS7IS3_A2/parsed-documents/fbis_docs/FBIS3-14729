A flurry of visits to and from Washington in the near future are expected to produce a fresh bout of nuclear activism. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit to New Delhi is only a prelude to higher level exchanges between India, Pakistan and the U.S. While the Clinton Administration is beginning to flex its muscles to get New Delhi and Islamabad into a nuclear nonproliferation embrace, the operational element of this strategy unfortunately continues to rely upon flawed logic. By reviving the planes-for- non-proliferation strategy, Washington hopes to give its overall nuclear nonproliferation goals a significant boost. In the past few weeks, the Administration has been seeking to manoeuvre past strong Congressional opinion by using the supply of stranded F-16 planes to Pakistan, on a one-time exception basis, to induce a capping of Pakistan's clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Such a move, apart from the hydraheaded implications for the subcontinent, is fraught with expected risks of failure. Through the 1980's, the Reagan Administration's guns for influence policy produced no tangible results on the nuclear front for Washington. Despite soaking up nearly $10 billion in economic- cum-military assistance, Islamabad's bellicosity towards its eastern neighbour remained acute. Neither did the drive towards acquiring a nuclear weapon capability slow down. To the contrary, Islamabad was convinced that the guns for influence policy may have been intended for its nuclear programme but, in effect, it held a virtual veto, because of the anticipation of Washington's policies whose real thrust was to keep open the channels of communication with the Afghan Mojahedin. Having cooperated with the CIA, the military regime in Islamabad was given a virtual free hand to procure critical parts for the bomb from the West. Over all, this policy only produced a feverish arms race in the subcontinent. With Afghanistan removed from its strategic "concerns", Washington realised that Islamabad and the Generals had pulled wool over its eyes through the entire period of the Afghan resistance. It acted belated in deciding that the Pakistan nuclear establishment had crossed the "red light", which warranted them to stop economic and military aid, halfway through the second phase of the assistance programme. President Bush's inability to provide the waiver certificate in October 1990 automatically brought forth the provisions of the Pressler Amendment. The decision to seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment has been a stated objective of the Clinton Administration. But its attempts to re-write the Freedom Assistance Act without a country specific language have not been acceptable to U.S. lawmakers. Without the requisite votes, the Clinton Administration publicly forwarded a draft that retained the language of the Pressler Amendment. But privately it has been pursuing an innovative track in diplomacy. The Grand Strategy that has been crafted by the South Asia Department in Foggy Bottom is to maximize the leverage that Washington has with Islamabad, New Delhi and Congress over the Pressler Amendment. It is no secret that the supply of the stranded 71 F-16's has become the focal point of the dispute between Islamabad and Washington. The F-16's, apart from their operational versatility, have come to symbolise the tenuous nature of their bilateral relations. In another context, the F-16 represents the jagged edge of a bitter and costly arms race between India and Pakistan. Within Pakistan, the supply of the aircraft has been projected in popular perception as the test case of America's "loyalty" to Islamabad's outstretched hand of friendship and assistance. With the stakes getting higher on the issue of the delivery of the F-16's, Washington's mandarins including Ms. Raphel have conceived of a strategy that seeks to develop sufficient leverage over Islamabad by sending signals that it is prepared to work for the release of the F-16 for a price. This bounty, it is generally assumed, is to seek to cap the nuclear weapon programme. There are two broad interpretations of the proposed moves on the South Asian chess board. One view looks upon the F-16 nuclear capping swap in purely bilateral terms, with New Delhi's ability to steer clear of any linkages on New Delhi's nuclear front. The resumed supply of F-16's, this view contends, will spark a fresh round of purchases. Without a countervailing external power capable of giving aircraft that match the large dose of F-16's that Islamabad will receive, New Delhi may be forced to look at other alternatives to restore the balance. The second view looks at the proposed move in alarmist tones. They perceive this decision by the Clinton Administration to represent a "tilt" towards Islamabad, bringing back earlier fears that Washington's Pakistan policy is being worked without taking into account New Delhi's sensitivity. There is, however, a need to look at the Administration's attempt as part of a larger and more coordinated strategy than is generally assumed. In both reports submitted to Congress for FY 1992-93, the Administration has consistently singled out nuclear non-proliferation as its highest priority item in South Asia. The reports have also underlined the manner in which the U.S. would want to proceed in achieving this goal. Washington would first like to "cap" the programmes of the two countries then "freeze" them followed by their "roll back". It is obvious that they can achieve this only through simultaneous pressure upon Islamabad and New Delhi. Several credible news reports have outlined the course the Clinton Administration would like to take. The one-time exception is like dangling a carrot before the Benazir Bhutto government seeking in return a formal announcement that its nuclear programme has been capped. It is evident that Washington will not merely accept Pakistani declarations, but will seek inspections of nuclear facilities in Pakistan and create inventories, thereby hoping to foreclose future enrichment and its weapons development programme. The leverage to make Islamabad bite the non-proliferation bait will be the resumption of the F-16 fighters. Washington hopes that the resumption of supply of these high visibility items will allow Benazir a face-saving escape route because, technically, Islamabad's weapon option would remain open while its future capability would be severely hampered. In fact, the controversy over nuclear capping that involved all major actors of the troika having corroborated the decision to cap the programme, albeit with totally differing motivations, could be part of a long-term strategy of sensitising Pakistani public opinion to a trend that Islamabad may have accepted as au fait. A declaratory posture on nuclear capping would allow the Administration to create sufficient grounds within Congress to seek the repeal of the Pressler Amendment, allowing for resumption of arms supplies to Pakistan. But it would be inconceivable for Islamabad to accept such terms on a unilateral basis. This is where the second element of Washington's nuclear nonproliferation strategy for South Asia comes into play. The Robin Raphel visit to New Delhi coincides with the visit of General Abdul Waheed Kakar to Washington. The fact that the much postponed visit by a Pakistan Army Chief is on, suggests that the nuclear issue will be discussed with the man generally presumed to be closest to the nuclear button. There is every possibility that Ms. Raphel and Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, scheduled to visit India some 10 days after her, may carry a significant nonproliferation message for India. New Delhi would no doubt come under severe pressure, if Washington and Islamabad are able to agree upon this tandem approach. While our nuclear disarmament policies have been predicated upon a global approach, we have in the recent past been persuaded to accept the validity of a regional construct, not necessarily confined to South Asia. New Delhi cannot escape the ramifications of the impending Pak-U.S. deal on the F-16's. Pressure upon New Delhi notwithstanding, Washington's aircraft-for-capping strategy can fall into a similar trap that the Reagan and Bush Administrations had fallen into. Capping will not remove Islamabad's clandestine bombs nor will it give reliable information about how much fissile material Abdul Qadir Khan's men would have stashed away elsewhere. Given Islamabad's persistent attempts to link Kashmir with the fear of a holocaust, Islamabad's declaratory posture needs to be accepted with a pinch of salt. Washington may find that in the process of capping nuclear programmes in South Asia, it has caused a sprint towards overt nuclearisation.
