The Likud, Tzomet, and Moledet factions said that it is most deplorable that the prime minister is attempting to prepare Israeli pubic opinion for a withdrawal from the Golan Heights through threats of war. Here is what Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu had to say: [Begin Netanyahu recording] What the prime minister apparently fails to understand is that the danger of war lies only in his blabbering about it. The reason the Syrians have not and will not fire the missiles they already possess at Israel is the simple fact that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is sitting on the Golan Heights at zero-range from Damascus. These missiles will become a real threat only if the IDF withdraws from its positions on the Golan Heights. [end recording]
