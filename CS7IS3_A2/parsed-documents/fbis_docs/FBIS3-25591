It can be put into operation within weeks. Excerpts of a top secret Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] "war" document, which came into RAPPORT's possession this week, even contain guidelines for the treatment of prisoners of war. Reputable sources close to the Volksfront told RAPPORT this week that the coming parliamentary sitting early in March will be the possible signal for the launching of the so-called V-day. On this V-day ("V" stands for Volkstaat [homeland]), incidents of violence could take place. Plans for war have been underway for weeks, under the leadership of a group of approximately 50 retired, but relatively young, senior officers of the South African Defense Force. These are mainly brigadiers, colonels, and commandants. These officers have been consulting with elements in the Inkatha Freedom Party for a long while. Meanwhile, Volksfront leader, General Constand Viljoen, is busy chasing every negotiation option for a peaceful settlement. Planning for the armed resistance is being done under the greatest cloud of secrecy by planners who work independently of each other in small groups. Even influential leadership figures in the Volksfront, apparently including nearly the entire so-called "transitional government," are still totally unaware of the plans. Senior officers involved in drafting these war plans apparently have little patience with politicians. They "can continue with their useless actions." Even General Tienie Groenewald, one of the leadership figures in the Volksfront, is, according to RAPPORT's information, in the dark about plans for an armed struggle. Gen. Groenewald, a former senior officer in Military Intelligence, is not trusted by influential people within the Volksfront. It is interesting to note that the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has played no part in the drafting of these war plans. One of the reasons is that the AWB is regarded as being fully infiltrated by agents in the state Intelligence service. It appears that planners are careful to avoid the armed resistance from becoming a form of so-called "ethnic cleansing," where blacks are shot at random. This issue is strongly stressed by senior army officers heading the operation. In the Volksfront document in RAPPORT's possession, marked "Top Secret," there is repeated reference to "the pending confrontation": "As a result of the composition of the SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP [South African Police] the pending confrontation will undoubtedly result in the capture of large numbers of prisoners of war that will have to be controlled and managed by own forces. It is of cardinal importance that members be fully informed about action expected of them in this regard. It is in the interest of future relations between the various groups, as well as the Christian duty of each individual and military unit, to be sympathetic in the exercising of their duties." Thereafter, broad guidelines are given for the handling of prisoners of war. Among other things, it stipulates that they must be treated according to the rules of the Geneva Convention, and if a criminal act should lead to the death of a prisoner, then the person responsible will be charged with murder and will be court martialed. The court will have to reach a decision within 24 hours and sentence will also have to passed in this time. Another instruction is that the "transporting" of prisoners will be the responsibility of "area commanders," who will have to identify collection points before 24 January 1994. RAPPORT has determined that this instruction has already been carried out and that the so-called collection points are farms in the northern Transvaal. The document does not mention Gen. Constand Viljoen. At time of going to press he could not be reached for comment.
