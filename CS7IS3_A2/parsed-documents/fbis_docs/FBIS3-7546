Our future task is internationalization." Thus, he indicated Taiwan's strong intention to return to the international community through its admission into the GATT and the United Nations. While stressing that Taiwan's economy is growing smoothly, Secretary General Hsu stated that it is also advancing in its political democratization under President Li Teng-hui's leadership. Then, while disclosing good prospects for "the direct presidential election by residents next year," Hsu added: "As a result, democratization will be fully realized." Touching on the issue of Taiwan's UN admission, Hsu expressed his dissatisfaction, and said: "It is unfair that Taiwan's admission has not been approved while it has economic potential and also intends to fulfill its mission as a member state of the international community." Then, Secretary General Hsu, who is also former representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan, called on Japan for its cooperation in supporting Taiwan's UN admission. On the issue of reunification with China, Hsu pointed out: "While China's democratization is an indispensable factor, the economic disparity is still too big." "However," he added, "exchanges at the private level have been proceeding smoothly but in a cautious way." Thus, he disclosed Taiwan's intention to upgrade the level of dialogue to promote reunification. Hsu also touched on Taiwan's achievements in the diplomatic field. For example, President Li Teng-hui paid unofficial visits to three ASEAN member nations last month with good results. Moreover, he also stated that "we want to be admitted into the GATT through our participation in the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] forum." Thus, he stressed that "the most important future task for Taiwan is its internationalization."
