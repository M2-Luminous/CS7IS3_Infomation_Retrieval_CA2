Under the headline "The New Chaotic Order," the paper notes that President Mubarak described the new international order as a new chaotic order. The newspaper writes: What we see in today's world is chaos, not order. What is happening in Russia, the former Eastern bloc, Iran, Afghanistan, and Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrate the traits of this new international order. The new order is characterized by chaos, wars, and genocide perpetrated by the big powers against downtrodden nations, particularly the Muslim ones. Muslim people have suffered terribly under the new order. This is true in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Islamic republics that were part of the former Soviet Union.
