Subject to accounting changes imposed by the principal French shareholder, Giat Industries, the Liege arms manufacturer is set to officially announce on 7 June a net consolidated profit close to 350 million Belgian francs, following a meeting of the Board of Directors specially convened in order to ratify the balance sheet for the financial year. In the previous year, the group had recorded a net loss of 1,125 million Belgian francs. Twenty Billion The profit is in line with the hopes expressed just a few months ago by Albert Diehl, the group's president: Over 20 billion Belgian francs, in which the military branch (FNNH and Canon Delcour) accounts for just over 9 billion and the civil branch (Browning-Winchester) for almost 12 billion. In both cases, performance has exceeded forecasts. Thus, anticipating the recovery of its U.S. subsidiary, USRAC, and virtually the only remaining problem being the Italian subsidiary, rather than a budgeted loss of 325 million Belgian francs (following a real loss of over 1 billion Belgian francs in 1992) Browning-Winchester closes with a negative balance of just 100 million Belgian francs. As work on the reconstruction of USRAC's U.S. factory is nearing completion, it should break even in 1994. A slight profit is even possible. As to FNNH, with profits of almost 500 million Belgain francs it is reaping the rewards of diversifying its markets. Full Risk Cover? What a contrast! The Herstal SA results come at a time when, from Paris, news of the parent company is so bad that its directors are placing all their hopes in either a rapid recapitalization, 2 billion French francs [Fr] or 12 billion Belgain francs are being requested from the government, or European regroupings. The net loss recorded by Giat Industries for last year amounts to Fr1.2 million or 6.2 billion Belgain francs, which makes a total loss of Fr2.3 billion or almost 14 billion Belgian francs since 1990, the crucial year when the group swapped its status as a state company to that of a limited liability company with shares owned by the public. A possible European regrouping with dangers for Herstal SA? They remain optimistic in Liege. Nobody, they say, is going to dismantle or sell a subsidiary in which investments are being made (2.5 billion Belgain francs) and which is absorbing the losses of its parent company. But the success of Herstal SA is also due to its autonomy and this autonomy has been earned, Albert Diehl likes to say. The Meuse FGTB [General Belgian Workers' Confederation] is considering a reduction in the work week to 32 hours in order to stimulate new recruitment. Diehl would not refuse to discuss this, provided no extra costs for the company are involved. Therein lies the debate, and the challenge!
