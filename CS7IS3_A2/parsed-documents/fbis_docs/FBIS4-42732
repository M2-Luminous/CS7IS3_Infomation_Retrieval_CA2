Delors, president of the European Commission, said urgent action was needed towards "global management of economic problems." He was speaking at the end of a three-day session of the Commission on Global Governance, a body comprising 28 men and women established by world leaders in 1992 to study global cooperation following the end of the Cold War. Delors identified the growing swell of world capital movements as a particular threat to economic stability and sustainable economic growth. "If the rationale of the capital market goes against the interests of the global neighbourhood, who can react?" he asked at a press conference. Delors's answer was an economic security council comprising the United States, Japan, the EU, China, Russia and countries heading regional economic organisation in Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Pacific. He proposes that such a council meet regularly with representatives of such institutions as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Labour Organisation. "We cannot go on talking about the global and the world economy without knowing how to tackle the problem," Delors said. He stressed the need to take a global view of a world economy becoming ever-more unified, and to establish links between "trade, currencies, finance, the environment and polulation growth." Delors said that the international capital market had to bear much of the blame for the current rise in longterm interest rates. Co-chairing the Commission's meeting were the former secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Shridath Ramphal, and former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. They said the meeting had also discussed a United Nations peacekeeping force to extinguish flare-ups of violence, and ways to make the UN more accountable to ordinary people and organisations as well as governments. But Ramphal would not be drawn on what action should be taken to bring countries such as China into line with international standards of human rights. "Good government doesn't need the suppression of one set of values in favour of another," he told journalists when asked whether the Asian drive towards economic development might clash with individual human rights.
