Amendment Nos. 121&hyph;241; 125&hyph;21; 135&hyph;52] RIN 2120&hyph;AE91 Flight Attendant Duty Period Limitations and Rest Requirements AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; notice of effective date. SUMMARY: The notice announces the effective date for the information collection requirements of the Flight Attendant Duty Period Limitations and Rest Requirements final rule. This notice is needed because at the time of issuance of that final rule the Office of Management and Budget had not approved the burden associated with the recordkeeping requirements. That approval has now been received, and the FAA announces the effective date for the affected sections. DATES: Effective Date: Sections 121.683(a)(1), 135.63(a)(3), 135.63(a)(4)(x), 135.63(a)(5), and 135.63(b) are effective November 18, 1994. Compliance Date: March 1, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 15, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a final rule requiring air carriers, air taxi, and commercial operators to provide duty period scheduling limitations and rest requirements for flight attendants engaged in air transportation and air commerce [59 FR 42974; August 19, 1994]. At the time of issuance, the burden associated with the recordkeeping requirements had not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); therefore, those sections of the final rule did not have an effective date. On August 17, 1994, OMB approved the burden associated with the recordkeeping requirements under OMB Control No. 2120&hyph;0585 through July 31, 1997. The FAA hereby gives notice of that approval and the effective date for the affected sections of the final rule. A copy of the OMB approval may be examined in Docket No. 27229 in the FAA Rules Docket, room 915G, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591.
