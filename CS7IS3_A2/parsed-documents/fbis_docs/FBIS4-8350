This became clear after the second meeting of the Consultative Council on National Security. At the meeting Defense Minister Aleksandrov reportedly declared his Ministry's inability to feed the Army. Therefore, in the near future we could be relying on a 55,000-man Army. The food will suffice only for such a size. Everyone understands that even the present armed forces personnel cannot guarantee the country's national security and integrity. This is also well known to our benevolent (for the time being) neighbors in the Balkans. In addition, no one doubts that the results of the "reform" in the army in the last four years have amounted to dismissing 2,000 officers. The new element now is that the 3,000 officers and almost 1,000 sergeants who have been marked (in the best case) for "gradual" dismissal will be requalified according to a U.S. model. Thus, after comprehensively using the Soviet leading experience, now we are advancing toward using the U.S. experience. The minister reportedly proposed other novelties: As consolation, the officers and sergeants dismissed will receive securities rather than the 12-months of wages that they are entitled to. Perhaps he wants to turn them into stock market dealers? The methodology of a British military institute has also been used for the envisaged cuts. However, we do not know whether this methodology also recommends cuts in the drastically inflated payroll of the high-ranking officers on the General Staff and in the Defense Ministry. And another thing, is our army not turning into a producer of young pensioners? Is is not more appropriate to adopt first the national security concept and pass the Law on Defense and the Armed Forces? Otherwise all this resembles cutting off the head of the army. It also reminds us of the experiments of the "father of all nations" [Stalin], who from 1937 until the beginning of the war against Germany "purged" his army of its talented and able officers. We know the results of this purge. Let us hope that we will not have to experience those results in our country.
