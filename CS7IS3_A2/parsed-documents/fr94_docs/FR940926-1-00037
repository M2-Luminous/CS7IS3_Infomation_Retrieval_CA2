FR940926-1-00037 FR940926-1-00011 This agent has been developed by the U.S. Navy as a test gas simulant in place of halon in new halon total flooding systems on ships which have been under construction prior to identification and qualification of substitute agents. Halon systems are no longer included in designs for new ships. The Navy estimates its annual usage to be less than 10,000 pounds annually, decreasing over time. Thus, the Agency believes that the quantities involved are not significant. While SF 6 is not currently used in the commercial sector and new halon systems are rarely installed, EPA is proposing a narrowed use limit to ensure that emissions of this agent remain minimal. The NFPA 12a and NFPA 2001 standards recommend that halon or other total flooding gases not be used in discharge testing, but that alternative methods of ensuring enclosure and piping integrity and system functioning be used. Alternative methods can often be used, such as the ``door fan'' test for enclosure integrity, UL 1058 testing to ensure system functioning, pneumatic test of installed piping, and a ``puff'' test to ensure against internal blockages in the piping network. These stringent design and testing requirements have largely obviated the need to perform a discharge test for total flood systems containing either Halon 1301 or a substitute agent. 3. Proposed Unacceptable a. Total Flooding. (1) HFC&hyph;32. HFC&hyph;32 is proposed unacceptable as a total flooding agent. HFC&hyph;32 has been determined to be flammable, with a large flammability range, and is therefore inappropriate as a halon substitute when used as a pure agent. This agent was proposed acceptable in the first SNAP proposed rulemaking (58 FR 28093, May 12, 1993) but public comment received indicated agreement about the flammability characteristics of this agent. EPA is not aware of any interest in commercializing this agent as a fire suppression agent. IV. Administrative Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.'' It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that federal agencies examine the effects of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a final rule-making, it must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of the Agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). The agency believes that this final rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities and has therefore concluded that a formal RFA is unnecessary. Because costs of the SNAP requirements as a whole are expected to be minor, the rule is unlikely to adversely affect businesses, particularly as the rule exempts small sectors and end-uses from reporting requirements and formal Agency review. In fact, to the extent that information gathering is more expensive and time-consuming for small companies, this rule may well provide benefits for small businesses anxious to examine potential substitutes to any ozone-depleting class I and class II substances they may be using, by requiring manufacturers to make information on such substitues available. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The EPA has determined that this proposed rule contains no information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. V.
