FR941219-1-00032 FR941219-1-00015 On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG. (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information.The NPRM was divided into two segments: (1) vehicle requirements that focused on the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements that focused on the fuel containers alone. In that notice, the agency proposed specific requirements applicable to the initial strength, durability, and pressure relief characteristics of CNG containers. In addition, the agency sought comments about the effects of corrosion and cold temperature extremes on CNG containers, and their rupture without fragmentation. NHTSA received a large number of comments to the docket addressing the January 1993 proposal. The commenters included manufacturers of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses, research organizations, State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies. In addition, NHTSA met with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and had telephone conversations meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed in the public docket. The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and fuel containers is necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container manufacturers stated that NHTSA should issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. With respect to the equipment requirements, the commenters generally believe that Federal requirements about the CNG fuel container integrity are needed and should be implemented as quickly as possible. In addition to comments addressing the proposed requirements for durability, strength, and pressure relief, some commenters favored the promulgation of requirements about corrosion resistance, high and low temperature extremes, damage tolerance, and rupture characteristics of CNG containers. As noted above, NHTSA recently established Standard No. 303. It specifies vehicle performance requirements for the fuel system of vehicles fueled by CNG. The Standard enhances the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles by subjecting the vehicles to crash testing and placing a limit on the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system. The Standard specifies frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds. NHTSA has also issued a final rule that establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304, Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers, that specifies tests and performance requirements applicable to a CNG fuel container's durability, strength, and pressure relief. A pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability by requiring a container to withstand without any leakage, 18,000 cycles of pressurization and depressurization. This requirement helps to ensure that a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings over its service life. A burst test evaluates a container's initial strength and resistance to degradation over time. This requirement helps to ensure that a container's design and material are appropriately strong over the container's life. A bonfire test evaluates a container's pressure relief characteristics when pressure builds in a container, primarily due to temperature rise. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG fuel containers. These requirements are based on specifications in NGV2, a voluntary industry standard addressing CNG fuel containers which was adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 2 . 2 NGV2 was developed by an industry working group that included container manufacturers, CNG users, and utilities. NGV2 specifies four types of container designs. A Type 1 container is a metallic noncomposite container. A Type 2 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a hoop wrapped pattern over the liner's cylinder wall. A Type 3 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. A Type 4 container is a non-metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. II. Agency Supplemental Proposal A. General Based on comments to the January 1993 NPRM and other available information, NHTSA has decided to issue this supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), to propose additional performance requirements and tests to ensure a CNG container's structural integrity. Among the proposed tests are environmental cycling tests, a low temperature impact test, a gunfire test, a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. One environmental cycling test would evaluate a container's resistance to internal corrosion and high humidity as well as the effects of high and low temperatures on a container. A second environmental test would evaluate a container's resistance to road salt and other acidic chemicals. The impact test, known as the Charpy test, would evaluate a metal container's brittle fracture characteristics under low temperatures. The gunfire test would evaluate container fragmentation. Three tests, the flaw tolerance test, the pendulum impact test, and the drop test, would evaluate a container's resistance to external damage. Specifically, the flaw tolerance test would evaluate a container's exterior resistance to abrasion; the pendulum impact test would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a sharp external blow; and the drop test would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a blunt external blow. This notice also proposes labeling requirements applicable to CNG vehicles and labeling requirements for CNG containers in addition to those required by the CNG container final rule.
