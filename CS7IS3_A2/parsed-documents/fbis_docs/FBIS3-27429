Since 1992, China has promulgated and implemented the "Patent Law," the "Trademark Law," the "Copyright Law," the "Law Against Unfair Competition," and other laws and statutes; and has joined the world IPR organization, the Paris Convention for protecting industrial property rights, the World Copyright Convention, and the Patent Cooperation Agreement; thereby establishing a world-class system for protecting IPR. At the seminar, officials from the U.S. Justice Department and Customs explained the enforcement of U.S. legislation to protect IPR, and offered suggestions on how China could protect IPR. The seminar was attended by representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the State Science and Technology Commission, and other ministries and commissions concerned. Officials from the State Copyright Bureau and Trademark Bureau gave briefings on the protection of copyright and the implementation of the trademark law in China, as well as measures being taken in these areas.
