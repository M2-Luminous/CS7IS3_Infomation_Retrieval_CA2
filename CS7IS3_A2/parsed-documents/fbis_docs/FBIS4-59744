FBIS4-59744 "drnes095_n_94004" FBIS-NES-94-095 Daily Report 12 May 1994 LEBANON Former President on al-Hariri Move, Opposition Former President on al-Hariri Move, Opposition JN1305171194 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1940 GMT 12 May 94 JN1305171194 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with former President Amin al-Jumayyil by Kamal Tarabayh; place and date not given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded] [Excerpts] [Tarabayh] Your Excellency, how do you view Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's withdrawal ['i'tikaf]? Do you support or oppose his demands and preconditions? [Al-Jumayyil] The cabinet crisis is one of the results of the al-Ta'if agreement. I said at the time that the agreement would create confusion in relations among the constitutional bodies; that is, the presidency, the prime ministry, and the parliament. In any case, the heresy of withdrawal is a novelty. It is not mentioned in the new or in the old Lebanese constitutions. [Tarabayh] If you please, Mr. President, it is not so new. The late Prime Minister Rashid Karami used to withdraw from time to time. [Al-Jumayyil] It is good that you asked this question. Karami did not withdraw. He respected the constitution. Karami used to resign, tender his resignation. However, for certain circumstances--in 1969 during the Cairo agreement, or during my administration--it was impossible to form a new government for certain national circumstances. Karami would remain to perform the duties of the prime minister. Karami's stand was constitutional. Today, a new heresy is being created, i.e., withdrawal. The least that can be said about it is that it violates the Lebanese Constitution. More than that, it is a crime paralyzing constitutional establishments. In modern democratic countries, a perpetrator of such a crime would be referred to the supreme state council. [Tarabayh] This means al-Hariri's withdrawal is a crime, for which he should be punished? [Al-Jumayyil] I believe and I insist on saying that this is a disturbance of the constitutional establishment. As I have said, the word withdrawal does not exist in the constitution. Prime Minister Karami at the time tendered his resignation to President Hilu [in 1969] and then tendered his resignation to President al-Jumayyil in 1985. There was a resignation. But the heresy of withdrawal, that is, staging a one-man strike, playing hard to get, and sitting at home and saying come and beg me--this means paralyzing the constitutional bodies. By law and by the constitution, this is a crime and a deliberate injury to the people's interests. Who commits such a crime must be referred to the High Court. [Tarabayh] Let us leave the issue of the withdrawal. Al-Hariri presented the view that the Christian, particularly the Maronite representation in the government, should be defined. He called for appointing at least two ministers representing the Phalangist Party and the National Bloc. As a Phalangist from outside the party leadership, do you agree to Phalangist participation in the government? [Al-Jumayyil] [passage omitted] As in the past, we reject the prime minister bringing in some employees who cooperate with him in his own organizations and appointing them directors and high state officials. Now, he is following the same method, consecrating this or that as a Maronite leader or a man responsible for his community. This is rejected. We want the government to continue as it is now, preparatory to the people electing their own representatives, and so that the Lebanese people--and if you want to use the Christian theme--the Christians themselves say who they would like to represent them. [Tarabayh] Would you comment briefly on the detention of the dissolved Lebanese Forces party, Samir Ja'ja', and the accusations leveled against him, topped by the murder of the late Dani Sham'un? [Al-Jumayyil] I do not want to comment on this matter. The law will eventually give its verdict. But I demand that justice be given to all. We do not want biased justice. We do not want two standards before the law. I demand the arrest of the killer of my brother, Bashir. The killer is well-known. He is free and walking safely and happily on Beirut streets. He admitted the murder at the time and confessed who his accomplices were. [passage omitted] [Tarabayh] My last question is: You have recently met with General Michel 'Awn. What did you talk about? Will you participate in the political front which he called for? [Al-Jumayyil] Naturally, he and I consult on current issues because we share the same views about nationalist issues and consider the situation in Lebanon to be unbearable, in view of the current well-known conditions. Together, we are endeavoring to organize the work of the opposition and to close ranks in order to deal with the current situation, especially in this current difficult and historical phase. The entire Middle East is now put to the test. The peace conference will define a new map for the Middle East region. This map should not be redrawn at the expense of Lebanon, its interests, independence, and sovereignty. [Tarabayh] Do you make continuous contacts with 'Awn? [Al-Jumayyil] Indubitably. [Tarabayh] What about General Raymond Iddih? [Al-Jumayyil] I hope that the circles of consultations will expand to include all the leaderships, including that of Iddih. Perhaps the circumstances are not conducive to this now. However, we will continue to gather all the sincere leaderships which have enough courage to confront the current situation in Lebanon. [Tarabayh] Thank you.
