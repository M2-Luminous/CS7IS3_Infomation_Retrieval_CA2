It says: It has been proven beyond a doubt that when there is a unified Arab position on basic pan-Arab issues, the Arab nation can score major achievements. It has also been proven that any penetration of the Arab position from any direction for any reason will definitely harm everyone. This is absolutely clear from the Oslo agreement and what has followed. AL-BA'TH adds: Had Arab coordination remained as it had been at the beginning of the peace talks itwould certainly have been in the interest of the Arabs and, consequently, in the interest of the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace. AL-BA'TH indicates that what matters now is not when the peace talks will resume, but how Israel will comply with the resolutions of international legitimacy so that the peace process will be brought to a successful end leading to a just, comprehensive peace, which is needed in the region. The paper believes that the responsibility for achieving this lies with the cosponsors of the peace process, specifically the United States, being the initiator of the peace process. AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's readiness to continue peace efforts. It indicates that Syria has offered all that is possible to ensure the continuation of that process in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: When Syria called for a meeting of the Arab parties directly concerned with the peace process, it did so out of its faith in joint Arab action and its absolute realization that coordination and faithful commitment will thwart any Israeli attempt to effect another penetration like the Oslo agreement. Besides, coordination in itself can achieve at least a minimum level of Arab aspirations. In an editorial on the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre and the chance that the resolution has provided for the resumption of the peace talks, TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, UN Security Council Resolution 904 on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has provided a new opportunity to resume the peace talks. In turn, this will boost the international arrangements and measures to protect our Palestinian Arab people in the occupied territories, and will prevent the recurrence of spiteful crimes and massacres by the settlers with the support of the Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. TISHRIN continues: The Hebron massacre and the subsequent confrontations and events have proven to the entire world the need to end the Israeli occupation and to arrive at a just, comprehensive peace in accordance with the Madrid conference formula away from any procrastination and obstacles. Thus, Israel must adopt practical measures to protect and ensure the security of the Palestinians. We also demand that it disarm the settlers, give up its provocative and extortionist stands, and seriously contribute toward activating the peace process by recognizing the facts and objectives of this process and responding to the UN resolutions, the Madrid conference formula, and the principle of trading land for peace. TISHRIN adds: Undoubtedly, the chances that were provided for the peace process, particularly during the talks, have been greatly narrowed after the Hebron massacre. Safeguarding the peace process and extricating it from the impasse to which it has been driven requires, more than ever before, a public Israeli acknowledgement in advance that only a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories can ensure the achievement of a just, comprehensive peace and regional security, stability, and calm. TISHRIN stresses Syria's eagerness to continue coordination among the Arab parties to the peace process and its call for a meeting for consultations prior to the resumption of the talks. The paper explains that the Arabs, especially Syria, have always been advocates of right and justice, seriously and honestly working to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. However, Israel has met all this with nothing but more maneuvers and circumvention of the objectives of peace. Had Israel been, like the Arabs, serious at the Madrid conference and had it showed commitment to the formula of that conference, the Hebron massacre would not have taken place and all this violence and terrorism would not have prevailed in the occupied territories, which have turned into battlefields in which Arab citizens are being slaughtered by the gunfire of the occupiers. Nor would southern Lebanon have suffered destruction, bombardment, and displacement of its population as a result of the brutal Israeli aggressions. Concluding, TISHRIN says: While awaiting the true and full implementation of Resolution 904, it must be emphasized that Israel is required, now more than ever before, to respond to all bases and requirements of peace, headed by full withdrawal from the occupied territories. Securing such an Israeli response is both an international and a U.S. responsibility.
