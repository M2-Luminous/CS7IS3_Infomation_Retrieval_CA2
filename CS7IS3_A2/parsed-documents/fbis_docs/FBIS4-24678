According to a report provided by the Shanghai Uni-Trust Property Trust and Consultancy Company Ltd, many investors both at home and abroad have expressed desires to invest in the construction of exhibition halls in Shanghai to show their products and hold trade talks. At present, the city has only four exhibition halls, with a combined area of less than 40,000 sq m. They hardly meet the needs of investors. According to a plan, Shanghai will sponsor more than 60 large international exhibitions and fairs in the near future.
