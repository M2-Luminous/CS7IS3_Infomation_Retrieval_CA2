FBIS4-28957 "dreas115_c_94036" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 North Korea Anti-Korean `Rampage' by Osaka Police Noted Anti-Korean `Rampage' by Osaka Police Noted SK1106053994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0441 GMT 11 Jun 94 SK1106053994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 9 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Osaka prefectural police and the Higashi Police Station of Japan are getting all the more arrogant, ignoring the strong protest by the Koreans in Japan and public opinion at home and abroad, according to CHOSON SINBO. The paper said the Osaka prefectural police, far from apologizing for its criminal acts, let out a stream of provocative words at officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans, shouting "Chongnyon of Korea, break up your protest action" and "we will arrest you, if you stay any longer". The rampage of the Japanese right-wing gangsters is assuming greater intensity, coupled with the arrogance of the Japanese police. On the 6th of June, they appeared around the prefectural police bureau and the Higashi Police Station where Koreans were staging a protest and made a fuss, shouting "away with Koreans." On the 7th, right-wing gangsters belonging to the "League of Asian Nations" came with an armoured vehicle and a loudspeaker car and threatened Koreans who were staging a protest, uttering uncleanly words unfit for human mouth. The suppression by the Japanese reactionaries has lashed the Koreans in Japan into fury.
