Spanish Secretary of State for European Affairs Carlos Westendorp said most EU countries were impatient with the hardline stance of the two countries, which are negotiating to join the Union with Sweden and Finland. "Many (EU) members think the moment has arrived to find out who is ready to join the EU and who is not. The impression is there are some candidates which are not interested in closing the negotiations," he told journalists. Westendorp was speaking during intense talks to wrap up year-long talks with the four countries by a deadline of Monday midnight. But diplomats said Denmark and Germany were resisting attempts to hive Norway and Austria out of the negotiations unless the two applicants softened their entry demands. The talks were continuing late into Sunday night. Diplomats said Sweden was closest to agreeing on entry terms to join the Union, followed by Finland which was still insisting on more aid for its farmers. But the EU was still far from overcoming Norway's flat refusal either to allow more access to its fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports to other countries of the Union. Norway's Minister of the Sea, Greta Knudsen, repeated her country's battle-cry in the negotiations late Sunday: "Not a single extra fish" (for EU and particularly Spanish vessels in Norwegian waters). Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said there was no agreement in sight on the other major obstacle -- Austria's insistence on maintaining strict controls on polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps until end-2004. Austria has hardened its refusal to compromise on trans-Alpine truck pollution since the Swiss public voted a week ago to take foreign trucks off Swiss roads within 10 years and make them cross the Alps by rail. The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, warned that the enlargement talks could also collapse over a dispute over how enlargement of the Union would affect the balance of power within it. Britain is trying to modify the EU's system of majority voting so that the entry of new members will not increase the number of votes needed for blocking minorities in ministerial councils. Spain wants the system changed so that the newcomers, all from northern Europe and all relatively wealthy, do not dilute the influence of the poorer southern members, particularly in decisions on monetary union. Pangalos warned that the European Parliament might also block any enlargement agreement because of balance-of-power concerns. He called for an urgent study so that the Parliament could be enlightened on the issue before its vote on enlargement, which must be held by May. The negotiations are supposed to be wrapped up by Monday midnight so that the successful applicants can join the EU on target on January 1 next year.
