Up to the end of 1993, this major tourist attraction had approved more than 1,000 overseas investment projects, involving a total capital of 3.026 billion U.S. dollars. In 1993 alone contracted overseas investment amounted to 1.17 billion U.S. dollars, equal to the total in the previous ten years, according to official sources. Rich in cultural attractions and located in an advantageous position on the middle of the second Euro-Asia Continental Railway, the city has witnessed a marked improvement in its infrastructure since the mid-1980s, in an effort to boost its tourism industry. The city's first expressway, linking it with Lintong, a major tourism attraction to the east, opened to traffic this year. The upgrading of two other highways is also underway. Also completed in 1993 was the Xian International Airport, which links it with more than 40 domestic and international cities and ranks among the top four airports in China. More flights and routes will be opened soon. The city's telecommunications system also saw a big boost, with the installation of more than 200,000 digital-controlled telephone lines. Direct calls can be made to 800 domestic cities and towns and over 180 countries and regions worldwide. The developed infrastructure facilities and powerful technology development potential (the city's 503 scientific institutions employ 332,000 researchers and technicians) have made the city particularly attractive to overseas investment, as it has been chosen as the site for a national high- and new-technology development zone. The past year has seen three major tendencies emerge in the development of overseas investment in the city, according to the officials. Manufacturing and urban infrastructure construction have become the major targets of foreign investment, in place of housing and small-scale trade. Of the new projects approved in 1993, some 65 percent are in the manufacturing sector, the officials said. With the advent of world business giants on the Xian investment scene, the volume of investment is becoming larger and larger. A Sino-Japanese venture involves an investment of 30 million U.S. dollars and produces 236,000 industrial sewing machines a year. On a visit to Washington D.C. in the U.S. last November, a delegation from Xian signed an economic and technological co- operation agreement with the city which provided that Washington would invest 40 million U.S. dollars to build the "Washington Industrial Park" in the Xian High- and New-Technology Zone.
