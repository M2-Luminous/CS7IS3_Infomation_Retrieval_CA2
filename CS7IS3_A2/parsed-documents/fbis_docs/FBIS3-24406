Some, in the heat of political romanticism, venture to prove that it is the West's sacred duty to help Russia, others see this as useless waste of resources, still others are convinced that this aid gives the West the right to lay claims to part of Russia's sovereignty and demand "obedience" from it. These days the viewpoint of those advocating a reduction of American aid to Russia has unexpectedly been buttressed by the scandal which flared up in Washington over the arrest of the Ames couple who sold information to Russian intelligence. This has given an occasion for many American legislators to demand a freeze on the aid program on the grounds that while the United States has been heaping favors on the ungrateful Russia, the latter has brazenly continued spying against it and, moreover, paying for the traitors' services with that very same American money. The ethical and logical character of such lamentations is a matter for special discussion. Now, however, let me discuss something different. Let us suppose that the USA has really frozen its contributions to our reforms. Who will this hurt -- Russia? Hardly. Highly indicative is the analysis made in early March by The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to sort out how the money allotted by the US administration to Russia is being spent, whom it is spent by and for what purposes. According to the newspaper, when the United States promised to allot for the former USSR 5.8 billion dollars a large part of which was meant for Russia, "there was dancing in the streets from joy at this decision, but not in the streets of Russia. Who mainly celebrated this event? Whole hordes of American consultants who were about to seize a large part of the `pie' of American aid." Business in the field of "useful recommendations" amounts perhaps to one of the most lucrative in present-day Russia and, most importantly, does not carry the slightest element of risk -- first, money is being pumped out of the US government and, second, the worse things are in Russia, the bigger the gain in the long term. It is not for nothing that at the US Agency for International Development (AID), which controls nearly the entire package of aid granted by the USA, as many as 1,200 consultants have submitted applications for participation in this program, which is a record high for the AID in its 33 years of existence. As estimated by The Wall Street Journal, from 50 to 90 percent of the money granted Russia under any specific aid contract lines the pockets of consulting firms. All this is done so brazenly that it cannot deceive anyone, even in the USA. It is this that compelled Marshall Goldman, a well-known expert on Russia, to state recently to the US Congress that the aid granted Russia, at the hands of American consultants and "Beltway bandits," "brings minimal aid to Russians, and perhaps nothing useful comes from this at all." Perhaps it is only at first glance that the passage about "beltway bandits" will seem too harsh, but only at first glance. It is enough to take a look at some figures to understand and forgive the unintellectuality of this thrust. The Sawyer/Miller Co. which organized what the Americans themselves saw as a useless act with TV ads on privatization received seven million dollars for its implementation. Its representative in Moscow, Marc Mellon Brown, demanded from AID a salary of 1,150 dollars daily for his titanic labors, though, it is true, his request was turned down. The point is that AID permits its consultants in Russia to be paid no more than 380 dollars per day which, considering pension benefits and overhead expenses, amounts to 800 dollars per day. And, naturally, from money designated as aid to Russia. How many of our helpers' "problems" are being solved in practice can best of all be observed at Moscow's Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. A Wall Street Journal correspondent described this as follows: "On a recent evening a string quartette was playing in the foyer -- a hall with a marble floor --when a large group of American businessmen, many of whom were aid consultants, were drinking and eating, not limiting themselves in anything. In the immediate proximity of them, on a frosty and dark street, about a hundred elderly men and women were wading through mud trying to sell their possessions -- a bottle of vodka or maybe a pair of shoes -- to passers-by." It will be recalled that the famous Marshall Plan, which changed postwar Europe, deliberately minimized the role of American consultants. According to one of its architects, James Silberman, it was then found more effective and cheaper to bring to America 26,000 European economic managers and public figures who then returned to Europe with the restructuring methods they had received in the USA. As Silberman puts it, in those years indignation was evoked by the notion about American consultants not limiting themselves in expenses, well paid and "swimming in aid."
