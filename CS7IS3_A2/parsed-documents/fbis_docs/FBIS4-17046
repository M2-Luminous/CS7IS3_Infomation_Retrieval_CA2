The organization of Russian citizens in the Estonian capital was established on April 9. Rozhok said the new body is to defend the interests of Russian citizen residents of Tallinn. He added that this was to be done "only within the limits set by legal acts," by bringing, as he said, to the world's notice all violations of the rights of Russian citizens in Estonia. The new body is to address the United Nations and the Russian parliament on the issue in the near future, Rozhok said. He added that there are about 30,000 legal Russian citizens living in Tallinn. The organization in Tallinn will also prepare the documents necessary for its registration with the Estonian authorities. "But I'm more than sure that we will never be registered," Rozhok said. The league is also an in corpore member of the Russian Community of Estonia, another hardline Russian-speakers' organization that has failed so far to gain a formal status with Estonia's authorities. More than 42,000 Estonian residents have taken Russian citizenship by now.
