FR940913-1-00010 FR940913-1-00003 A difference of $1.00 per hundredweight between the support rates for milled whole kernels of long and medium/short grain has been effective since the 1987 crop year. Comments are requested regarding an appropriate difference between price support rates for milled whole kernels of long grain and medium/short grain for the 1995 crop of rice. Discounts for price support rates for lower grades of rice have been established for prior crop years at levels reflecting the lower market value of such rice. Rice price support loan rates are currently subject to discounts that have been effective since 1983. These discounts are $0.30 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade # 3, $0.60 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade # 4, $1.00 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade # 5, and $2.00 per hundredweight for U.S. Grade # 6. Accordingly, comments are requested as to the level of premiums and discounts that would be appropriate for any grade of 1995-crop rice.
