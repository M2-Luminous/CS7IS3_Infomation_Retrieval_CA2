Every day a new pretext emerges, thus retarding the peace talks. There are changes after changes just because the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] makes demands that are difficult to meet. Our correspondent Joao Ligio reports. The mediators continued their separate consultations today in search of details to draw up the third version of specific principles. It is thought that this third version could be part of tomorrow's proceedings. If that happens, it will be one step forward. What was not taken into consideration, however, was the demand by Jonas Savimbi's followers that as long as the government does not say something about recent statements made by deputy Lucio Lara and General Joao de Matos, the peace talks will not move forward. Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general, brushed aside the demand, recalling that it has already been accepted and signed that events outside Lusaka should not disturb the course of the peace talks. To overcome this tense atmosphere, Alioune Blondin Beye had to place the Black Cockerel's men between a rock and a hard place, exhibiting a new document entitled Guiding Document. In this document, the mediators outline all points that the parties must take into consideration. This new form of undertaking involving signatures is aimed at preventing the parties from recanting previous protocols, and it is viewed as a compulsory guideline.
