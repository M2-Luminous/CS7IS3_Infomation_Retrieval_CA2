Alvaro Alsogaray said that the "prospects are good" and expressed confidence that there will be no economic course change. Aldo Rico took a negative stance: "I refuse to be an accomplice in a process whose objective is to perpetuate the power of an entire family: the Menem brothers." Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez also fired his missiles. "The way politics is done in this country leaves a very bitter taste: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk," said the deputy representing the Great Front. The agreement between Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin continued to make waves yesterday. For example, Liberal Alvaro Alsogaray expressed confidence that the pact for the partial reform of the Constitution will not change the course of the government's economic program. "The president's decision is apparently irrevocable," stated Alsogaray, adding that "the prospects are good if the reform is carried out" because "we need to undergo a transformation from a socialist and centrally planned system to a free-market economy with monetary stability." From a different perspective, Aldo Rico, leader of the Dignity and Independence Movement (Modin), gave a different opinion. Rico did not mince words in expressing opposition to the Menem-Alfonsin pact: "As an elected deputy, I refuse to be an accomplice in a process whose sole objective is to perpetuate the power of an entire family: the Menem brothers." Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Great Front stated that the pact leaves "a very bitter taste about how politics is done in this country: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk." Alvarez said that the accord "is a political deal for Menem and Alfonsin, but many people are left out in the cold, for example, those who voted for the opposition thinking they were preventing the reelection of Menem. I think Menem and Alfonsin are cut from the same cloth; they have the same tendencies toward personalism and political hegemonism." But at the center left, there are discordant voices. Santa Fe Deputy Guillermo Estevez Boero, a Popular Socialist, says, "The dialogue between Menem and Alfonsin is positive, because it establishes a methodology that can overcome conflicts and political disagreements." In any case, Estevez Boero warned that his party will not be left out. "The legitimacy of this procedure," he declared, "will depend on going beyond the limited, two-party perspective." In New York, where he is attending a seminar, Peronist Senator Jose Octavio Bordon indicated that the reform agreement "is on the right track for the consensus that I have always called for. We have moved a step forward." Despite the pressure, Bordon opposed the government's plan to amend the Constitution, which has now been tabled in the wake of the Olivas summit. "I am much more in favor," he added, "because I also think that the text will be much more limited, will inspire more confidence, and will better serve Argentines." There were other opinions as well: - Party of Liberation: "We urge the people to reject the Menem-Alfonsin conspiracy, which will pave the way for Menem's reelection, and thus for the continuation of this economic policy." - Movement Toward Socialism: "The Menem-Alfonsin pact, signed behind the workers' backs, is designed to strengthen the institutions of this pro-business regime. They are scheming to continue applying the hunger plan." - Order and Justice Party: "A serious attack on legality has been perpetrated by the two top leaders of the Radical and Peronist parties. The agreement to reform the Constitution is equivalent to a white coup d'etat." - Workers Party: "The pact between Menem and Alfonsin is antidemocratic. Its sole purpose is to boost the reelection of the current privatist clique, in response to the demands of international creditors and big business in this country."
