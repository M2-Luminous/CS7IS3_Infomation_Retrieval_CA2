Australian firemen managed to extinguish the fire before it reached the inside of the building. Only the garage and the consul's car were damaged. Diplomatic sources in Sidney said the consul had refused to sign forged documents which two fugitive suspects in the al-Zuq Church bombing and assassination of engineer Dany Sham'un, Tony 'Ubayd and Jean Shahin tried to obtain. The investigation links the fire to the indictment in connection with the two cases.
