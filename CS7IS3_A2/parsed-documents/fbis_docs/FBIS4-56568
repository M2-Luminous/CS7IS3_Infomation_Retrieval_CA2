FBIS4-56568 "drlat088_a_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 1 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Finance Minister Addresses ANPP Session Finance Minister Addresses ANPP Session FL0505134894 Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish 2033 GMT 1 May 94 FL0505134894 Havana Tele Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Speech by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez to the National Assembly of the People's Government at the Havana Convention Center on 1 May -- recorded] [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro; Comrade Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]; comrade deputies; and guests. When we began the discussions of the problems related to the internal financial imbalance in our country during the last ANPP session in December 1993, we all knew that we were facing one of the most serious economic, political, and social problems the Revolution has ever faced throughout its history. However, our people have grown accustomed to these hardships and have demonstrated, since our fights for liberty, that there are no obstacles or difficulties that cannot be overcome if one acts with resolution, patriotism, and loyalty to principles. Today we have come to this special ANPP session, in recognition of 1 May, supported by a massive discussion -- an example of the people's participation in decision-making, which allows us to count on the collective thinking of the grassroots and on their understanding of the solutions to these red hot problems. Before beginning the debates, allow me to submit some principles, which in our opinion, must precede solutions to the internal financial imbalances. To do this, we will submit the ideas prepared by the Ministry of Finance, and the opinions on which we must meditate and work. These opinions stem from the workers' parliaments and from the opinions gathered from the Cuban Communist Party [PCC] cadres and partisans; and in general, from the opinions [words indistinct] by all our people. First of all, we must stress the fact that the best technical solutions will be feasible only if we can also count on the patriotism and honor of our fellow citizens and on their willingness to do whatever might be necessary to save the Revolution. These solutions also claim that the principles of social justice and solidairty must prevail. In our country, no one will be neglected. No honest worker will see his essential interests overlooked or sacrificed, and no neoliberal adjustment policy will be implemented in Cuba. Moreover, we must realistically assume that the measures we might adopt will demand an undeniable share of sacrifice, which we must face with the wisdom of he who is the defender of the essential things that guarantee our economic stability and the Revolution's survival. The current financial imbalance in the Cuban economy synthesizes an imbalance that for years has been growing in the areas of production and distribution. It is appropriate to recall that this phenomenon is found both in the monetary area, through excess currency; and in the fiscal area, through the deficit in the state budget. The solution to this imbalance is found -- as repeated several times -- essentially and ultimately -- in an increase in supply of goods and services, stemming from an increase in production. However, due to the impossibility of achieving this growth to the extent demanded in a short term, we must reduce the demand; we must quickly revalue the national currency to motivate work; and finally, we must achieve an increase in production and services. The initial basis of a fiscal streamlining policy has already been adopted, with substantial reductions to the 1994 budget deficit, to which I will refer later. We must also take into account the fact that monetary circulation in the country at this moment includes both national currency and freely-convertible currency. Both must be considered when analyzing these problems. In terms of national currency, by the end of March 1994, the excess currency amounted to 11.636 billion pesos. Of this total, 59 percent was deposited in savings accounts with the People's Savings Bank, and 41 percent was circulating among the population. Over the first two or three months of the year, this amount of currency in the hands of the people has been increasing, and if the necessary measures are not adopted to curtail this trend, we will reach a much higher figure by the end of the year. The primary income source of our population shows that, according to the latest available estimates, 44 percent of workers earned basic salaries of up to 148 pesos monthly, while 32 percent earned between 149 and 198 pesos. Moreover, pensions were set between 60 and 99 pesos for 62 percent of all pensioners. In general, also according to the latest available data, families considered low income represented approximately 24 percent of the total number of families throughout the country. This situation calls for income distribution with certain modification levels. Considering the existence of a previous redistribution process and the existence of a certain amount of freely-convertible currency which, since the decriminalization of the dollar last year, has been having an impact on, but not essentially changing, many of these realities. Considering the adoption of measures to streamline the country's monetary-fiscal system in accordance with the analysis we have made at the Finance Ministry, and which we are submitting for consideration by the ANPP today, we believe that the monetary-fiscal process must also be closely related to the reestablishment of other policies, which are being adjusted in the country in the labor and salary areas. In the entrepreneurial area, for the sake of achieving the greatest economic efficiency and production growth possible, we have followed the recommendations of the workers' parliaments where these problems were discussed. Moreover, the streamlining of the monetary-fiscal system demands the adoption of a set of consistent measures, the overall effect of which must be clearly established. Thus, the order, the discipline, and the pace of implementation of the agreed-upon measures will yield gradual effects, which will be perceptible within a period of at least 18 months. The measures adopted therefore demand a great deal of political authenticity and feeling so as to achieve the greatest support possible from all of our population at this moment. Let us now talk about the measures we have been analyzing throughout this discussion process. First of all, the measures adopted to reduce the budget deficit represent an essential element in assessing the country's financial situation. We can therefore state that for the 1994 budget, our government has decided to reduce that fiscal deficit by approximately 1 billion pesos during the current year. According to the estimates that have not yet been concluded, this represents a 24-percent reduction of that deficit. As we also reported during the session held in December, the reduction of subsidies for losses also plays an important role because in the 1994 budget, losses amounted to 1.3 billion pesos. For this reason, we are seeking efficiency and productivity efforts by our entrepreneurial institutions. Also, among the overall financial problems, and in light of the discussions of these issues in December, the amount of accounts receivable and payable in the country were mentioned. At that moment we provided the data for a representative sample of companies and institutions, which were samples of others up to the end of the sessions on 30 September. We were later able to complete the data from the information provided by each central state administration organization and by the local ANPP organizations, reaching the end of last year with accounts receivable totaling 3,898,800,000 pesos, 97 percent of which belong to the entrepreneurial sector. These accounts were divided in the following manner: 41 percent were due in 30 days, a payment period which can be considered normal; 28 percent fell due between 31 and 90 days; while 31 percent fell due after more than 90 days. As a general rule, the accounts to be paid in more than 30 days represented only 12.4 percent of the overall value of sales during the year to date. An analysis made by the majority, not to say all the state companies and the local ANPP organizations, has led to a reduction of these bills during the first quarter of the year by 11.3 percent, which represents the collection of 440 million pesos which were pending as of 31 December last year. Moreover, accounts receivable in freely-convertible currency [words indistinct] have reached a surplus of approximately 209,800,000 pesos. However, of this total, 47.5 percent is the result of operations in currency among national institutions, and only 52.5 percent was the net total to be paid by companies abroad. Moreover, from this total, which can represent a net flow of the country's income, 73.9 percent were in a normal payable situation, and only 26.1 were in an unpayable situation. Thus, after these analyses we can say that it has been confirmed that there is no negligence in charging the debts in freely convertible currency and that the pending debts are part of normal situations in the country's income. Lastly, taking into account the situation of accounts receivable and accounts payable, the problems analyzed for each organization, and with the purpose of preventing current problems and situations in the detected cases from being repeated, a set of measures has been adopted to guarantee an improvement of the situation and to see that such an accumulation of accounts receivable is not repeated in the future. These measures are already in the process of being implemented. Concerning measures to encourage savings, a few minutes ago we said that approximately 59 percent of the excess currency in the country is deposited in savings accounts. Thus, it is essential to consider the measures to be adopted to see that that money remains in the banks. We have considered several alternatives, taking into account our current economic situation and being careful not to imitate formulas that in other cases would yield some results, but which in our particular situation, might not be the most suitable. Thus, we have thought that a set of options could be considered, options which are not always or necessarily related to the increase in interest rates, because with the excess currency in the country, it is not always the case that an increase in interest rates would necessarily increase the motivation for savings. We must look for other alternatives. These other alternatives contemplate the possibility of relating savings accounts to specific ends, as some have mentioned here and in the workers' parliaments themselves, which might imply a freezing of funds for a given time with guarantees given by the bank for the saver, so that these funds can be converted into some type of special savings bonds. In due time we might also consider the possibility of having fixed-term savings accounts in foreign currency. These measures, in addition to others that might be considered, can be a guarantee for freezing most savings accounts deposited in banks. These savings must increase, because it is good for the country to have increased savings. The measures we might adopt must preserve the mechanisms that will encourage savings and the people's savings bank, and we must also see that this amount of money is out of circulation as long as possible. We have also considered the possibility brought up in the workers' parliaments of issuing public-debt bonds. This we can consider within the possibilities which have not been used in our country for many years but which represent a method employed by the state, and a method employed by other countries worldwide, to request a long-term loan from our people, a loan often payable in more than 10 years, perhaps in 15 or 20 years. This loan would help recover with different interest alternatives, or without interest, those bonds. We also considered the possibility of implementing other variables which would appeal to collective subscriptions to these bonds, to a movement of patriotic support for this type of debt emission which, I repeat, could also yield some results which would contribute to long-term freezing of those resources. We must adopt measures that will promote better control of the circulation of freely-convertible currency in the country. This is a new phenomenon which we began implementing last year, and with which we do not have full experience concerning the implications and measures we must definitely adopt to achieve better control. But undoubtedly some of the ideas brought up in the workers' parliaments and other forums, and the ideas brought up by the people themselves, are being considered. An example of this could be, for instance, changing the currency for one that could play that role, a currency that could be called a convertible peso [peso convertible] or foreign exchange peso [peso-divisa] in the country. This is one of the possibilities and it offers a number of benefits because it places that monetary circulation under the direct control and sovereignty of the Cuban state. This is one of the options we must consider. There are other measures intended to strengthen the state's policy to attract the freely-convertible currency through the dollar-collecting stores. It is worth repeating that the established policy seeks to obtain through high prices the highest profit levels possible from those currency holders in order to redistribute them equally among other needs the country has. We must work toward that purpose and we must also gain the understanding of the spirit of this policy because those high prices must lead us to understand the reason for implementing them. There are other measures which imply the need to strengthen the circulation of the peso, and which in some way contribute toward compensating for the imbalance created when a freely-convertible currency is implemented in the country. Thus, the gradual increase in supply of national goods and services obtainable in pesos by selected sectors through the stores which exist, for example, in our Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC], the stores created for specific sectors, makes it possible, that with the pesos charged by the workers to those sectors, a related market is created to give an answer to the Cuban peso with a supply which is more or less limited at this moment but which can be expanded. This is a measure that will contribute toward gradually balancing the purchasing power of the peso. Together with this, we must also implement, or study the implementation of measures that will provide incentives to the workers to increase the supply of goods and services available in the national currency in accordance with the country's needs. Some decisions have been made recently, such as in the case of the workers involved in the generation of electricity, to implement a program of this nature. To the extent possible, this could imply that, when we have more production, we can increase the free sale of certain products at prices which are in line with the current situation we have to face due to the financial imbalance prevailing in the country. The possibility of analyses or inventories which are still outdated, or some reservations in this distribution channel, have not been ruled out. Among the services that could be supplied we can mention, for instance, the sale of personal, property, and civil responsibility insurance which has not been implemented in the country to this date. This is a type of mechanism we must consider and we must assess as a supplementary mechanism which helps protect the people from risk, without directly undermining the state's budget. There are other types of measures, such as the advanced payment, with a certain level of discount, of the people's debt to the People's Savings Bank, debts stemming from personal credits or from credits granted for housing. We have made an analysis, for instance, that a reasonable discount rate for immediate or short-term payments could be granted, according to different combinations, and that this could yield between 350 and 500 million pesos. This idea, if implemented, will surely increase the country's potential. We must also consider measures for a selective increase in prices and rates. Comrade Ross has submitted several proposals collected from different opinions conveyed in the workers' parliaments, and we have been analyzing a set of those opinions which because of their economic importance, or because of the consensus level, are obviously measures that must be taken into consideration. Thus, we have discussed the possible implications of the elimination of product subsidies, replacing them with subsidies to low-income people. This is a measure within our capability and which, if implemented, in a short term could yield some 200 million pesos yearly. The increase in prices of nonessential products: many things have been said about different combinations, but undoubtedly there is a major level of consensus concerning the adoption of a set of measures among which we can mention the possibility of increasing cigarette prices. On discussing these matters on different occasions we have talked about this measure and that it implies some organizational rules. This implies a certain level of control of inventories in order to face a demand which has not been satisfactory for a relatively lengthy period of several months -- since last year -- and how to reach an organization of this measure so that this increase in prices will not become an additional channel leading to the underground economy and to the black market. In our analysis we have realized that prices can be increased without necessarily eliminating the different distribution categories that now exist. That is, it seems advisable to consider the possibility of maintaining the distribution categories and to increase prices which, among other alternatives, could be established in this manner: for instance, we are considering the idea of increasing the price of a cigarette pack to two pesos in a regular distribution category, and to six pesos in the extra-quota category, and to 10 pesos in the unregulated category. This, comrades, would probably yield an additional income, maintaining an organized distribution and a minimum inventory, of 1.954 million additional pesos yearly, if all those cigarettes are sold. That is, with or without these prices, these measures can yield an amount that is not inconsequential. But undoubtedly this is one of the most important measures concerning price increases, and cigarettes are not an essential article vital for the existence of man. Prices of alcoholic beverages have also been considered, taking into account the same characteristics we mentioned previously in the case of cigarettes, and the production costs that must be considered before putting anything into effect. And considering the different categories, of rum and other alcoholic beverages, starting from prices in those three scales, for instance of 30 and 40... [changes thought] excuse me, from 40, 30, and 20 [not further specified] for 750 ml bottles. In this scale, this increase in prices would provide an additional income of 328 million pesos yearly. This is another important element we must take into consideration within our analysis. We have also analyzed the possibility -- and all these figures stem from an analysis of the production behavior this year -- of implementing this measure, not from the point of view of potential production, but of production that can be achieved. In the case of beer, for instance, and we cannot guarantee that it will be achieved, but if the minimum production of beer can be achieved every year, only by doubling the average price of the bottle of beer in the different categories, from retail to wholesale distribution, this could yield $135 million pesos yearly. This is a very small amount, I repeat, but still it yields some resources that cannot be rejected. We also discussed a vehicular fuel price increase as one of the possible measures to be adopted, and according to different combinations of the premium gasoline, the regular gasoline, and diesel, taking into account what appears to be this year's true distribution -- which is less than last year, as you well know -- it could also yield, according to different combinations which in some cases would demand doubling or tripling the price per liter, some $80 million more, notwithstanding the reduced deliveries we are facing. Concerning utility rates, and Comrade Ross already mentioned this, one of the services which has obtained the highest level of understanding has been the increase in electricity rates in residential areas. Recently, in a television program, our comrade [Basic Industry Minister] Marcos Portal explained that increasing the electricity rates at this moment is practically indispensable, not only to increase the country's income but to foster savings in electricity consumption. In the analysis we have jointly made with our comrades from the Basic Industry Ministry in an effort to protect the low-level consumers, that is, those who consume up to 100 kilowatts monthly, we have decided to maintain one of the variables: not to change the price of nine centavos per kilowatt, but increasing it in the other two levels: that is, from 100 to 300 kilowatts, and those above 300 kilowatts of consumption. These consumers will be charged higher rates, at least 20 centavos per kilowatt, and 40 centavos per kilowatt. This, in addition to exerting better control and a motivation to reduce consumption, could yield approximately 112 million pesos more yearly. We have also considered the possibility of increasing nonurban transport tariffs, taking into account different alternatives and different proposals submitted by our comrades from the Transport Ministry, considering the increase in costs: fuel, et cetera. This, not to fall into excessive details, and if implemented in a short term, could also provide an additional income of approximately 100 million pesos. Telephone rates were also mentioned in relation to the improvement of services. In this case we have been considering some alternatives to increase the telephone rates, not too much, but sufficiently only to cover costs and to reduce losses. This would yield the small amount of approximately 11 million [pesos]. Other types of services to the people were also considered, namely the price of the workers' cafeterias. After thoroughly analyzing the proposals submitted by the workers' parliaments, we thought that this must be a decentralized decision. That is, a central organization cannot say that prices will be increased. However, if we manage to achieve -- and this is the calculation we have made -- that if the workers' cafeterias manage to cover their costs, or whatever the mechanism, in whatever period, and with the discussions in each workplace, the country would save and also collect an additional 100 million pesos yearly. This is the cost the government has to pay in terms of subsidies for charging prices lower than the costs. In some cafeterias this is not the situation, but in most of them food is sold at current prices. We have also studied other services for the population, including something we have seen recently, something proposed by the Communications Ministry and which has been very little mentioned in our discussions: the postal services. The country has for many years maintained the same rates, rates which have been unmovable for many years, but the country has to cover a loss of approximately 15 million every year in order to maintain those services without counting the expenditures in hard currency, because the international mail also affects us. However, following a proposal we are studying with our comrades from the Communications Ministry, -- and this is a reasonable proposal -- we have realized that our rates are below the rate which is charged abroad throughout the world, and even though we are charging a lower rate, we will probably collect some 30 million additional pesos with a little increase in postal rates. I am mentioning this case becase the service is so broad and today we could not discuss in detail all the points assessed, but we have found this proposal very interesting. We have also considered the possibility of charging for those services that used to be free. It has been explained since the previous ANPP session how these measures can have a double objective. They can be adopted to increase income, and they can also be of educational nature. We have made a thorough evaluation of the range of services which are free of charge and which could be considered in this case. We have also discussed matters with which we could agree, and matters with which we could not agree, at least in our opinion, but our intention has always been to evaluate almost everything proposed and which can be evaluated, because there are some matters that are impossible to evaluate. However, we have considered some of these measures perhaps because of their economic importance or perhaps because they are feasible, namely those which could yield something additional. For instance, in the educational area we have taken into consideration those points which have been consistently mentioned in the workers' parliaments, such as charging for lunch served in boarding schools, at least a minimum rate, which in this case has been set at 35 centavos. This, according to the number of fees and the days of the week when the students eat in the schools, could yield approximately 29 million pesos yearly. As you see, this is not a very high figure, but this is one of the areas in the area of education which it was believed could yield the largest amount of pesos, and it is one of the points we can consider. We have also discussed the reduction of allowances granted to university students, although 20 percent of the population, which is the percentage of the population with the lowest income, would not be included in this reduction. That is, this measure would be implemented among those people not considered of lower income. Concerning the reduction of allowances granted to university students, excluding the foreign grantees who would not be affected, obviously, would yield some 17 million [pesos] should this decision be adopted. School supplies distributed among students have also been the object of discussions in the workers parliaments. For the level of school supplies distributed at this moment we could obtain approximately 4.7 million pesos yearly by charging very low prices which would be accessible to the people. Many proposals were submitted in the health area, and after analyzing them, we thought that not all of them were in line with the policy outlined by our revolution, concerning public health. But there was one which circulated with some force and some argument, concerning the free distribution of neovitamins. And how much could be collected if the people were asked for only the cost of that medicine? Well, this and other medicines which could be added would yield 103 million pesos yearly. There are other proposals which we did not consider appropriate, such as charging something for ambulance services or other services which, although they do have a cost, we believe that, from our point of view, cannot be considered. We also considered the possibility of charging fees for cultural and sports activities. One of the proposals which have received major support, according to the reports by the workers parliaments, is charging for a ticket for sports events. However, if we consider charging a reasonable entrance fee, it would yield approximately 4.5 million pesos yearly, but there are many who oppose this idea. There are also measures related to culture. Charging entrance fees for artistic shows would yield some 4.8 million pesos, but excluding again the lowest income people, who make up some 20 percent of the population. Thus, the reduction of subsidies, which is currently paid to some institutions, centers, and provincial councils for culture, could also yield some 11 million pesos. The other element also discussed in the previous assembly, referring to classes in preparation for sports events, was activities that can be organized during vacation periods to offer a recreational activity that might contemplate the practice of some sports, thus charging a modest fee during the school recess periods, during the school vacation periods. This would also yield some 15 million pesos yearly. This means that in the field of free services there is a broad range of subjects to be discussed. We could spend hours here talking about this matter. We have only mentioned those which we think have greater possibilities of being approved and which could yield some relatively large amount of resources. But as you will see, these cannot be compared to other categories of measures we have to evaluate. Measures for a gradual implementation of a tax system on a sector of the population: this is one of the most controversial measures, as it was explained here. The workers have expressed a clear position in the workers parliaments against the imposition of a tax on wages. We must remember, however, comrades, that income tax in our country not only affects the salary earners. We also have a tax on self-employed workers. The state is expected to collect this year 126 million pesos from this tax. Yesterday, during a meeting with the presidents of the provincial and administrative councils, we considered the implementation of this measure and the system of payment, and especially the manner of increasing the minimum tax installment. By December only nine municipalities in the country were implementing this measure, but today we can report that 76 municipalities in 11 provinces have already increased those installments. In some cases, as in Holguin Province, these installments have gone up to 1,000 pesos monthly for certain types of employment. There are other tax installments amounting to 600 pesos and to 200 pesos. By the closing of the March report, Holguin was the only province that could talk about a per capita income resulting from the increased tax installments which are already being paid, and for this reason its income is higher. Holguin thus has one of the highest tax rates in the country. This would be a type of tax which we must preserve and which we must increase as a regulating and an income element. These two elements must be maintained until we can get to the progressive tax on income. We are already preparing a proposal to be submitted to the government so that when the conditions are appropriate, it can be implemented. I must also inform you that other rates and tariffs are being implemented, and not only the tax to be paid for the right to be self-employed, but we are also charging a tax for the right to use space and means. The marketing right is also being taxed in 77 municipalities throughout the country, which means that the self- employed worker carries out his activity outside the province where he was originally registered. These taxes are already in effect. This means that we are beginning to implement a policy of tax on these workers' income. Today there are more than 153,000 self- employed workers in the country, and it is appropriate to impose a tax policy on their income. And as you can see, this tax is not paid only on salaries but also on income. We have been studying the possibility of reviewing the tax on the income of peasants and cooperative members. We must study and evaluate this because the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative] is paying 5 percent over its net income while the peasants pay another 5 percent individually. However, we must still consolidate these taxes in accordance with the tax that the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] must pay. We are still studying these taxes. We have also considered the possibility of charging a tax on foreign currency income. There are some people in the country who earn an income in foreign currency, not through salaries but through other payments. I want to explain that we are not thinking in this case of remittances, but of those people who, after being authorized, receive these payments for exercising certain activities compensated in hard currency, or which receive a bonus or an extra payment in foreign currency. This is another option we will probably analyze. There is another thing brought up in the assemblies, such as the tax on properties which we have analyzed, that is, the tax on home ownership. Today most homes are owned, and this can also be considered in due time, concerning what kind of tax can be charged on home ownerships, and not only on homes but also on empty lots, and on a number of properties existing in the country, such as real estate. The workers' possible contribution toward social security has also been analyzed. This possibility has been discussed taking into account the deficit existing between the contributions to social security and what the country spends on social security, a deficit which amounts to some 500 million [pesos]. We have been studying several options, different categories, and the different times when this could be implemented. This is one more of the measures we have in our arsenal to be considered. And there are other types of taxes we must not forget, such as the tax on ground transportation, and according to results of the analysis, this could yield approximately 10 million pesos annually. Allow me to tell you also that this year there was better discipline concerning the payment of the tax on ground transporation. The people seem to have acquired some tax knowledge to such a point that we ran out of tax forms [laughs]. There is a reaction to the payment of this tax. And we also have the tax on documents and the seal on stamps, and these together will yield 23 million pesos. And we also have other types of taxes the state would like to implement. One of them could be the tax on aqueduct service, better known as the water bill. As you know, the country today has only one way of collecting these bills, and this is done through water meters, although this service is not extended throughout the country and we cannot think about this possibility today. We could consider a fixed rate for aqueduct service, and if only one peso were charged per person monthly, it would yield some 90 million pesos yearly, and thus we would be covering an important service which at this moment is receiving a minimal income by way of the water meters. Fines for personal delinquency also increased this year. Violations of Decree 186 on special delinquency of self-employed workers have increased in several provinces. This income could amount to some 17 million pesos this year. Last year the fines dropped by a little more than 4 percent. During the first quarter ending this month fines increased a little more than 9 percent. This means that there is still much to be done in this area, but we are working on it. We have also considered the possbility of changing our money. We must put this measure within the arsenal of possibilities. As Comrade Ross said, there are many ways of doing it, there are many variables, and I can tell you that the variables that prove to be suitable might be implemented. This is not a problem we cannot solve, but we do have the obligation to take up this measure as a possibility. So, comrades, we have tried to analyze all these problems with the sole objective of providing to our government and to you in this parliament, some facts which, once the causes of these problems and the possible solutions are known, will help us work toward the achievement of those solutions. But we do have to adopt the measures that will definitely guarantee an effective solution to the excess currency in the country. To achieve this we must understand that we must willing to do anything possible because this is the essential obstacle we are internally facing today in making our economy successful. These measures would not be complete if we did not also demand, considering the sacrifice our workers are making, the repression of those who have accrued wealth illegally either through theft or speculation, taking unscrupulous advantage of the scarcity our people face to achieve their personal wealth. These deeds cannot and must not remain unpunished. The process which will be implemented through the agreements adopted by this National Assembly will play a role which will be decisive in itself in accordance with the order and discipline which we might impose, without hastiness but with a sense of responsibility we must all share. The measures to be adopted by the government to implement these measures will also be decisive, keeping in mind that this will be a gradual process that will demand indispensable adjustments or changes to the extent that we keep advancing. Starting from these discussions, we are certain that the vital interests of the people will be respected. We feel optimistic therefore, and in good spirits. We know that if we have resisted thus far, we will will not lack strength and intelligence to keep taking steps forward. We believe that our people will have the great privilege to celebrate this 1 May as protagonists aware of their own solutions to the serious problems we are facing, certain of the victory with Fidel as leader as it has always been and as it will always be, because all Cubans will fight with him for this goal. Thank you very much. [applause]
