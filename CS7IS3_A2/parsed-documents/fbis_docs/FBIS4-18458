It was the first indication that, despite all the polling evidence, the Tories were set to capture their fourth general election in a row. The voters of Essex had spoken. Yesterday John Major returned to speak to them. Visiting Basildon and Harlow, the citadels of Essex man and woman, the Prime Minister was clearly hoping to trade on his personal rapport with the electorate, the soapbox strategy that many believe won his party the last election against all the odds. What better way, his advisers must have told him, to show up the few remaining advantages he still possesses over his chief rivals, Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine? Whatever can be said of them, neither has been miserably unemployed. Neither can understand from personal experience what many people have gone through, particularly in the South of England, during this last recession. The difficulty for Mr Major is that no amount of charm, friendliness or empathy can make up for the patent inadequacies of his record and that of his Government since that surprise general election victory. He arrived in Essex on the day that taxes on both incomes and spending were due to rise, brought in by a party that not only promised to cut taxes at the last election but scared voters away from voting Labour by predicting the very tax "bombshell" that is now about to be dropped. And those tax rises are necessary because the Conservatives, possibly in the belief that they were likely to lose the election, spent taxpayers' money in 1991-92 as if there was no tomorrow. The tomorrow has become today, and taxpayers are being asked to pay off the Government's debts. They are also paying for the Governments economic incompetence in prolonging the recession unnecessarily by clinging to membership of the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. Will the voters of Essex forgive him? He should not take their loyalty for granted. The Conservatives have won four elections in a row mainly thanks to people like them. They voted Labour until 1979, but switched when they saw that the Tories under Margaret Thatcher seemed to have their interests at heart. They bought council houses, started new businesses, profited from tax cuts and generally prospered in the 1980s. Now many of them have had houses repossessed, seen their businesses go bankrupt, are paying higher taxes and remember prosperity as but a distant dream. They are not tribal Tories; if Labour seems to be offering them a better deal at the next general election, there are no historical or familial ties to deter them from switching. Hardline Essex voters, and others like them, thought at the last party conference that their concerns were at last being addressed. For years they had made their populist points at the rostrum while the platform listened politely but ignored their pleas. Last October they seemed to have spurred a desperate Cabinet into action. Law and order was to be toughened, basics were back on the political agenda and the march of European federalism was to be stopped. What do they now see? There is a Home Secretary stumbling from one pitfall to another on his Criminal Justice Bill; a back-to-basics programme that has destroyed the careers of too many ministers and now lies in tatters; and a Prime Minister who promises to stand up to his European partners one week but backs down the next. Mr Major's courage in visiting Essex cannot be faulted. But, true to form, he chose a battleground on which he never had a chance of winning.
