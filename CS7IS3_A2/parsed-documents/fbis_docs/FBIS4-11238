General Alfredo Rodriguez, the counterterrorist front commander of the zone, disclosed that the latest clash between terrorists and two Army units took place near the town of San Isidro. Sources have stated that soldiers clashed with the SL "Red Sea" column, which retreated to what the military call "Spring Valley." After the terrorists withdrew, Army troops occupied a SL base and are pursuing "Red Sea" fugitives who, according to military sources, are headed by two SL leaders known as "Rayo" and "Pescadito." The military forces involve 380 men, of which 200 are combat troops and 180 support troops. They are closing in on the terrorists' retreat. Gen. Rodriguez explained that the Peruvian troops are using a "pincer" move against the terrorists. He added that during 17 days of clashes, 14 terrorists have been killed and another 15 have been captured. The military commander explained that these operations, on the banks of the Huallaga River in Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department in the Northern jungle, have not affected civilians living in the combat zones. Gen. Rodriguez said the Army has seized from the SL members 220 hand grenades, grenade-launcher rifles, 14 FAL rifles, bombs, shotguns, percussion caps, and a great quantity of ammunition. The terrorist columns are believed to comprise about 250 men. Military sources have stated that during the past few days hundreds of children, women, and elderly people who were forced to support the SL in the Peruvian Northern jungle, have surrendered to the Army. The source did not disclose the number, site, nor exact date when these people surrendered. These people "were slaves" of the SL and were divided into "grass-roots forces" and "peoples' committees." The SL seems to have used the same system as in the central region, where they enslaved thousands of indigenous Ashaninkas who are now being gradually rescued. In the next few hours members of the Congressional Human Rights Commission and Attorney General Blanca Nelida Colan, will travel to the site of operations to try to verify reports on alleged attacks against civilians by helicopter gunships. The National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has witness reports of helicopter-fired rocket attacks against towns along the Huallaga River and a video in which bodies of the alleged victims are shown. Legal Defense Institute Director Ernesto de la Jara has said that some 40 to 50 civilians died in these attacks and the National Coordinating Board of Human Rights has requested the intervention of the Red Cross, which has not been allowed to visit the zone. Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, travelled to Tingo Maria with 30 journalists. Today they will be taken to the combat zone. Gen. Hermoza said the SL is dismantled, the Army is obstructing its retreat, and the military chiefs are urging the terrorists to surrender.
