L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed funding preferences stated below. Purpose The SDS program is a program of grants to health professions and nursing schools for the purpose of assisting such schools in providing scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged background who are enrolled (or accepted for enrollment) as full-time students in the schools, as well as to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing a career in health professions. For purposes of the SDS program in FY 1994, an ``individual from disadvantaged backgrounds'' is defined in 42 CFR part 57.1804, subpart S, as one who: (1) Comes from an environment that has inhibited the individual from obtaining the knowledge, skill, and abilities required to enroll in and graduate from a health professions school, or from a program providing education or training in allied health professions; or (2) Comes from a family with an annual income below a level based low-income thresholds according to family size published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer Price Index, and adjusted by the Secretary for use in all health professions and nursing programs. The Secretary will periodically publish these low-income levels in the Federal Register . The following income figures determine what constitutes a low-income family for purposes of the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students program for FY 1994.
