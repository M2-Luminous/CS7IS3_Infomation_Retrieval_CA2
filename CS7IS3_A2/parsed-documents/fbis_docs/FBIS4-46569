Yu.M. Perunov has been Scientific Production Association (NPO) Chief Designer since 1987. The NPO develops and produces electronic warfare (EW) weapons. "Gradiyent" VNII [All-Union Scientific Research Institute] (Rostov), where Yuriy Mitrofanovich was the director until 1987, is part of this association. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Yuriy Mitrofanovich, does the NPO imeni P.S. Pleshakov exist right now and, if it does, in what form? [Perunov] Under new conditions, the NPO is being transformed into an associative type association with those same missions and in that same composition that it was, with the exception of the enterprises that are on the territory of the countries of the former USSR. There is approval for entry into the association of enterprises of the former Minelektronprom [Ministry of the Electronics Industry], specifically, "Almaz" NPO (Saratov). This will permit us to more effectively and purposefully accomplish the missions of developing the latest models of equipment and their modernization. The Future Planning, Prediction, Development and Foreign Economic Activities Center has been organized under the Chief Designer to ensure coordination of the work and to improve interrelations with our customers, including foreign customers. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do matters stand with orders in the NPO? [Perunov] The policy of wholesale conversion did not bypass the association, just like the entire defense industry, and therefore practically all customers do not have the required resources for their financing when a packet of orders is available. If the work that we previously accomplished is somehow still being supported with financing, then new work, especially scientific-research work, is practically not being paid for. There is one more distinctive feature in the financing of our work. EW systems are normally installed on certain land-based, airborne and maritime-based platforms. In the majority of cases, the cessation of financing of our work has been associated with the fact that the development of the platform is being terminated. The enterprise certainly has a broad sphere of work in relation to the modernization of previously developed and series-produced systems. However, the shortfall in financing is also holding back this direction. In 1992, the NPO's enterprises on average were supplied with approximately 50% of the financing required and this figure totaled from 20-80% for individual enterprises. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Will your enterprises manage to retain cadres? How will wages be paid at those enterprises that are being poorly financed? [Perunov] The situation is taking shape as follows. We are partially supplementing the shortage of resources for state orders using budget resources that are being allotted for conversion, furthermore, we are manufacturing household appliances. However, the resources received are clearly inadequate which has naturally resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of workers. Unfortunately, as a rule, the best cadres are leaving. In order to ensure the required wage level, we are attempting to find that customer or those orders that would give us the capability to employ so-called dual use technologies for civilian production. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What work is being conducted at your association in the context of conversion? [Perunov] The NPO has repeatedly proposed conversion programs. The appropriate plans, tasks, and executors exist. However, the state is allotting very limited resources for conversion which is impacting the effectiveness of putting these plans into effect. Commercial structures and banks practically do not resort to long-term investment programs or place unacceptable terms on credit. If we talk about the content of the conversion plans, then they are --medical equipment, security systems, satellite television antenna and reception systems, a device for employing microwave energy in various productions of the food and processing industries, a device to monitor the ecology of the environment and to monitor cargoes on rail and motor vehicle transportation, and many others. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Are you only developing conversion products or are you involved in their series production? [Perunov] We are primarily conducting development and we are producing small lots. Of course, there is series production. This is primarily tape recorders, washing machines, telephones, and microwave ovens. However, in the process, we are encountering enormous difficulties in obtaining components. The prices for them are continuously increasing which leads to the need to increase prices for the end product and, consequently, creates difficulties with sales. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What kind of contacts do you have with foreign countries and firms? [Perunov] For the time being, our contacts have been largely limited to negotiations and to protocols on intentions. However, foreign firms are displaying a great deal of interest in some of our developments. We are conducting negotiations with the countries of the Middle East, China, with representatives of South America, and also with European states. Our enterprises have also attracted the attention of certain foreign firms. They are prepared to invest their resources but the unstable situation in Russia, the absence of guarantees by state structures, and also the bureaucracy in the countries of these firms, COCOM, and certainly the policy directed toward the collapse of our scientific and military potential is stopping them. This often makes our negotiations futile. They are not ending with the conclusion of contracts or joint cooperation. For now, cooperation with China and the Middle East countries appears to be realistic. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What has changed with the formation of the Defense Sectors Committee? [Perunov] Very little has changed. The Committee is practically disenfranchised. However, the situation has still improved in comparison with the time when the Ministry of Industry existed. Elements of coordination have appeared in the modified structure and the board of The Committee for the Realization of Sector Programs and Conversion is rendering substantial assistance. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess the level of weapons developed at the NPO in contrast to the West? [Perunov] The EW equipment that the NPO has developed and has in series production is no worse than foreign models and some of the developments are better or do not have equivalents in the world. We are resolving the issues of systems engineering and integration at a level that is higher than the world average. However, there is a certain lagging behind in circuitry. Under today's conditions, the high degree of automation and information processing of military equipment determines EW's primary role as a deterrent factor, both during the conduct of combat operations and also in peacetime. EW equipment is also being utilized as performance monitoring and recording devices. Russian First Deputy Minister of Defense A.A. Kokoshin has assigned the issues of developing EW among the priorities, however, our NPO still has barely felt the practical steps of this decision. Only work to equip platforms that are being produced and developed is being financed and not completely. Work for the future and research work is practically not being financed. If the situation doesn't change, we will lose our cadres, our reserves, and our ideas. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] The Persian Gulf War demonstrated the significance of electronic weapons in combat operations. Have the results of this war been reflected in the NPO's activities? [Perunov] We foresaw many of the results of this war. We knew that the Multinational Forces were saturated with electronic weapons and we also knew that Iraq practically did not have these weapons. If Iraq had had adequate EW systems, say, like those that the Russian Armed Forces have, then it is hard to predict how soon and with what results that war would have ended. It turned out that the Multinational Forces suppressed Iraq's electronic systems and the allies' numerous electronic systems functioned without jamming. Today aircraft, ships, ground-based equipment and other military targets that are not protected by EW systems are being transformed into accessible and easily destroyed targets. Modern military conflicts -- are first of all an information war. Weapons of destruction swing into action only after disruption of troop command and control and elimination of the enemy's information about itself. The Syrian-Israeli and British-Argentine conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and combat operations in the Persian Gulf zone confirm that axiom. Unfortunately, despite this situation, the NPO is not receiving a sufficient number of orders to develop EW systems. They tell us that there are other more important concerns. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Do we supply EW systems to other countries? [Perunov] I don't know about such cases. Moreover, the Americans also practically do not supply EW weapons to other countries. All of the world's leading countries develop these kinds of weapons for themselves, although some sort of coordination exists in Western Europe. I need to say that the West imparts a great deal of significance to EW weapons and the issues that are associated with these weapons are among the most restricted. Right now negotiations are being conducted on the sale of domestically-produced EW weapons along with platforms and also on the installations of systems produced in our country on foreign platforms and the sale of individual EW systems components. However, the rates at which these negotiations are being conducted is defining the actually quite long time periods for their execution.
