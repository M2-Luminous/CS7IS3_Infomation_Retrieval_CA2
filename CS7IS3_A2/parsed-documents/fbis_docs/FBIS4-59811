FBIS4-59811 "drnes096_o_94006" FBIS-NES-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Syria Daily Rejects Israeli Presence in Golan Daily Rejects Israeli Presence in Golan JN1805081394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 18 May 94 JN1805081394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] AL-THAWRAH writes about the visit to Syria by the chief of U.S. diplomacy, noting the U.S. secretary's impressions of the visit, particularly Syria's commitment to the peace process and its honest concern to give it the required momentum to reach the desired and definite objective. AL-THAWRAH says the Syrian trend and endeavor toward reaching a solution and settlement have always been governed by firm principles. The paper adds: The red lines, which nobody can bypass, remained the essence over which there is no bargaining. These red lines -- which are based on the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and which underscore the full implementation of these resolutions on all fronts to guarantee the restoration of all Arab rights -- have always been the point of reference and the basis for a just and honorable solution and have always been appreciated by the world. AL-THAWRAH notes a matter realized by everybody, namely, following the signing of the Oslo and Cairo self-rule agreements with the PLO, Israel has escalated its aggressiveness and terrorism inside and outside the occupied territory. Furthermore, Israel did not hesitate to bring into its military arsenals sophisticated and internationally banned offensive weapons. This has exposed Israel's intentions toward peace and revealed the intentions of its rulers toward making gains at the expense of Arab rights. AL-THAWRAH adds: Syria, which accepted peace as a strategic option, cannot accept any Israeli presence on any inch of the Golan. Syria also adheres to a comprehensive solution on all tracks, insists on the principle of a comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territory in exchange for a complete peace, and categorically rejects partial solutions. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH stresses the need for undoing the difficult Israeli knot, straightening and rectifying the course of the Tel Aviv rulers, and binding them to the Madrid point of reference and to implementing international legitimacy's resolutions. This is the task of the international community inasmuch as it is the task and responsibility of the U.S. sponsor for the sake of peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN says the sought peace should be based on international legitimacy's resolutions, adding that since the beginning of the peace process Syria has reiterated its commitment to a just and comprehensive peace. TISHRIN notes that Syria is very much concerned about peace and that it will spare no efforts to activate the peace process and to help it achieve its objectives. TISHRIN adds that the whole world is a witness to Syria's credibility, its sound course toward the peace process, and its full commitment to the requirements of this process. The paper adds that since the beginning Syria has been aware of the fact the path of peace does not pass at all through partial solutions, phased settlements, or individual deals. Syria believes that peace can only be achieved through ending the entire occupation and ushering the region into an age of stability and security. TISHRIN stresses that the occupation, over all the years of Arab-Israeli conflict, has been the source of chaos and tension and the cause of wars, tragedies, and cycles of violence. Syria, which supports a just and comprehensive peace and adheres to ending the occupation, bases its stand on the resolutions of international legitimacy which provide for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories and the inadmissibility of Israeli forces' occupation of these territories. Syria's objective is to reach the peace that guarantees restoration of Arab lands and full rights. Concluding, TISHRIN says: For this, Syria responded to all international political efforts, particularly the American efforts. It always welcomed the role of the U.S. sponsor as a full partner and fair broker in the peace process who works to implement the U.S. initiative based on the return of land in exchange for peace. Through this agreement, Syria opened the road of peace, worked to achieve it on just bases, and reiterated its continuous readiness to give a momentum to the peace process. Syria hopes U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour will produce positive results to salvage the peace process.
