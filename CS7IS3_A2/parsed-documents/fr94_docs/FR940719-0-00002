FR940719-0-00002 FR940719-0-00001 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 171 RIN 3150&hyph;AE99 Establishment of Revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 Annual Fee Surcharges AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: On July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') published a final rule as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision dated March 16, 1993. The final rule changed the method of allocating low-level waste costs for FY 1993 in response to the court's decision. In its FY 1993 final rule, the NRC indicated that it was adopting the FY 1993 approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992 and would separately publish a final rule revising the FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges. This final rule establishes those revised surcharges for NRC licensees for FY 1991 and FY 1992. The NRC will make refunds to certain materials licensees based on the amounts of the revised surcharges. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C.

Background On March 16, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided Allied-Signal, Inc., v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States of America, 988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The court questioned the NRC's decision to allocate generic costs associated with low-level waste (LLW) disposal by classes of licensees, rather than by individual licensee. The Court remanded only the FY 1991 rule; however, the FY 1992 rule raised identical questions and a challenge to that rule was subsequently remanded by the court. In response to the Court's opinion, the NRC, in its final fee rule for FY 1993 published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669), changed its method of allocating LLW costs to NRC licensees after providing for notice and comment on four alternative methods of LLW cost allocation and possible variations of those alternatives. Based on the comments received, the NRC, for FY 1993, created two groups_large waste generators and small waste generators. Licensees within each group are charged a uniform flat fee. In its final FY 1993 rule, the NRC also adopted this approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992, indicating that it would publish separately final revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharge schedules resulting from changes in the allocations of NRC LLW budgeted generic costs. This rulemaking notice completes agency action on the proposed rule issued for public comment on April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21662) and implements the ministerial calculations called for in the July 20, 1993 final rule. The agency workpapers that support these final changes to 10 CFR part 171 for FY 1991 and FY 1992 are available in the Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, in the lower level of the Gelman Building. II. Final Action_Revised FY 1991 and 1992 Fee Surcharges This final rule establishes the revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges for NRC licensees based on the allocation method of low-level waste costs described and used in the FY 1993 final rule.
