In mid-May, the automatic field operations command system developed by this college was officially put into use in teaching. This reporter saw a gratifying scene in the college's basic staff training course classroom: More than 70 students had finished drawing up operational plans and plotting tactical charts with the application of computers, and their dream of creating a device with reading, memorizing, calculating, writing, drawing, and transmitting capacities had come true. For many years the above six commanding capacities have been manually operated in a traditional pattern and have been "bottlenecks" affecting and restricting enhancement of command functions due to low speed and efficiency. For this reason, the Army Staff Officers College enlisted forces to tackle the key problems and, after several years of hard work, succeeded in developing this system, thus enabling the army to achieve the objective of automatically handling the operational work of staff officers. Ma Kaicheng, an associate professor who is the principal person in charge of this project, briefed this reporter, saying: In using this system for "reading," instead of applying such instruments as maps, magnetic needles, rulers, and so on, we only have to strike the keys on the keyboard. The computer will analyze various topographic elements. It will then display on the screen the general configuration of the surface of the battlefield in three dimensions with various angles and altitudes, automatically showing on the map the measurement and judgment of distance and area. In addition, in light of the tactical background, the computer will produce specific charts for parachute landing and traversing the area. The data base of the system has a storing capacity of several hundred thousand characters and over 100,000 items of classified data, which are accurate and reliable and can be consulted at any moment. In this way, it has changed the traditional function of "memory." As to "calculation," the system can work out, among other things, troop maneuvers, operational commands, and combat capacity. Besides, in light of the strength, weaponry, quantity, and quality of both our and enemy forces, it can also give overall consideration to various factors including environment, operations, combat actions, and so on to foresee victory, defeat, advance, retreat, and exhaustion in a campaign, so that decisions of the commanders will be more scientific. In terms of "writing," by conducting dialogue between computer and operator, the system can automatically draw up various operation orders, instructions, and plans, and, the moment a commander makes up his mind, draft a combat order. For "transmission," the system can automatically encipher and instantly transmit messages with text as excellent as the accompanying pictures. This reporter has noted that the system works on a microcomputer which is just the size of a notebook. The success of developing this device has blazed a new trail for the highly efficient command of the headquarters in field operations. It marks that our army has scaled a new height in automated command. After watching the demonstration, leading cadres including Zhang Wannian, Fu Quanyou, and others spoke highly of the system, which, in the headquarters' view, represents the reform orientation of command pattern of the headquarters.
