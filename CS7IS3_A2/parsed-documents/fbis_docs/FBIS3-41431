Now, it is reported that satellite photographs show 47,000 hectares under coca cultivation, hence an actual increase. The United States Embassy has set a 1994 deadline for completion of the eradication, since it has been found that only 10 percent of the production has a legitimate use, and that the rest is used for the manufacture of cocaine base. The foregoing indicates the scantiness of the information filtering down to the public on the subject of coca cultivation. Since the topic is intertwined with police and diplomatic issues, the information being released is incomplete; and it still cannot be said that there is a strong current of public opinion in favor of replacing the coca economy. The fact that has been given the least importance is that the Chapare is an ecosystem of approximately 2.5 million hectares that is in the process of being destroyed by coca cultivation and the use of chemical precursors. Coca is necessary for soil preservation in the Yungas of La Paz, according to reports by LIDEMA [League for the Protection of the Environment]. But in the Chapare, farming techniques, lack of crop rotation, and weeding with the grubbing hoe, have all accelerated erosion and done away with the thin layer of topsoil. In 1991, the degradation of the soil that was found to have occurred in the eradicated areas of the Chapare was such as to require a waiting period estimated at 10 to 15 years for its recovery. But the problem is not only coca itself. According to data released to the press in 1991, the drug producers have, each year, been spraying between 121,000 and 127,000 tons of leaves with 278 tons of sulfuric acid and approximately 12 million liters of gasoline, kerosene, and jet fuel. Since coca cultivation has now expanded, it must be assumed that these figures have also grown. Even though not the entire measure of contaminants reaches the Chapare's soil or its rivers, it is known that lime and sulfuric acid drastically modify the pH of soils and waters. And the kerosene, spreading out into rivers, seriously contaminates the waters. Antidrug police forces have destroyed tens of thousands of vats and laboratories in the area. The coca plant is not the only link in the chain, and, within the ambit of shared international responsibility for curtailing the drug traffic, the positions being taken against its cultivation are increasingly aggressive. This is not the case, however, with respect to the traffic of the chemical contaminants. Without coca there is no drug, but neither is there drug without precursors. In Bolivia alone there are four legally established enterprises for the manufacture of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia, although the industrial demand for these products is insignificant. It seems that nations that manufacture chemicals have not shouldered the responsibility devolving upon them to control the trafficking in these products. Records show that precursors are arriving from Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, United States, Holland, Peru, Switzerland, Italy, England, France, and others. Legally or illegally imported, they are entering through Chilean ports. Furthermore, all production increases when demand requires it. And while the Alternative Crop Planting Program has been a failure, the campaigns to curb the dealing and use of drugs in consumer countries have also been a failure.
