FR940504-0-00014 FR940504-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;47] Amendment to Class D Airspace; Moses Lake, WA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Class D airspace at the Grant County Airport, Moses Lake, WA, by excluding the airspace overlying the Moses Lake Municipal Airport, WA. It will permit air traffic operations to and from Moses Lake Municipal Airport without the requirement for radio communications with the Grant County Airport Traffic Control Tower. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Melland, ANM&hyph;536, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;47, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone: (206) 227&hyph;2536. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class D airspace for the Grant County Airport, Moses Lake, Washington (59 FR 8567). Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they desired. No comments were received. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating airport traffic control tower is now designated Class D airspace. Class D airspace designations for airspace extending upward from the surface with an operating airport traffic control tower are published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The coordinates in this final rule are in North America Datum 83. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Moses Lake, Washington. It will permit air traffic operations at the Moses Lake Municipal Airport without the requirement for direct radio communications with the airport traffic control tower at the Grant County Airport by excluding the Moses Lake Municipal Airport from the Grant County Airport Class D airspace. It improves the efficiency at Moses Lake Municipal Airport without significantly impacting on the operation at the Grant County Airport operation, and simplifies air traffic control activities within the Class D airspace. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
