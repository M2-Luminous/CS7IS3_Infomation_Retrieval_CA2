It stands for the settlement of the Karabakh problem in the CSCE framework", Vafa Gulidze, the republican state adviser on foreign policy, told TASS on Tuesday after Azerbaijan refused to sign a ceasefire protocol brokered by Moscow between the warring sides. He rejected mass media reports that Azerbaijan had accepted only the Russian plan according to which Russian peace-keepers are to be deployed in the zone of conflict. "These allegations are absolutely groundless and can be assesseed as pressure on the republic", Gulidze said. "We are not against cooperation with Russia, however the Armenian-Azeri conflict has acquired an international character and can be resolved only in the framework of the CSCE of which Russia is a member", he stressed. According to Gulidze, neither the president, nor the foreign minister, nor he himself have seen the document discussed in Moscow. At the same time he recalled that Azerbaijan had agreed on Monday with the document proposed by the chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group for Karabakh which envisages a ceasefire, disengagement of troops and a simultaneous withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azeri territories. Armenians have in words agreed with the proposal too, but did not sign it explaining that they are unaware of the results of the Moscow meeting of defence ministers of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Russia, according to Gulidze.
