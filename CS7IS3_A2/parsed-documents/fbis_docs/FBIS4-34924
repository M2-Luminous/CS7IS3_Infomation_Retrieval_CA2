The newspaper reported the group, presumably linked to the terrorist organization ETA, was arrested following an extortion attempt in Zapopan. EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO cites investigations which the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has conducted and adds the group under arrest is involved in the deaths of a citizen from Los Angeles, (California), a Venezuelan official, and a Mexican businessman. The group, known as "Los Julupesty," has been committing "kidnappings, homicides, threats, and thefts in various banking institutions" in the last few months, the Mexican newspaper has reported. The arrested men followed "a crime route extending from Los Angeles, California, to Caracas, Venezuela, passing through Mexico," the publication reports. The group is headed by David Gomez, alias "El Chino," a fugitive of the justice system and an alleged, active, ETA member, the article added. The arrested individuals, whose nationalities were not disclosed, are Marcos Gomez Ontiveros, Ernesto Lopez, Carlos Alberto Ortiz, Daniel Ramirez, Vilma Ramirez, Carmen Armianca, and Jarry Gomez. In their first statements before the Jalisco Attorney General's Office, the seven individuals admitted they had tried to extort a family in Zapopan through a letter, but the family notified the police, the Mexican newspaper reported. The article added the arrested individuals could be involved in the murder of businessman Mario Gonzalez, who was shot to death by two individuals in the Mexican port of Veracruz on 1 April. Likewise, according to the source, they are accused of participating in the kidnapping and murder of William Munoz, leader of a gypsy community in Los Angeles who was killed on 21 April because the $1-million ransom that was being demanded was not paid.
