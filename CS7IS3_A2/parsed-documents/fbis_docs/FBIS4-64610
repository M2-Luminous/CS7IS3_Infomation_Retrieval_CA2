[Pangalos] I was not one of those who expected much to come from this trip. Bilateral relations have improved, and that is a good thing. But the basic question is: What policy does the United States want to take: a policy of relationships of force, or a policy of principles? Initially, Clinton looked more like he wanted to go the second way, but.... To put it clearly, a policy of relationships of force means oil, particular attention to Islam, and hence a search for solutions, the principal criterion of which is the relationship with Islam. In the Balkans too. We in Greece have very bitter experience of American policy of relationships of force. The aggression in Cyprus was tolerated, if not even organized, by the United States. Hence, when one talks of the "dangerous Serb precedent" in Yugoslavia, we agree, certainly, but ethnic cleansing and the violation of human rights and of borders is something we have known in Cyprus for 20 years now. [Vannuccini] This is why you do not trust the Europeans on the Skopje question? [Pangalos] Look, the problem of Skopje exists, and it is not we who invented it. They tell us that it also existed before. But previously Macedonia was not a state. There were two provinces, a Macedonian province in Greece and a Macedonian province in Yugoslavia. I do not question that Skopje is a part of geographic Macedonia. But now that they are a state, it seems to me that they are the true Macedonians. And this poses a problem. It Tessin [southern Swiss province bordering on Italy] declared itself independent and called itself the state of Lombardy, this would create a problem for the Milanese, would it not? [Vannuccini] Probably also for the inhabitants of Skopje, who have considered themselves to be Macedonian for the past 50 years. Assuming another name is a problem. [Pangalos] No, and I will explain to you why. First of all, they do not see themselves as Macedonians, but as Yugoslavs. Yugoslavia was something real, even if today we speak of it as if it had not existed. Moreover, a third, and possibly more of the inhabitants considered themselves, and continue to consider themselves, to be Albanian. Of the other two-thirds, one minority saw itself as Macedonian, and another believed itself, and still believes itself to be Bulgarian. Just think that the second largest party in Skopje has its headquarters in Sofia. Things are not simple. Greece is afraid of political instability. And this is something very real. The Skopjans have problems with the Serbs, with the Albanians, and with the Bulgarians. The Albanians have problems with the Serbs, with the Skopjans, and now they are trying to create problems with us as well. Everyone has problems with everyone else. Not to mention Turkey. Greece wants to stay out of the Balkan game. For this reason I wish to solve the question rapidly, so that there are no future claims of any kind. Why are the Skopjans insisting on their positions? Answer me. [Vannuccini] Probably because a name based on geography is less risky for a country with so many different ethnic groups. [Pangalos] Is this why they are insisting also on the articles of the constitution and pretend to have a "droit de regard" [a right to oversee] our Macedonians, whom they view as "compatriots who speak Greek." The rule in the Balkans has always been that whenever a regime fails to resolve the problems of its own people, it creates problems outside. If you do not know that, you understand nothing about the region. [Vannuccini] Can you please recapitulate the Greek position for me. What did Papandreou say to Clinton? [Pangalos] We told [FYROM President] Gligorov that, simultaneously, we would lift the embargo and he would remove the Vergina sun from the flag and make a declaration that the articles of the constitution have no further meaning than a historical text. We would guarantee our existing borders to each other -- we are also prepared to guarantee Skopje its borders with the other neighboring countries -- and at the same time we would remove our veto to their entry into the CSCE and adopt the economic aid program. Two things are still left out: They say that it is a Macedonian minority in Greece, and on this item we can refer to the Council of Europe rules. And then there is the question of the name: Here we can admit the existence of a reciprocal right, and begin negotiations. We expect the Europeans to place pressure on Skopje. But Europe does not care less about Greek concerns. There is a total distance. Greeks can only record this and draw from it very negative conclusions. [Vannuccini] Which? [Pangalos] Europe is divided and weak. There are countries which make policy and countries which are subject to policy. Do not fool yourself that Italy has a policy. Look, we have no intention of playing this game to the bitter end. [Vannuccini] Are you referring to the recognition of the former Yugoslav republics? [Pangalos] It seems to me that the Germans themselves are becoming aware that the recognition of Bosnia was premature. The Greek Government should have exercised its veto. It was clear from the outset that the Serbs would not have accepted a Muslim Bosnia. To imagine a minority of Catholics and Orthodox accepting a Muslim power is to be unacquainted with the Balkans. When the Balkan peoples say Muslim, they mean Turk, and Turkish power is still alive in their mind. Because it was an indescribable power. It is not comparable with the Austrian occupation of Italy or the Swedish occupation of Denmark, as my Danish colleague suggested, demonstrating how little he understood of the situation. The Turkish power was barbarian. It was not Islam, mind you, but a Mongol power. Attila, Tamburlaine. Perhaps the Turks do not yet consider them as heroes? A Turk was allowed to rape children whom he met on the street, to kill whomever he wanted. The Greeks never ceased combating them. I belong to a Greek Albanian-speaking minority from an area of Mount Parnassos, in Attica, where the Turks never managed to set foot. [Vannuccini] Greeks often see things less in terms of errors of judgment by certain European countries, and more in terms of obscure designs of political and economic penetration. Do you share this analysis? [Pangalos] I do not think that these designs are dark at all. They are extremely clear. Certain people preferred to have weak and easily influenceable countries in the south of the Balkans. Divide and conquer. [Vannuccini] What type of solution do you see then for Bosnia? [Pangalos] We need to turn to the European level. The territorial status quo. With small changes, but without losing more time seeking to change it substantially. [Vannuccini] Leaving the Serbs with more than 70 percent of the territory? [Pangalos] What does 70 percent mean? This figure includes the mountains. And what then is the alternative: to arm everyone and hope for a Muslim victory? And then impose a Muslim state on the Serbs? There are no military paths, only the path of negotiation. [Vannuccini] But did you not say that one must reject relationships of force? [Pangalos] The situation here is different, because we have recognized Yugoslavia's internal borders as international borders. We need to redraw the borders, respecting nationalities, and then seek to remake Yugoslavia -- a confederation, something which will enable these people to live together. I know that what I am saying can appear absurd, but it is less so than it might seem. [Vannuccini] Greece has a bad image in Europe, also because of its financial mess, but it has done nothing to remedy the situation. [Pangalos] We have an austerity plan, and we need to apply it with firmness. Certainly Greece poses problems for Europe because it will not allow the Maastricht Treaty to go ahead. But it is not alone. Is Maastricht possible without Italy? I do not think so. And in any event, it is not, as some people say, that the money is going out of the pockets of North Europeans who work and into the pockets of Greeks who do nothing. I have had a balance sheet prepared of the give and take in 15 years of Community membership. And I can assure you that these calculations are difficult to do: money transfers can be calculated because they are visible sums, but other parameters are difficult to put into figures. Greece is a major importer of Northern European products. The transfers are for investments, three-quarters of which return to European industry. If the calculations are done, we will have some surprises.
