The Arab affairs editor in the Jamahiriyah News Agency commented on this saying: "Such actions constitute blatant interference in Syria's internal affairs". The editor questioned whether the United States would accept that anyone could demand of the American President Bill Clinton to release American prisoners in American jails. The editor said that this condescending manner with which America views the rest of the world has plunged the world into crisis. They do not allow anyone else to treat them as they treat others in the belief that they are unique and others are not allowed to do what the United States allows itself to do.
