Incidentally, with this he has also set himself against the more moderate stance of the Slovak head of state. Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava: [Nagy] Certain political forces exceed the limits of tolerance when they demand collective rights for the Hungarians of Slovakia. If in this way they want to increase tension, they must reckon with the fact that they are confronting the power of the state. There will not be any kind of province; we will guarantee that. And this country will not voluntarily give up as much as an inch of its territory, because that would lead to a Central European conflict. These remarks were made by Vladimir Meciar at a discussion he held with workers of the Slovak Defense Ministry. In connection with bilingual placename signs he stated: The government's wish is for the use of the Slovak name, translated into the language of the minority, and it does not agree with the proposal coming from the Castle [Slovak Presidency], which recommends that the minorities should use any name that suits them. Minority rights are above average in Slovakia, stated the Slovak prime minister, according to whom Bill Clinton also rejected collective rights at the conversation he held with him in Prague. For this reason Vladimir Meciar trusts that the part dealing with the inviolability of borders will also be included in the Slovak-Hungarian interstate treaty, which is under preparation.
