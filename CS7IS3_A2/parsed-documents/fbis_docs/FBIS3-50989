[Jovel] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Some small business owners and certain politicians have said that one of the repercussions of NAFTA could be Mexico's strong capabilities, which are very different than what Salvadorans have. Could this be a repercussion or what could be the main repercussions of NAFTA? [Cristiani] I think that the repercussions, or the main repercussion, will generate competition. To that effect, our entrepreneurs will have to face the challenge of competing with products coming from other countries. Competition leads to better quality at a better price, and consumers, who are the majority of the population, receive the benefits; in other words, consumers will have greater options when choosing the product that provides better quality at the most reasonable price. I think our entrepreneurs should not fear open competition. They have proven to be good businessmen on numerous occasions, and they have highly qualified workers. I think that if we make this decision--and I think entrepreneurs are about to make that decision--they will accept the challenge, and I think they will be successful. Personally, I do not think there is any reason why we should fear competition. We must obviously try harder to provide the people with those two elements. There is always an advantage, even in free trade, and that is transportation. Transportation is what makes the difference between the imported and locally manufactured product; nevertheless, I still do not think there is anything to fear. Furthermore, the treaty with Mexico is asymmetrical; that is, our products will enter Mexico even before Mexican products enter El Salvador, according to what was agreed in Tuxtla Gutierrez; in other words, this is an additional advantage. Naturally, if we want to see examples, let's see examples such as Mexico versus the United States, or let's see Spain versus Germany. Actually, there has been an increase in trade between the two countries, both in the cases of Spain and Germany. That is where each country has to seek in which areas it can be more competitive and then compete. [Moderator] Carlos Marquez, from AFP. [Marquez] Mr. President, the elections will be held in 68 days, and I would like to know if any governments have been invited to observe the electoral process. [Cristiani] That is something that corresponds to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], and, as everyone knows, the United Nations will send observers. The United Nations is a world organization; therefore, all countries indirectly have the possibility of being included in a mission that we understand will arrive at the time of the elections. The mission will include 900 [as heard] observers. For the time being, the TSE has only notified us that it has decided to invite all of the electoral bodies of Latin America inasmuch as they have an organization among themselves. They also have an agreement whereby all members of these bodies are observers in each other's elections. Apart from them, we have not had any other request by the TSE. [Moderator] Amadeo Cabrera, LA NOTICIA. [Cabrera] I would like to know if you will attend the new Honduran president's inaugural ceremonies, and how do you describe bilateral relations between the outgoing president and your government? [Cristiani] Yes. We have plans to attend the inaugural ceremonies of the new Honduran Government on 27 January. I would say that relations between the government of President Callejas and ours have been excellent. [passage omitted]
