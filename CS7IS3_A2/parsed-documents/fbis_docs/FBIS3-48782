"The fact that the U.S. Senate has voted in favor of lifting the embargo by President Bill Clinton is a positive gesture that corresponds to international reality and the wishes of the American people," a ministry spokesman said. "We believe that this vote will enjoy substantial approval among American and world opinion," according to the ministry, which reacted particularly rapidly. The Senate voted 62 to 38 in favor of lifting the sanctions imposed against Vietnam in 1975. The issue now moves to Clinton for his decision. Last week, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said the embargo was a domestic American affair, saying that Vietnam has already cooperated fully in trying to resolve the issue of 2,238 US soldiers missing in action (MIA) in Indochina. The MIAs remain the final obstacle to the lifting of sanctions.
