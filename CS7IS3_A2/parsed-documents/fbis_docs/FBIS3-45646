His successor will probably be Yin Jieyan, who currently holds the position of director of the State Administration of Exchange Control. In view of the ghastly signs of price rises and an overheated economy which have emerged in the mainland's economic situation recently, the national monetary conference, which ended a short time ago, decided to slow down the pace of monetary reform and to continue to practice macroeconomic regulation and control policies. It has been disclosed that the news about Zhu Rongji's intended resignation as president of the central bank came from Zhu himself when he attended a national monetary work meeting last month. It was reported that, in his speech, Zhu Rongji indicated that the responsibility that he shouldered in macroeconomic management work was so heavy that he was unable to simultaneously attend to the work of the central bank. Given the intense rivalry between the two most promising vice presidents -- Zhou Zhengqing and Dai Xianglong -- the post of central bank president may finally fall on the "dark horse" -- Yin Jieyan, the current director of the State Administration of Exchange Control. As disclosed, Yin has worked in the central bank for a long time and, as early as 1985 when Chen Muhua was president of the bank, he was secretary general of the bank's board of directors. Since last year, particularly since the unification of exchange rates this year, Yin has performed outstanding work in stabilizing the renminbi's exchange rate. He is worthy of being called an experienced banking official with expertise in modern banking. Hence, he is most probably the candidate who will be selected by the central authorities for this post.
