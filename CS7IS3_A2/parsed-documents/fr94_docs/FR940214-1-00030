Section 318.2 (c), footnote 1, and (d) would be revised as follows: ยง318.2 Reinspection, retention, and disposal of meat and poultry products at official establishments. * * * * * (c) Reinspection may be accomplished through use of statistically sound sampling plans that assure a high level of confidence. The circuit supervisor shall designate the type of plan and the program employee shall select the specific plan to be used in accordance with instructions issued by the Administrator. 1 1 Further information concerning sampling plans which have been adopted for specific products may be obtained from the circuit supervisors of program circuits. These sampling plans are developed for individual products and will be distributed for field use as they are developed. The type of plan applicable depends on factors such as whether the product is in containers, stage of preparation, and procedure followed by the establishment operator. The specific plan applicable depends on the kind of product involved, such as liver, oxtail, etc. (d) A U.S. retained tag shall be placed by a Program employee at the time of reinspection at any official establishment on all products which are suspected on such reinspection of being adulterated or misbranded, and such products shall be held for further inspection. Such tag shall be removed only authorized Program employees. (1) Reinspection determinations regarding adulteration may be deferred: (i) For up to twenty (20) calendar days, if a product has become soiled or unclean by falling on the floor or in any other accidental way, an the inspector determines the condition can be corrected, in which case the product shall be cleaned (including trimming if necessary) or otherwise handled in a manner approved by the inspector to assure that it will not be adulterated or misbranded and shall then be presented for final reinspection and disposal in accordance with this section within a period of twenty (20) calendar days, or (ii) When the Regional Director grants prior approval of an establishment's written procedures for storing at the official establishment product suspected of adulteration with metal, plastic, or other material capable of detection by the use of approved specialized mechanical detection devices prior to final reinspection. These written procedures shall describe how the establishment will maintain the identity of the suspect product, where the suspect product will be stored, how long the product will be stored, and what measures will be taken to secure the product. (A) Approval of an establishment's written procedures for accumulating product will be based on the establishment's ability to provide the physical space to store the accumulated product and its ability to assure that the identity and security of the product is maintained. (B) In any situation where the establishment's written procedure for accumulating product is found by the Administrator or his/her designee to be unacceptable, formal written notification shall be given to the establishment of the basis for the denial. The establishment will be afforded an opportunity to modify the procedure in accordance with the notification. The establishment shall be afforded an opportunity to submit a written statement in response to this notification of denial and a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial. If the establishment requests a hearing and the Administrator or his/her designee, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, he/she shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer and the request for hearing, which shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall hereafter be conducted in accordance with Rules of Practice which shall be adopted for this proceeding. (C) Specialized mechanical detection devices shall be approved in accordance with the provisions of ยง308.5 of this subchapter. (2) Upon final reinspection, the product shall be disposed of as follows: (i) If the inspector determines that the product is not adulterated or misbranded, the inspector shall remove the U.S. retained tag;
