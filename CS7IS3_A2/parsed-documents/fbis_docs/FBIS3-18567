At a stormy meeting Balladur defended his plan against strong opposition from trade unions, students and left-wing parties and in spite of an opinion poll in the daily Info-Matin that showed 55 percent of the French opposed the plan while 36 percent supported it. Balladur was speaking at a roundtable with trade unionists and employers' representatives that had originally been scheduled to debate employment prospects, but the meeting was dominated by the plan to allow firms to recruit young workers and pay them less than the take-home minimum of 880 dollars a month. Students and trade unions planned protest marches later on Thursday to fight the plan. Viannet said new proposals on the wage cut plan made by Balladur on Thursday were "mere window-dressing." He said all the trade unions had been unanimous in condemning the plan. Viannet said Balladur had proposed introducing a distinction between holders of university degrees and diplomas and unqualified youths. Labour Minister Michel Giraud was attending the meeting.
