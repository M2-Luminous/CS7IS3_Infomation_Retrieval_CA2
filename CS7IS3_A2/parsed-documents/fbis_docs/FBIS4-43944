This delighted comment came from Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen (Conservative Party) on Monday [11 June] as he learned about the outcome of the Austrian referendum. Salolainen was convinced that the Austrian result will have a positive impact at least on the undecided members of the Finnish parliament and on other citizens. The Austrians have, in fact, fought the same kind of battle as the Finns over billions in subsidies. A negative result in Austria would have been, according to Salolainen, a "dreadful shock." "The referendum result has once again made a mockery of the opinion polls," Salolainen added joyfully. The referendum in Austria also accelerates the forthcoming disintegration of the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EEA [European Economic Area] base. Austria's decision to join the EU breaks up the base of mutual arrangements between the EFTA countries.
