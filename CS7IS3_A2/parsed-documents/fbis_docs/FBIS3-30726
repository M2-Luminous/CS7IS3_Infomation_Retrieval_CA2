However, in times of war, particularly in such times as face our country and people, this way of doing it is not common in democratic practice. This assembly is sitting in session, and this government is submitting a report on the first 100 days of work only about 300 to 400 meters from the front line, and this in a city in which over the last few days alone about 100 civilians have been killed and 200 wounded. Under these conditions, 100 days to the people exposed to the horrors of war is a long time, while to the government of the country facing tremendous problems, it is a short time. There is a constant race with time. Esteemed deputies, I would like to remind you that the new government took up duty under extremely hard conditions, characterized by a further escalation of the aggression with the open military engagement not only of Serbia and Montenegro, but also the Republic of Croatia; the catastrophic humanitarian situation, caused by the blockade imposed by both aggressors and the indecisiveness of the international community to eliminate that blockade; the deadlock of the peace process that is on the one hand the result of the aggressor's commitment to the war option, and on the other, the result of the lack of political will of the most important international protagonists to achieve the principles they set themselves in resolutions and other documents, and the devastated economic and financial system, the destroyed and badly damaged vital production capacities and the fractured economic ties between various parts of the country. This difficult situation has been further worsened by the problems created through the long- lasting obstruction by certain members of the previous government. This resulted in confusion and an interruption in the work of some ministries and certain segments of the government in general, and further caused the suspension of work of some significant state institutions at a time when their work was most needed. Apart from that, there was the attempt at a separatist putsch in the Bihac region, and when the putsch was thwarted, the separatists stepped into open collaboration with the aggressor. One should certainly say that the formation of the new government was spearheaded by the consolidation of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, whose new configuration stood unified behind the concept of preserving the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and -- on that basis -- behind seeking political solutions in the peace process, while decisively resisting the aggression and strengthening the army and all the defense potential. The formation of the new government was the result of such commitments, which opened the road to the creation of a qualitatively new atmosphere in the entire state structure. Under these conditions the government -- although according to the Constitution it is responsible for the situation in all spheres of life -- had to determine the priority tasks and aims, and for that reason it directed its activities in the following direction: Providing the most urgently needed means and conditions for the survival of the population during the winter period; strengthening the overall defense capacities of the country, with the stress on strengthening and developing the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as the key factor of defense; undertaking measures for alleviating the very hard position of the refugees and the displaced people, and creating the climate for their return; adapting the economic and financial system to a war economy footing in order to place all the resources in the defense of the country and the survival of the population, and consolidating the state management and judiciary, and the advancement of justice in general, and particularly the personal and property security of all the citizens, and the protection of human rights, which is particularly important in times of war. Since the establishment of peace is the main, and within this government's program, the ultimate aim, the government has been intensely engaged in the efforts to get the peace process out of the impasse and steer it in the directions that offer the chance to establish a just and stable peace. According to everything, the Geneva talks -- which imposed the wrong concept from the start -- are facing definite collapse as both the aggressors are using them as a smokescreen, while their real aim is to conquer and annex through war most of the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory. I do not intend to elaborate here on the reasons for the failure of the peace process so far and the consequences of that failure, just as I will not elaborate on the concept of the peace initiative to be launched by our country since that is the issue to be addressed at a special point on the agenda of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the government, within its sphere of competence, has invested enormous efforts to avoid the collapse of the peace process. Our diplomacy has been working very intensively in this direction. It sought and obtained political support and specific help from friendly countries. It insisted in the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, and other relevant international organizations and institutions to carry out the principles that the international community has set itself. It spread the truth about Bosnia-Herzegovina, it mobilized the world public to act by applying pressure against the inertia and hypocrisy of the political establishments of their countries. At the same time, we thoroughly analyzed possible solutions and intensively sought ways of accepting all options that are offering at least the minimum of justice and prospects for stable peace. However, at no time have we ever considered accepting capitulation. It appears that this is what is being asked of us. We are deeply aware that with this kind of attitude by certain members of the international community we have as many chances of achieving peace as our army and our people demonstrate strength, decisiveness, and success in the struggle for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although sincerely committed to peace, we had to invest the maximum of effort to further develop and strengthen our defense capabilities. Within its sphere of responsibility, the government has taken specific measures concerning the creation of a unified system of financing defense and providing logistical support, because the unintegrated systems in some communes or districts have not only been ineffective but also suited the unacceptable concepts of waging a defense war inside the country and within local communities, while neglecting the global interests of the country. Within the development of the global concept for securing funds for the needs of the defense, at the proposal of the government we adopted a decision on a tax for defense and rebuilding of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This tax is expected to produce significant results, especially in regard to the material contributions by our workers employed abroad. The characteristic of this war is that the aggressors have been attacking civilian targets with all their might, and that the mass killing of civilians has become an integral part of the aggressors' strategy. Despite the fact that we have been taking certain measures for the protection of the civilian population, it is obvious that this is becoming a task of the greatest importance. In this respect the government has already set directives for the work of the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Civil Defense, and other institutions of the system. We have achieved significant results in the development of our defense forces. We certainly do not want to create illusions that we are equal to the aggressor in regard to military equipment. On the contrary, the unjust embargo has considerably impaired our defense capabilities. However, regarding manpower, the organization of the system of command, a high combat morale, and the mobilization of all potentials on which the defense depends, we created not only a respectable army but also an increasingly sound system of defense as a whole. This is of crucial importance for further course of the war and the further course and outcome of the peace process, because we take the view, we are sure that a solution can no longer be imposed on us with the aggressors' military means. The international community is becoming aware of this, and so is the aggressor himself. This means that in the future the peace process must embark on the path of finding a formula for a genuine peace, and not capitulation. Regarding the provision of conditions and means for the survival of the population in the winter period, I must say that the results achieved so far are not proportionate to the enormous efforts invested by the government in this respect. The activities of the government on securing funds for the survival of the population were primarily directed at the issues concerning the delivery of humanitarian aid, the mobilization of natural resources and available facilities for the production and distribution of food, and finding energy resources. Through its relevant ministries the government has also undertaken measures needed to implement the plan for spring sowing in 1994 and to activate facilities for the quick production of food. The key causes of the critical humanitarian situation lie in the fact that the aggressor is using the humanitarian situation to achieve his war aims, which cannot be achieved on the battlefields. At the same time, some protagonists in international politics are using the grave humanitarian situation as a means of applying pressure on the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept solutions that suit certain powers in this region. We told the international community this openly at our extraordinary session. The (?lack) of resolve by the international community to carry out the resolutions on the military protection of the convoys and ensure the safety of relief routes, and the reluctance on the part of UNPROFOR to carry out at least the measures that it was empowered to do by the otherwise inadequate mandate, I repeat the inadequate mandate, have contributed toward the amount of humanitarian aid that has been delivered being well below the existential minimum. For these reasons, the government held an extraordinary session from which it sent a message to relevant international institutions and the entire world public to prevent a human catastrophe. This call has met with a positive response and the first results can already be felt. After this objective criticism, one should say that we appreciate the efforts made by UNPROFOR, UNHCR, and other humanitarian organizations in practice. We are aware that without them, with their involvement, the situation would have been much more difficult. I particularly positively assess the delivery of aid with parachutes. This was the only way to (?send aid) to some areas that are completely surrounded. Although the humanitarian situation is critical in almost all regions that are under the control of the legal organs of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is nevertheless precisely because of the persistent and organized efforts by the government that certain progress has been made, and an even worse situation avoided, at least for the time being, which was our aim. In our effort to transform the economic and financial system with quick and resolute moves, and adapt it to the demands of the war economy, the government has instructed the relevant departments to draw up a list of all available resources and facilities on the free territories in the shortest possible time so that they could be included in the system of defense for survival in an organized and coordinated way. Then, they were instructed to establish our energy resources and the minimum of needs for electric power, coal, oil, oil products, gas, and other energy resources, as well as embark on the revitalization and reconnection of the electric power system. In addition, the government has outlined complex measures to identify social capital as state capital in order to protect it from illegal misappropriation and use it more efficiently for the needs of defense. These solutions are of a transient nature. The ultimate objective is the privatization of capital when objective conditions have been created for it. The tasks that have been set in this respect have already been partly accomplished, or work on their realization is intensively under way. When the government presented its program in the inaugural session, we promised that we would approach the issues of the status and subsistence of the families of our soldiers and the killed and wounded members of the armed forces, and other victims of the war, with special attention and responsibility. In a relatively short period of time we adopted regulations and secured funds to solve these issues, at least partly, through special pensions, the payment of pensions and other income in kind, the establishment of a system of care and education for the children of members of the armed forces killed, and the provision of accommodation and other appropriate measures. This, of course, is only a small part of the responsibility that we took upon ourselves, and these issues will remain the priority in the future work of the government. Regarding refugees and displaced persons, and the creation of conditions for their return, we have embarked on the drafting of regulations and setting up appropriate institutions so that this complex and long-tern problem could be dealt with systematically and in an organized way, not only as a humanitarian and social problem, but as a strategic issue for which the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina is responsible. The issue of organizing the functioning of the health service in times of war -- the kind of war waged by the aggressors against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- is extremely important. The government has not had much leeway for solving these issues, as all the problems present in the humanitarian situation and aid in general are reflected in the health service. The blocking of the humanitarian aid has had extremely dire consequences on the health service. The international community has been tolerating with incredible indulgence the open threats by the aggressors in connection with the delivery of medicine, sanitary and medical equipment, and the evacuation of the wounded. Our doctors and other medical staff have been working miracles in extreme hardship and without the most basic conditions. However, thanks to friendly countries, we have managed to obtain a minimal amount of medicine and sanitary materials. The arrival of the field hospital in Mostar will alleviate at least partly the intolerable conditions under which the wounded and the sick are treated in the free part of that city. Esteemed deputies, times of war are not very favorable for any spectacular moves by the government in the fields of culture, science, or education. We have tried, through the appropriate ministries, to maintain the continuity of the education process in the conditions of war, primarily keeping in mind the security of the students, as the schools have become the aggressor's favorite targets. We have also undertaken measures to protect the staff, equipment, and other facilities in the sphere of science from further destruction. As for culture, we have a phenomenon here worthy of attention. Despite the extremely unfavorable conditions, cultural life is not only being preserved but is also being promoted in European and international circles. That is one of the spheres that the government does not encourage much owing to its objectively limited resources. However, the cultural workers obviously understand this and are putting more into it than could be realistically expected. As for the sphere of information, the most important activities of the government have been directed at providing factual and expeditious information to the domestic and international public about all the relevant events in the country. Through staffing, and the financial and technical strengthening of the media, the government has also tried to provide for their integration into a overall system. Through agreements with governments of friendly countries, and countries that have received our refugees, and through other forms of support and means, particularly Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina as the most profuse media, the government will do everything possible under the circumstances to enable information from the republic to reach the world. This has not been the case as yet. Parallel with the intensive engagement in the peace process, the government has taken into account overall foreign policy, which is of particular importance under the circumstances. Our bilateral activities have been very intensive. We have been visited by the prime ministers of Pakistan and Turkey, foreign ministers of Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Croatia, and a number of ministers in charge of humanitarian aid, parliamentary delegations, other prominent politicians, and other prominent personalities and intellectuals from all over the world. As prime minister, I have visited Turkey, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Croatia. Our foreign minister has visited Hungary, Italy, Belgium, France, Turkey, Germany, and Austria, and has taken part in the work of the CSCE and the CEI [Central European Initiative]. The ministers for education, health, economics, and interior affairs have also made some important trips abroad. As for the next period, we have arranged visits to our most important partners, who influence the peace process in various constructive ways, or who give us their support and aid in preserving the independence and integrity of our country. The government has devoted a lot of attention to promoting relations with other countries. So far 75 countries have recognized Bosnia- Herzegovina, while diplomatic relations have been established with 45 of them. Eighteen countries have accredited ambassadors to Sarajevo. Bosnia-Herzegovina has opened 22 embassies, three missions within international organizations, and three general consulates. The public knows little about this, but it is of great importance for Bosnia-Herzegovina that it has become a member of a large number of international organizations over the period that this report covers, from UNESCO, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Organization for Intellectual Property, the International Organization for Migration, and so on. Our country is a signatory to 172 international multilateral agreements and systems of the United Nations, and another 34 are being processed. The procedure of ratifying 16 conventions within the Council of Europe is under way. We have recently signed agreements on friendly cooperation with Pakistan and Turkey, while activities aimed at signing bilateral agreements with a number of other countries are in progress. The government believes that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly should debate at one of its next sessions the strategic directions for our foreign policy engagements. The government will prepare an adequate platform for that. I would like to point out that over the last three months the government has undertaken concrete steps on the consolidation of the state's administration, the judiciary, and the advancement of law. The government was formed according to the criteria of competence and ability, but also that of its members' loyalty to the struggle for the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a relatively short time the republic's management has been successfully reorganized, and all the ministries have been changed to enable them to carry out their duties more efficiently. We have been working intensively and with some success on establishing effective vertical links among the state bodies, starting from the republic, through the regions to the communes, where the links had considerably weakened, and in some parts hardly existed. In that sense the establishment of ministerial coordinators for certain regions has proven useful. Apart from the constant presence of these ministerial coordinators, the practice is being established that other ministers and government officials should also frequently tour all the territories under our control, that is, under the control of the legitimate authorities. We will continue to develop this practice as it is one of the ways of overcoming occurrences of autarchy, individualist activities of local bodies, and in some cases disintegrating moves that weaken the necessary unity. The government is speeding up its work on preparing regulations and other measures with which one would carry out certain changes in organizing the state structure, so that the state could function in a united way over the entire free territory and in the enclaves that are difficult to reach or those that are completely surrounded. We have demonstrated resolution in suppressing all forms of lawlessness and it is not immodest if I say that in strengthening the personal security of all citizens and security of their property, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the security organs of the Defense Ministry and the Army, judicial organs and other institutions of the system have made radical moves. Of course, I am far from claiming that the present situation is good, but it is a fact that there is a positive state of legality and that the state of personal security of all citizens and the security of their property cannot be compared with the situation that the government had been faced with at the beginning. At the end of this expose, ladies and gentlemen deputies, I want briefly to present the basic aims of the government in the coming period. You have been given the program of work of the government and have the opportunity to observe and assess its topicality, the volume of work, and the significance of the (?tasks) that the government is facing. You have also been given the detailed programs of work as well as reports on the work of all ministries. We are probably facing a decisive period in which not only the further fate of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples, but also the fate of every individual on this territory will depend. The government is not going to change the basic concept of its policy. Our intention is to be a government that will achieve peace. In this respect, we are going to continue to make efforts and seek solutions that lead to the end of war. Because, nobody has more interest to achieve peace than we do, as the war is hitting us worst. In doing so we shall continue to seek support and cooperation of the international community, but we also remain open for dialogue with those political forces in Serbia and Croatia that are not being behind the great-state, nationalist, and conquering projects involving our republic. Vital links do not exist only between Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All peoples in the countries that appeared on the territory of the former Yugoslavia have interests in peace, prosperity, and mutual cooperation. This is the meaning of our call to the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, as well as other internationally recognized states that came into being in the wake of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, to make decisions on mutual recognition. It is on this basis that everybody is given prospects that would replace war, hatred, killing, destruction, and poverty. You are, however, still (?facing) aggression which is not an ordinary war, but genocide -- a lot has been said about it here -- and destruction of all civilizational, spiritual, and material achievements. As long as this aggression is going on we have to oppose it, we must defend ourselves, because it is the natural right of every state and every man. We do not need the army to conquer foreign territories, but are going to do everything with a view to having an army that would successfully defend the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These are invariable points in the government's policy, esteemed deputies, which it presents in this report to you, and I suggest to you to support us in this respect. Thank you.
