FBIS4-3885 "drchi080_f_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Near East & South Asia Jordanian Parliamentarian Meets CPPCC Official Jordanian Parliamentarian Meets CPPCC Official OW2504142994 Beijing XINHUA in English 1346 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504142994 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Amman, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Jordan's lower house speaker Tahir al-Masri met here today with Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). They discussed bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process. In his speech at the meeting, which was also attended by the CPPCC delegation led by Wang and a number of Jordanian parliamentarians, Masri stressed that Jordan will never be content unless a just and comprehensive peace is realized in the region and the rights of the Arab and Palestinian people are guaranteed. He also expressed regret over the fact that Israel and the U.S. -- one of the two sponsors of the Middle East peace process -- have not made enough efforts to realize a durable peace in the region. The speaker said that Jordan will do its utmost to safeguard Arab rights. On the democratization process, Masri said that Jordan has embarked on a democratic process, which includes all aspects although it is not perfect. "Jordan will not copy Western democracy, but will introduce one which suits its own tradition and culture," he noted. Masri complained that although the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ended long ago, sanctions against Iraq have been increasing with one UN resolution following another. Despite all this, Masri said, Iraq has accepted all of the demands raised with it, including some which are harmful to it. As a result of the sanctions against Iraq, Jordan's only port of Aqaba has been blocked by U.S.-led Western naval forces, inflicting heavy losses on the kingdom, he said. The speaker appealed to China as well as other countries to make efforts for lifting the blockade. He asked Wang to convey the request of Jordan's lower house to China's National People's Congress and the CPPCC. In his speech, Wang briefed the hosts on the enormous achievements China has made in the reform and economic boom in the past 15 years. On the Middle East issue, Wang said that China has consistently supported the just cause of the Palestinian people and appreciated highly Jordan's endeavor to realize a just and durable peace in the region. As one of the five UN Security Council permanent members, Wang noted, China will continue to make unswerving efforts to push forward the ongoing Middle East peace process. Wang expressed profound sympathy with Jordan for its heavy losses resulted from the Aqaba blockade. He said China supports Jordan's fair and rational demands and hopes the blockade will be lifted as early as possible. On the Iraqi issue, Wang said China has made clear its stand in the discussions at the UN Security Council. He expressed sympathy with the Iraqi people who have suffered dearly as a result of the international sanctions imposed on the country. Wang, who arrived here Sunday [24 April] heading a 10-member CPPCC delegation, has met with Jordan's upper house speaker Ahmad al-Lawzi [spelling of name as received] and Prime Minister 'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali. He will also meet with Jordan's Minister of Planning Ziyad Fariz and visit a tourist attraction in Jerash, 44 kilometers north of Amman.
