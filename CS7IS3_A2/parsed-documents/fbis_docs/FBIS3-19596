Rinaldi cites Berlusconi's claim that popularity polls currently give him 36 percent of the votes as a good reason to focus attention on the man who may well become prime minister after the 27-28 March general elections. Attention should turn especially to Berlusconi's "most hidden characteristics," Rinaldi adds, because Berlusconi has claimed that his success is due to the trust he inspires in people. Rinaldi presents 10 reasons why he believes that trust must be denied. 1. Too Much Power Should Berlusconi win, Rinaldi writes, he would at the same time hold political power as head of government, economic power as owner of Italy's fourth largest private business group, and cultural power as the owner of three private television channels and of Mondadori, Italy's largest publishing company. Should a Berlusconi government decide to cut the number of state-owned RAI television stations or ban them from advertising, the question would arise whether this had been done for the good of the general public or for the good of Berlusconi-owned stations. The same question would be asked about privatizing the state-owned GS supermarkets, currently in direct competition with Berlusconi's Standa supermarkets, and about appointments to head government-owned banks that, Rinaldi claims, have overextended credit to Berlusconi. 2. Habit of Circumventing Law According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi has repeatedly violated the laws on telecommunications. On 28 February he was accused of violating television regulations for election campaigns. The Editors' Federation produced evidence that Channel 5, one of Berlusconi's main television outlets, almost always exceeds the daily advertising quota established by the Mammi Law. Berlusconi's brother, Paolo, who was recently arrested on a bribery charge, has alleged that in the past, Berlusconi's construction company, Edilnord Commerciale, received unbilled materials. Berlusconi's "pseudo- sale" of the daily IL GIORNALE, Rinaldi writes, is now being investigated by the authorities responsible for press affairs. 3. Deceitfulness Charged Regarding the sale of real estate property in the exclusive Milano 3 residential section of Milan, Paolo Berlusconi said that he had accepted a low offer made for the property because the Berlusconi concern "needed to sell." However, Silvio Berlusconi had given a different explanation, that the decision had been made so that Milano 3 should not be a city just for the rich. As a result of the sale, Berlusconi claimed, some of the property was sold to public associations so that less wealthy families could occupy the apartments. Rinaldi writes that, in Berlusconi's mind, "the need to sell" had become a philantrophic decision in favor of the less fortunate. 4. Over-reliance on Polls Noting Berlusconi's claims that polls show him leading with 36 percent of the votes and Italian Popular Party secretary Mino Martinazzoli trailing with only 3 percent, Rinaldi finds three problems with what he calls this over-reliance on polls. First, he questions the honesty of a candidate who celebrates his constant rise in the polls and prophesizes doom for his opponents by passing off data that no one can verify as indisputable truth. The second is a legal problem. The law prohibits any polls from being published 15 days before the elections, but also states that from 30 to 15 days before the elections, only polls that include all the pertinent data and methodology may be published. Rinaldi indicates that polls commissioned by Berlusconi may not meet that legal standard. The third problem is political, Rinaldi writes. Berlusconi's decisions, Rinaldi maintains, are totally founded on poll results, including his choice of candidates, the direction of the party's program, and the timing and methods of his propaganda. Even if the polls were honestly conducted-- "and that's doubtful," Rinaldi adds--a government official should not follow the public's every mood. "The idea that decisions would be made on the answers provided by [public opinion researcher and Forza Italia candidate] Gianni Pilo is enough to make one shiver," Rinaldi writes. 5. Helped Legitimize Neofascists According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi did everything possible to legitimize Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the neofascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), recently renamed National Alliance. Rinaldi cites a series of Berlusconi statements on the subject: "I would vote for Fini in the Rome mayoral elections." "There is a real effort at renewal." "Those who wave the scarecrows of fascism show their moral baseness." "I don't believe a movement such as National Alliance can be said to belong to the extreme right." "National Alliance members have been converted to liberal-democratic ideas." Rinaldi finds it strange that Berlusconi believes that former communists have remained communist but that former neofascists have been converted to democracy. By opening the doors to the neofascists so quickly, Berlusconi has forced the country to "play with fire," Rinaldi writes. 6. Indebtedness Problem Rinaldi notes that Berlusconi has indebted his conglomerate, Fininvest, and that his explanation that he was forced to go into debt to compete with RAI is not plausible. No one forced Berlusconi to compete with RAI, Rinaldi writes, adding ironically that he could well have borrowed another 20 billion lire and competed with Fiat. Beyond the debts themselves, Rinaldi criticizes Berlusconi's way of dealing with his debt load by cutting expenses. Berlusconi does not plan to give up any of his subsidiaries or inject fresh capital into Fininvest, says Rinaldi, and believes his indebtedness is quite normal. Rinaldi wonders whether Berlusconi would handle Italy's huge deficit in the same manner: "Will he trust in God, as he now does, trusting in his creditors' patience, or will he make things worse by reducing taxes, as he is promising?" 7. Lack of Transparency in Business Arrangements Although Berlusconi insists he believes in the free market system, he often excludes his businesses from free market practices. Except for Standa and Mondadori, he avoids listing his other companies on the stock market. Fininvest is headed by "22 strange holding companies named First, Second, Third, etc.," Rinaldi claims. While Berlusconi swears that he and his family own all 22 companies, documentation to that effect has never been made public. Berlusconi once explained that he was advised to organize Fininvest that way in the 1970s because there had been kidnapping threats against his son and this arrangement would help hide his assets. Rinaldi counters that this does not explain why there are 22 companies when just a couple would have served the same purpose. Even though the kidnapping threat is over, Rinaldi adds, Fininvest's organization has remained the same. 8. Allied to `Provincial' Forces Berlusconi insists that the economy can be savied only by beating the Democratic Party of the Left, arguing that if the leftists entered the government many businessmen would move out of Italy. However, something very different has happened so far, Rinaldi observes. Since a Berlusconi victory at the polls has become a possibility, the stock market has steadily dropped--while, on the other hand, the same stock market rose in December when many leftists won in local elections. Berlusconi's enthusiasm and ability to improvise are not sufficient to succeed in international economic competion, Rinadldi concludes, especially when the Italian magnate allies himself with forces such as the "provincial Northern League and the antiquated, nationalist MSI." 9. Intolerant of Disagreement Rinaldi reports that when asked whether it is true that Berlusconi suffers moments of depression, one of his collaborators replied, "Only when someone does not agree with him." When Berlusconi was asked whether he was always right, he did not deny it, Rinaldi writes, and when asked to name some of his defects he could not name even one, replying, "I nominate myself for sainthood." 10. Surrounded by Yes-men Berlusconi has been accused of running his party like a business. While he has rejected the accusation, many of Forza Italia's candidates, such as Antonio Martino, Vittorio Dotti, and Cesare Previti are Berlusconi's long-time business consultants and advisors, Rinaldi writes. Forza Italia's 14 billion lire expenses are guaranteed by Berlusconi himself--a unique case in the political world, according to Rinaldi. The only reason Forza Italia exists, Rinaldi continues, is because one day Berlusconi decided he would create it and pay for it. It is a one-man party, and those surrounding Berlusconi are people on his payroll who do nothing more than follow their boss's wishes, Rinaldi maintains. If everything goes according to Berlusconi's plan, Rinaldi concludes, "we will soon have our one-man government."
