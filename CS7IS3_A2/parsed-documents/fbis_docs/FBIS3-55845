He described as "absolute fascism" the joint French-British initiative on a forcible settlement of the conflict in former Yugoslavia. He thus spoke about one of its authors, the French president: "That Mitterrand of yours has grown senile. He will last another half a year; so near his end, he dreams up all sorts of little ideas." The reaction by President Mitterrand and the French Foreign Ministry to this statement is yet unknown.
