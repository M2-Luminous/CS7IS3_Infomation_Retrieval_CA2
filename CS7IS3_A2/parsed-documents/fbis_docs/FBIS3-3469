They are also hot topics at the ongoing National People's Congress [NPC] session and the session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. In the last few days, NPC deputies and CPPCC members have expressed their views on commodity prices in almost every speech. Sun Shangqing, NPC deputy and director of the State Council's Development Research Center, said worriedly: Price increases were a little too high last year and became higher at the beginning of this year. If this is not strictly controlled, the plan to keep price increases under 10 percent this year will fall through. CPPCC members Wang Rongbing and Qu Qinyue made the following appeal: Excessive price increase in commodities closely related to the people's lives have affected the people's standard of living and feelings; mandatory limits must be set for price increase indices and these limits must not be overstepped. Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi spoke about the pressure he endured and his feelings: The increase in the purchase prices of grain, cotton, and oil; the lifting of control over the prices of coal, electricity, and crude oil; the introduction of the civil service system; the implementation of wage system reform in institutions; and the rapid growth of investments in fixed assets in the entire society will all cause commodity price raises. It will be hard to keep price increases under 10 percent this year. NPC deputies and CPPCC members discussed state affairs and expressed the people's opinions. Their worries are not without foundation. Since November last year, commodity prices have kept rising. At first, panic buying of grain and oil swept from the south to the north, causing anxiety among civilians; subsequently, the standardization of foreign exchange rates caused some turbulence in the use of foreign exchange certificates; some people with foreign exchange certificates in hand began to buy gold ornaments and imported electrical appliances, also causing some unrest; afterward, taxation system reform was introduced amid price raises, during which some people could not understand the 17 percent increment value-added tax and the consumer tax on some commodities. Some people availed themselves of the opportunity to increase commodity prices, even the prices of some overstocked products. Statistics revealed by an authoritative department indicate the civilian pressure: In January this year, the civilian cost of living throughout the country increased by 21.1 percent over the same period last year; in February it rose to 23.3 percent; the cost of living in 35 big cities increased by 25.9 percent. In particular, the prices of daily necessities and service charges increased very sharply. There are all kinds of indications that the civilian capacity to endure inflation has reached a critical point. If commodity price raises are not strictly controlled, economic relations will be distorted, the macroeconomic environment will become intense, and the overall situation of reform and opening up will be endangered. Chinese statesmen are absolutely sober-minded about this point. They do not deny inflation and have made up their minds to introduce control and regulation. At these ongoing NPC and CPPCC sessions, government leaders have, of course, focused on controlling excessive price increases. Li Peng said: Lifting control over prices does not mean giving up macrocontrol and regulation; prices must be controlled within the framework of the forbearance of civilians; in particular the "vegetable basket" issue regarding the urban and rural people must be properly resolved. Zhu Rongji said: Controlling prices and stabilizing markets are important tasks for governments at all levels. From now on, achievements in agricultural and vegetable basket issues should be taken as the main criteria for appraising governors, provincial party secretaries, and mayors. Li Lanqing said: If prices cannot be controlled, popular feelings and stability will be affected and reform cannot be carried on. Economic, legal, and administrative methods should be adopted to stabilize prices. Recently, the Chinese Government has repeatedly given orders demanding the clear pricing of commodities, the implementation of price checks, and strict supervision of the prices of daily necessities and service charges. These moves have initially stabilized popular feelings but whether or not they will help halt excessive price increases remains to be seen. The policy is good but needs to be put into effect. In Chinese society, which is experiencing the transformation from a planned economy into a market economy, from lower to higher income, and from closed to open operation, the large-scale introduction of reform and rapid economic growth will inevitably cause certain inflation. In this situation, the government must severely curb the practice of raising prices at will and strictly control the investment scale and consumption fund to fundamentally stop price hikes. On the civilians' part, they should spend their money reasonably, promptly report malpractices, and avoid panic buying -- this is a sensible choice. We should not turn pale at the mention of price raises because, if we do, we will not be able to control them. However, neither should we take the problem of price hikes lightly, otherwise it could affect and ruin reform and discourage the reformers. "China's agony" really exists but a new life will emerge after this agony.
