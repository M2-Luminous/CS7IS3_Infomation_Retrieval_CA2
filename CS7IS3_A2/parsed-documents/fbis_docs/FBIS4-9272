FBIS4-9272 "dreeu078__a94048" FBIS-EEU-94-078-A Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia New TA SR Director Melichercik Interviewed New TA SR Director Melichercik Interviewed AU2204105994 Prague CTK in English 0851 GMT 20 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2204105994 Prague CTK English BFN [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 20 (CTK) -- The change in the leadership of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA SR) was not caused by bad-quality work on the news desks but by the daily REPUBLIKA which it publishes, the new general director of TA SR Ivan Melichercik says in an interview for SME today. The role and character of a news agency was not compatible with the publication of a paper of this type, Melichercik said, adding that REPUBLIKA had no place on the agency's soil. Asked if he was considering the departure of the paper's editors from the TA SR building, he replied "I think they'll do it themselves." Former TA SR director Dusan Kleiman, who was dismissed yesterday by the Slovak Government, says in today's issue of REPUBLIKA that he considers his dismissal a "political, undemocratic act of administrative caprice." Kleiman attacks the government's decision, which he says came before he could appear in front of the Slovak National Council's Committee for Education, Science, and Culture. It shows that the government did not need facts and objective investigation of the paper's publishing to make its decision, Kleiman says, adding that the act of his dismissal was a politically motivated purge against the paper. SLOVENSKY DENNIK publishes a statement by Vladimir Miskovsky from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative which analyzes in detail the legal and economic aspects of REPUBLIKA. He says the weekly TREND pointed last May that in publishing REPUBLIKA the agency was breaching both the law and Finance Ministry decrees, but nonetheless the paper continued to appear. "It is the publication of REPUBLIKA above all which has caused the agency to owe Danubiaprint 18.5 million crowns, and analysis of the agency's economic results shows that under its current leadership the agency has had the worst results of all," Miskovsky says. REPUBLIKA organized a collection to improve its financial situation, but this cannot be carried out without permission from the Finance Ministry, which TA SR did not ask for. The unauthorized collection took place all over Slovakia, and therefore the publisher could receive a fine of up to 200,000 crowns ($6,600) from each area. Miskovsky also points out that although REPUBLIKA was evaluated at 10 million crowns ($300,000), Kleiman agreed on March 18 with the free transfer of the publishing rights to the then editor-in-chief of the paper, Jan Smolec. "It is worth noting that for ten days the agency managed the newspaper of a private person, without even informing its business partners of the transfer of publishing rights," Miskovsky said (the rights were transferred back ten days later). "If personnel changes take place in the leadership of TA SR, they cannot be called political purges but an attempt to find people for the top of the agency who would run it professionally," Miskovsky added.
