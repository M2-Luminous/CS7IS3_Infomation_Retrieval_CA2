FBIS4-9461 "dreeu080__a94030" FBIS-EEU-94-080-A Daily Report 26 April 1994 ANNEX Poland Suspension of Mining Decision, Strike Reported Suspension of Mining Decision, Strike Reported LD2304195194 Warsaw PAP in English 1754 GMT 23 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD2304195194 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, April 23 -- Industry Minister Marek Pol suspended on Friday night [22 April] his decision concerning the preparations for the restructuring of the brown coal mining sector and appealed to striking miners to end the strike and start negotiations immediately. The minister's decision of March 23, 1994 concerned the organization of work designed to set up holdings in the power engineering sector. Under the decision, the minister appoints commissioners for the organization of holdings, establishes task teams and defines their competences. The decision provides for the establishment of 3 holdings, namely, the Belchatow holding, the Konin-Adamow power engineering and fuel holding, and the regional Turow brown coal power engineering. The striking miners decided to continue their protest until the decision was annulled and not temporarily--as they describe it--suspended. Having in mind the existing threat to Poland's power engineering security, Minister Pol sent a letter to chairmen of the brown coal mining trade union organizations in which he informed them that he had suspended the decision. Pol told a press conference on Saturday that "if there were no breakdowns in power plants, on Saturday and Sunday there should not be any problems with supplies of energy for industry and individual customers." The minister added that there might be certain restrictions on Monday but the government would try to minimize their effects. The minister explained that the decision made on Friday to dismiss Deputy Industry Minister Eugeniusz Morawski was caused by the "improper implementation of the decision of March 23." Pol did not explain what mistakes Morawski had made and added the decision to dismiss him was taken by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. On Saturday afternoon, the striking miners sent a letter to Minister Pol in which they asked him to precisely define whether his decision was still binding. In their opinion, the suspension of the decision does not mean its annulment. The miners decided to continue the strike action. The government press office issued a communique on Saturday which said that the suspension of the decision was not accepted by the strike committee. In connection with this, the government press office was authorized to report that any further decisions by the industry minister concerning the issue were not possible without talks and exchange of views between the two sides. Minister Pol was ready to hold talks concerning industrial questions, the communique stressed, adding that other issues should be discussed with the Labour Ministry and the tripartite commission, the meeting of which would be held on April 29.
