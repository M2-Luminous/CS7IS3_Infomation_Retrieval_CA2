FR941216-1-00063 FR941216-1-00010 (ii) Eligibility for integration. Both Issue 1 and Issue 2 are qualifying debt instruments. Z has met the identification requirements by identifying Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument and Issue 2 as the ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. The other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under this section. (iii) Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. The synthetic debt instrument has an issue price of $1,000, provides for a payment at maturity of $2,000, and, in addition, provides for annual payments of $140, which are treated as qualified stated interest payments under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. The synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 (equal to $2,000 to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by the $1,000 received on the ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge). As a result, the synthetic debt instrument has no OID. The payment of $1,000 received by Z on the ยง1.1275&hyph;6 hedge on January 1, 1996, increases the synthetic debt instrument's adjusted issue price to $2,000 immediately after it is issued. (i) [Reserved] (j) Effective date. This section is effective for qualifying debt instruments issued on or after the date that is 60 days after final regulations are published in the Federal Register.
