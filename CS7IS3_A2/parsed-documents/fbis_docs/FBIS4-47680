FBIS4-47680 "drafr084_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 1 May South African Press Review for 1 May MB0105114794 MB0105114794 BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES IEC's `Monumental Incompetence' Viewed--"The elections were declared free and fair on Friday [29 April] by Mr Justice Kriegler...and his view was immediately endorsed by the leaders of the two main political parties, Mr F W de Klerk and Mr Mandela." So begins Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 1 May in a page-24 editorial. "However, in looking forward it is necessary to hold in mind the lessons of the monumental incompetence with which the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] conducted these elections. Those lessons, by no coincidence, confirm the message transmitted by the breakdown of the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. In both cases, we flirted with disaster. Both institutions sprang from a suspicion, more prevalent among political elites than among the people at large, that no institution of government can be trusted if it seems to represent the old regime. Behind the formation of the NPKF lay a naive belief that ill-trained and ill-disciplined irregulars could be welded in a matter of weeks into a professional army." "Similarly, the IEC was born of distrust of the Department of Home Affairs, the only institution in the country which -- with the backing of the SA Police and the SADF [South African Defense Force] -- might have conducted orderly, properly controlled elections. The attempt to create an `independent' substitute organisation, as it turned out, became more of a threat to the transition than a help." "As Mr de Klerk is fond of saying, we only have one SADF, one police force, and one civil service. We also have, more amorphously, only one business class. Whether the government of national unity is to have any hope of satisfying the reasonable expectations of the people who, in their millions, have given it a mandate, depends on these existing institutions. The callow socialist ideologues who surround Mr Mandela have had two vivid demonstrations of what happens when they, unlettered and inexperienced, try to `organise' and `plan' the life of the nation. They are incompetent to do so." BEELD National Election Victory Urged -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 25 April asks in a page-10 editorial: "Can our country's largest so-called liberation movement be given the mandate to govern the country for the next few years? Four years ago we would have given an unconditional no. Since then the ANC has changed in fundamental aspects. Policies and reasonable statements give one courage for the future. The negotiations also showed how sensible people could change radical views and find one another. But in other ways, unfortunately, the ANC remains unchanged. They remain in coalition with the South African Communist Party... and the virus of debilitating socialism thus remains part of the ANC." The National Party has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis and shown that it is representative of all groups in the country. "The values for which this changed party stands are those with which we can most easily identify. Its leader is a person of integrity and vision who helped create a new South Africa of justice and full participation. He deserves support in order for him to complete his task, and therefore we recommend him and his party," concludes BEELD. Bombers Cannot Stop Change--BEELD on 26 April says in a page-12 editorial that "those cowardly murderers who believe they can stop the approach of democracy in South Africa with their bombing campaign are busy unleashing a rage unknown among the vast majority of South Africans. It is a rage which totally counters what the bombers are trying to achieve. It is uniting South Africans across all barriers as seldom seen before against violence and bloodshed." "The bombings have cost valuable lives and caused extensive damage to property, and that cannot be tolerated." "One realizes that the security forces are stretched very thinly on the ground at present," but "the present situation demands drastic action. The country expects the same decisive action to be taken as was the case in the eighties when destabilization came from the other side of the political spectrum. Activists and instigators were rounded up then, regardless of who they were. The same medicine is needed now." CP Losing All Its Decent Leaders -- "The Conservative Party [CP] is systematically losing all the reasonable, decent people within its leadership," states a second editorial on the same page of the 26 April BEELD. "The latest are Messrs Driew Bruwer and Thomas Langley, who walked over to General Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] after they were reassured about the negotiations process through the accord signed at the weekend between the front, the government, and the ANC. This accord, which confirms the front's right to negotiate for a homeland, does not guarantee that it will be achieved. That will depend on the strength of the argument and its practicality." "The CP leaders trickling over to the FF are apparently only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the surface there is no doubt a much greater movement of reasonable people who wish to follow the decent path. All that will remain then will be the diehard CP members who are unable to negotiate anything for themselves."
