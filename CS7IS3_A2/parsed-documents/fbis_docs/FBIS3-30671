FBIS3-30671 "dreeu026__a94042" FBIS-EEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Cermak: ODS Turned Down Intelligence Offer AU0302173994 Prague CTK in English 1603 GMT 3 Feb 94 AU0302173994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague Feb 3 (CTK) -- Petr Cermak, deputy chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), said that in 1991 he met with employees of the Czechoslovak counterintelligence service about setting up an ODS intelligence service, but that he declined their services, MLADA FRONTA DNES writes today. Stanislav Devaty, director of the Czech Security and Information Service (BIS), told CTK today that he knew nothing about such an offer by counterintelligence service members to the ODS. Last summer, Cermak called reports that the ODS had tried to create its own intelligence service "absolute nonsense." "The ODS has no intelligence service," he said at that time, adding that the party had never made any effort to create one. Miroslav Macek, former ODS deputy chairman, told Czech Television last year that employees of the FBIS, the BIS' federal counterpart, proposed setting up a "mini-network" to protect the party from information leaks and to gather information on other political parties. Macek said he had rejected the offer. According to today's MLADA FRONTA DNES, FBIS employees had a similar project prepared for the Civic Democratic Alliance. All those who offered the services to the ODS left the FBIS in 1991 and 1992, the paper writes.
