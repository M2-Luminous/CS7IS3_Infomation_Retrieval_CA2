[Filatov] Well, this is a difficult question. You see, I think it is a ridiculous thing that a person finds out from the newspapers or radio that a decree has been signed on his dismissal or removal, so to speak. The procedural system had not worked properly in this instance. Unfortunately, things like this do happen time from time. [Voskoboynikov] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, said that Shakhray's plans were not always in line with Russia's real state interests. Nevertheless, President Yeltsin has decided to leave Shakhray in the position of Vice Premier. Why? [Filatov] Well, you know, Shakhray's activities have been beneficial. Since the creation of the Russian Federation we have seen the important work he has been carrying out in one or another sector he has headed. That is why I think these circumstances were probably taken into account. Of course, his work is beneficial to the government and it is most likely that this was behind the president's decision to keep Shakhray.
