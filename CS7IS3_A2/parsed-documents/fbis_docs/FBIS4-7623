Just as Prime Minister-designate Borislav Mikelic announced this information, a statement by the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina appeared, saying that its leader, Milan Babic, had postponed the negotiations on his participation in the Serbian Krajina government. This was the reason why we asked Borislav Mikelic, whom not even his biggest enemy can deny wisdom and above all flexibility in establishing contact with everyone, what had actually happened. In asking this question, we were primarily prompted by the fact that the war in the republic of Serbian Krajina is still going on, that companies have not worked for nearly three years, that 40,000 pensioners have not received their pensions for months, and that hundreds of children have lost their parents -- that is, that another hour should not be wasted in forming the government. This is another reason to listen to Mikelic's statement: [Begin Mikelic recording] I was of the opinion that we must carry out our task and form the government. I began from the premise that I had capable people for individual departments and not ministries, since it would be difficult to talk about ministries within the framework of the republic of Serbian Krajina at the moment. These ministries could perhaps be established only in three or four spheres; however, in other spheres this is not possible, bearing in mind the circumstances. Therefore, I am viewing the situation realistically. On the basis of this plan, I proposed to the SDS four mandates and that Mr. Babic be appointed deputy prime minister for international relations and for liaisons with the Serbs in diaspora, which I believe is a sphere that he could cover. In a sense, he would be the first deputy prime minister in the government led by myself. To the radicals, keeping in mind that they already have the chairman of the assembly, I offered another two mandates. In this second stage, I did not even take into consideration the parties and their size but was motivated by finding expert people -- that is, to draw into the government those who can cover certain expert fields, as well as what is feasible at this stage. Therefore, I made certain compromises here -- in some spheres even at the expense of quality -- with the aim of creating a government of national unity and to finally show those in the West, in Croatia, and others who are against the republic of Serbian Krajina that we can work together, that we -- Martic, Babic, Mikelic, Bjegovic, and all others who can in a way offer to the nation a little more than what has been offered so far -- will stick together. Thus, I held talks with the SDS and its president, Dr. Babic. In principle, he accepted my offer. I now hear that the SDS has issued a statement that they embrace the government of national unity, but based on the parity principle taking into consideration the number of parliamentary seats, and also that Babic has postponed his participation in the government. I view this as a SDS statement and not a statement by Milan Babic. If the SDS coordinated this with him, then Mr. Babic will probably inform me about it. For the time being though, I have not heard this from him -- that is, that he has postponed his participation. If he has postponed it and perhaps given up on this approach, then he could have done it only after our talks. This is my approach and if I will not be able to fulfill it, then I doubt that I could agree to be prime minister in a government that would reflect the parliament -- that is, a government in which the majority and minority parties would disagree on certain decisions and to have the party struggle transferred to the government. I would not want to head such a government. They will have to find someone else. I have agreed to offer my services and come to Knin for patriotic reasons. I am willing to work and help some people save [words indistinct] for the sake of Krajina's future. However, if someone wants to place party interests above national ones -- I believe that national interests are above the party's interests -- then the people should judge what is more correct right now -- what I have to offer or what the party leaders and some party clubs have to offer.
