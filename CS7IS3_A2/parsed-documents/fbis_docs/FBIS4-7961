Units of Izetbegovic's army are preparing to attack Grbavica, Vogosca, Ilidza, and other Serb-held districts of Sarajevo. High-ranking Muslim military officials and Izetbegovic's close aides have worked out a plan to attack Serb positions, encouraged by the fact that Serb units have no heavy weaponry in the area. They have been left without artillery and tanks and the Muslim leadership is aware of this, the Slovene daily stresses.
