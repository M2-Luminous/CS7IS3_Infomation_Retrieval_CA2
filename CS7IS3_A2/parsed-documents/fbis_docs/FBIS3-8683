"Such important visits must be consulted upon so that I am not taken by surprise," he added. The president said the prime minister is "independent and self-governing, but it would be easier if we agreed on such matters. I discuss all of my foreign trips with the Mnistry of Foreign Affairs, and we need more cooperation here so that we can achieve more," the president said. At the same time, Lech Walesa said that, according to information he has, Prime Minster Pawlak's visit "is among the issues that have been discussed. If new issues are raised and if the president is not consulted, the situation could be bad," he said.
