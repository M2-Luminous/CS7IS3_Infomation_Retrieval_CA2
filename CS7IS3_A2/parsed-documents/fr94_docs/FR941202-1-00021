SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') (Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1165 (September 19, 1980)) requires that each agency review every ten years each of its rules that has a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of the review is ``to determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded *␣*␣* to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities'' (5 USC 610(a)). The RFA stipulates the following specific considerations that must be addressed in the review of each rule: (1) The continued need for the rule; (2) the nature of complaints or comments received concerning the rule from the public; (3) the complexity of the rule; (4) the extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other Federal rules, and, to the extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules; and (5) the length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule (5 USC 610(c)).
