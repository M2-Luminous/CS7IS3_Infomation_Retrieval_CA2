Here is a report: After an exhaustive discussion on the current political situation in Croatia and Croatia's policy concerning efforts to establish a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all members of the presidency voiced their support for Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's present policy, in the spirit of the stands adopted at the second HDZ congress. For this reason, all misinformation about divisions within the HDZ leadership and about an alleged rift in the HDZ is malicious and false. Equally false is the speculation, carried by some media, that some high-ranking state officials, especially Messrs [Stipe] Mesic, [Josip] Manolic, and [Gojko] Susak have been replaced. The changes already made were carried out in line with HDZ policy. In addition, the spreading of misinformation about major changes in the interior and defense ministries, and claims that [Defense] Minister Susak is to be replaced by Franjo Greguric are especially harmful. The presidency heard a report about allegations that the president of the republic has called for the resignation of Assembly Chairman Stipe Mesic. The truth is that Stipe Mesic is on annual leave and will be spending some time abroad. The presidency made political assessments of some examples of opposition to the implementation of state policy, such as the unnecessary clash of views concerning foreign investments in Valpovo, which harmed Croatia's foreign relations, despite the repeated stand of the Croatian leadership encouraging foreign investments. A tribute was paid to Osijek municipality, the county's HDZ branch, the county leadership, and county prefect Branimir Glavas for their positive initiatives directed toward normalizing relations with the Serbian ethnic community and gradually introducing Croatian authorities in UN Protected Areas [UNPA]. By contrast, a statement issued by the Karlovac HDZ city committee on 12 January this year was assessed as harmful and unacceptable. The statement called on the remaining Croats to move out of UNPA's. However, the HDZ presidency maintains that it is the duty of all state and other institutions to help all Croats in every possible way to preserve their homes and stay there, while making efforts to normalize relations with Serbs in Croatian territory under UN protection as soon as possible. This policy has never been demagogical, but reflects the sincerity of the Croatian leadership in its consistent efforts to establish Croatia's full sovereignty in all territories of the Republic of Croatia. The presidency assessed that some opposition parties' moves and demands geared toward creating a constitutional crisis and early elections are clearly failing to contribute to the consolidation of Croatia's internal stability and international position. On the contrary, they are aimed at destabilizing the democratic system. Their purpose is to cause dissatisfaction and unrest among the people, encourage strikes, and, as they themselves admit, cooperate with a moderate faction within the HDZ in order to bring about a constitutional crisis and topple the authorities. All this should be viewed within the framework of opposition and foreign speculation about a need to look for acceptable successors in the Republic of Croatia and in other states created after the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. The HDZ presidency is consistent in its efforts to establish a law-governed state, protect human rights and press freedom. At the same time, it warns that some of the media are clearly working to destabilize the government using various methods, even inhumane and uncivilized ones. For instance, some media are publishing articles and manipulating the results of opinion polls in order to create a false picture of the public mood and a favorable climate for the destruction of the democratically-elected government. The presidency voiced its support for implementation of the government's stabilization program, which has been and remains the program of the HDZ. It will resolutely overcome resistance to the implementation of government decisions; this phenomenon is found at all levels of the old bureaucracy. The presidency urged a serious and consistent implementation and further elaboration of this program, as final success and the realization of Croatia's economic renaissance, as outlined in the president's address to the assembly last year, depend on this. All members of the presidency once again expressed their joint resolve to persevere in implementing HDZ policy under the leadership of President Franjo Tudjman. It is this that led to the establishment of the Croatian state and its international recognition. It will result in the full liberation of all Croatian territories, help bring about a just peace in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and secure the strategic interests of the Croatian state.
