An official from the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said that 2.139 million of the cadres studied in party schools at various levels or cadre-training institutes for over one month and 2.6 million attended different short-term training classes, while 1.232 million are still studying in party schools. They mainly studied the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and books on the socialist market economy and on modern science and technology. During the period from October last year to May this year, the CPC Central Committee held four theory symposiums, which were attended by 175 leading officials at provincial level. They discussed important issues related to China's socialist modernization drive. Special attention was paid to training young cadres. Nearly 800,000 young cadres have received various kinds of training in party schools at various levels. As a result, a swathe of personnel who know how to manage the market economy and are familiar with an export-oriented economy have been brought up. The CPC Central Committee has paid great attention to construction of cadre training centers. By 1993, there were 6,944 party schools and management institutes with over 109,000 specialized teachers.
