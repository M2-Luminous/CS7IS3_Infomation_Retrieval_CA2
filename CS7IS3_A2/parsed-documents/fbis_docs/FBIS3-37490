Urmas Loit provides the details. [Begin recording] [Loit] Foreign Minister Juri Luik, what was most important about this meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and your Baltic counterparts? [Luik] The most important aspect was evidently the symbolic side of things. British Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd met the Russian leadership 15 February and it was seen as necessary to inform us of these talks. The fact that we are seen as partners who are to be taken seriously, that it is necessary to inform us and discuss matters with us -- this is perhaps the most important aspect of the meeting. We discussed here, behind closed doors, also bilateral relations between the countries. We discussed integration into Europe and our membership in the European Union. Britain promised help with free- trade talks. We have small problems there with agriculture and textiles. Britain, as one of the most experienced supporters of free trade, promised to put in a word for us. You have heard here, Britain will be helping us to build our army and helping with the setting up of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. And so, we have discussed quite a number of bilateral and multipartite issues. [Loit] Obviously you also discussed the Baltic countries' relations with Russia. What is the British attitude to some of the contradictions here? [Luik] Well, Douglas Hurd emphasized in a very [word indistinct] manner that in talking about the Baltic countries we are talking about sovereign states who have full rights to decide whom they choose to be friends with and whom not, and whose army is on their territory and whose is not. Full support was given to our policy of [Russian] troop withdrawal. Douglas Hurd promised to keep a higher focus on this issue than hitherto in Britain, and so we had quite a constructive discussion about relations with Russia. [end recording]
