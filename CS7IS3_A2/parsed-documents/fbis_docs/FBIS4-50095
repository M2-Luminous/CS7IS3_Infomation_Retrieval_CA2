The project in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, where the country's number one automobile plant is located, marks a new wave of overseas investment in China's automotive industry. Just before this project, the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Corporation signed an agreement with Ford Motor Co. of the United States to produce interior decoration parts for cars. China is described as the world's largest potential auto market, as some 270 million families are estimated to be potential auto owners. Listed by China as one of the backbone industries, auto production is expected to hit three million vehicles a year by the end of the century, fueling demands for auto parts. As most of China's auto manufacturers started by assembling foreign parts, domestic part makers have to greatly reduce costs when China approaches its resumption of its status in GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). Joint production with foreign auto makers is an option or even a way out for some Chinese firms, experts say. According to an official from the Ministry of Machine-Building, most of the China's existing 116 auto makers are Sino-foreign joint ventures. He added that China will divert auto joint-ventures to auto parts production. He said China plans to establish 200 enterprises to build another 200 auto parts production plants within the century, and so Sino-foreign co-operation, he said, will be of vital importance. in light of the growing Chinese market, Ford of the United States set up a special department to deal with Chinese business this year. General Motors started a joint venture to make auto parts in Beijing this April and another two ventures are being discussed with Chinese partners in Henan and Shenyang. Similar Sino-foreign auto parts enterprises have also been established by companies from France and other countries.
