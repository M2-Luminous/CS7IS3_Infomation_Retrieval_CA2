FBIS4-11818 "drnes063_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 SYRIA Paper Views Christopher Statement on Mideast Tour Paper Views Christopher Statement on Mideast Tour JN3103100494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0545 GMT 31 Mar 94 JN3103100494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "Before It Is Too Late," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on developments in the peace process, and Israel's procrastination and maneuvering, which aim to create additional excuses for evading the requirements of peace and derail the peace process. The paper says: Now that there is renewed talk of the possible resumption of the peace talks, Israel has demonstrated an enthusiastic excitement about the peace process. While focusing its attention on the implementation of the Gaza- Jericho accord, which yielded countless advantages in its favor, Israel seeks to play games on the other tracks of the negotiations. Israel reaped the fruits of games with the Palestinians when it concluded the Oslo accord with them. This is because this accord contains serious and secret loopholes that allowed Israel to pounce upon the Palestinians, who departed from the overall inter-Arab coordination regarding the peace process. AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel is certain that it cannot ensnare any other Arab side by making it depart from the Arab consensus regarding the need to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. Nonetheless, it has continued to make desperate attempts in this regard. If anything, this policy indicates that Israel is not concerned with just, comprehensive, and durable peace. This is because such peace is the antithesis of the expansionist Israeli scheme and its Zionist objectives, which aim to achieve a version of peace that allows Israel to have peace, and, at the same time, retain its control over the territories. The paper adds that Israel is only interested in the benefits it can draw from the peace process, particularly since it has continued to evade any discussion of substantive issues in the bilateral talks, namely, the issues of occupation and withdrawal. Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The solution, as all observers believe, lies in activating the role of the United States as a full partner that should honor its pledges and commitments, particularly since it is the party that launched the peace initiative in the first place. Otherwise, the peace process will be jeopardized, and the region will remain vulnerable to worst case scenarios. Under the headline "Israel's Crimes Before the International Community," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has reiterated his willingness to make a fresh tour of the region to activate the peace process, without committing himself to a forceful role in efforts to address the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was no coincidence that Christopher's offer came in the aftermath of Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon and amidst the thunder of bullets that kill and wound scores of Palestinians of the occupied Arab territories every day. That is why he has absolved himself of any undertaking to play a forceful role. He is well aware that progress in the peace process is now contingent upon the Israeli stand, which seeks to obstruct the regional peace process. The paper believes that Israel aims to encircle the new peace opportunity that could be created if the peace talks are resumed in Washington. The paper notes that in addition to political maneuvering and foot-dragging, Israel has begun to carry out a series of successive massacres that started with the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This series of massacres is continuing. Israel is now covering up its massacres with fresh ones, as manifested in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast in Lebanon. AL-BA'TH adds: By so doing, the Rabin government seeks to distract those concerned with the peace process. It wants to prompt them to address the new problems it is creating. Nobody will be taken in by this policy, which has been stepped up recently, particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit. It is difficult for the Rabin government, regardless of the tactics it is employing, to influence the course of the peace negotiations, or to derail them. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: International efforts to advance the peace process and resume the Washington negotiations have become extremely necessary to end regional tension and halt the Israeli anti-Arab terrorism, repression, and massacres.
