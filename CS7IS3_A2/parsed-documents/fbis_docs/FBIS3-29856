The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will continue to support the muse analog HDTV system developed by public broadcaster Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Akimasa Egawa, director general at the ministry's Broadcasting Administration Bureau, told a press conference. But he added the general trend shows Japan's HDTV formats will eventually move toward a digital-based system. A final decision on the matter should be made after studying the interests of consumers, electronic makers and other parties concerned, with an eye toward the next century, he said. The consumer electronic industry was baffled by Egawa's remarks on Tuesday calling for a switch from the analog to a digital system in signal transmission for the next-generation television. The remarks, apparently designed to unify Japan's HDTV format with the global trend, came at a time when NHK is already offering HDTV broadcasting programs under an analog format named "hi-vision." Electronics makers have put enormous amounts of money into its development. Egawa's remarks drew fire from many sectors -- NHK, makers, retailers and consumers who have already purchased hi-vision televisions. Egawa said his remarks do not reflect what he really meant. The Posts Ministry will allow NHK to continue with experimental analog HDTV broadcasting in the future, he said. He said the ministry will promote hi-vision broadcasting using a broadcasting satellite set for launch next year, in line with a report prepared last year by the radio regulatory council, an advisory body to the posts and telecommunications minister. Hi-vision broadcasting will continue at least until 2007, the year when the satellite's life comes to an end, Egawa said. As for a switch to digitalization, he said the ministry will come up with some proposal by this summer.
