[passage omitted] At least, the ultimatum France wants its 15 NATO partners to issue is clear. It cannot be ignored or regarded as a dilatory measure: If it is approved by NATO and rejected by the Serbs, it will actually endanger UN soldiers in Bosnia, beginning with French troops. On the other hand, the United States, which -- hiding behind a convenient "understanding" of the position of Bosnian Muslims -- has so far refused to commit itself in the crisis, not even on a diplomatic level, may now be constrained to take a stand. In a phone conversation on Sunday [6 February], U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was reportedly rather surprised at the concrete nature of the French position. It is too early to tell whether this first reaction means that everybody is going to unite around the French proposal. Paris is intently awaiting the response of three other NATO members: the Greeks, who are pro-Serb; and the Canadians and British, who also have troops in Bosnia and have always opposed the use of force. A first indication of the Greek and British positions should come out of the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Union in Brussels starting on Monday. In the meantime, France does not intend to cease striving to achieve a negotiated settlement, that is, a partition of Bosnia. It expects that the ultimatum it wants to send to the Serbs will give more credibility to its efforts for a peaceful settlement by demonstrating that it wants the initial partition proposal to be revised in favor of Bosnia's Muslims. Paris also recognizes that pressure will have to be exerted on the Croats to make them grant the Muslims the access to the sea they have been demanding.
