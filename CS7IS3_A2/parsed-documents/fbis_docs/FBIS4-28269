[Tsutomu Hata] I have no intention of changing the present constitutional interpretation of security policy. Regarding the issue of collective right to self defense, for example, as long as Japan is a sovereign state, it is reasonable for Japan to have the collective right to self-defense according to international law. However, exercising the right to self defense as stipulated in Article 9 of the constitution (giving up war, not bearing arms, and rescinding the right to aggression) must be carried out within the limits of at least defending Japan. Since exercising collective self-defense exceeds this limit, the government thus concluded that from the standpoint of the constitution, it was not allowed. [Pae] What is Japan's basic position on its international role? [Hata] Currently, Japan has emerged as a country exercising great influence in international society. To establish a new peace order, it is inevitable for Japan to carry out its role and responsibilities commensurate with it. From this point of view, I feel that Japan must carry out various international contributions such as making efforts to solve environmental issues, resolving regional disputes, managing arms, promoting disarmament, and taking part in UN peacekeeping activities. Furthermore, we must also carry out sufficient organizational work to successfully accomplish these works. [Pae] What is the basic position of Japan's diplomacy toward the ROK? [Hata] Promoting friendly relations with the ROK is one of the most important pillars of Japan's diplomatic policy. To further develop ROK-Japan relations under this kind of understanding, I believe that it is important to establish a future-oriented relationship by facing the facts of history. To achieve this, exchange among figures from various circles of both countries must be promoted so as to enhance mutual understanding and promote cooperation in the international society. [Pae] How do you plan on concluding the issues related to our past? [Hata] We must newly recognize that our country's past act of aggression and colonial rule brought about great suffering and unhappiness to the people and convey this to our next generations. We must deeply reflect on the past, and I hope that based on this, we will be able to create peace and build a bright future in the Asia-Pacific region. The issue concerning the right to claim assets between our peoples and countries was completely and ultimately resolved through the economic cooperation agreement on the right to claims. However, in consideration of the character of the issue, the comfort women issue is currently being examined for achieving the quickest solution to this issue. [Pae] What is Japan's position regarding U.S.-Japan relations? [Hata] U.S.-Japan relations are most important for both countries. The two countries have played a core role in securing peace and prosperity in the world since the end of the Cold War. From the political and security point of view, we will continue to adhere to the U.S.-Japan security treaty based on the U.S.-Japan allied relationship and make further efforts to operate it more smoothly. In coordinating various important diplomatic issues including the issue of developing nuclear weapons by North Korea, and issues in the Asia-Pacific region, we will work to closely exchange views. We will carry out courageous economic reform with sovereignty in expanding the opening of the market and significantly curtailing the current account surplus.
