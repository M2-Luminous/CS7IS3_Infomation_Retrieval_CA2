A leaflet distributed in Gaza warned that the group's military wing, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, has "decided to hit at settlers so they can get a taste of death and leave our land." "The 'Afula operation is only a beginning," it said. A Hamas suicide bomber last Wednesday blew up a bus in 'Afula. A day after the bombing, Hamas threatened to fire rockets at Israeli homes and said the attack was the first of five to come on Israeli targets. Meanwhile, the body of a Palestinian man with a bullet hole in his head was dumped in the street in Gaza City. Palestinian sources said he had been executed by Hamas for collaborating with Israeli authorities.
