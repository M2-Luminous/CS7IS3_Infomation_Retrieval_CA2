Assistant Regional Health Director Jose Rodriguez said the health department's disease surveillance center reported 28 confirmed cases of typhoid fever admitted in at least six hospitals in the city. Of the 28 confirmed cases, 11 are from Cebu City, eight from Lapulapu City, four from Mandaue City, one from Toledo City, and two each from Liloan and Talisay towns. As this developed, Rodriguez said they have sent an epidemiological team to Cordova in Mactan Island to check reports that 18 people are suspected to have been afflicted by typhoid fever. Rodriguez said that the number of typhoid cases for the period from January to middle of February is very much higher than that recorded for the same period last year. Typhoid fever is caused by the fever-causing bacteria called "Salmonella typhi." Its symptoms, aside from fever, include headaches and abdominal pains. Rodriguez said typhoid fever is dangerous in that, if not immediately detected and cured, could lead to the rupture of the intestines. Regional Health Director Consuelo Aranas signed directives asking health officers in every city and municipality in the region to monitor the situation and conduct epidemiological investigation.
