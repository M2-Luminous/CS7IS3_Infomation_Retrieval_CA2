Khergamvala] [Text] Manama (Bahrain), Jan. 25--On a day when the Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, was talking about jugular veins, iron curtains and preconditions, India's visiting Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, got emphatic support from two Gulf regimes for a strict bilateral approach to resolving the Kashmir dispute. In Kuwait and in Bahrain where Mr. Bhatia met the top echelons of the leadership the hosts made two points, in addition to the routine but important message about the contribution of the Indian community to development in these places. One, that they are glad that talks between India and Pakistan have been resumed and next, that these must continue if a solution is to be found. Noteworthy: Lest this sounds like a daily exhortation coming from one part of the world or the other to India and Pakistan, a specific nuance that injected itself into these views from top Gulf leaders is noteworthy, especially because this is the first time it has been made. In Kuwait, sources say the term avoidance of "internationalisation" of the resolution mechanism was used. However internationalised the dispute already is, this usage was music to Indian official ears, especially after unfounded rumours that Kuwait had joined Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and the United Arab Emirates in agreeing to sponsor a resolution against India on human rights violations. Officials from both sides declined to identify the specific Kuwait leader who used the term. The inference could be drawn that it was either the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jabir or the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, Sheikh Sa'd. Bahrain chose to make the same point using another logic. Bahraini officials point to their own live dispute with Qatar over the ownership of some islands and the maritime boundary. Qatar has taken the dispute unilaterally to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) but Bahrain has challenged in the first instance, the right of Qatar to go to the ICJ unilaterally. The message conveyed to Mr. Bhatia was that only direct disputants can find the appropriate avenue to resolving a problem. It need hardly be emphasised that especially in this region the events surrounding the broader Arab-Israeli dispute are being shaped through direct bilateral channels between Israel on the one hand and the other Arab parties on the other. Published announcement: It would be a mistake to interpret the stands of Kuwait and Bahrain as being supportive of India on Kashmir but India should be gratified that the approach advocated by it had found an echo and been explained through the logic of the circumstances in which these regimes find themselves and the broader trends in the region. Bahrain and Kuwait had one other stated and published announcement. This time for the ears of the Pakistan opposition leader, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, and the "Prime Minister of Azad Kashmir." Both of them have been shouting themselves hoarse about sanctions against India by the Gulf. On the day Mr. Bhatia arrived in Kuwait Mr. Sharif appealed to the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) to call for sanctions against India. Two facts respond to these appeals. One, made in Kuwait and Bahrain about the contribution of the disciplined Indian community and, another in the 1993 annual trade figures just published by Bahrain. Imports from India increased by 20 percent to $87.5 millions and exports to India nearly doubled to $56 millions. Pakistan bought only $8.5 millions worth of goods from Bahrain and does not figure on the list of major sources of exports. Also for Mr. Sharif's information is the fact that in Saudi Arabia the number of Indians working has jumped to a million. The Amir of Kuwait's visit to India is being scheduled. Iran's Speaker is to visit India. The Saudis have just nominated an Ambassador to India and positioned a military attache recently in New Delhi. Investments: In comments to newspersons Mr. Bhatia by and large gave an economic-cum-investments spin to the "goodwill" visit. Considering that India does not even know about Kuwait's offset investments programme which could bring money into India, if there was one aspect that Mr. Bhatia did not discuss, it was investments. Both Gulf countries agreed to send chamber of commerce delegations, which is not saying very much. Bahrain also agreed to hold its joint committee meeting with India in four months. Mr. Bhatia's mission, timed and designed to preempt Pakistan gaining an advantage in these countries seemed to suffer from an old rigid syndrome. Gulf countries have changed. There are consultative or elected assemblies. Though Mr. Bhatia did meet the rulers and other top leaders as well as the Speaker of the Kuwaiti Assembly, the effort next time should be on speaking to politicians on various Assembly committees. The one dominant issue in the assemblies is the subject of manpower imports and human rights in countries with Muslim minorities, both of very direct concern to India.
