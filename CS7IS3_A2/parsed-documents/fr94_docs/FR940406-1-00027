FR940406-1-00027 FR940406-1-00008 III. Implications of This Action The EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision submitted by Colorado for the Lamar nonattainment area on May 27, 1993 to satisfy those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991. Among other things, the State of Colorado has adequately demonstrated that the Lamar moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates. The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate. IV. Request for Public Comments The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider any comments received by May 6, 1994. V. Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. VI. Regulatory Flexibility Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq ., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410(a)(2). Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
