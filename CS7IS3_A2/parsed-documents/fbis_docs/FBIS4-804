Many people continue to die under the hands of the Presidential Guards, the MRND-CDR [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] youth wingers and some elements of the Rwanda Army. So far the death toll is exceeding 26,000 people. Yesterday, reports said that Dr. Theoneste Gefaranga was murdered in his hiding place. Dr. Gafaranga was the second vice president in the PSD [Social Democratic Party]. In Commune Rukira, about 800 people were found by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] soldiers locked in one place since the death of President Habyarimana. Some had died, and others were badly injured due to grenades that were thrown at them regularly. Others were dying of hunger. Those who were survived were rescued by the RPF troops. Reports say that the road from Kigali to Gitarama is ringed by dead bodies and starving refugees. The government is using trucks to clear the bodies. Another incident took place at the Zaire Embassy in Kigali, where 22 people were killed. Some of these people could have been Zaire nationals. And, in another turn of events, people in Commune Bicyumbi [Kigali Prefecture] have started defending themselves against the killers. They use traditional weapons like spears, bows and arrows, and pangas. Meanwhile, the Belgian foreign minister expressed fear that all the Belgians remaining in Rwanda were in imminent danger. He had information that the Rwanda Government soldiers had plans to kill Belgian soldiers who were part of the UN mission in Rwanda. Yesterday 440 Belgian soldiers were still stranded at the Kigali Airport. The foreign minister, Mr. Willy Claes, continuously appealed to his government to do all possible to evacuate them.
