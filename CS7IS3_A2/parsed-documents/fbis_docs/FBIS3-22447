The convention contains provisions on the banning, supervision, and monitoring of exports and transportation. An Environment Committee hearing held behind closed doors on 2 February discussed issues relating to the export and disposal of hazardous waste and Federal Government bills on the subject. Bayer AG and the federal Hazardous Waste Management and German Disposal Industry associations raised constitutional objections to a "consumer-oriented [as published] liability fund at federal level" proposed by the Bundesrat and other bodies. A solidarity fund of this type would only make sense, the Hazardous Waste Management Association claimed, if all the economic sectors involved in export procedures were cited as potential culprits. The best method of avoiding illegal exports remained monitoring by the laender. The Disposal Industry Association maintained that before founding a "waste recovery solidarity fund," it should first be established whether a liability incumbent in principle on the state could be replaced by a fund financed by industry. According to the Basel Convention and the European regulation on transportation, "subsidiary state liability" applied to illegal exports. Such a fund would be conceivable only in the form of an organization under civil law that all waste transporters could join, like the "Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation Fund." It would have to be possible to sue illegal traders, but the fund should not have to pay for "exports determined at the political level." Bayer considered a fund arrangement "unfair," because legal waste conveyers would be accepting joint liability for illegal waste exporters, and it would contradict the principle embodied in the European waste directive whereby the culprit had to pay. North Rhine-Westphalia's Environment Ministry and the Greenpeace environmental organization, on the other hand, would welcome a culprit-oriented liability arrangement. The Environment Ministry spoke out in no uncertain terms against costs being borne out of public funds in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and in favor of risk distribution with costs shared by the waste management sector. This, it said, seemed reasonable, as it would enhance the waste disposal operators' sense of responsibility. Greenpeace basically welcomed the introduction of a fund, although a solution that obliged each of the 16 federal laender to set up an individual fund and laid responsibility on the land where the waste came from as unrealistic and unfair. This would place the Hanseatic cities, the laender with a North Sea seaboard, and the eastern federal laender at a distinct disadvantage and overburden them. The organization also pressed for a comprehensive export ban, especially to developing countries.
