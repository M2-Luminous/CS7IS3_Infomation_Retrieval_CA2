France, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Denmark announced in mid-December that they would set up diplomatic ties with Macedonia. Claes told a news conference here, "Belgium will follow this example as soon as its presidency of the European Union ends." Greece will succeed Belgium as six-month president of the 12-nation European Community on January 1, to be followed by Germany on July 1. Athens has criticized its EC partners for establishing diplomatic relations with its northern neighbor which it insists must change its name before it should be recognized. Greece has a northern region also named Macedonia and says it fears the former Yugoslav republic may have territorial claims on the region.
