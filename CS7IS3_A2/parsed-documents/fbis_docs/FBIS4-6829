After Cho Song-tae, director of the Policy Planning Division of the Ministry, explained the truth regarding the report on the purchase of weapons, the Defense Ministry distributed to the press an official written explanation expressing its position and asked the press to support the present ROK-U.S. cooperative system, stressing the importance of the system. The Defense Ministry made it clear that both countries' ministers did not discuss the purchase of Apache helicopters, Patriot missiles, and other latest U.S. weapons during their recent talks. The Ministry reported: In an effort to improve its capability to cope with an unexpected situation in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, our military has partially modified the arms procurement program in the Yulgok Five-Year Plan to adjust the timing for the purchase of weapons, placing more emphasis on building up our antiartillery and night battle ability. However, this has no relation to the recent ROK-U.S. talks. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae explained the result of the recent talks to reporters in the press room of the Defense Ministry and said that there was no discussion on the purchase of weapons at the 20 April talks. Prior to this, in a news conference with domestic and foreign reporters at the Shilla Hotel on 21 April, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry also said that he and Minister Yi did not discuss selling U.S. weapons to the ROK.
