Vyacheslav Shirokiy, our correspondent, reports: [Shirokiy] Chita communications workers have finally carried out their threat. Having found themselves practically isolated today they decided to stand firm till the end. The point is that Viktor Malakiyev, head of the local territorial radio broadcasting center, received a telegram from the Communications Ministry to the effect that as a result of talks, an accord was reached with the government on a stage-by-stage repayment of all the existing debts. However, the Transbaykal communications workers could not be satisfied with this kind of response -- all too often in the recent past they received similar promises that usually remained nothing more than just so many hollow gestures. Currently, and due to the fact that the TV and radio company has failed to pay its debts to the communications workers, they owe almost 1 billion rubles to the Transbaykal power engineering people alone and they, in turn, constantly threaten to pull the plugs at the main relay stations in Chita Oblast. There have already been several instances of this kind, when the radio fell silent in the eastern Transbaykal area for more than 24 hours at a time. Today, too, almost 2 million Transbaykal people are left without up-to-date information about events taking place in the country. In his short interview for Radio Rossii, Viktor Malakiyev, the head of the territorial Radio Broadcasting and Communications Center, noted that we all became hostages of the economic chaos caused by the government itself that prevaricated till the last moment with the financing for the country's TV and radio companies, and that never bothered to repay the existing debts in good time, end of quote. Whatever the merits of this case are, people in Chita Oblast now understand that the present stoppage in TV and radio broadcasts being put out represents the first and a completely real step toward destroying the country's unified information space. One would like to believe that the government will, at long last, reach the same conclusion.
