FR941004-0-00008 FR941004-0-00003 In response to a comment, the final regulations clarify that an owner of an interest in an entity may not treat as separate activities the activities grouped together by the entity. However, if the activities are not grouped together by the entity, an owner of that entity may group the activities together so long as the grouping is appropriate under the general rules for grouping activities. The final regulations also clarify the Commissioner's regrouping authority. Under the final regulations, the Commissioner may regroup a taxpayer's activities if any of the activities resulting from the taxpayer's grouping is not an appropriate economic unit and a principal purpose of the taxpayer's grouping is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469. If the Commissioner can show that the effect of a taxpayer's grouping is the circumvention of the underlying purposes of section 469, this will be evidence, sufficient in certain cases, of a principal purpose of the grouping. It is expected, however, that the Commissioner's regrouping authority will be exercised infrequently. Tax practitioners have also inquired concerning the circumstances in which suspended losses will be allowed on the disposition of part of an activity. The final regulations modify the rule in the proposed regulations to provide that the rule allowing suspended losses on partial dispositions applies only to dispositions of substantially all of an activity. However, the effective date of the final regulations provides transitional rules that allow taxpayers to use the rules provided in the proposed regulations for taxable years beginning before October 4, 1994. Several comments requested guidance on when activities grouped in accordance with the rules in the temporary regulations must be regrouped under the final regulations. In accordance with the effective date provisions, taxpayers that grouped their activities under the rules in the temporary regulations must regroup their activities if their activities are not appropriate economic units under these regulations. The effective date and transition rules reflect this clarification. These regulations do not address the grouping of rental real estate activities by taxpayers subject to section 469(c)(7), as enacted by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. III. Effective Dates In general, these regulations are effective for taxable years ending after May 10, 1992. However, for taxable years in which these regulations apply and that begin before October 4, 1994, a taxpayer may determine its tax liability in accordance with proposed §1.469&hyph;4 published at 1992&hyph;1 C.B. 1219. For taxable years ending on or before May 10, 1992, taxpayers must apply the rules of §1.469&hyph;4T. For the taxable year that includes May 10, 1992, taxpayers may choose to apply the rules in §1.469&hyph;4T, rather than the rules in these regulations. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal authors of these regulations are Ronald M. Gootzeit and William M. Kostak, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
