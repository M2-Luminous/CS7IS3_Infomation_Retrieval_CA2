The process of "integration" of the world economy will be a long-term one, but we can clearly see that competition in international commodity market is increasingly fierce, and that the situation for superior commodities to win out and inferior ones to be eliminated through competition is extremely clear. This is one of the important characteristics after the Cold War. High-quality and inexpensive commodities carry all before them, and low quality, high cost, low technological content, and low added-value commodities gradually retreat from the market. This is an inevitable outcome of the function of objective economic laws that admit of no sentiment. Any people or country that wants to occupy a place in the market full of fierce competition, especially those who want to occupy a larger share, must realize, understand, and control such a law. From an economic point of view, such a law is objective and impartial. This is the genuine force behind international market competition--comparative advantage. Out of consideration of "being prepared for danger in times of peace", theoretical and academic circles are now discussing the strategy for foreign trade development in the 1990's. No doubt this is extremely far-sighted. The author believes that only by studying this question at several levels can we draw a correct conclusion. I. Study Practical Problems by Integrating Theory With Practice We must first see clearly that foreign trade has entered a new stage either in the world or in China. The characteristics of the new stage are: Machinery and electronics products are highly technological, and consumer goods are high-grade. Intellectual property, visible, invisible, and service trades are all included in the large context of foreign trade. Foreign trade in its original sense can no longer cover the current foreign trade activities. The sphere of study of foreign trade has obviously been enlarged, and relations between various forms of foreign trade have become one of the focal points of study. Second is the integration of foreign economic relations with foreign trade. It is very difficult to separate so-called pure foreign economic relations from pure foreign trade. Under many circumstances, foreign trade export is no longer the material export of commodities. It may possibly be invisible export of funds, technology, and labor, that is to say, production centers have been moved to sales markets. China's attraction to foreign investments lies in the huge sales market. China's foreign economic and technological assistance is of such a nature, but it is a pity that it has never been consciously linked with foreign trade, or they have even been seriously separated. The state encourages, through policies, close integration of the two, which is a big step forward under reform. We can already feel the economic performance brought about by such integration. Third is foreign trade legislation and policy guidance. When we have the above basic understanding, it does not mean that foreign trade work will certainly succeed. We must have a whole set of legislation for standardization and a whole set of policies for guidance, encouragement, or restraint. Here in the first place is the basic legislation adopted by the National People's Congress--the "Foreign Trade Law" and related laws enacted on anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The second line is industrial policies, and country and regional policies. The most important goal of foreign trade legislation, of course, is to standardize the operational behavior of foreign trade operators, so that foreign trade will develop healthily according to legal regulations. Foreign trade legislation is also an important means for ensuring and safeguarding China's interests after resumption of GATT status. Primary level [zu fu ji 4371 3637 4787] basic legislation is all the more a powerful weapon in trade negotiations. A task of top priority is to speed up legislation, so that there are laws to abide by for the cause of vigorously developing foreign trade. Industrial policy is the basis of foreign trade policy and the latter is an extension of the former. It is not difficult for western countries to understand such a logic. This is because their economies have always been export-oriented, their domestic markets and foreign markets have been linked together since World War II, and their industrial policies have taken into account the needs of both domestic and foreign markets. In China, the system of planned economy had been carried out for years, domestic and foreign markets were seriously separated, and even the international market was artificially divided into so-called "two parallel world markets." This made China's industrial policies mainly emphasize domestic needs, with a small amount of exports to the Soviet Union and East European countries, without being able to go beyond the big circle. This has resulted in the fact that the technological level of China's products has lagged behind that of the world's advanced level for a long time, that China's export products are not up to grade, and that China can neither make full use of two markets nor two kinds of resources, leading to the situation of relying for years on a small number of products for foreign exchange earnings. China has taken a big step forward, we should say, toward a unified international market in recent years, but there is still quite a long way to go. It seems that it is necessary to join tracks finally with the international market and take part in a unified international market by "resumption of GATT status." Fourth, big powers have become increasingly dependent on foreign economic relations and trade. For years in the past, there existed a view in international economic circles that foreign trade was not so important for big powers, but very important for small and island countries deficient of resources. Therefore, for them there is no question of the validity of the slogan "to build the country by trade," rather it is a tenet they must try to pursue. This has been confirmed by the fantastic achievements of Japan, the Asian "four small dragons", and even Switzerland, among other places. Modern developments have shown that this point of view has the defect of being biased. The extent of big power dependence on foreign trade is ever intensified, which is even linked to social stability and employment. The establishment of GATT and many rounds of trade negotiations have indicated the importance attached by various countries to foreign trade. The proportion of foreign trade in the GNP of various countries is gradually going up. Such a trend becomes more obvious in the process of integration of the world economy. Moreover, trade between big powers (including blocs) is in fact playing the role of a locomotive in bringing along the development of the world economy. This is dominated by a fundamental economic law--developed economies, in particular, rapidly developing economies, need big markets, and they want to break through national boundaries and enter broader areas of activities; conversely, opportunities provided by the international market in turn promote the development of their own economy. The reality of China's economy is an example. Fifth, commodity production is the crux. The front part of foreign trade is production, and the back is consumption. Foreign trade is circulation. Foreign economic and technological cooperation integrates the production process directly with foreign trade. What we emphasize is commodities, and not production under the circumstances of self-sufficient natural economy. Such production formation exists in regions where a commodity economy is undeveloped, and it can only be regarded as reproduction. The commodity economy we are talking about is large production under the circumstances of a market economy. The products turned out are not for our own consumption, but for meeting the market needs. Such production is precisely the basis of foreign trade. Now the problem we must solve is that China's production enterprises are not simply to meet the needs of domestic markets, but of both domestic and foreign markets, which is the goal of our work. This puts forth high requirements on the quality of commodities. I have always maintained the carrying out at home and abroad of a unified quality standard, and we cannot support foreign trade development by a "special faovrs" [xiao zao 1420 3501] method. There is no developed foreign trade without highly developed commodity production. Sixth, the level of merchandizing is an important factor of foreign trade. A conceptual error to which ordinary people are easily subject is that general production is regarded as commodity production, and commodity production is mistaken for highly merchandized production. So-called merchandizing refers to intrinsic quality, production technology, mode of production, exterior design, packaging, stable quality, and unified specifications. Without quality, there is no commodity production, and without quantitative scale, there can't be commodity production either. Seventh, trades which render services to foreign trade require major development. After the founding of new China, we have built on a preliminary basis trades that render services to foreign trade. After forty years of development, they have attained an initial scale, but there is still a gap in what is required. The building of wharves and ports, the capacity of land and sea transportation, and the means to promote exports, such as banking and insurance, are still far from meeting the objective needs of foreign trade development. Among them banking support in particular still lags behind need and is a bottleneck that restrains foreign trade exports, directly hampering the growth of export trade. II. Discover, Safeguard, and Create Comparative Advantages If we review the history of international trade, particularly the history of various countries in "building the country by trade," we discover some common characteristics. These include: A long-term development strategy, necessary legislation by the state, a whole set of supportive policies, correct industrial guidance, and high quality commodity production that meets the needs of both domestic and foreign markets. These are the keys to realizing the strategy for foreign trade development, and other means are factors that ensure the realization of strategic principles. Now the problem is how to organize and put into effect high quality and high grade commodity production. The author believes that to discover and create comparative advantages is the key to solving such a problem. There are always some advantages for a country or a region in commodity production. The responsibility of operators is to be good at discovering and catching hold of these advantages and making full use of them. These advantages may be expressed in relatively cheap labor, inexpensive raw materials, or highly efficient production. Overall performance requires low production costs and strong market competitive power. We have repeatedly seen in practice that comparative advantages change and move. If we cannot consciously safeguard advantages, they slip away unconsciously. This is a problem to which policymakers and operators should pay attention at all times. Therefore, to safeguard comparative advantage is also a continuous process of improvement and enhancement. China is a country with a large population, vast territory, and rich resources, which objectively provide advantages for China to develop commodity production, and China has ample conditions to give play to these comparative advantages. The key is to understand and distinguish where the advantages are after all and to set correct policies. China has a clear labor advantage, and this advantage has been and is being brought into play. Since reform and opening up, the reason investors from outside China have kept pouring in is that they set store by China's cheap labor and the huge potential market. Labor intensive commodities with a ready market have developed at high speed within a short period of time. There has been a certain degree of blindness, and there have appeared chaotic phenomena of repeated importation, but it is an indisputable fact that the export of toys, TV sets, clothing, home electrical appliances, tape-recorders, audio-visual equipment which has been growing by leaps and bounds for years soon presents a scene of prosperity. Moreover, inaccessibility of market information in China and the phenomenon of production divorced from marketing instantly become things of the past. The general slogan of market economy "basing production on sales prospects" soon became a reality. China has become a big power in export trade in the sphere of these commodities. Though not the only country attaining excellence, China has become a decisive market force. China-made toys occupy one-third, and shoes, socks, and stockings one-fourth of the U.S. market. We have to admit that these are fantastic achievements. There is a fact which is often neglected here: The introduction of labor intensive commodities has promoted rapid development of industry as a whole at home, and organization, management, and sales channels have entered a new stage. It is difficult to overestimate the significance of this example which is more significant to a certain extent. The comparative advantage of labor has indeed brought the greatest benefit to economic performance in China. China's textile export, especially of clothing, occupies an important place in export trade, taking up almost over one-fourth of total export volume. This is the direct outcome of China's making full use of the comparative advantage of cheap labor. We should not only continue giving play to this advantage, but should also raise it to a higher level--a new stage of high technological content, high added-value, and high efficiency. However, we must face up to the problem that with the building of a market economy, the raising of the standard of the people, and prices rise, the cost of labor will also go up. In recent years the export of yarn and cloth as raw materials has met with difficulties. Beside other reasons, increases in the cost of labor and delays in the heightening of labor productivity are important reasons. Therefore, to continue giving play to comparative advantage, we must raise the grade of products, and speedily heighten labor productivity. If we still cannot achieve the goal after making efforts, then there is only one choice: Let this comparative advantage slip away, turn over a new leaf, and explore other advantages. This is an objective economic law which cannot be controlled subjectively. Traditionally, another of china's comparative advantages is abundant raw materials and low prices. But from the point of view of market, this advantage is quite fragile. Due to climate, supply and demand, and cost, prices may rise or fall. China's present situation is that after an end to pricing policies which have been manipulated for years, prices of raw materials generally have gone up, thus gradually reducing the role of this advantage. The cruel reality with which we are faced at present is how to safeguard the original comparative advantages and how to create new comparative advantages. Advantages can be created, and such creations are involve fierce competition. This is a road developed countries have down already. Only through concerted efforts on the part of the government (through policies), production departments, and foreign trade management departments can the creation of new advantages be completed. Now the situation is that the government has worked out a number of policies for encouraging exports and foreign trade management departments have take great initiatives. The most important thing is that production departments must understand that the survival of an enterprise rest in its rising head and shoulders above others in competition in both domestic and foreign markets and that the core of competition is human resources and technology. Only when this problem is overcome can production be upgraded, commodities of high technological content and best quality produced, and comparative advantages created. Therefore, the present policy should mainly be to pay attention to the production of commodities which are of high quality and high technological content. I believe that machinery and electronics products in a broad sense and complete sets of equipment have potential. Agriculture that earns foreign exchange, audio-visual equipment, high-grade clothing, high-grade shoes, socks, and stockings, and even low cost consumer goods subject to wear and tear are still areas that China should strive to develop continuously. III. Financial Support Is the Motive Force for Major Foreign Trade Development If we make a comprehensive survey of the history of the world's foreign trade development, we can discover that foreign trade is the natural outcome of economic development and progress, and that it in turn also promotes the development of the economy. The history of World War I and World War II all the more explains that when the economy of some countries develops to a certain degree, their need for world market can get to such an extent as to unleash war at all costs to redivide the world market. The history of the world's foreign trade development has also proved another fact: To promote export, the state always introduces a number of policies to "encourage export and restrict import" to support foreign trade, of which most commonly seen are tax policy and financial policy, complemented by non-trade administrative means. For decades when the planned economy was carried out, China exercised a system of control over foreign trade and plans were centers. With plans, everything is set, and foreign trade was supported by various fields. Under the environment of the time when the economy was not quite developed, plans did play their proper role. Today, we are carrying out the system of a socialist market economy, and markets becomes the subject of economic life. Obviously, the original foreign trade system must change with changes in the economic system. The characteristics of such changes are abandoning the original management method of mandatory plans, using necessary administrative means to promote the building of market mechanisms, and standardizing foreign trade activities according to law on the basis of a number of legal regulations. So- called economic law consists, in the first place, of the law of supply and demand, the law of competition, and the law of superior things winning out and inferior ones being eliminated through competition. It requires investment to take the road of stepping up the strength of competition, carrying out technological transformation, and turning out upgraded products. With foreign trade developed to the present stage, the sharpest problem which arises is the integration of foreign trade with financial capital; in a certain sense, this is also the natural extension of integration of industry with financial capital. Unfortunately we have been a little late to understand this a law, which has affected the growth rate of China's exports and delays the renovation of China's export product mix. Agricultural, sideline, native, and special products that contend in the domestic market for sources of goods have long been China's major export commodities. Conversely, products of low production cost and high technological content hardly developed their strength for a long time. If we compare ourselves with South Korea, one of the "four small dragons", it forms a striking contrast. It took a very short time for it to change from the primary export stage to a high-level export stage, and the export of its technological products, especially automobiles, gave it an advantage within a short period of time, making it a major export force. Even such competitive opponents as Japan also cry out in alarm: "Terrific!" One may well say that a Chinese import-export bank should be set up and emerge as the times require. Although some people describe it as "it comes out at long last after thousands of calls," but it is born after all! It would undoubtedly increase the potential for the developing cause of China's foreign trade. IV. Make Full Use of the Opportunity Brought by the "Resumption of GATT" Status, and Build Up the Concept of a Big Unified Market In modern world economic development, Karl Marx's thesis that markets have no national boundaries has been repeatedly proved to be absolutely correct, and contemporary developments have further testified to the existence of this law. People have been compelled to take consciously or unconsciously various measures to promote the realization of a big unified market. The European Economic Community, the North America Free Trade Zone, and various proposed regional trade blocs do not just make no distinction between national boundaries, but also want to achieve a high degree of unification. As an outcome of the Uruguay Round talks, the world trade organization is a new attempt at these efforts. China's point of view of building up a big unified market is related to traditional domestic and foreign markets. In fact, with China's resumption of GATT status, we must write a full stop, or put an end to our traditional concepts. By then, we must take the world as the stage in commodity production and sales markets. If we work efficiently, it will pave the way for China to move toward world markets; if we are not self-conscious, and our measures are not efficient, it may lead to practice being in position and concepts not being in position with a resulting lack of vitality in the face of a vast big world market. We may be open in the domestic market, but cannot make full use of world market. We are only put to much trouble by world market, but cannot enjoy its benefits. This raises the question of how to make full use of the opportunity brought by the "resumption of GATT" status. The "resumption of GATT" status will bring China, I believe, the following opportunities: A vast world market, a favorable and equal trade environment, MFN treatment in general and on a multilateral basis, full enjoyment of a generalized preferential system (so long as per capita national income is low, and the developing country status remains unchanged, China is entitled to such treatment), the right to participate in working out trade regulations, the right to protect young industries, the right to obtain the latest information on economic relations and trade, the right to protect intellectual property, and other rights. China's rapid economic development inevitably puts forward new requirements on foreign market, and the "resumption of GATT" status precisely fits in with this need. It is a law that a powerful economy inevitably leads to powerful foreign trade. We must comply with and understand this law, and use it to serve our purposes. It goes without saying that the "resumption of GATT" status will bring China opportunities and also require China to carry out commitments, which are no more than appropriately opening up the market and getting prepared for competitions. But one thing that makes people feel comfortable is that various countries benefit rather than are harmed to a varying degree after joining GATT. I think this has something to do with the age in which we live. Various countries are making efforts to develop their own economies, and join GATT after having made certain achievements. In other words, they join GATT when they have the conditions to make full use of GATT's favored treatments. This is even more so China's situation. As for competition, we should look at it from the positive side, and see that competition yields achievement. China's over 90 billion dollars in exports last year has proved that China has the ability to compete and succeed. As to the impact on some of China's industries, I think as long as we are fully prepared, take the world as the stage, improve quality and efficiency, and give play to comparative advantages, it is fully possible for China to win out in competition. If some of our products are in fact "counterfeit and inferior," they should be eliminated, shouldn't they? It is fully possible for Chinese enterprises, after 15 years of tempering through reform and opening up, to participate and win out in international market competition, pushing China's economic level to a higher stage.
