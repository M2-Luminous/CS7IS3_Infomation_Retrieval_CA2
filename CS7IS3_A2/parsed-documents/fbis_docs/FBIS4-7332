On the same day, the South Korean puppets held a firing exercise and a helicopter operation exercise as part of the Hwarang war exercise in a frontline area adjacent to the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line. The premeditated military provocations are rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula more strained. If the United States and the South Korean rulers continuously reinforce their aggression forces and unleash a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, the provokers will never get off scotfree.
