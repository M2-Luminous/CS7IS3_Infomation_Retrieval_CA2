During the 11-day overseas tour, Yi held meetings with his counterparts and ranking government officials to discuss mutual concerns with a particular emphasis on military exchanges and security issues, including the knotty North Korean nuclear problems. Of particular note was that Yi was the first defense minister ever to visit the three countries. Yi took office last December. He made the significant foreign visits in line with the government policy to set up firm security relations with the surrounding nations following his April 20 meeting with the United States Defense Secretary William Perry he had just before embarking on the overseas trips. "Yi's visits have significant meaning in that they were timed with the rapidly changing security situation surrounding the Korean peninsula," a ministry official said. In Japan, Yi met former Defense Agency Director Kazuo Aichi and agreed to expand military exchanges, mainly between military personnel. They reached agreement on the exchange of port calls by navy vessels carrying cadets of the naval academies, promising to realize the visit by the Korean side within the year. They also signed a pact for the prevention of accidental collision of military aircraft by notifying in advance the other of flight plans in areas adjacent to open seas. [sentence as published] The visit to Japan was evaluated to have important historical meaning in that he paved the way for the military cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo that has been regarded as a "taboo" because the people still harbor bitter feelings for Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea. But, it lost steam since it was made in the middle of the political chaos in the Japanese government without being able to form a new cabinet after Morihiro Hosokawa resigned as prime minister, military observers say. After a spell of confusion over his visiting schedule Yi managed to meet Aichi who was replaced later. In Russia, Yi signed with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev a 1994- 95 letter of intent for the promotion of military exchanges. The two ministers agreed to upgrade the military exchange level over that in 1993, promising to realize mutual visits by ranking military leaders, with Grachev's visit to Seoul slated for sometime this year. The two reportedly discussed the issues regarding the Russian proposal to provide South Korea with military weapons to pay off the $1.4 billion it owes for economic assistance. But the ministry officials declined to confirm it, saying the matter is still under consideration. The two ministers shared the view that the North Korean attempt to develop nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the peace of the global community as well as in Northeast Asia. In this vein, the North's nuclear ambition should be deterred under any circumstances and Pyongyang should return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) immediately to carry out its duty as a responsible member of the international community, they agreed. The outcome of the Yi's visit to Russia was hailed as successful as it placed a psychological burden on the North and laid the groundwork for military cooperation between the Cold-War foes. But Yi came under fire for "wasting time without efficient schedules from April 28 to May 3 which included weekend days and Russian Easter day on May 2," the observers maintained. Yi focused his efforts on ensuring procurement of Germany's state-of-the-art military technology. But his bids seemed to have failed due to Bonn's cautious attitude. Yi and his German counterpart Volkere Ruhe adopted a joint announcement pledging further military exchange, which the ministry greeted as a momentous result, as it was the first joint announcement made with non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries
