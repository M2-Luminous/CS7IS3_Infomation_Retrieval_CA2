FR941013-0-00009 FR941013-0-00004 One commenter states that the compliance requirements should be revised to minimize economic impact due to major engine disassembly. Specifically, modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies and installation of the No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing could entail major engine disassembly depending on the scope of work performed at the next shop visit occurring after the effective date of the AD. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA has determined that the modification of the LPT vane cluster assemblies is not applicable to the engine models specified in this AD, and therefore has eliminated this requirement. However, the compliance requirements for the installation of the No. 6 bearing scavenge pump bracket bushing is still required at the next shop visit to achieve the desired level of safety. One commenter states that additional costs could be incurred due to lack of availability of the parts required by this AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has coordinated this AD closely with PW to ensure the availability of the required parts. In addition, PMA parts are specified in this AD as an acceptable alternative for PW parts. One commenter states that the &hyph;15A/&hyph;17A models were the only engine group to have the initial steel duct modification incorporated during manufacture in accordance with PW SB No. 5697. These engines, together with a limited number of retrofitted engines, will be the only ones able to take advantage of the associated industry support program. The FAA has no comment on the extent or application of any support program which may offset some of the costs of the hardware required by this airworthiness directive. While some operators may receive discounts on the cost of the containment hardware, the economic analysis is computed on the assumption that no discount or warranty program is available. Therefore, this comment is beyond the scope of the AD or its economic analysis. One commenter states that an alternative to the compliance end date of December 31, 1998, should be expressed in hours and cycles, with performance required as whichever occur later, to accommodate low utilization operators. The FAA concurs. The FAA performed a risk analysis to determine the inspection interval requirements and that risk analysis accounted for both high and low utilization operations. However, determining the hourly and cyclic equivalent to the compliance end date specified in the AD, the FAA has determined that the fleet average utilization rate can be applied to low utilization operators. The FAA has added the hourly and cyclic equivalents to the AD. One commenter states the PW JT8D&hyph;17R engines should be exempted from the requirement to install the thicker third stage turbine outer air seal because these engines are already configured with a turbine shield for containment protection. The FAA does not concur. The PW JT8D&hyph;17R engines require additional containment protection due to higher rated low pressure rotor speeds on these engine models. Therefore, both the thicker third stage turbine outer air seal and the turbine shield are required for these engine models. One commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. In addition, the FAA has determined that inspections of the third and fourth stage LPT blade sets in accordance with the procedures and intervals described in PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 5, dated August 10, 1992; or PW ASB No. 5913, Revision 4, dated February 20, 1992, constitute acceptable alternative methods of compliance for the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(1)(iii) of this AD. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. The FAA estimates that 6,000 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take an average of 4 work hours, based on fleet configuration mix, per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $7,235 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $44,730,000. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
