The new representative body's speaker is Viktor Maksimov. He is 47 years old and has lived in Moscow since 1968. He started out as a neighborhood militiaman. He later worked in the USSR and RSFSR ministries of internal affairs. He was a Moscow City Soviet deputy. At PRAVDA's request the head of the Duma talks about his job. [Figurovskiy] Viktor Anatolyevich, how does the Moscow City Duma differ from previous representative bodies? [Maksimov] The City Duma's powers are not based on authoritative directives to the executive branch, but rather proposals of various options for solving problems. Duma decrees are signed by the mayor of Moscow. However, if necessary the Duma can override the mayor's "veto." [Figurovskiy] Soon after its election the Moscow City Duma was called a "pocket" Duma. Is it in anybody's pocket? [Maksimov] In my opinion, the fact that the government's proposal regarding a transition to a new system of payment for housing and municipal services was discussed at five sessions and sent back for additional work three times indicates that the Duma made substantial amendments to the draft before approving it, with the objective of increasing Muscovites' level of social protection. [Figurovskiy] Nevertheless the rent hike was an unpopular measure, to put it mildly. [Maksimov] Yes, it was unpopular. But as long as housing is free it will not go to the people who need it, but instead to those who are close to those in power. Consider this: of the millions of square meters of free municipal housing built in Moscow every year people on prefectures' waiting lists get only about 20 percent... There is one solution: transition to a market economy. Everything should have its price, and everything should be paid for. [Figurovskiy] So will the great mass of middle-income families have to say goodbye to their dreams of new apartments? [Maksimov] Not everyone will have to acquire housing at the market price. Following the example of many countries, we will introduce this system: every citizen will have the right, once in his or her life, to receive a standard allocation of housing of average quality free of charge. But if you want an apartment with more space or a better floor plan, then pay for it! The higher payment for housing is a first step in that direction, though not a very large one. It will take us roughly five years to go all the way. There are 18 square meters of living space for every resident of Moscow. Yet there are 700,000 people on waiting lists who have 8-10 square meters apiece. Another fact: luxury apartment buildings have very large auxiliary rooms that have not been paid for up until now. Is that fair? [Figurovskiy] How much will housing now cost in Moscow? [Maksimov] The new system will take effect in the second quarter. The government proposed introducing it in March, but the Duma deputies insisted that the new rates not be introduced before the city had a functional housing compensation system. We also insisted that rent depend not only on the number of square meters in an apartment, but also on the building's category. People will have to pay more for square meters that are "extra" relative to a social standard. The gist of the new system can be expressed in a few words: rates for apartments and municipal services will be indexed in accordance with price increases over the past three years. At the same time, a number of categories of Moscow citizens will be paid housing compensation. In the initial stage of reform a "belated" indexing of rates will be carried out. In the second stage, which the government plans to begin on 1 July, prices will go up by factors of between three and five. True, if the new system has not worked out by 1 July the Duma will have an opportunity to halt and postpone the start of the second stage. A number of categories of Muscovites will receive housing compensation during the first stage. Compensation will be provided to citizens within the limits of Duma-approved standards for living space and municipal service consumption, with consideration for each family's total income. The deputies have approved the following housing standards: for citizens living alone, 33 square meters; for two-person families, 42 square meters; and for families with three members or more, 18 square meters per person. Incidentally, that is more than the government of Moscow proposed. The average amount of rent and municipal services (excluding electricity, phone and radio hookup) can be calculated by multiplying the total size of an apartment by roughly 100. For example, if an apartment has 50 square meters of space, then the payment for it will be approximately R5,000. But that is only for Muscovites who have apartments that do not exceed living space standards. Those who have more square meters of space than allowed under the standard will also pay more. The size of subsidies is determined according to a simple formula: the amount that goes to pay for an apartment should not exceed 10 percent of a family's budget. Compensation will be paid in a non-cash form via a savings bank, i.e. a citizen will not be able to receive the money directly. During the second quarter subsidies will only go to the poorest families --approximately 4 percent of Moscow residents. Subsequently the number of people receiving subsidies will increase.
