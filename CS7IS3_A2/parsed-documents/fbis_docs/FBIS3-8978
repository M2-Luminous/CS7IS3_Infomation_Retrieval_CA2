At the same time, exports amounted to 820 billion forints, 3 percent less than in 1992. The balance of trade closed with a deficit of 342.5 billion forints or $3.6 billion. All this has been reported to MTI by the Central Statistical Office. The data also show that items that do not attract payment obligations represented a greater than usual proportion in the turnover. The delivery of fighter aircraft in exchange for the former Soviet debt, and natural gas imports to offset the investment at Yamburg belonged to this group. Deliveries of goods in connection with products manufactured under commission agreements, repairs, and leasing, and material contributions to businesses also amounted to a significant amount. Discounting these, the deficit can be put at $2.3 billion. In imports, Germany has been overtaken by the successor states of the Soviet Union and it is now in second place. On comparable prices, imports exceeded their 1990 level by 25 percent. Within this, the amount of machinery imports increased more than one and a half times. The purchase of the Boeing passenger aircraft played a big role in this. The import of foodstuffs increased by 30 percent, and the import of materials and other consumer goods increased by 10 to 16 percent. Exports decreased by some 10 percent. Exports decreased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of 1993 but significantly increased in the last two months of the year. The decline of agricultural and food-processing industry exports can be gauged at 20 percent, while 16 percent fewer consumer goods were exported. The export of materials decreased by 4 percent compared with 1992 and the export of machinery increased by 3 percent.
