Shakhray said that he was completely satisfied with "the high quality of the document," but he had a number of proposals to make regarding the procedure of adopting it. Shakhray believes that the ratification of the document should not be rushed and that "it would be better to work on it for a month or two," than to have it signed by representatives of parties representing the same political spectrum. In Shakhray's view, "this slowness" in drawing up the document will enable, say, Anatoliy Lukyanov and his allies, "who are preparing their own draft document on civil accord," to join it. Shakhray thinks that the document should be passed to the State Duma, adopted by it as a law, and opened for new signatories. "Both Rybkin and Yeltsin ought to sign the memorandum not as citizens, but as statesmen," Shakhray said.
