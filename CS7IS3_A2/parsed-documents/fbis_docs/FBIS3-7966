Does this mean that the war between the Serbs and Croats is over? [Jovanovic] The war has come to an end and both sides are of the opinion that peace and prosperity are only possible with normal relations. Thus, the opening of the offices in Belgrade and Zagreb follows from it. Experience has shown that the results of direct talks between the two sides are far more successful than is the case if a third side, foreign countries, interfere. The offices are only the first step to mutual recognition. [Vujovic] The greatest problem are the borders within the former Yugoslavia.... [Jovanovic] The FRY does not have any territorial claims against its neighbors. Thus, there is no border problem between us and the former Yugoslav republics. However, the problem is that individual republics have deprived the Serbian people who have lived in these territories for centuries of the right to decide on their future. It is the same right that these republics used for themselves in order to become independent. We do not have any territorial interests, but we only want to protect the interests of the Serbs who live there. However, the Serbs, for example, in the Krajina, can only decide on their future alone. All the problems there can only be solved in direct negotiations between Zagreb and Knin. We will accept what is decided there. [Vujovic] Does Belgrade have an influence on the Serbs in the Krajina? [Jovanovic] Of course, we have a certain influence on the Serbs outside the FRY, but one must not underestimate this influence. [Vujovic] The question of the prisoners of war is certainly one of the most important humanitarian questions at the moment. What is the present situation? [Jovanovic] We started to solve this problem as early as a year and a half ago. At that time, we signed a document that all prisoners are to be exchanged. However, as we ascertained later, the Croatian side did not release all its prisoners of war or, more precisely, not all were on the list. Therefore, these talks will be repeated. There are currently no Croatian prisoners of war on our side. On the other hand, however, we have a list of about 1,000 people, most of them missing persons from the former Yugoslav People's Army. The Croatian side is prepared to examine this list once again, to ascertain finally whether these people are still alive. A commission of the two states is to investigate this. We are also offering our help to rule out the possibility that someone was forgotten or incorrectly registered by us. [Vujovic] An issue that arises again and again is the question of property rights.... [Jovanovic] In the Geneva conference there is a commission that is responsible for the legal succession of the former Yugoslavia. While the individual seceded republics advocate the thesis that all the republics of the former Yugoslavia and the FRY are together the legal successors of the SFRY, we take another view. The FRY did not secede from the former Yugoslavia. Therefore, we are not a legal successor, but the state with the basic right. The second problem is FRY citizens' private property that is in today's Croatia and Slovenia. There are numerous houses, apartments, and summer houses with all their furniture and equipment, which were confiscated or even destroyed by the Croats. Our citizens must be able to enforce the right to this property, which belongs to them. [Vujovic] The interrupted relations resulted in many problems in the life of the Serbs in Zagreb, Istria, Dalmacija, as well as in the life of the Croats in Serbia.... [Jovanovic] I must stress that far more Serbs lived in Croatia until Croatia's declaration of independence. Many of these Serbs had to leave Croatia, and were often threatened. According to our estimates, only 100,000 Serbs are living in Croatia today, while up to 300,000 Serbs experienced "ethnic cleansing." Most of these expelled Serbs are living as refugees in the FRY, which is particularly difficult for us because of the UN sanctions. All who want to return must be able to do so. They should also have the right to their apartments and all their other rights. [Vujovic] Because of the participation of Croatian troops and soldiers in the Bosnian war, UN sanctions against Croatia were also demanded. What do you say to that? [Jovanovic] No, no new UN sanctions should be introduced, but the existing ones should be lifted. For the embargo against us, which has been in force for two years, has shown one thing: Such a thing does not serve peace, but it only aggravates the situation. [Vujovic] Can the visit of a higher-ranking Croatian politician be expected in Belgrade soon, for example, a visit by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to Belgrade or by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to Zagreb? [Jovanovic] There had already been high-level contacts before this normalization. So far, President Milosevic and President Tudjman have had several meetings within the framework of the Geneva peace negotiations. We expect Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic to visit Belgrade soon. It is only a question of when a meeting will be held on an even higher level in Belgrade or Zagreb.
