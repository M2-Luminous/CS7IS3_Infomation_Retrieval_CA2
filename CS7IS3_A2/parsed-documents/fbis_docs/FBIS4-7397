To do business, to carry out economic activities, we also need the means, that is, capital. In a symposium on economic development held in Ho Chi Minh City, a Japanese specialist has said frankly: "You want to find business partners? First of all you need to have money in your hand; then you have to have business management knowledge and market information, otherwise failure awaits you...". It is true that if we do not have capital to the minimum of 40 percent of the total investment capital for a joint venture, then we will be at a disadvantage. I was not surprised when I visited Shanghai in China, where the eastern region development project is being carried out. Foreign investment up to tens of billions of dollars capitalizes it; however, the state of China has also put in 130 billion yuan, or 50 percent of the total of capital, for that gigantic project, which is creating the "head" of the dragon for the whole east China region. There are countless examples to prove that lack of capital means disadvantages for the economic development of the world's poor countries. The first victims were the African countries, who have, due to the lack of capital, `voluntarily' used their land and dirt-cheap labor to grow industrial plants as required by capital lending countries. The results have been shortages of food staples, exhausted soil, and an even more devastating situation than before. One of our directors recently exclaimed that, two years ago, he had been too "enthusiastic" in searching for foreign partners to set up joint ventures. For capital, he borrowed from them half a million U.S. dollars, and they contributed another half a million dollars with the condition that the joint venture should import equipment chosen by them, and our director should take care of the sale of the produce. In exchange our director should agree to an export volume of agricultural products of 2,500 tonnes. As a result our director received a loan and a bunch of obsolete equipment which had been newly-painted. Our director is of course awaiting his trial in court, but, to be fair, the state and people should shoulder this loss. He claimed that he did not embezzle even a cent into his own pocket; he was cheated and he had no capital to make a fair deal. Cases like this are happening quite often these days in our country. Capital is essential for development in our country, a country devastated by many years of war. Many projects have been postponed just because funding was not available, and many of these projects were construction of infrastructure requiring large amounts of investment and a long capital recycling time. But if we do not strive for strong development of the infrastructure, we will not have conditions for economic development. In a recent visit to Dien Bien Phu, the local leaders told me that the local people supported the campaign to substitute poppy with other industrial plants. But when the people needed financial help, only about several hundred thousand dong for each hectare of land, the authority could not respond. Then the people told the leaders that they would supply their own plant and livestock species, but that the authorities should make more roads so they could barter their products with other localities. The authorities faced another stalemate since they had no funds to build more roads. So where can we find the capital? Some specialists estimate that there is about 20,000 billion dong of idle capital still in the hands of the people. Others say it is 40,000. In the last Tet Giap Tuat [New Year of The Dog] event alone, our Vietnamese compatriots from the U.S.A. brought home $36 million through Tan Son Nhat Airport (Ho Chi Minh City). Most of this money did not go into saving funds and state treasure, but was invested in land and real estate. Investment in land and real estate brings no benefit to the national economy. Some economic specialists have asserted that the land prices in Vietnam are unrealistically high. In some places the price was twice as expensive as compared with that in other countries in the area, thus creating another difficulty in the effort to attract foreign investment. The success of the domestic capital motivation campaign is a criteria to measure the trust of people in the state. If people still do not trust [the state] and feel indecisive, it is almost impossible to urge them to bank their money in the state treasury, or to do joint business with the state. So the primary task the state needs to do is to create trust in the people so that they will be willing to put their money into developing the economy and building the country. There will be a thousand and one tasks to do, but the first thing we need is an appropriate legal system that protects the rightful benefits of the people. We should not repeat the situation in which the people who have deposited money in saving funds have nowhere to turn to when problems arise. Secondly, we need to restructure our management to improve economic efficiency, so that the money people put in will secure a profit. We should not allow the current situation of many loss- making enterprises with their directors and cadres still earning enough to build new houses, buy new "late model" cars, and live even more "luxuriously". It is impossible then to persuade people to practice thrift for national construction. We need to revise the following lesson: at the time when we had just regained independence, our national treasury was almost empty. President Ho Chi Minh urged all the people to save one meal and use the rice to help people who suffered hunger at that time, and he did it first as a model to others. Later when he again urged people to contribute money and gold to buy guns for national salvation, all the people gave their strong support. We should never forget this lesson; it should be the model for our activities.
