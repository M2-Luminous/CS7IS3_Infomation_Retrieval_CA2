The State Council will announce a number of major reform measures one after another, which are important steps in establishing a socialist market economic structure. To ensure their successful implementation, the entire party, from the top to the bottom, must make joint efforts, and governments at all levels and the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the agricultural system should focus closely on this central work of the State Council, proceed from its general interests in everything they do, and carry out the party's rural policies in a down-to-earth manner. They should earnestly improve agriculture, carry out rural economic work, and strive to accomplish this year's production tasks to create a favorable environment for reform. Chen Junsheng pointed out: A prominent problem in our work for many years has been that policies are not implemented or are distorted in the course of implementation. This is particularly true in the case of policies affecting the immediate interests of peasants and policies supporting and protecting agricultural production. There are both structural causes and causes related to awareness and work. Structural causes must be gradually resolved through in-depth reform. However, a large amount of facts indicates that the problem is largely rooted in awareness and work. In many instances, structure cannot be blamed for our failure to implement policies. The causes must be found in subjective factors, namely, whether party and government leaders at various levels truly regard policies as the party's lifeline and whether they have firmly established the idea that agriculture constitutes the foundation. Without a profound understanding of the problems facing rural areas, agriculture, and peasants, they will lack initiative and a sense of responsibility in policy implementation. Whether or not we can successfully implement the party's rural policies is a matter of party spirit. All localities and departments must ensure successful implementation of central policies without obstruction. Chen Junsheng said: Steadily increasing peasants' income and the effective supply of agricultural produce is a strategic issue affecting the prosperity and development of the national economy. To increase peasant incomes more rapidly, we must proceed from the overall interest of developing the entire economy and earnestly implement the various principles and policies adopted by the party and state for the countryside. From now on, gradually improving peasants' living standards and increasing their income by every possible means will be made an important norm in the performance evaluation of cadres at all levels. We must judge the work of a locality not only by the amount of grain produced but also by the amount of the peasants' income increased. Speaking of this year's agricultural and rural work, Chen Junsheng asked all localities to carry out the following tasks in a down-to-earth manner: 1. We must never relax grain and cotton production. We must not treat grain production lightly at any time. We are a large country where conditions differ from one area to another. If we misstep on this issue, no one can help us. Cotton production has declined for two years in a row. From now on, we must use any and all means to maintain adequate crop acreage and work hard to restore our total cotton output to normal levels. 2. We must use the market as our guide to vigorously develop "three-high" [high technology, high foreign exchange earnings, and high efficiency] agriculture. While ensuring a steady increase in grain and cotton production, we should let peasants freely adjust their agricultural structure and develop "three-high" agriculture. To this end we must successfully build well the demonstration zones designated by the central authorities for developing a type of farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency. Provinces could also designate a number of provincial- level "three-high" agricultural demonstration zones. 3. We must continue our efforts to promote the construction of vegetable basket projects in various parts of the country. Large and medium-sized cities shall maintain a fixed proportion of vegetable fields in the suburbs based on the distance to the city proper. Vigorous efforts should be made to develop vegetable crops, livestock breeding, and fishing. Steps should be taken to further enliven circulation and stabilize market supply. The State Council will soon hold a vegetable basket project conference to focus on resolving problems of vegetable supply around the Spring Festival and during next April or May, the slack season. 4. We must vigorously develop town and township enterprises. Whether peasant incomes will increase in a sustained way in the next several years still hinges, to a large extent, on the rate of growth and efficiency of town and township enterprises. These enterprises must stress "internal management" and spend more efforts on improving their standards, quality, and efficiency. 5. We must persistently carry out the work of supervising and controlling burdens on the peasants. Central and provincial departments concerned must screen, in accordance with the law, documents and projects that will affect the peasants' burdens. Strict control should be exercised and no projects should be undertaken without prior screening and approval to prevent eliminated burdens from "bouncing back." At the same time, localities should continue to implement the central policies and laws and regulations on reducing peasant burdens and should remove burdens from peasants accordingly. Chen Junsheng also stressed: Agricultural departments should earnestly change their functions and mentality, expand their field of work, and strengthen regulation and control. They should promote reform and pay attention to policy while taking care of production and technology; they should concern themselves with the production process and at the same time take care of procurement and marketing to link them with production. At the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture commended 80 advanced units and 300 advanced workers who made outstanding contributions to the control and prevention of bollworms in 1993. Responsible persons from relevant State Council departments attended today's meeting.
