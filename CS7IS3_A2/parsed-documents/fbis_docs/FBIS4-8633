Otherwise, the international community would be directly responsible for an escalation of the conflict with unforeseeable consequences for the entire region. U.S. NATO aircraft on April 10 and 11 raided Bosnian Serb army positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe haven" which should have been demilitarized last spring. In late March, about 10,000 Moslem troops from Gorazde mounted an offensive on Bosnian Serb positions surrounding the area. The NATO aircraft intervened when the Serbs crushed the offensive and launched a counter-attack. Simic told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Government had most categorically condemned the U.N. decision to engage NATO aircraft as a direct and open engagemement in the civil war in Bosnia- Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems. The Yugoslav Government remains consistent in its long-term foreign-policy orientation that all hostilities must unconditionally cease in Bosnia-Herzegovina before overall solutions are found, Simic said. He went on to say that solutions which should not dramatically clash with the real situation and the democratic principles by which the international community should be guided can be sought only on the basis of lasting peace and easing of the malignant tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Unfortunately, these principles have long been abandoned and grossly abused in the Yugoslav crisis and replaced by an open imperialistic policy on the international political scene which the U.N. obeys and duly implements although by its very nature it should oppose it, Simic said. The U.N. decision to bomb Serb territories, which was also highly controversial as far as the required procedure was concerned, shows that the contemporary world has gone too far in belittling the values without which peace cannot be even imagined, he said. The key international factors should sober up and abandon their arbitrary, aggressive and reckless actions, and pursue instead a realistic policy of negotiations on an equal footing as the only way to the ultimate goal -- peace and a lasting, just settlement acceptable to all in Bosnia, he said. In this, the international community can always rely on Yugoslavia's peaceful policy of active mediation, said Simic. Paradoxically, the future of the peace process in former Yugoslavia depends on whether political developments are really heading in the direction of peace. If the international community is really interested in peace, then the means to attain this goal should be corresponding, he explained. Force which only prolongs the war and continues the bloodshed cannot be justified by aspirations for peace, said Simic. It is utterly cynical when some diplomats say they hope the Serbs would join the peace process in the future, because the Serb side has always supported negotiations as the only way out of the crisis, he said. The Serb side had accepted the latest Bosnia peace plan of the European Union which, following the Moslem rejection of it, simply forgot it had made any proposal at all, discrediting itself as an international factor which could have helped find a favourable solution to the crisis and the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. Yugoslavia remains consistent in its position that the peace process should be based on negotiations in which all sides would participate on an equal footing, said Simic.
