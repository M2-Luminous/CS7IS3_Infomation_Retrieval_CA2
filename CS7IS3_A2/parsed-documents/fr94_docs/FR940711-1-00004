FR940711-1-00004 FR940711-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 33 [Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;18; Notice No. 33&hyph;08] Special Conditions; General Electric Aircraft Engines Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed special conditions. SUMMARY: This document proposes special conditions for the General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines Model(s) GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 14 CFR part 33, including the requirements of ยง33.94, Blade Containment and Rotor Unbalance Test, relative to the location of fan blade fracture for the containment test, do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the certification of the GE90&hyph;75B/&hyph;85B/&hyph;76B turbofan engines. This finding is based on a novel or unusual design feature of the GE90 fan blade. Therefore, this document proposes special conditions which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards of part 33 of the FAR. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before August 25, 1994.
