FR941019-1-00060 FR941019-1-00008 A deletion will occur after the Regional Administrator places a notice in the Federal Register . The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will be made available to local residents by Region VII. IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for recommending deletion of the Northwestern States Portland Cement Company Site, Mason City, Iowa, from the NPL. Northwestern States Portland Cement Company (NWSPCC), owns and operates a cement manufacturing facility on the north side of Mason City, Iowa. The facility has been in operation since 1908. A byproduct of the cement manufacturing process since 1969 is cement kiln dust (CKD). The West Quarry site (Site) is a quarry covering approximately 150 acres to a depth of 40 feet of which approximately 110 acres were filled with CKD during the period of 1969&hyph;1985. A pH monitoring program of the water in the West Quarry was started in April of 1974 in response to a change in color of the Quarry water. The Quarry water pH rose sharply following January 1976, increased to 11.8 in April 1976, and leveled off at about 12.5 in 1980. The increase in pH is attributed to the breakdown of the natural buffering system which was sustaining the Quarry water at a near-neutral pH. In response to Quarry dewatering initiated in 1987, current pH levels are about 10.5. In 1979, two seeps emerged from the northeastern portion of the filled West Quarry. High pH water from the seeps flowed overland to Calmus Creek. In 1984, the state initiated a study of Calmus Creek and found pH in the creek elevated 2.0 pH units downstream of the seep area. In April 1985, the state ordered NWSPCC to immediately cease discharge from the seep area to Calmus Creek. NWSPCC was also ordered to cease kiln dust disposal in the Quarry and to conduct a hydrogeologic investigation. In 1989, the state did a follow-up stream survey of Calmus Creek. The 1989 study concluded that there had been no improvement in water quality since the 1984 study. Conclusions from the 1989 study suggested that runoff from the haul roads and storage areas was contributing to the water quality degradation. In 1992, a Calmus Creek stream study was done to meet requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination permit issued by Iowa Department of National Resources. The results of this study suggested water quality had improved with pH dropping from 10.2 in earlier studies to 7.9. The study attributed this improvement to elimination of runoff from the site and the installation of the groundwater extraction/treatment system installed in 1985. In 1987, EPA conducted a Site Inspection of the NWSPCC Site and, based on the findings of this investigation, the Site was scored with the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) for possible inclusion on the National Priorities List (NPL). Based on the site characterization completed under the direction of EPA, an HRS package for the Site resulted in a score of 57.80. This score was based on the impact to groundwater and direct human contact. The Site was proposed for the National Priority List (NPL), in June of 1988 (53 FR 23988). The Site was added to the NPL in August of 1990 (55 FR 35501). The RI/FS field work and data collection activities began in August 1988 with the final report submitted in March 1990. The investigation demonstrated that significant impact to groundwater outside the Site boundaries had not occurred. The U. S. Public Health Service Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), conducted a draft Health Assessment for the NWSPCC Site. They concluded that the Site is of potential health concern because of the potential risk to human health resulting from possible exposure to hazardous substances at concentrations that may result in adverse health effects. A final Record of Decision (ROD), was executed in June 1990 by the EPA with concurrence by IDNR. The selected response action addressed the principal threats of surface water and groundwater contamination and the source of contamination_the cement kiln dust. The selected remedy consisted of the following actions. •Dewatering of the Site which contained high pH water, acid-neutralization and discharge to Calmus Creek. •Construction of a permanent drain system in the dewatered Site to collect precipitation runoff and groundwater inflow to the quarry. •Placement of an engineered clay cap over the area of the Site filled with cement kiln dust to minimize infiltration through the kiln dust. •Installation of bedrock dewatering wells to collect contaminated groundwater beneath the Site, prevent migration of contaminated groundwater from the Site and maintain groundwater levels below the kiln dust. •Treatment of contaminated water to meet IDNR/NPDES discharge permit limits with discharge to Calmus Creek. •Assurances that the dewatering system will be operated in perpetuity to maintain isolation of water from the waste kiln dust and collect and treat any contaminated water which is generated. A Consent Decree was signed in June 1990 which outlined the performance criteria to be met by implementing the approved remedial action alternative as well as the reporting and scheduling requirements of the remedial design and construction activities. The final Remedial Design and Remedial Action Work Plans were completed in June 1992. The EPA in consultation with the State of Iowa, has determined that all fund-financed response activities under CERCLA at the NWSPCC Site, Mason City, Iowa, have been completed and that no further response is necessary. Therefore, it is proposed to delete the Site from the NPL. Dated: September 26, 1994. William Rice, Acting Regional Administrator, Region VII.
