We know this because they have turned up in the forefront of the U.S. anti-Republic international cooperative system. While spreading a groundless rumor that we have manufactured nuclear weapons, the Japanese reactionaries are not only raving that international pressure and sanctions should be imposed on us but are also making absurd remarks that our nuclear development poses a threat to Japan's security. This is indeed ridiculous. Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to isolate us at the van of others by putting forward gibberish about international cooperative systems and so forth in international conferences, including the United Nations. By keeping in mind certain sanctions against our Republic, the Japanese authorities are accelerating the formulation of legislative measures in a bid to establish a war system, such as the emergency law, and are even raving about a marine blockade. This is an undisguised disclosure of the Japanese reactionaries' will to join the war to invade Korea by following the United States in an emergency. The Japanese reactionaries, who are busily running wild joining the maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean puppets to crush our Republic, are spreading preposterous and groundless rumors and false reports about our Republic. This strengthens the oppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and Koreans living in Japan. This is a grave challenge to our Republic, an independent sovereign state, and is the greatest infringement on human rights. In addition, this is an act of illegal and unjust political suppression and is a criminal act of excluding other nations. Today the Japanese reactionaries are attempting to conceal the development of their nuclear weapons by adhering to crafty tactics on the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear development. As has been exposed, Japan accelerated on a full scale the nuclear weapons development beginning in the fifties. As a result, Japan has secured all material and technological foundations that enable it to manufacture nuclear weapons. With Japan's nuclear armament being pushed ahead, worldwide vigilance is becoming more keen and voices of denunciation are resounding more highly. All flowery words uttered today by the Japanese authorities about the peaceful use of plutonium, the three principles for denuclearization, and so forth, are false. The Japanese reactionaries needed excuses for legalizing their nuclear armament. Our nuclear development, fabricated by them, is one of such excuses. Today, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough, are actively accelerating their nuclear armament under a deceitful signboard by laying a blame on our side. The recently-exposed incident of concealment of plutonium capable of manufacturing nine nuclear bombs is an incident of plutonium concealment carried out under tacit approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is applying double standards in the nuclear issue, according to instructions of the United States. This is an actual example of Japan's accelerating its nuclear armament. What is grave is the fact that no one knows how much plutonium Japan, which was branded a flagrant offender, has systematically concealed for scores of years during which it kept operating nuclear facilities. Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities, shamelessly enough, made provoking remarks while laying the blame on us for our so-called nuclear development issue, claiming that a resolute attitude of international community is necessary, Japan's cooperation for sanctions when a resolution is adopted in the United Nations is quite natural, and so forth. This is a crafty tactic to prevent plutonium, which Japan has systematically concealed, from being exposed any more by diverting the people's attention to us. The Japanese authorities, who accelerated nuclear armament by laying the blame on us, have now been officially recognized by the world as nuclear maniacs. Reality shows that nuclear threat comes to us from Japan, not from us to Japan. Today the Japanese reactionaries are openly spreading remarks that the use of nuclear weapons is not a violation of international laws. This is indeed alarming. The Japanese reactionaries' hostile act against our Republic has reached an extreme pitch in collusion with the United States and the South Korean puppets. If one attempts to gain and increase one's popularity by sacrificing others, such benefit and popularity will work as a gimlet piercing one's own eye. The Japanese reactionaries should precisely realize this. The more blame Japan lays on us, the more clearly will our innocence be proven, and the more clearly will Japan's dark and shameless intentions be exposed to the world. We have already clearly stated that if Japan joins in any sanctions against us, whether by taking the lead or being dragged in, we will regard this as a declaration of war. If Japan turns up on the path of sanctions, at last while accelerating nuclear armament defying our warnings, Japan can never evade due punishment for this. Japan should clearly realize the firm will and determination of our people, who dislike empty words, and should immediately stop its catastrophic maneuvers to become a big nuclear power and reckless commotions over sanctions.
