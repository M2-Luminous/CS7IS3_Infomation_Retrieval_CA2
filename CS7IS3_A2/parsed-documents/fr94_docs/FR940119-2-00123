FR940119-2-00123 FR940119-2-00080 The MOA will minimize duplication and inconsistencies between Swampbuster and the Clean Water Act wetlands programs and articulate clearly the procedures by which the Nation's farmers can rely on SCS wetlands jurisdictional determinations on agricultural land for purposes of both the Clean Water Act and Swampbuster programs. The MOA includes provisions to ensure that agency personnel are properly trained, that standard agreed-upon methods are utilized in making wetlands determinations, and that appropriate monitoring and oversight is undertaken. The MOA also places emphasis on local cooperation between the signatory agencies and the improvement of analytical methods for making wetland determinations. While the MOA became effective on January 6, 1994, full implementation will vary from state to state depending on the level of training required and the development of state wetlands mapping conventions. The signatory agencies will take appropriate action to expedite implementation of the MOA consistent with such prerequisites. The full text of the MOA follows. Dated: January 7, 1994.
