Angelopoulos: "Mr. Berisha's `A La Turks' Policy"] [Text] The behavior of Albanian leaders toward Athens and the policy that they use against the Greek minority and the Orthodox Church in Albania have caused big problems. Everything shows that Sali Berisha's (formally democratic) regime follows a specific line. It tries to prove in our Balkan region and internationally that Greece has territorial designs on Albania, the Orthodox Church there is a "political agent" of the Greek Government, and our country is a threat to the Balkans because of its relations with Belgrade. The government has so far shown restraint on this issue, which passed through a phase of strong tension after the well-known fatal incident at Peshkepi, and it exhausted every diplomatic possibility to prevent deterioration of Greek-Albanian relations. However, Tirana's "response" to this cool behavior has shown that the Albanian regime seeks the deterioration of bilateral relations. Apparently believing that he has secured some international "protection" and that his relations with Ankara will yield some profits for him, the Albanian president is attempting to formulate a "scenario" that would offer him the possibility of eliminating the Greek Orthodox minority from his country so that North Epirus would soon be inhabited by Albanian Muslims. With such Albanian intentions, it is not surprising that the Zurich meeting on 3 May between the two countries' foreign ministers did not achieve any substantive results. Will there be positive results from another ministerial meeting as Tirana now wants? This could happen only if Sali Berisha and those who support his "line" decide to change their policy toward Greece and the Greek minority. However, this does not seem possible. The most probable thing that will happen is that Tirana will adopt Ankara's methods: Escalation of provocations along with invitations for "dialogue" at times to preserve the international community's impression of "good intentions." Given the current Tirana policy, Athens is obliged to consider a specific "Albanian policy."
