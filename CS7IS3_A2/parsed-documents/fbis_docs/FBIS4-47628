FBIS TRENDS-18MAY94-JAPAN-U.S. Tokyo Perceives U.S. Stance on Trade Talks Moderating Tokyo Perceives U.S. Stance on Trade Talks Moderating SUMMARY The Japanese Government appears to be entering discussions with the United States about resuming the stalled U.S.-Japan trade talks under the impression that Washington is softening its stance toward Japan on a number of key issues. Tokyo also seems to believe that the U.S. Government is divided over its policy toward Japan, and that those favoring a more accommodating approach may have, for the time being, gained the upper hand. END SUMMARY In recent comments to the Japanese press, a number of senior Japanese government officials have indicated that they see a softening in Washington's trade policy toward Japan. -- According to the 8 May Asahi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told reporters on 6 May that he believed that Washington was backing off from its demand for numerical targets to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The paper quoted Kakizawa as saying that he thought "the United States is beginning to realize that such a demand will not win the support of international opinion." -- The 12 May Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed Japanese officials connected to the U.S.-Japan framework talks as citing a number of recent examples of a softer U.S. line toward Japan. Among these examples were U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's decision to delay citing Japan under the Omnibus Trade Act for discriminating against U.S. products and services; President Clinton's 3 May statement, during a 3 May television press conference, that Washington will not seek numerical market shares or managed trade; and the President's reported comment, during a 9 May telephone conversation with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, that both Japan and the United States need to work to restart the framework talks. Commentary in the Japanese press, which maintains close ties with Japanese Government officials through the Japanese press club system, has also recently portrayed Washington's stance toward Japan as moderating. A 3 May article in the influential, business-oriented Nihon Keizai Shimbun argued that the U.S. Government "has come to feel strongly the importance of Japan- U.S. interdependence and realizes that excessive pressure on Japan will . . .undermine U.S. interests as well." Similarly, a 13 May Mainichi Shimbun article cited a number of examples of the changed U.S. position, including statements by U.S. Trade Representative Kantor that the United States is not seeking any numerical market share in its talks with Japan; President Clinton's comments during his 9 May telephone conversation with Prime Minster Hata, and comments by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, during meetings with Foreign Minister Kakizawa and Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata, that the United States was prepared to be flexible on the issue of objective criteria. Japan's two other major national newspapers, Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun, have also carried similar articles (Asahi Shimbun, 12 May; Yomiuri Shimbun, 17 May). Causes of Change Japanese officials appear to believe that what they see as Washington's softer stance stems from several factors. One of these is the recent sharp fall in the value of the dollar. According to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, one reason for the change has been the recent sharp fall in the value of the dollar and the negative impact this could have on the U.S. economy. Suggesting that the United States is reassessing its policy of pressing for an appreciation of the yen, it quoted unnamed Japanese officials in charge of the framework talks as saying that "the U.S. Government has been concerned with the dollar's devaluation and the fall in the stock market and bond prices." Japanese officials also appear to believe that Washington does not want to take any steps that might imperil the weak ruling coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The 12 May Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed Japanese officials in charge of the framework talks as arguing that the U.S. Government was softening its position toward the talks "out of consideration for the new government in Japan." In addition, Japanese officials apparently believe that these concerns have strengthened the hands of those within the U.S. Government that favor a more accommodating approach to Japan. For example, according to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, unnamed Japanese officials in charge of the framework talks told the paper that "the mood may be building within the U.S. Government to alter the hardline trade policy upheld until now by the U.S. Trade Representative. " Similarly, the 3 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun asserted that in recent "heated debate" over U.S. policy toward Japan, officials in the National Economic Council and the Departments of Treasury and Commerce favoring a more moderate policy had won out over the U.S. Trade Representative's office, which supported a continuation of the hardline approach. The 17 May Yomiuri Shimbun argued that one of the reasons for Washington's changing position was the impact of a letter sent by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Winston Lord to Secretary of State Warren Christopher criticizing the Clinton Administration's policy toward East Asia and calling for less emphasis on economic issues in U.S. policy toward Japan. Possibilities for Compromise The perception that Washington is softening its stance toward Japan appears to be encouraging some Japanese officials to moderate Japan's stance in the talks and seek an accommodation with Washington. A number of senior officials have recently been quoted in the press as proposing compromises on some of the major outstanding issues in the framework talks. -- The 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Foreign Minister Kakizawa as calling for "some kind of quantitative criteria which would not lead to actual numerical targets" as a way to settle the dispute over setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance. -- According to the 21 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, after a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, the Japanese Government's special envoy for economic affairs, Nobuo Matsunaga, called for both Tokyo and Washington to "make arduous efforts" to devise objective criteria that do not involve numerical targets. The paper also reported that Matsunaga stressed that both sides needed to compromise. -- The 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi would probably carry compromise proposals for "a step-by-step approach" to setting objective criteria for measuring progress in opening the Japanese insurance, automobile, and auto parts markets to meetings in Washington beginning 19 May. -- In an interview in the 11 April Nikkei Weekly, MITI Vice Minister Okamatsu argued that both Japan and the United States should seek a "third path" between Washington's "results-oriented policy" and Tokyo's "process-oriented" one. Continued Resistance However, some senior officials, especially in the bureaucracy, appear to continue to be wary of compromise with Washington--a factor that could dampen the prospects for achieving a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations. The 3 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun cited unnamed Japanese bureaucrats as being resentful over reports that the United States had decided to soften its approach for two months to see how Japan would respond. According to the paper, the officials argued that Washington had "no right to press Japan to respond by imposing a deadline." The 13 May Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unnamed senior MITI official as expressing skepticism that the Unites States was prepared to compromise, stating that he did "not expect the United States to drop its proposal for objective criteria so easily." Other senior officials have been quoted as making statements suggesting that they anticipate that the United States will have to make most, if not all, of the concessions if the framework talks resume. For example, according to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, an unnamed senior MITI official told the paper that the softening of Washington's position indicated that "at long last the United States Government has realized that no matter how hard it presses Japan, it cannot wring concessions for . . . numerical targets." The same article quoted another unnamed official as asserting that in future negotiations, the two countries would have to "reach a set of agreements that will allow the United States to save face." Outlook Japan's ruling minority coalition would probably welcome the opportunity to achieve a breakthrough in trade talks with Washington that might reinforce its shaky political standing. The coalition could also use such an achievement to bolster its appeal in elections that will probably be held in the near future. The perception that Washington is softening its line could play into the hands of those Japanese officials who are seeking such a breakthrough. However, continued resistance within parts of the bureaucracy to significant compromises in the framework talks and the coalition's limited leverage within the bureaucracy suggests that progress toward a compromise in the talks will be slow. Opponents of accommodation with Washington may use reports of divisions within the U.S. Government over Japan policy and of U.S. concern about the falling dollar to argue that the United States may eventually be forced to soften its position even further.
