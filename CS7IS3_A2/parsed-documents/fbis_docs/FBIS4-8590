During a break in the National Assembly session today, the BSP parliamentary group discussed this issue but did not reach a specific decision. There were equal numbers of votes for and against. The parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces is postponing its decision on the same matter, because it is not clear whether the United Nations really requested a military corridor through Bulgarian territory.
