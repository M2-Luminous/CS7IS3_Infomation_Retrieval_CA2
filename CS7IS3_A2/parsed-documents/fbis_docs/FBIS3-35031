At the outset, the Central Command members observed a minute of silence in honor of the departed son of the homeland and the people, Staff Major Basil al-Asad. Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah then spoke about Basil al-Asad's noble traits and good character. The Central Command members also praised Basil al-Asad's traits, which made the people love him. They noted that the people are sad on the departure of the knight, who embodied, during his lifetime, the genuine values upheld by President al-Asad. The Central Command also listened to a political report presented by Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. The foreign minister reviewed the latest political developments in the Arab, regional, and international arenas, as well as contacts made on several issues related to these developments. The Central Command discussed the current political situation and Israel's attempts to circumvent the important political results of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, especially with regard to the peace process. It viewed such attempts as a continuation of Israel's policy that is based on undermining the peace process by violating the principles and rules of this process, primarily implementing UN resolutions, adopting the principles of international legitimacy, and Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
