Meanwhile, the government conveyed a message to the Baghdad administration informing it that Ankara is prepared to receive a delegation from Iraq headed by an under secretary. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "They have asked for talks for a long time. We have responded to their request. The matter is not very important. The question of the oil pipeline between the two countries will be discussed." According to Foreign Ministry circles, for a long time the Baghdad administration had asked Turkey at every opportunity to agree to an official visit. However, considering the UN embargo on Iraq, Ankara has rejected the request so far. The Oil in the Pipeline Will Be Withdrawn The Foreign Ministry officials have said that the main topic at the talks with the visiting delegation, which will be headed by an under secretary, will be the pipeline. They recalled that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller convinced the U.S. Administration when she visited the United States of the need to withdraw the oil in the pipeline between Karkuk and Yumurtalik and said: "The only problem on the matter is the question of sharing the oil that will be withdrawn from the pipeline. The UN officials have proposed that the sides concerned each receive one-third of the oil in the pipeline. However, we have proposed that Turkey receive 50 percent of that oil. We shall discuss the matter with the Baghdad administration. Iraq maintains an approach in Turkey's favor. We are trying to convince the UN officials to agree. The United States is involved in the matter. Meanwhile, the UN secretary general's decision has to be considered. If he agrees, then Turkey will receive 50 percent of the oil in the pipeline." The officials also said that the developments in northern Iraq will be discussed with the visiting delegation. They asserted: "We have said at every opportunity that Iraq must not be divided. We shall outline our views on the developments in northern Iraq and the need for Baghdad's compliance with the UN resolutions."
