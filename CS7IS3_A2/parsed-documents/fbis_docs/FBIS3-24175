The text, which was interrupted by the main announcements of those stations, was read for five minutes. Starting today, the above-mentioned radio stations will be broadcasting announcements five times a day, urging the people to clip and to mail in questionnaires, published in the press, investigating listeners' and viewers' opinions about the independent television and radio stations. Journalists were informed about this action, its causes and purposes yesterday, at the Lithuanian Journalists Union. Chairman of the governmental commission on the development of radio and television, R. Jasinavicius, and the chairmen and representatives of television channel TALE-3, television studio BALTIJOS TELEVIZIJA, radio stations M1, RADIOCENTRAS, ZNAD WILII, TITANIKA, as well as the leaders and representatives of the radio station VILNIAUS VARPAS took part at the press conference. They acquainted the journalists not only with their action, but also with the statement which they had addressed to the President of the Lithuanian Republic, the chairman of the Parliament, and the Prime Minister. It states that in the area of mass information media the government is not only maintaining, but is also strengthening the monopoly, giving priority to Lithuania's radio and television and monopolizing the communications media. According to the authors of the statement, an anticonstitutional situation from the legal point of view has been created in this area. The situation must be changed if the freedom of expression is to be nurtured in Lithuania. The authors demand that the planned raises for the rental of the state radio and television means of communication be revoked and that the Lithuanian Republic TV be decommercialized. Otherwise, the independent television and radio stations will be destroyed economically. They survive only from advertising, while the state radio and television draws its income both from the taxpayers pockets and from advertising. The main purpose of the action is making equal the conditions under which both the state and the independent structures exist. At the press conference it was mentioned that the representatives of the independent radio and television stations are not calling for a strike or some big action that would harm the people of Lithuania and the organizers of such actions. They will seek a convocation of an expanded Government session, with the participation of the representatives of the mass information media and of the interested departments, for the solution of the strategic problems of Lithuania's electronic mass information media.
