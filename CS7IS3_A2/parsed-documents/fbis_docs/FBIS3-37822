According to this, four documents are endorsed as a single package, including a resolution on an amnesty for those who took part in the events of August 1991, 1 May 1993, and September-October 1994. Some deputies, in particular from the Agrarian faction, the Communist Party faction and the Liberal Democratic Party faction have described this as the biggest occasion for celebration in the history of the Russian state. Other deputies, in particular those from the Russia's Choice faction, said that this was the start of civil war in Russia.
