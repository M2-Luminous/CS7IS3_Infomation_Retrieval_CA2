Observers took this statement as an implicit threat to the Palestinian people whose intifadah has flared up and encompassed all cities, villages, and camps of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and extended even to the 1948-occupied territories. The truth is that the Israeli prime minister is just as responsible for the horrendous massacre as the Zionist settlers who carried out the treacherous attack. Rabin is the one who armed the settlers and gave them a free hand to commit aggression in the occupied territories. He also refused, after the massacre, to take deterrent measures to check the settlers' activities and disarm them. Instead of punishing the war criminals and bloody killers, he imposed a collective punishment on the entire Palestinian people, subjected all of the occupied territories to military siege, and instructed the occupation troops to shoot indiscriminately. As a consequence, more than 20 martyrs from our Arab people have fallen in the wake of the savage massacre. Dozens more were wounded. The list is increasing everyday, and suppression is on the rise. Rabin is indeed preparing for further massacres, since he insists on incorporating the Zionist extremist Tzomet Party into the government coalition and letting the well-known terrorist and bloody leader of the Tzomet Party, Refa'el Eytan, take over the Police Ministry. Eytan is one of the most extremist Zionists. He is the one who advocated mass expulsions of the Arabs and committing savage massacres against them to drive them to emigrate immediately. Therefore, the international community should take Rabin's threats seriously and provide protection for the Palestinian people in line with the Geneva Conventions and international charters and principles. By issuing such threats and making them a reality, Rabin not only seeks to severely harm the Palestinian people, but also to deliver a fatal blow to the Middle East peace process, entrench occupation, and pursue schemes to Judaize the occupied Arab territories and plant them with settlements. We do not believe any of the influential parties on the Security Council are unaware that the massacre has done great damage to the peace process and that any new massacre will undermine the peace process in its entirety. We also do not believe that a single Security Council member is unaware that Zionist settlers constitute a stumbling block to the achievement of peace. A just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East is impossible without the return of all the occupied Arab territories, the evacuation of the settlers, and the Palestinian people's guaranteed right to exercise their national rights, foremost being their right to self- determination. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has again highlighted certain facts that some people have forgotten or chosen to disregard. One of these facts is that peace is impossible under occupation and cannot coexist with settlement activity. Therefore, the Security Council, which is discussing the question of this region, is asked to assert the need for a full Israeli withdrawal and for the evacuation the settlers and the dismantling of the settlements in line with international resolutions. These resolutions have always rejected occupation, the acquisition of territory by force, settlement activity, and Judaization of the land. Today, peace depends on a decisive international stand and true international credibility. Current and past events have shown that the international community cannot continue to disregard the reality of Zionist occupation and give the criminal hand of Zionism a free rein in the occupied territories. This would be an outright violation of international charters and UN principles and would undermine the peace process that has so far drowned in Arab blood shed at the hands of Israel, its troops, and settlers. The Arabs, who responded to the U.S. peace initiative and accommodated all Security Council resolutions, have only reaped bitterness and frustration. Such a situation is no longer acceptable by Arab governments or by the Arab man in the street. Unless effective international measures are taken to implement the Security Council resolutions, effect the return the occupied Arab territories, and ensure the liberation of the Palestinian people from Zionist terrorism and oppression, the peace process is liable to collapse into oblivion.
