The volume of drugs seized between January and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the drug out of circulation. According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be sold on the U.S. or European market. Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon Region, to transport the coca base. In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with international organizations and foreign governments for the purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the results are visible in the considerable number of "mules"--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Operations Cover Entire Country Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia. And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu (Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which makes access and policing difficult. The various operations taking place in 1993 included the destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known as "Monte Santo," "Ouricuri," and "Independence," took place with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region. Amphetamines Gaining Ground A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market. Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the other in Florianopolis. The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA, whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new escalation of drugs in our country. Battle Against Illegal Prospecting The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani" arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest," which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three aircraft and a large quantity of fuel. The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were seized. In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving underage girls forced into prostitution.
