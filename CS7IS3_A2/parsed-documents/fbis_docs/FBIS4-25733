This project will change the backward appearance of the rural areas in central Gansu and have a major impact on the province's social and economic development. When exclusively interviewed by these reporters, Yan Haiwang, secretary of the Gansu Provincial CPC Committee, and Governor Zhang Wule both took this project as an indication of the tremendous achievements scored by the province in reform and opening up, and likened the achievements to those currently attained in Dujiangyan. This is one of the key projects financed by the World Bank in China with a loan of $123 million. The construction of the project is difficult because of its large span. The Pandaoling Tunnel has an overall length of 15.7 km, and is the longest water delivery tunnel in Asia and the seventh longest in the world. With the world's most advanced equipment and technology, the engineering companies from China, Japan, and Italy, which are the contractors on the project, took six years to basically complete this magnificent irrigation work, and have been highly appraised by the World Bank and the Israeli experts. Yan Haiwang stressed that Gansu, which in the past always depended on grain transferred from other provinces, has been basically self-sufficient since reform and opening up. Without suspension or semisuspension in production, the large and medium-sized enterprises here have performed better than those in many other provinces. The secretary also pointed out that Gansu is an entirely landlocked province, which is not along any coast, big river, or border (except for several dozen km of borderline contiguous to Mongolia with no economic significance). Under the situation in which eastern China is growing at a high speed, Gansu is determined to develop its strong points and avoid weaknesses so as to restore the prestige of the Silk Road, and the people are resolved to work hard for the goal of shaking off the province's impoverished appearance. Governor Zhang Wule pointed out: With the market economic mechanisms taking effect, large and medium-sized state enterprises in Gansu have acquired a fair competitive environment. They are getting out of their predicament and advancing in a good direction. The construction of the multitrack Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and Baoji-Zhongwei Railway soon will be completed and opened to traffic, which will considerably enhance the province's railway transport capacity. Moreover, the province will benefit directly from the construction of the second Eurasia Continental Bridge between Lanzhou and the Alataw Pass, and its investment environment will be further improved. The State Planning Commission plans to establish a project to build in Lanzhou a large ethylene plant with a production capacity of 660,000 tonnes in a bid to increase the economic strength of northwest China, after taking into account the adequate output of petroleum and gas in Xinjiang and the good industrial and traffic facilities in Lanzhou. If the construction of this project is confirmed, the province's output value will increase by several dozen billion yuan, and Gansu will play an even more powerful role as an industrial base in the vast northwest of China.
