FR940425-0-00008 FR940425-0-00006 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;20] Change in Altitudes and Time of Designation for Restricted Area R&hyph;2511; Fort Ord, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action changes the designated altitudes and time of designation for Restricted Area R&hyph;2511, Fort Ord, CA. This action reduces the designated altitudes for R&hyph;2511 from the ``Surface to 5,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)'' to the ``Surface to 2,000 feet MSL.'' This action also reduces the time of designation from ``0600&hyph;2300 local time Monday&hyph;Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours in advance'' to ``0700&hyph;1900 local time Monday&hyph;Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours in advance.'' EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Gallant, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9361. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations reduces the designated altitudes for R&hyph;2511 Fort Ord, CA, from the ``Surface to 5,000 feet MSL'' to the ``Surface to 2,000 feet MSL.'' This amendment also reduces the time of designation from ``0600&hyph;2300 local time Monday&hyph;Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours in advance'' to ``0700&hyph;1900 local time Monday&hyph;Friday; other times by NOTAM at least 12 hours in advance.'' As a result of the base closure of Fort Ord, CA, the Department of the Army has determined that there is no longer a military training requirement to retain R&hyph;2511 as currently designated. However, in order to conduct unexploded ordnance clearing operations at Fort Ord, restricted airspace to 2,000 feet MSL is required. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.25 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review This action reduces the designated altitudes of the restricted area and also reduces the time of designation. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts.''
