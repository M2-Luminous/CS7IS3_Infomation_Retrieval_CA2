The government's preferential treatment of exporters, investors, as well as state protectionism in some branches of the economy, are supposed to make the program successful. On the other hand, the program's implementation could be impeded by the lifting of earning controls in state-owned enterprises. "We have analyzed three versions of the program: the warning option, the extensive-development option, and the basic option -- which is difficult but implementable" -- said Miroslaw Pietrewicz, a minister and CUP's chief. "We decided in favor of proposing the third option to the Council of Ministers. The decision was determined by the domestic situation -- unemployment, obsolete industrial machinery, indebtedness by enterprises which last year reached 550 trillion zlotys [Z], and the crisis of public finances. Poland's debts have reached the level of Z1,400 trillion. To service the debt this year, we will need Z112 trillion. On the other hand, we have reported an economic growth of some extent, even though it is still fragile and uncertain. We are also hopeful concerning the economic revival in the West. But generally speaking, the starting point for the program's implementation is difficult" -- CUP's chief added. The program is based on the assumption of growth in GDP by 22 percent over four years, as well as an increase in consumption generally by 15 percent, and an increase in investment of around 40 percent. There is also an assumption of approximately a 1.5-percent yearly increase in real wages and salaries. According to M. Pietrewicz, this kind of growth is dependent first of all on a speeding up of the rate of ownership transformations and economic modernization. But investments in enterprises are linked with the need to save money by those enterprises and to devote savings to production capital. "It is hard to say whether we will be successful in that" -- the minister stated. "Investing money in investments is more risky than investing in bonds." The version of the program suggested by CUP requires an intensification of exports. So it is based on a widening of consumption markets for Polish merchandise beyond the traditional markets. But the program also envisages difficulties in eliminating the negative foreign-trade balance. Modernization of the economy will require an increase in the imports of modern technologies. So the state is supposed to provide clearly preferential treatment to exporters, for instance by providing insurance for risks of credit exports -- this according to assurances received from CUP. Apart from that, state protectionism will be visible particularly in large economic branches such as mining, steelworks, the defense industry, and the energy industry. When asked whether state intervention and protectionist policies will not deter foreign investors -- whose involvement will largely determine the program's success -- Minister Halina Wasilewska replied: "It is not true that foreign capital invests mainly in those areas where there is full liberalization. On the contrary -- investors demand outright protectionism, as in the form of tax or customs-duties breaks." CUP also makes the success of the proposed program for social and economic development in Poland dependent on a gradual abandonment of earning controls. According to the CUP chief, the sudden elimination of such controls would cause equally sudden consequences. Italy serves as an example -- over there, such a step resulted in a breakdown of the economic situation. It is a complicated issue. The controls and popiwek [earning-control legislation] should be eliminated, but not yet. First, principles of indexation of benefits should be changed, enterprises should be commercialized, and the issue of companies with a strong, monopoly position on the market, resolved; a special commission should also be established which would deal with earning issues. Otherwise, the implementation of the program proposed by CUP would be very hard. Miroslaw Pietrewicz also expressed his hope that thinking along economic lines will prevail. If the implementation of the program is successful, then we can expect 1997 expenditures on the educational system to be similar to those of 1989 (it is the same case with health services); we can also expect 1-1.2 percent of GDP to be devoted to science, 3 percent to the defense system, as well as a rate of unemployment which would not exceed 14 percent of the professionally active population of Poland.
