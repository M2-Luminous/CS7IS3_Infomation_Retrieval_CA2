Neither Piotti nor Judge Cesar Lagos released their names because the investigation is still under way. Unofficial sources said that one of the gang's leaders was Miguel Angel Lopez, a member of the Federal Police's narcotics division, and that police have also arrested a driver and a security guard employed by the company that owned the truck, Tab-Torres. The gang also reportedly includes two deputy police inspectors and two other non-commissioned Army officers. Although a large array of weapons -- including an English Stirling -- was on display during a press conference given by Lagos Piotti denied that the gang possessed police vehicles.
