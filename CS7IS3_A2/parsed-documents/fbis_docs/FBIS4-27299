The message reads: Pyongyang, Your Excellency DPRK President Kim Il-song: I extend my greetings to you, Your Excellency President Kim Il-song. On behalf of the Palestinian people, members of Executive Committee of Palestinian Liberation Organization, and my own name, I extend my deep appreciation to you, Your Excellency, and to your government and to your friendly people through you, for your solidarity message supporting the Palestinian people's struggle. In the message you have expressed a firm feeling of solidarity again. This proves how friendly and cooperative relations and solidarity between the people of our two countries are close and strong. We hope that we will be able to further deepen and develop the relations to comply with the common interests of the two countries' people, who want to secure peace and stability and to make progress and prosperity in our area, as well as in your area, thus making effort for its realization. Since the signing of an agreement on the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho areas, our Palestinian people have begun the work of laying foundations and building facilities urgently needed to establish the national government. With great trust and hope, our people, who have entered such an important stage, expect that all of our friends, as well as all people throughout the world, who love freedom, justice, and peace, are able to express their support and greetings needed to consolidate the basis of the Palestinian government. Strengthening the basis of the Palestinian government guarantees security, peace, stability, progress, and prosperity of the people of all countries in our area. Also, this will be the first important step in maintaining the fair and durable peace in the Middle East region, enabling our Palestinian people to terminate Israel's occupation of their territory and to restore and exercise their legal national rights, including the rights to establish a independent state with the sacred area [kudosul] as its capital. Finally, I extend my deep thanks to you, Your Excellency, once again, and wish you a long life and good health. I wish you success in your people's work for national reunification, progress, and prosperity. I extend my best regards and warmest greetings to you as well, Your Excellency. [signed] Yasir 'Arafat, president of Palestinian State and chairman of Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive Committee. [issued] 16 May 1994, Tunis
