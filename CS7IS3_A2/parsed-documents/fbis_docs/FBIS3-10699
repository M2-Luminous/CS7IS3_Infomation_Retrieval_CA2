The complaint was made known after city daily CLARIN published an article on Tuesday [8 March] saying that the agreement had been reached by SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] state intelligence agency Secretary Hugo Anzorregui on a visit to Britain on Monday [7 March]. A document signed by Deputy Antonio Berhongaray said that the deputies in question were both "surprised and disapproving" of the development especially given the recent history of conflict between Argentina and Britain. They wrote that even if the service was essential it would have to pose no danger to "strategic policy and basic common-sense." They added: "It seems obvious to the unaware mind that the training of personnel by foreign intelligence services enables the country carrying out the task to gain valuable insight into professional training and the makeup of the other country."
