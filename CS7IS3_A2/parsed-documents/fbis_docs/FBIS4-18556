Since becoming the PCF leader, Robert Hue has shown a desire to promote the emergence of a "new political force." The good result achieved in the cantonal elections, in which his party secured 11.4 percent of the vote in the first round, and the effective tactical move to direct votes to the leading left-wing candidate in the second round, has given him renewed confidence. This is "urgent," he said on Thursday [7 April], addressing the National Committee, when he suggested to his party comrades that a "strong initiative" be launched with a view to enabling "the popular forces, the progressive forces," to build a true "alternative" which would respond to the "tremendous appeal" made by the "social movement" and "our youth." `Profound Development' This "strong initiative," the new national PCF secretary emphasized, could not be allowed to boil down "as in the past," to a mere platform, an alliance at the level of party leaders. Robert Hue likes to think of himself as more innovative and bold, seeking to "reestablish the links between two things that have become disjointed": society and politics. He insists on the need to open discussions with all the left-wing parties with a view to coming up with a credible alternative. No official invitation has yet been issued, but Robert Hue wants to move quickly. His proposals will be debated during a National Committee meeting on 6 April. Yesterday, Jean Glavany, spokesman for the PS [Socialist Party], reacted very favorably to Hue's proposals. "For several weeks," he told LE FIGARO, "this profound development within the Communist Party has been noticeable. Between the two [cantonal election] rounds, the withdrawals and commitment of votes could not have turned out better. Together, we organized several meetings and were highly aware of the desire on the part of the voters to see us take up the dialogue again." Jean Glavany added: "The PS had already started to proffer its hand by organizing meetings on the transformation of society. So I can only rejoice at this development. Of course, it is not a question of reestablishing the union of the Left and adopting the joint platform of 1972. We must look for a new way of cooperation." The PS and PCF are working on this, but for the time being no meeting has been planned between Rocard and Hue.
