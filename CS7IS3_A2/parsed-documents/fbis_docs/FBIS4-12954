Husayn al-Hakim, an Iraqi opposition leader, took part in that meeting. AKHIR KHABAR has noticed that reports of that meeting were leaked at a time coinciding with the visit of Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, Jordanian deputy prime minister and minister of higher education, to Baghdad to brief the Iraqi brothers on the latest developments in the siege imposed on Iraq and al-'Aqabah. The reports came on the heels of a successful recent visit to Baghdad by a Jordanian parliamentary delegation. Informed sources said the Iraqi leadership welcomed the delegation's proposal that multilateral parliamentary delegations should visit the big powers in order to support the Iraqi position on the blockade. The Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) has issued a statement praising Jordan's stand on the official and popular levels.
