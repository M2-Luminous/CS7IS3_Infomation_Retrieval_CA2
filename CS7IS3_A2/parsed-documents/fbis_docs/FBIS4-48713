Speaking shortly before the meeting in Durban, Mr Zuma said: "We are always confident. We have disputed issues which we will try to resolve. We have no reason to fail, I'm ready for anything." Dr Mdlalose said he too hoped the differences would be resolved, but "you never can predict what will happen". The premier and Mr Zuma said the dispute had been raised during Monday's talks between President Nelson Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Cape Town. The conflict over the allocation of portfolios arose last week when the three ANC ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and Zweli Mkhize, excused themselves from the swearing-in ceremony in Pietermaritzburg. The trio were dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to them, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted with them before a decision was taken. Mr Zuma was initially awarded the social welfare portfolio, Dr Mkhize the health portfolio and Mr Ndebele the roads and traffic control portfolio. But in his speech in Ulundi on Friday, Mr Buthelezi said a new portfolio, auxiliary services, had been given to the ANC. The meeting to break the deadlock was mooted by Dr Mdlalose last week.
