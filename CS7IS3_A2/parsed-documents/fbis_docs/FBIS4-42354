It would be an action of historic significance, a Netherlands Government without the Christian Democrats. Jacques Wallage, the 48-year-old secretary of state for social affairs and employment in the outgoing government, and the man generally regarded as the successor of PvdA leader Wim Kok, believes that the possibility of a "purple" coalition merits thorough investigation. He does not consider it to be a drawback that the formation of such a government would mean his party having to take the plunge with the VVD, his party's opposite number on financial, social, and economic policy. "A coalition is a marriage of convenience, not of love," he said. [passage omitted]. According to Wallage, the credibility of his party need not necessarily come into play if the PvdA does business with the VVD. "In the years to come, both workers and employers from small- and medium-sized companies [SME's] must look to merge their interests. Together, they will have to agree on a package of difficult measures. If we expect a social pact to be possible in the economy, why should a political pact between the PvdA and the VVD be impossible?" he wondered. Before it comes to this, the two parties will have to agree on how to approach the issue of social security. [passage omitted] Wallage concedes that the number of people claiming social security benefits is far too high. Nonetheless, his party does not want to alter the size of benefits, unlike the VVD, which favors reducing most benefit payments to 60 percent of the minimum wage, with individual insurance on top of this. "By implementing the system better and showing greater responsibility, the main structure of the social security system can be kept intact," Wallage claims. Bad Behaviour However, the precondition for this is the implementation of a good policy on job opportunities, combined with wage restraint and easing of debts. Moreover, Wallage believes that the social security system must be reorganized in such a way that people are given more responsibility of their own. "The present system does not always provoke good behaviour. Here in the Netherlands people can still receive a benefit, refuse work, and barely incur any punishment as a result. We have tolerated the abuse of social security provisions for too long. The existing system must be cleansed of those people fiddling it. Otherwise we will be running the risk of people who are now helping to pay for this solidarity no longer being prepared to do so in the future." According to Wallage, the difference between the VVD and the PvdA consists of the VVD acting as if it still has to launch the whole reorientation process, while the PvdA is of the opinion that the "cleansing process" is already under way. Wallage says: "We have come up with stricter criteria regarding work disability. The criterion of suitable work has been replaced by passable work. In the past, a teacher who became handicapped was declared unfit for work and was immediately paid a full work disability allowance. Now we are assuming that the same teacher can still probably perform another function, using his brains and hands. So he will receive a much lower benefit and otherwise classified as being out of work. It will then be his own responsibility to do everything he can to find a job in line with the options still open to him." Employers [passage omitted] Wallage is interested by the proposal to help people find work via tax credits. "However, it is an expensive proposal, because the tax advantage does not go to all workers. That is why I am wondering whether it might not be better to let the benefit filter through to employers, who would then receive tax credits the more workers they took on at the minimum wage." The state secretary expects that the final government agreement will include a mixture of both possibilities. Since a large group of long-term unemployed will still be left over despite all the plans regarding jobs and stimulating measures, Wallage favors creating subsidized jobs, with either the government or individuals. "The main problem regarding the long-term unemployed is that people forget how to work. Consequently, subsidized work, on a voluntary basis, is something not to be shunned." Nevertheless, he does see a few pitfalls. "There are two things to watch out for: The falsification of competition, and the risk of the person involved earning so much that he is no longer motivated to move on to nonsubsidized work." As a result, Wallage believes that the Netherlands welfare state must be reevaluated, and his party, which is celebrating its centenary this year, has an important role to play in this. The state secretary is also opposing the voices in the PvdA that are clamoring to join forces with other progressive parties, the D66 and the Green Left, and form a Progressive People's Party together. Those in favor of such a Progressive People's Party believe that after a century-long struggle for emancipation there is no longer any need for a separate social democracy. Wallage's response is this: "I would always call myself a traditional social democrat in the sense that I find the basic ideas of social democracy to be totally pertinent to the present day. The party has to adapt its policies but the basic thoughts are sufficiently `alive' for us to look ahead to the next century with some degree of self-confidence." According to Wallage, the emancipation of workers, the source of social democracy, has still not been completely achieved. "There is better access to training, and generally speaking those people with jobs have a reasonable income. However, the process of forming an elite is still under way. Consequently, there are still sharp distinctions culturally speaking. Moreover, the fact that a consumer society has arisen points to incomplete development. Emancipation does not consist of consumption, but rather production, making a contribution. That form of emancipation has only just begun."
