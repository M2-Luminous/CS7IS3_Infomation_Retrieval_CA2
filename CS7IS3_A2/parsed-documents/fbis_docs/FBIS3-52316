The vote was 62 in favor, with SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], United Torah Judaism, and the Arab Democratic Party giving their support to the Labor and Meretz coalition. Forty-four opposition Knesset members voted against the budget, and two members of HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] communists abstained. Summing up the budget debate, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said next year Israel will have to find solutions for the large expenses resulting from the peace process.
