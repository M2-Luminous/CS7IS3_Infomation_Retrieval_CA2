Norodom Sihanouk, reenthroned as king of Cambodia last September, has since been hospitalized in Beijing for cancer treatment. He travelled to Pyongyang early this month before returning to Cambodia. According to a schedule arranged by the Royal Palace cabinet, the king will preside over a people's audience on 12 April to solve five urgent problems from among the grievances aired by the Cambodian people as selected by his high privy councillors. A roundtable meeting between government leaders and the head of the Khmer Rouge faction under the king's lofty chairmanship has also been arranged. Last month, government forces took control of several Khmer Rouge-held bases, including Anlung Veng and Pailin, in the region bordering Thailand. King Sihanouk launched an appeal from Beijing calling on the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and the Khmer Rouge faction to put a halt to their fighting. Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second prime ministers, have declared that the RGC has adopted an "open-door" policy toward the Khmer Rouge, allowing them a chance to reintegrate themselves into the national community.
