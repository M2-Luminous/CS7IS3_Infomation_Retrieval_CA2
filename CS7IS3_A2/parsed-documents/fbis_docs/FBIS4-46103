John Shalikashvili at the Pentagon on Monday [23 May]. An aide to Takemura, leader of new party Sakigake [Harbinger], later told reporters that Perry showed strong interest on the current state of Japanese politics and asked Takemura for his views on its impact on Japan's foreign policy. New party Sakigake is a splinter group of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Takemura served as chief cabinet secretary of the previous government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Takemura, whose party quit the ruling coalition last month, assured Perry that Japan will stick by its close relationship with the United States under the present government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata or any future "post-Hata" government. Takemura also told Perry that "there is no doubt" that Japan will play its part in implementing any sanctions the United Nations may impose on North Korea in connection with its suspected nuclear arms development. Takemura is currently on a private visit to the U.S. He is expected to meet other senior U.S. Government officials before leaving for San Francisco to give an address, the aide said.
