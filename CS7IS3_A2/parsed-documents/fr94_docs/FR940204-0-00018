FR940204-0-00018 FR940204-0-00012 33 CFR PART 161 [CGD09&hyph;93&hyph;037] Temporary Speed Limits for the St. Marys River AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is making a temporary amendment to the speed limits for the St. Marys River during the 1993&hyph;94 icebreaking season. This amendment reduces the speed limit by 2 miles per hour through that part of the system, between Munuscong Lake Lighted Buoy 8 and Lake Nicolet Light 80 upbound and between Lake Nicolet Light 80 and Munuscong Lake Light 9 downbound. These temporary changes to the speed regulations are a precautionary measure to minimize any possible damage to the environment due to movement of large commercial vessels through the ice. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective from December 27, 1993 through April 15, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Captain Roderick A. Schultz, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Ninth Coast Guard District Aids to Navigation Branch, room 2083, 1240 East Ninth Street, Cleveland, Ohio, 44199&hyph;2060, (216) 522&hyph;3990. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking and delay in the effective date would be contrary to the public interest because immediate action is necessary to prevent possible damage to the environment. Discussion of Proposed Regulations In a letter received on February 26, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources advised the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District of concerns over the environmental impact of ship transits through the St. Marys River during the period of March 21 to April 1. April 1 is the nominal date for the opening of the locks at Sault St. Marie, which allows large commercial shipping access to the St Marys River from Lake Superior. In accordance with an agreement reached on June 29, 1993 with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the Commander of the Ninth Coast Guard District is making this temporary change to the speed regulations during periods when ice breaking is being conducted in the vicinity of Neebish Island, St. Mary's River, Michigan, as a precautionary measure to minimize any possible damage to the environment. The speed limit is being reduced by 2 statute miles per hour in the area between Munuscong Lake Lighted Buoy 8 and Lake Nicolet Light 80, upbound, and between Lake Nicolet Lighted Buoy 80 and Munuscong Lake Light 9, downbound. The Light 9 checkpoint has been added to extend the reduced speed limit area past Winter Point, thereby protecting the sensitive environment between Winter Point and Light 9. Speed limits apply to the average speed between established reporting points. Drafting Information The drafter of this regulation is Captain Roderick A. Schultz, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Ninth Coast Guard District Aids to Navigation Branch. Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment A recent environmental impact study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers indicated that March 21 is the optimal opening date. [see U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Opening Operations of the Lock Facilities on March 21 (February 1993), Supplement III to the Final Environmental Impact Statement, Operations, Maintenance, and Minor Improvements of the Federal Facilities at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (July 1977)]. The same study by the Corps of Engineers indicates that there is no significant impact on fish populations due to movement of large commercial vessels through the ice. However, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources asserts that there may be such an impact during the early period of March 21 to April 1. The Ninth Coast Guard District has adopted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers EIS, EIS Supplements, and EIS studies on Operations, Maintenance, and Minor Improvements of the Federal Facilities at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. In addition, the Coast Guard is preparing a supplement for the 1974 Ninth Coast Guard District EIS regarding icebreaking activity on the Great Lakes. Collection of Information This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Economic and Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 CFR 11034, 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard has determined that a regulatory evaluation is unnecessary because of the minimal impact expected from this regulation.
