Today Mikhail Yegorov, deputy interior minister and head of the department for fighting organized crime, met journalists. Andrey Zenkov reports: [Zenkov] The existence of organized crime in Russia was recognized officially by the top militia authorities relatively recently. Having recognized it, they started to actively show journalists documentaries of chases and exchanges of fire that ended happily bandits being detained, just as in American gangster movies. The fact that over half of these bandits are released after 48 hours and godfathers do not even figure in cases is not the fault of militia, but of out-of-date legislation. [Begin Yegorov recording] We keep on repeating again and again: Give us the opportunity to make examinations prior to instituting proceedings and to carry out checks of documents. Let us work with those detained. We need to stop releasing the leaders of organized criminal groups and their members on bail, since they have lots of money. Incidentally, we need to gather evidence. It is difficult to gather evidence in two days. The posession of weapons, be it a nuclear bomb or a pistol -- our law is far from being perfect in this respect -- attracts roughly the same punishment. Nineteen and a half percent of those detained under Articles 218-219 are sentenced to imprisonment. The rest leave to re-commit crimes. [end recording] Mikhail Yegorov, one of the authors of Yeltsin's famous draft decree on fighting crime, stressed again that measures that are tough from the point of view of human rights, including the audit of accounts of the relatives of those under scrutiny, will be used only when fighting organized crime, which is responsible for up to 1,500 crimes committed in Russia daily.
