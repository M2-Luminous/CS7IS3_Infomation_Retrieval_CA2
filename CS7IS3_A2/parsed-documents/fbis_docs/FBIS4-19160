In a news conference in Brussels, an EU commissioner said the Commission ratified its decision of last week. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described the EU Commission decision to take Greece to the European Court for adopting measures against Skopje on 16 February as unfortunate, inappropriate, and contradictory. Venizelos said: The EU Commission will ask the European Court to take temporary measures against Greece, something that will undermine international mediator Cyrus Vance's initiative and the Community's political initiative through EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek. The spokesman said the court will give our country a new forum to develop its positions further.
