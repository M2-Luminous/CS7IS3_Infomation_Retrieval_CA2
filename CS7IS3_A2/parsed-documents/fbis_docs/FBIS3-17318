Moldova continues to press for unconditional pullout of Russian troops from the Republic by 1 July 1994. As for the Russian side, it links the withdrawal shcedule to Moldova's granting a special status to its breakaway Dniester region. Russia has recently stepped up considerably its activities aiming to settle the Dniester conflict. At the moment, the Russian president's special envoy Vladilen Vasev is staying in the region as a mediator between Moldovan authorities and the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The Russian diplomat has already met with moldovan President Mircea Snegur, parliament speaker Petru Lucinski and Dniester leader Igor Smirnov. He informed them about Russia's proposals, which could form the basis for resolving the protracted Dniester crisis. Moldovan and Romanian newspapers are still exaggerating rumours that the 14th Russian army may be turned into a Russian military base in this region. The Moldovan head of state flatly dismissed the rumours. But other republican leaders and Russia's official representatives in Chisinau decline to give any comments. The CSCE mission in Moldova has recently declared again for unqualified withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldovan territory and expressed grave concern over the lack of progress in settling the problems of the Republic's eastern regions.
