The minister made this remark during an overall assessment of the political framework following Wednesday's [11 May] parliamentary session devoted to debating the Roldan affair and corruption. According to Rubalcaba, it was made clear in the debate that the government stands by its intention to tackle corruption, and that it has stability to continue its work. At the same time, it is obvious that relations with the People's Party are experiencing a difficult time, although this does not mean that relations between the two main parliamentary forces have been severed. So the main new development in the sphere of political relations stems from the fact that the government takes note of IU's stance in that session, and reiterates its desire to pursue agreements with Anguita on the matters on which it is possible. "The prime minister," Rubalcaba said, "has already expressed gratitude for the tone of Mr. Anguita's speech, which was different from that used by other parliamentary groups upholding the same political stance or the the same main aim (Felipe Gonzalez' resignation). Mr. Anguita used a radically different tone, which undoubtedly makes possible a different political debate and political dialogue. It is true that there are some agreements with IU, and it is not a characteristic of this latest stage of the legislative term, because there were already some agreements at the beginning. We have never concealed our desire to reach agreements with IU on the issues on which it is possible. There are certainly considerable differences -- for instance, on economic policy or on matters such as labor reform, except for the matter of trade union elections -- but there can be no doubt that there have been agreements on other matters. We will spare no efforts to ensure that those agreements can continue to occur." Despite the toughness of the confrontation between Jose Maria Aznar and Felipe Gonzalez, the government asserts that not "all the bridges have been broken." "At the parliamentary level," Rubalcaba stated, "there are some relations. Nor is anybody unaware that relations with the People's Party are certainly not at their best, but that does not mean that there are no kind of relations with the People's Party. They are not smooth right now -- they are experiencing difficult circumstances -- but there are relations at levels other than those of the prime minister and the People's Party chairman." In any event, the government believes it has a stable basis for continuing its work, and this has been made clear in the recent sessions in the Congress of Deputies. In short, the government emerged from Wednesday's debate on corruption with the conviction that it has been made clear that the nationalist forces are giving it "the parliamentary support needed to perform its work." The government is in constant touch with those forces. A result of this has been the resumption of contacts with the Basque government in order to continue the process of a "joint reading" of the Basque autonomy statute. The Basque Nationalist Party complained a great deal about the blocking of the dialogue on autonomy. For its part, the government wishes at all costs to prevent the smooth relations with the nationalists being interpreted as a concession or quid pro quo for the support it receives from them, especially in view of the imminence of the election campaign. Hence Rubalcaba was at pains yesterday to emphasize that the recent contacts with representatives of the Basque government stem from the pledge to enhance the government's autonomy policy, begun at the beginning of the legislative term. In keeping with this decision, the government yesterday passed a resolution admitting the autonomous communities to the Spanish committee on cooperation with UNESCO. In addition, the government is beginning the European campaign by denying that its results can be interpreted as if it were a general election, Rubalcaba stated yesterday. With respect to the opinion polls forecasting an electoral victory for the People's Party in the coming European elections, Perez Rubalcaba stated that the government attaches great importance to them. In addition, Rubalcaba added that the "it is not reasonable to seek to turn the European elections into something other than what they are: They are European elections, and the results should be assessed in that context." "Those who seek to infer other things from those elections," he continued, "will have to explain what nature or significance they attribute to that assessment."
