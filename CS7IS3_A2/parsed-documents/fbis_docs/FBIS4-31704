Lengyel: "There Are No Major Differences in the Foreign Policy Programs"] [Text] The coordination of the foreign policy programs of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] starts today within the framework of the ongoing coalition negotiations. Comparing the documents, we can say that there are few actual differences between them. The foreign policy section of the negotiations will be mostly a field of expert coordination, rather than political fighting. Neither of the programs is an ideological one; they can be clearly called pragmatic, and both are based on international realities and interests. Both parties regard European integration and neighborhood policy as the cornerstones of Hungary's foreign policy attitude, and this provides the goals of our foreign economic, security, integration, and national minority policies. The SZDSZ regards full NATO membership as the most important concluding moment of integration; the MSZP puts Hungary's membership in the European Union in first place. Therefore, the MSZP regards the Partnership for Peace program as an adequate step on the road leading to the NATO, stressing that this strengthens the confidence of the countries in our region toward each other and creates the conditions for the NATO-compatibility of the Hungarian defense forces. The SZDSZ does not emphasize the importance of the Partnership stage so clearly. The MSZP would use a referendum in the matter of NATO membership, but this is not so clearly formulated in the SZDSZ program. Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are aware of the fact that the conditions of economic, political, and security policies and military alliance cooperation with Europe must be primarily created within Hungary itself; a hasty and unprepared integration would cause serious damage to our economy. It is impossible to start a "competition" in this process in our region and get a more favorable position than others; at the same time, we must be aware of the fact that Hungary has recently been present in Western considerations "according to its weight" and, although this might give the impression of devaluation, this is actually not the case. However, the unsettled relations with our neighbors is a factor that hinders integration and it harms the measure of our acceptance. Looking at it from both directions, it is important to create a modernized and attractive Hungary, a desirable partner. The differences derive from the political habits and cadres of the two parties. Foreign policy has traditionally been a success area of the MSZP and, along with Gyula Horn, Laszlo Kovacs, and Csaba Tabajdi, numerous other theoretical and practical experts, former ambassadors, and foreign officials can now be employed. The SZDSZ-shop led by Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, with its straight strategic line that puts greater emphasis on principles, will emerge along with the MSZP foreign policy that will probably be able to react to the changes with great security. In Csaba Tabajdi, the MSZP has a considerable expert on the international standards on the issue of ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders and the national minority issue in general. The Tabajdi-group clearly declared the principle of "national minority rights in exchange for the border clause," which does not contradict the idea of the Szent-Ivanyi group according to which "Hungary does not have any territorial demands that can be implemented; nor can it have such demands; however, guaranteeing national minority rights is clearly a European norm." It is a matter of taste which of these has more argument value and which is more idealistic, or more practical. (One can also mention here a pseudo-argument, but the issue can also be interpreted in the way that the border issue on the other side, and the situation of national minorities on the Hungarian side received a psychological weight that led to the development of a real situation of something in exchange for something else). Differences mostly emerge in the clear stand in favor of the autonomy concept of the ethnic Hungarian minorities, because this appears more clearly in the MSZP. The fact that both parties think in terms of contributing to the social and economic modernization of the neighboring countries, economic contacts that improve the situation of ethnic Hungarian minorities and generally the bilateral relations, including the legal conditions (investment protection, avoiding double taxation, and the creation of special economic zones) takes away the strength of possible debates. The MSZP is more in favor of a basic treaty with an adequate content, formulation, and guarantees; the SZDSZ, however, regards the treaties an important, albeit not outstanding, element of the means of our neighborhood policy.
