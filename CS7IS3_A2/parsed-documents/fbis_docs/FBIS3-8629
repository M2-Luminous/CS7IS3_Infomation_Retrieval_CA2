The unprecedented horrors of Maglaj's inferno have descended on the population with a vengeance this morning. The heaviest shelling since the beginning of the war is going on as I am filing this report. Dozens of howitzer and mortar shells fired in salvos are crashing onto the town center every minute. The town is being shelled from several directions and by all means at the enemy's [Bosnian Serbs] disposal. Five Russian-made surface-to-surface missiles have been fired at civilians and the town itself this morning. Casualties have been reported, although the exact numbers are impossible to determine. The Serb aggressor's offensive against the defense positions held by our [Muslim] defenders continues with the support of several hundred missiles fired from artillery pieces of all calibers. Concentrated fire is being directed at the area around the Nekolje dam. However, the fighters of the 201st Valiant Brigade and other units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army cannot be swayed and are not giving in an inch.
