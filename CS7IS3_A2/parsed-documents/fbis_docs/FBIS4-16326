They are designed to destabilize the situation and could be used as a justification for introducing Ukrainian presidential rule into the Crimea", according to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. Meshkov complained to ITAR-TASS that the Kiev administration's actions are preventing Crimea's new leadership from getting down to work. "We have not been given even the least bit of breathing space so that we could start working on economic decisions under normal conditions", he said. Commenting on the recent elections to the new Crimean parliament, where the electoral bloc "Russia" holds a majority of the seats, Meshkov noted that the administration and parliament had the same goals, which "gives us the possibility of working constructively". In reply to a question about the relations between the Crimean and Russian leadership, Meshkov said, "let me put it this way: The Crimean president does not feel isolated, and the "climate" of Russia's Crimean policy has become significantly warmer".
