In this interview he made ridiculous claims about the Islamic Republic's defense of freedom of the press. For example, he said: We believe in freedom of the press, freedom of the pen, freedom of speech, and the freedoms that are in the law. We believe that the sacred sanctuary of the press must be preserved, and those who disrupt this sacred sanctuary will be dealt with. This dealing is not by any means with the press, but is for the purpose of strengthening freedom of the pen. He then discussed 'Abdi's arrest, the relationship between this arrest and freedom of the press, and the question of what this person's crime really was. Among other things, he said: "It is not clear how correct this is in the eye of public opinion. His crimes will certainly be discussed when it is appropriate, and when necessary he will go to trial..." Mr. Ra'isi was asked repeatedly by various correspondents about what his crime really is, whether the accusations are only for the press or otherwise and why they have kept him in solitary confinement for 66 days without allowing visitors. He was not willing to give a proper answer. He only emphasized: "Because his crime was not announced, it is not known to you, but his crime is known clearly to the revolutionary prosecutor. However, concerning the manner of dealing with it, including visitors, detention and interrogation, you certainly must know that the legal regulations will be observed for him the same as they are for other defendants." In other words, based on the laws the security organizations of the Islamic Republic act upon, the defendant is savagely tortured to the point of death. He "confesses" to crimes not committed and then goes to "court." In view of the fact that in violation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic the defendant is imprisoned for a long period without access to a defense lawyer, talk of "defense of freedoms," and by one of the regime's agents at that, can be nothing more than a horrifying joke. In any case, what can be said right now is that Engineer 'Abdi's friends are conducting behind the scenes negotiations to free him, and with the results of these negotiations it will be clear whether he will be freed or whether he will "confess" to crimes he did not commit, like tens of other victims.
