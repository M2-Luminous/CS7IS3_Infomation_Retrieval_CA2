The UIP executive board will meet on 30 March to debate this issue as well as the country's economic situation and the government position in face of demands made by industrialists. The rupture between the industrial sector and the government will lead within a short term to the withdrawal of its representatives in the Coordination Council for Social Development. This decision was conveyed yesterday to Industry and Commerce Minister Uvaldo Scavone, who also received the concerns of the industrialists. Jara Avelli said: "Some of the problems we see in the current situation are an economic policy harmful to industry, the overvaluation of local currency that favors `dumping' by some countries into the Paraguayan economy, and the lack of support for this sector." [passage omitted] According to Jara Avelli, the industrialists gave the government eight months time by keeping a "prudent silence, and the government should have at least shown the political will to solve the problems, but we did not see any such thing," and we therefore decided to withdraw our support. He said: "Industry receives support in the electoral campaigns, and we saw within the economic program of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy an industrial development plan, but nothing of that plan has been fulfilled." He added: "We realized the government's lack of a political will to change the economy of exploiting raw materials without added value, and of trying to solve the problem by importing subsidized finished products -- in other words a system that creates hunger among peasants and favors a privileged group of importers." He concluded by saying: "The government must realize it cannot continue to put the industrial sector aside."
