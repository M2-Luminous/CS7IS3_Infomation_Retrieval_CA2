The "Free Iraqi Council," based in London, says that the Baghdad Government has leaked rumors claiming that Air Force Commander Staff Lieutenant General Muzahim Sa'b Hasan al-Tikriti is in Amman for medical reasons, but Arab diplomatic sources emphasize that he went to Amman on the direct orders of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to supervise the building of "secret" air bases to be used when necessary and, in times of despair, for escape because he now fears a coup by the military commanders closest to him at any moment. The "Council" also says that there is a mounting campaign of condemnation and denunciation in Sanaa and Aden because of the Saddam regime's increasing interference in the Yemeni crisis and fueling the fire there. It adds that a number of political figures and tribal chiefs and some sections of the press have expressed anger at the arrival of 20 Iraqi pilots in Sanaa and the payment of funds to some tribal chiefs and officers loyal to the Iraqi Ba'th party for the purpose of holding Western experts working in Yemen as hostages and assassinating supporters of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and accusing the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership of doing that in retaliation for the assassination of its supporters for which elements loyal to President Salih were blamed. A statement issued by the "Council," a copy of which has been received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, says that, at the internal level, there is growing alarm among most Iraqi merchants, especially those who move between Baghdad and Amman, after the death of Iraqi businessman al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Latif Bunyah in a road accident as he was driving his car to Jordan. Accusing fingers have been pointed at the Iraqi intelligence services and aides of the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy. It should be recalled that al-Hajj 'Abd-al-latif had loaned the Iraqi Government large sums of money and was in competition with 'Udayy for the control of the international Coca-Cola Company's agency. He also allegedly criticized the Iraqi Government's financial policy on more than one occasion.
