Wu told a press conference held here today by the Information Office of the State Council that on January 16, 1992, China reached a memorandum of understanding on the issue of intellectual property rights protection with the United States. China has kept its words in the memorandum thoroughly, which the U.S. side also admitted. Till now, the Law on Trademarks, the Patent Law, and the Law on Copyright have been passed in China, and its Law on Trademarks conforms to the Paris Convention for the protection of industrial property, of which China is the 95th member country. Since China signed the Madrid agreement for the international registration of trademarks, about ten thousand foreign trademarks have been protected in China. Moreover, China has also signed the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works, and the universal copyright convention. When answering a question about the U.S. view that the status of China's intellectual property rights protection posed another obstacle to America-Chinese ties, Wu said that the U.S. Government neither knows nor understands China's positive practice in this regard. She added that it is not wise to try to impose pressure. Having a vast territory and large population, China developed unevenly in different regions on the issue, Wu admitted. But she added that China will start a comprehensive education drive to strengthen its people's sense of intellectual property rights protection, since all countries, including China, are in need of protection of intellectual property rights. Wu said that China will open courts for intellectual property rights in some key cities. If evidence of violation of intellectual property rights were found, both Chinese and foreigners could sent the cases to court.
