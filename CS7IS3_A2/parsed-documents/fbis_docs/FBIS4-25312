The CAES is the highest academic body in engineering field in the country. On June 9, relevant leaders of the State Council briefed academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the CAES on ideas for the Ninth Five-Year Plan and Scientific and technological development programme within this period in the country. Academicians of the CAES will discuss and work out proposals of the strategy for the development of science and technology and the developmental goals in different stages in the future. [as received] As an expert in post and telecommunications, Mr. Zhu has made a great contribution in this field and since 1982, he has been the Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. Mr. Zhu said that another work needed to be done by the CAES was to enlarge its academician ranks. He rebuked the concept prevailing in the past that the social status of the engineering technicians should be lower than that of scientists, saying that from a long-term social and economic point of view, this idea was harmful. One of the aims for the establishment of the CAES was to raise the status of engineering technicians, therefore, those who have become leading academic personnel and made outstanding contributions in this field would be drawn into the academician ranks as soon as possible. China now has nearly 10 million engineering technicians.
