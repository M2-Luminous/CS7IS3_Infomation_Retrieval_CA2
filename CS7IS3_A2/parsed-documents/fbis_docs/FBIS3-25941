After hearing the reports, Cheng Weigao again urged that the party and government organs at various levels and their leading cadres should be honest and thrifty in their spending during the Spring Festival and that the discipline inspection and supervisory organs at various levels should strengthen supervision and inspections. Cheng Weigao stressed: The year 1994 is a year for package reform and breakthroughs in key areas. So long as the leading cadres at various levels maintain honesty and establish close contacts with the masses, the reform measures will be supported by the masses and reform progress smoothly. Party committees and governments at various levels should always regard the opposition to corruption and the maintenance of honesty as a political task and grasp it. At present, we should grasp the issue of honesty during the Spring Festival. Leading cadres at various levels should take the lead in being honest. As for localities, departments, and units where many serious problems emerge, their principal leading cadres should first be called to account.
