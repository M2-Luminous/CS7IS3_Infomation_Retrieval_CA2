In the event that the condition, as reflected by current databases, does not meet the required criteria, for any segment of Interstate, the State's request for funding transfer may not be approved unless the State certifies that the deficient segments have either been subsequently upgraded to meet the required criteria or that the work necessary to correct any such deficient segments is included in the approved State Transportation Improvement Program, required by 23 U.S.C. 135(f).
