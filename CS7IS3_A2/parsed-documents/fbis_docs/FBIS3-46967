The team will shortly ask the Korean Embassy in Paris to file a formal accusation of fraud against Fuan with the French Government but will suspend the filing of formal charges against Chu as he went abroad just before the case surfaced in mid-December. For their negligence, which resulted in no action in spite of the non-arrival of 90mm recoilless rifle ammunition one year and seven months after payment was made and in no steps to prevent Chu's flight from the country, disciplinary action will be taken against former and incumbent DLA directors, the announcement said. Four DLA officials involved in the scam have been arrested on charges of neglect of duty, forgery of documents and taking bribes. They are Army Col. Yun Sam-song, Navy Capt. To Chong-il, and civilian employees Hong Kol-hui and Yi Myong-ku. Yang Kyu-sok, operating officer of United Shipping Co., was arrested for having forged a bill of lading for Chu and Fuan to withdraw the payment for the non-existent shells from the Korea Exchange Bank's Paris Branch. Of the 6.7 million dollars they swindled out of the DLA, just 630,000 dollars was found in Chu's bank accounts in Seoul, the announcement said. As the investigation is complete, the Defense Ministry will reform the defense procurement system by the end of June to strengthen the function of foreign procurement and transfer as many domestic procurements as possible to the office of supply. In addition, the Ministry will lay legal grounds for strictly punishing arms dealers who break a contract.
