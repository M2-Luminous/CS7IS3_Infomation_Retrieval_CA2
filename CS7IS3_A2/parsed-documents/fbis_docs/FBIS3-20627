Coal exports were 18.05 million tons. Coal makes up over 75 percent of China's primary energy resources, and 82 percent of the electric power generated last year was produced from coal. Last year China freed up coal prices in the east and eliminated the 2 billion yuan subsidies, and when the key coal mines got into the market they concentrated on raising their economic performance, shipped and sold specific volumes, closed inefficient mines at 42 locations, and transferred 150,000 workers to diversified industries, while coal production for the year reached 470 million tons, which was 12.50 million tons less than the previous year. The per capita raw coal production rate for key national coal enterprises was 1.4 tons, reducing the annual losses to less than 4 billion yuan, a reduction of more than 30 percent in losses over the previous year. The collective output of local coal mines and village coal mines was greatly increased over the previous year. Diversification of national coal mines increased phenomenally last year, many products from domestic enterprises moved into the socialist market. A line of Sino-foreign joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises were formed. Last year's output value reached 18 billion yuan, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. There are now over 20 kinds of business activities in electric power, chemical industry, building materials, machinery, commercial trade, agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing, at nearly 20,000 factory locations, producing more than 4,000 kinds of products, and there are more than 20 diversified mining operations with output values in excess of 100 million yuan. According to Minister Wang Senhao of the Ministry of Coal, all coal prices will be freed up this year, and it is estimated that raw coal output will reach 1.16 billion tons, and mine shafts will be under construction at seven locations, which will increase the annual production capability by 11.55 million tons; new mine shafts will go into operation at 18 locations, increasing production capability by 31.99 million tons, and the output value of diversified operations will increase 15 percent. More local coal enterprises will be converted to coal-processing to develop more comprehensive operations. Mining districts with suitable circumstances will implement a more unified scale of construction and management combining coal, electricity, roads, and harbor operations, and at the same time electric power, metallurgy, chemical industry, and railroad enterprises will be encouraged to invest in coal operations. Areas lacking coal will be urged to go to rich coal districts to invest in coal mining operations and to engage in Sino-foreign commercial joint ventures and cooperative forms of coal operations.
