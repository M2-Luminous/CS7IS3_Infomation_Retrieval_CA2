Five Kuomintang legislators, including Lin Shou-shan and Lin Chih-chia, called on the Clinton administration to require the same export inspections of US software as the US Trade Representative officials have recommended for Taipei. Noting that US customs statistics show US IPR violations are only one percent behind those of Taiwan, the legislators called for equal treatment for the two countries. "It is fair to ask the US to impose a similar export inspection system to curb IPR violation," they said in a joint statement released Wednesday morning. The statement also called on the US to revise its patent law to add prison terms for IPR violators, as Taiwan is being asked to do the same. Legislators Ting Shou-chung, Wei Yung and Chao Yung-ching also signed the statement.
