This reporter interviewed officers with the relevant department and learned that the report was inconsistent with the facts and was totally fabricated. Over the past few years, Zheng Musheng, a peasant from Dongkou County, Hunan Province, has swindled people, stirred up trouble among the masses, and seriously disturbed public order by spreading rumors and fallacies such as that "an enormous calamity will befall the world in 1999, so it is sensible to eat as much as one can and to be idle without bothering about construction." In addition, he treated patients in superstitious ways and caused one person's death and several people's conditions to worsen. On 1 January he was detained by the local public security organ according to the law. During the detention, he was beaten and seriously injured by 13 prison inmates including Long Shunsheng, Huang Mingyong, and others for his "refusal to listen to their advice and to make the place clean." When the prison guards found him wounded, he was immediately sent to a hospital, but died after all rescue measures proved ineffectual. After the public security organ fully ascertained that Long Shunsheng, Huang Mingyong, and others had beaten Zheng Musheng to death, it arrested the assailants according to law and made the proper arrangements for Zheng's funeral. The relevant department has also taken action against the person responsible for the prison and reinforced its personnel.
