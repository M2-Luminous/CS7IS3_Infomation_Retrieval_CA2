Contrary to Carter's assertion, it is hard to say whether the crisis is over. There may yet be a relapse. As a matter of fact, however, this once again reveals the weakness of the U.S. Government's diplomacy. Washington Is Neither Cold Nor Hot Carter was the U.S. President for only four years. He entered the White House bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind like a preacher. He did not achieve very much despite arduous efforts in administration, so he was not reelected president. After he withdrew from office, he ran a peanut farm while silently devoting his efforts to peace. Unlike other retired U.S. presidents, he has frequently been involved in seemingly ordinary activities which were actually quite meaningful. This frequently earned him praise. His shuttle mediation between Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington was a rare activity which showed a magnanimous attitude. He obtained a positive response from Pyongyang, and preparations are being made for a historic summit meeting between the two Kims. Washington was suspicious in the beginning, but later admitted that "there are indications of hope," thus softening its stance. Viewing the responses of White House officials and Clinton, there is still a gap between the U.S. Government, Carter, and Seoul in their assessment of the situation. Carter said that "complete agreement" had been reached with Pyongyang on major issues, whereas Seoul nimbly responded to Kim Il-song's proposal for a summit meeting, immediately agreeing and actively making preparations. Comparatively speaking, Washington is neither cold nor hot. Washington Does Not Intend To Have a Dialogue On one hand, Washington warmly welcomed some of Pyongyang's positive actions, such as not expelling the two International Atomic Energy Agency inspection personnel. On the other, it coldly responded to Pyongyang's proposal to freeze its nuclear program, asking Pyongyang to make a written guarantee apart from allowing nuclear inspections. Washington neither objected to nor supported the proposal for a summit, indicating its unwillingness to participate in a dialogue. Washington and Pyongyang have conducted two rounds of formal talks. In Washington's mind, the talks are a method for putting pressure on Pyongyang, not improving understanding and reducing misunderstandings. Taking advantage of the DPRK's hope to rebuild its relations with the United States, it has set many preconditions for the talks and has "raised the prices." After Carter reported on the results of his Pyongyang tour, the United States revoked its demand that the DPRK explain its previous replacement of nuclear materials. This may be considered a kind of progress. Carter's Pyongyang tour precisely suggests that dialogue is the most important element. Carter conducted his mediation effort as an "ordinary civilian." His success shows the White House's incompetence. Rumors About Washington Washington's method of handling the crisis was clumsy. If Carter had not appeared on the scene and reversed the development trend, Clinton would have found himself in an even more awkward position. The U.S. threat of sanctions is baffling. The United States has no economic or military relations with the DPRK, and its sanctions must be enforced by a third party. Countries which can play a role in this respect are China, Japan, Russia, the ROK, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The U.S. allies in Europe cannot help. China is opposed to sanctions; Japan and the ROK are hesitating; Iran, Iraq, and Syria will not take instructions from the United States; and the only one left is Russia. When working out a UN Security Council resolution, the United States did not consult Russia, which made it so angry that it was not willing to cooperate with the United States. As a result, their relations were tense for some time. When Carter said in Pyongyang that sanctions had been put aside, Washington immediately denied it. As a matter of fact, Carter had hit the mark quite by accident. At a time when U.S. diplomacy is in a mess, rumors are spreading in Washington that the secretary of state will be replaced, and the candidate is said to be Secretary of Treasury Bentsen. These rumors have been spreading for months. Even if Clinton does not have this intention, it also suggests that people in and outside the government are dissatisfied with U.S. foreign policy.
