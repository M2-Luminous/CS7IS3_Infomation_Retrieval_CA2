The opening of the bridge of "brotherhood and unity" will for the first time link the Muslim-dominated inner-city area with the part held by the Serbs in Sarajevo since the Bosnian capital came under siege in April 1992. "Both sides have agreed to the opening" beginning Monday noon, Spokesman Rob Annink said. The bridge, now cleared of mines, will be guarded by UN peacekeepers and Muslim and Serb troops, with access to the bridge controlled by Muslims and Serbs separately on each side. The bridge was once a no-man's land between the front-line Muslim and Serb forces and thus split Sarajevo into two parts. Its opening is the first step to restore peace to the city under a plan proposed by Michael Rose, commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia. Rose said his next step is to open routes between Muslim and Serb-controlled neighborhoods along with the roads in and out of the city. Meanwhile, the passage connecting Sarajevo with the outside will also be open on Monday, Annink announced today. Reports reaching here said that a UN humanitarian relief convoy will be heading for Sarajevo tomorrow via Muslim, Serb and Croat-held areas, with passage permit from the warring factions no longer necessary. Under Rose's order, the convoy will be escorted by UN troops, and the aircraft of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will provide air cover and resort to "necessary military means" if it is intercepted.
