The foreign affairs policy of the MSZP--which has been elected to government--and the party's relations with Hungarians living beyond our border are on our agenda here. [passage omitted] Do you consider a wide-ranging regional autonomy justified where the composition of population is suitable for this, for example in Szeklerland? [passage omitted] [Kovacs] I think that the demand for autonomy is a justified endeavor of the Hungarians beyond the border wherever they live in large numbers on a certain territory. Furthermore, Szeklerland is in a special situation; it is rather far away from the Hungarian border, so the idea of fulfilling the demand for autonomy would, by any chance, lead to the upsetting of borders. This is certainly an important and, at the same time, sensitive issue, which can only be approached and put on the talks agenda if the sides concerned approach it with good intentions. This is why we consider it so important that Hungary and its neighbors should have basically good relations, because these issues cannot even be put on the agenda without it. [Announcer] Yes, Gyula Horn has several times mentioned that there is a need for a historical reconciliation with our neighbors. What does this mean exactly? [Kovacs] We mean that we have to settle our relations, first of all with Slovakia and Romania, which have become very tense over the past years. We have never said....[pauses] We even emphasized that this was not exclusively the Hungarian Government's fault. What we said was that the Hungarian Government was not able to handle the tensions, which had occurred for objective reasons, for example, because of the nationalistic endeavors in neighboring countries and, on the other hand, the Hungarian Government itself contributed to this tension with some clumsy statements and unfortunate steps. Well, we are of the view that the settlement of these relations is inevitable for several reasons. On the one hand, it is obvious that relations with our neighbors constitute a security policy issue for Hungary; on the other hand, Hungary--and any country in general--cannot exist without pursuing extensive economic-commercial cooperation with its neighbors. The third specific question is that the life of Hungarians living in neighboring countries cannot improve if we forego, from the outset, the means provided by settled relations and dialogue. Where else could we raise these problems? I do not believe that any kind of pressure can be put on our neighbors with canceled visits--or even with visits that have not taken place. The experience of the past four years has not proved the usefulness or productivity of this approach. Hungary does not have such influence that any kind of effect could be achieved in this way. With certain exaggeration I can even say that Hungary cannot put pressure on Romania with success because Romania is twice as big as Hungary, and we cannot put pressure on Slovakia because Slovakia is half as big as Hungary and, therefore, twice as sensitive. Exercising pressure must be excluded from our means. [Announcer] [passage omitted] What kind of guarantees does the MSZP see that Romanians will observe their minimal promises to the Hungarian minority, since they have never kept their promises in 70 years? [Kovacs] I think that it is an absurdity to sit down at the international negotiations table with the assumption that my partner is lying or that my partner has never kept his promises. This is an absurdity. In this case there is no point in sitting down, there is no sense in negotiations. [passage omitted] I see only one guarantee. There is a need for an international--bilateral--agreement, the frequently mentioned Basic Treaty, which includes real elements of guarantee, in respect of which the sides can be called to account. I have also hopes for the initiative called the Balladur plan, the opening conference for which took place in Paris just last week. [Announcer] Does the MSZP--and you personally--think that the so-called Ukrainian clause could be included in these basic treaties? [Kovacs] I think, yes. However, I have to add.... [Announcer, interrupting] Both in the Hungarian-Romanian and the Hungarian-Slovak Basic Treaties? [Kovacs] I think, basically yes. However, those who say this, that this Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty cannot set a precedent, are also right. A Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty cannot set a precedent for a Hungarian-Slovak or a Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty on a one-to-one basis. However, I regard it as a mistake that, at the time some government politicians categorically said that a basic treaty of this kind will not be concluded any more. What kind of basic treaties will we then conclude? Naturally, the Hungarian-Ukrainian, the Hungarian-Romanian, and the Hungarian-Slovak basic treaties will not literally match. However, I think that the content of the future basic treaties will be similar to the Hungarian-Ukrainian one. It will not be possible to evade two questions in them: One of them is the repeated confirmation of the borders, the renouncing of territorial claims; our neighbors insist on it and we have no reasons for evading them, because we really do not have territorial claims, because we really do accept the current borders. This is not an argument because we have confirmed it hundreds of times. Since we have accepted it hundreds of times, there is no reason why we should not do it another time. Another question that cannot be evaded is guaranteeing the rights of the Hungarian minority living there and--let me add, since it is a bilateral matter--the minorities living here. [passage omitted] Our political rivals often accuse us of intending to conclude unilateral basic treaties. [passage omitted] We have never said that. We have always stressed that the border issue and the minority issue cannot be evaded either in the basic treaties. [Announcer] [passage omitted] Will the future Hungarian Government undertake the representation of Hungarians beyond the border if they cannot represent themselves--as it happened at the opening conference--in the European stability process. [Kovacs] [passage omitted] Agreements on minorities in this matter, with which the minorities themselves do not agree, cannot be concluded. This is obviously absurd. Therefore, some kind of solution has to be found so that the minorities can present their endeavors and interests. [passage omitted] Hungarian foreign policy, in my view, should not be considering whether to undertake or not the representation of the minorities, but far more than that: the question of how to convince the sides concerned in the conference that the minorities have to have their say. A solution has to be found for this. [Announcer] [passage omitted] What are the MSZP's plans with Duna Television? Will the MSZP support it with grants from the budget? [Kovacs] [passage omitted] If Duna Television really usefully contributes to the cause of normal relations between Hungary and its neighbors and--by this, together with this, parallel with this--the cause of Hungarians beyond the border, I think that Duna Television will be worthy of support. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Thank you very much for the answers from Laszlo Kovacs, about whom it is being said in Budapest that he is a possible candidate for the post of foreign minister. [Kovacs] I think that it will be decided by the coalition talks, with particular regard to the question of which of the possible coalition partners will get the foreign affairs portfolio.... [Announcer interrupting] But if it is offered? [Kovacs] Naturally, this is such a professional challenge--it will be the peak of my foreign affairs career--that I would say yes, but at the moment we are not talking about it. [Announcer] Thank you very much.
