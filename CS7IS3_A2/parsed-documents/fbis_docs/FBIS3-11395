In its Monday editorial, the newspaper indicates that "there is often a trend to seek solutions to the idle (industrial) facilities based only on deals with foreign capital, which are important but do not constitute the only way out." The publication points out that "it is necessary to use all association possibilities among Cuban enterprises -- a sort of `South to South cooperation' -- on a local scale." It later says: "There are businessmen who prefer to bring anything from abroad, using such arguments as quality, timeliness, and efficiency." It goes on by saying: "This, which could be justified in some cases, in others implies, and we know it, an inadmissible resurgence of taking the easy way out, narrow vision, and an inability to see the country's problems in a comprehensive manner." TRABAJADORES believes that "there is actually a coherent policy designed to reorganize and reestablish the national economy but that all the economic sectors will not come out of the serious crisis Cuba currently faces at the same time or in the same way." TRABAJADORES reiterates: "It is necessary to motivate the strategic sectors that generate foreign currency, manufacture substitutes for things that are imported, ensure the supply of food, and those sectors that have the greatest chance to recover and thrive." However, the publication points out that "the principle of the struggle we are waging should not be based on the idea of `every man for himself' or `let us save a lucky few in some sectors.'" TRABAJADORES underscores that "our philosophy, which is just and realistic, is that of saving all and viewing the country and the people as one entity."
