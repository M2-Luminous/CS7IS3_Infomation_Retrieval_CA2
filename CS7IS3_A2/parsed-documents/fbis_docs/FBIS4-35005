The TCU, which made a general evaluation of the National Privatization Program (PND), advocated a reformulation of the program. The devaluation of shares could be avoided through a parcelled sale of shares over a specific period, PCU member Bento Bugarin said. According to the auditors who reviewed the program, only 5.4 percent of all collected funds were in currency, which helped alleviate the Union's serious fiscal situation. The rest of the price paid for privatized enterprises was paid with government debt certificates, which were bought with substantial discounts on the financial market. The TCU found out that capital investments made by the government in the enterprises within the PND were several times higher than the amounts that were finally obtained from the transaction. According to Bugarin, the funds that were obtained are not aimed at any specific objective. This means that they did not contribute to developing any activities in which the participation of the state is essential, like the construction of schools or hospitals or other objectives that might improve the people's living standards. According to the TCU report, the lack of clear rules for the privatization process and for management of the privatized enterprises led to the formation of monopolies in areas like the iron and steel sector. For Bugarin, who read the report at the TCU plenary session, the sale of share packages, the sale of a low number of shares to employees, and the lack of incentives for the participation of small investors prevented the democratization of capital, permitting the sale of enterprises to single economic groups, which is something that goes against PND objectives. One of the factors that was noticeable to TCU technicians was the participation of the Companhia Vale do Rio Doce in the auctions. The Constitution sets forth that Congress must authorize state enterprises' participation in private enterprises.
