Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the realities of China's reform and development, deputies pointed out the need to unswervingly uphold the policy of promoting material and spiritual progress at the same time and attaching equal importance to both in the entire process of reform, opening up, and modernization, and to strengthen in a concrete way the building of socialist spiritual civilization, regarding it as a common task for all fronts and departments. Some leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC Standing Committee, and the State Council took part in various delegations' discussions of state affairs and listened to fellow deputies' views and suggestions. Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor, took part in the Tianjin delegation's discussion, focusing on the question of building a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises. He said: In reforming the system of property rights, state-owned enterprises must concentrate on three areas: 1) building a new system to monitor, control, and manage state-owned assets; 2) establishing the rights of enterprises, as legal persons, to own properties and perfecting the system for enterprises to act as legal persons; and 3) establishing and perfecting the leadership and organizational structures of modern enterprises. He stressed: In the course of establishing a modern enterprise system, we must handle well relations between enterprises on the one hand and government, society, the market, and the owners on the other and between the leadership apparatus of an enterprise and its workers. We must make theoretical inquiry into this issue, and more importantly, we must probe it in practice and review and popularize what has been gained in practice. During his discussion with the Ningxia delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: No matter how enterprises develop in form, the character of state-owned enterprises must not change. We must take steps to preserve and increase the value of state assets; we must not let it decline or disappear. Taking part in the Jiangxi delegation's examination and discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his views on reforming and develop education. He said: Education is of vital importance to the development of the national economy. The fundamental solution for education is reform. In carrying out education reform, we must first adjust the macroeducation structure, concentrating our resources on basic education. Without a successful basic education, higher education will end up as "castles in the air." Second, we must not impose uniformity in promoting the nine-year compulsory education. We must not demand uniform education, ignoring differences between urban and rural areas and between developed and underdeveloped areas. Third, we must step up reform with the goal to improve education standards and increase the beneficial results of higher education. Fourth, we must strengthen moral education and conduct education in patriotism and collectivism to bring up morally, intellectually, and physically developed people. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, took part in the Sichuan delegation's discussions. Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the Guangdong and Guangzhou delegation's discussions; and State Councillor Ismail Amat participated in the Qinghai delegation's discussion. Each expressed his views on agricultural issues and on the question of developing the economy in nationality areas. Wen Jiabao said: Agriculture affects the country's overall interests. At present we must carry out three major tasks: First, we must stabilize and increase grain and cotton outputs and make the "vegetable basket" project successful. Second, we must make continuous efforts to increase peasants' income. After stabilizing grain and cotton production, we must make vigorous efforts to diversify operations and develop secondary and tertiary industries. Third, we must safeguard stability in rural society. We must stabilize and perfect the party's various basic rural policies, successfully guide and protect the peasants' initiatives, and vigorously implement the various measures to perform concrete services for the peasants. Speaking of the work of helping poor people, Chen Junsheng said: We must establish models who lifted themselves out of poverty and became well-off and give wide publicity to representative figures who shook off poverty and set out on the road to prosperity through self-reliance, hard struggle, thrift, and diligence. We must rely on advanced models to lead the march and overcome the mentality of waiting for, depending on, and demanding state preferential policies for relief. Chen Junsheng also urged Guangdong to make determined efforts to maintain the area of its grain crops, increase grain output, and work hard to raise the level of self-sufficiency in grain supply. Ismail Amat said: For Qinghai to accelerate economic development, first the state should provide it with the support it needs; second, developed regions should provide it with assistance; and third, Qinghai should double its own efforts, which is the most crucial of the three. During her participation in the Shanghai delegation's discussion, State Councillor Peng Peiyun briefed the deputies on China's current family planning work. State Councillors Chi Haotian and Song Jian took part in the discussions of the Guangxi and Liaoning delegations, respectively. In their discussion of the policy of doing two types of work at the same time and attaching equal importance to both, deputies pointed out that strengthening the building of socialist spiritual civilization is an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and an objective requirement for accelerating reform and develop. Gu Changchun, a deputy from Liaoning, said: Premier Li Peng's government work report gives prominence to the thinking of doing two types of work at the same time and attaching equal importance to both in the process of building a socialist market economic structure and the thinking of taking the road of developing the economy and culture simultaneously. In setting forth this year's economic construction and development tasks, the report also stresses the building of socialist spiritual civilization and the development of science and technology, education, and culture. These ideas of all-around social development conform with the trend of development of human society and the reality of Chinese society. Only by acting in accordance with these ideas and relying wholeheartedly on the broad masses of people can we ensure successful implementation of this year's reform measures. In the discussions, deputies representing the People's Liberation Army said: To develop a socialist market economy, it is essential that we make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization. The practice of reform and opening up has proved that a society's spiritual civilization will not automatically advance once the economy develops. Relentless and concrete efforts must be made to build spiritual civilization. We must answer the CPC Central Committee's call to deepen activities to learn from Xu Honggang, foster the Lei Feng spirit of the new period, and vigorously combat corruption and promote honest government. Leading cadres at all levels must set themselves as an example; start from themselves in maintaining integrity and exercising self-discipline; establish a good image in promoting clean, efficient government; and earnestly and comprehensively tackle problems of public order to create a good social and cultural environment for the speedy establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Pointing out Shanghai's reality, Wu Bangguo, a Shanghai deputy, pointed out that to ensure Shanghai's economic development, its social ethics and public order must not weaken. We must follow Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and turn in a satisfactory report card in both material and spiritual civilization to the central authorities and Shanghai's people. We must carry out a good education in patriotism, collectivism, and socialism and advocate and foster the pioneering spirit proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin to bring up a new generation of better-educated people with idealism and a strong sense of discipline.
