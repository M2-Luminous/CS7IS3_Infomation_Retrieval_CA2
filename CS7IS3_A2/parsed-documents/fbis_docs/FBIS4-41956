Nor do they want any sanctions to be imposed on Korea, so as to avoid making the situation more complex. This was stated today by Qian Qichen, deputy premier of the State Council who is also the foreign minister of the People's Republic of China, during his visit to the Moscow State University named after M.B. Lomonosov. Replying to questions asked by the university lecturers about similarities and differences in the approaches of China and Russia to the issue of the settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the head of the foreign policy department of the People's Republic of China stressed that there are no radical differences between Moscow's and Beijing's stands on this issue. "We understand Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral international conference," Qian Qichen said. At the same time, he said, the Chinese side believes that the nuclear problem in the DPRK must be resolved within the framework of the dialogues which currently exist between South Korea and North Korea, between the DPRK and the United States, and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Chinese foreign minister expressed the hope that the forthcoming round of talks in Geneva between Pyongyang and Washington will open up new opportunities to settle these problems.
