Aleksey Kolesnik, cochairman of the party and deputy of the republic's parliament, has told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the idea of concluding the agreement was discussed with Sergey Shakhray back on 26 April at the inauguration of the PRES Tatarstan branch. Mr. Kolesnik said in a conversation with your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the agreement looks certain to be based on bilateral, public ("non-state!" -- the "Unity and Progress" chairman stressed) control over the implementation of the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia. In this regard, Aleksey Kolesnik pointed out, KOMMERSANT-DAILY's allegations on 27 April that his party plans to use the cooperation with PRES "to strengthen its position in its standoff with the authorities" are completely groundless. In a statement on the KOMMERSANT-DAILY publication, the "Unity and Progress" executive committee said: "The party has not accused President Mintimer Shaymiyev of `dragging his feet on reform and being too careful in carrying it out,' because according to our program we are interested not so much in speed, but rather in the effectiveness of reform. We do not think that confrontation is the best means to achieve political objectives. The experience of Tatarstan's talks with Russia has shown that only through dialogue can positive results be achieved." At the same time, it is evident that a split is emerging among the party leaders themselves over approaches to economic reform. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already reported that another cochairman of the "Unity and Progress" party, its ideologist and presidential adviser (now former), Rafael Khakimov, published a series of articles in the local press accusing the republic's leaders of creating an atmosphere of stagnation in Tatarstan. The executive committee of the party's political council distanced itself from the "rebellious statements" by Rafael Khakimov, calling these publications "his private opinion." However, although "Unity and Progress" leaders keep insisting that their party is not in opposition to the authorities, the government appears to hold a different view. Filza Khamidullin, chairman of the Tatarstan State Economy Committee, refused to cooperate with party specialists when drawing up a government anti- crisis program. For its part, the "Unity and Progress" executive committee, familiar only with isolated fragments of the draft anti-crisis program being prepared by the State Economy Committee, nonetheless sees it as "not sufficiently market-oriented." Given that the president has sympathetically reacted to the party's economic policy concept and that "Unity and Progress" is made up primarily of the republic's city and rayon nomenklatura, the State Economy Committee's position appears fairly shaky. Mr. Kolesnik explains the current situation as follows: "The expressly market-oriented nature of our program and Mr. Khamidullin's dogged silence in response to our calls for cooperation confirms that someone does not want change but wishes to preserve the Tatarstan economy in its current form." Meanwhile, the issue is apparently not only that of different views on the situation in the republic's economy and further economic reform. In the view of observers, a conflict between political elites -- the old party nomenklatura currently in power and "second-ranking" bureaucrats who have been denied access to power -- is deepening in Tatarstan.
