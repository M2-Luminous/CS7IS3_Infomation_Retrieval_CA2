"Regrettably, our numerous partners in the West fail to understand that some Russian politicians, notably the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, are more interesting for medical than for political science. Western businessmen tend to abandon plans to invest in Russia after reading in newspapers what such politicos have to say. The net effect is obviously anti-Russian, not patriotic," he said. Kozyrev was confident that Zhirinovskiy, a clownish figure, would not be elected anywhere again. Kozyrev would like to switch the foreign policy from ideology and man-made problems inherited from the cold war to everyday problems of common people, above all in Russian outlying regions which make the core of Russia. In Kozyrev's view, "the state should not harm the regions or obstruct their development. There is much talk of unemployment while roads deep inside Russia are such that one is afraid of riding them. Road construction is the sphere where quite a lot of people can be employed."
