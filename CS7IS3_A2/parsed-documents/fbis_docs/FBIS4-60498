FBIS4-60498 "drnes102_k_94004" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 24 May 1994 IRAQ Kurdistan Democratic Party Urges Irbil Withdrawal Kurdistan Democratic Party Urges Irbil Withdrawal JN2505145794 (Clandestine) Voice of Iraqi Kurdistan in Arabic 1528 GMT 24 May 94 JN2505145794 (Clandestine) Voice of Iraqi Kurdistan Arabic BFN [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Dear listeners, honorable citizens: Our unified Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] urges a quick normalization of the situation in the city of Irbil and all over Irbil Governorate as a basic step toward detente. Decisions in this regard were made with the participation of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front [IKF] and the political bureaus of both parties and under the sponsor of the unified Iraqi National Congress [INC]: 1. On 14 May 1994, it was agreed that both side's troops be removed from the roofs of houses and buildings inside Irbil, including the buildings of the parliament and the ministries. 2. It was agreed that forces be withdrawn from inside Irbil on 23 May. 3. At a meeting held in the operation room at the INC's headquarters on 22 May, conferees stressed the need to implement the previous agreements by starting withdrawal of both sides' forces from Irbil. 4. But the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] is still procrastinating and has not carried out any part of the agreements. On the contrary, it continues to deploy its forces in other areas of Irbil and is still concentrating its forces in areas near Irbil like (?Banislau). The fighters of the PUK are still in control of the buildings of the parliament, the ministries, and the Council of Ministers that are adjacent to the parliament building. Thus, the Irbil residents are continuing to appeal to both sides to withdraw their forces to keep the fire of fighting away from the city. O citizens, this stalemate poses danger to Irbil's security, particularly since the presence of such a large number of fighters leads to regrettable daily clashes. We in the KDP add our voices to those of the honorable residents of Irbil and call for the implementation of agreements by totally withdrawing from the city of Irbil and from all over Irbil Governorate as a basic step in this stage. We have announced our readiness to withdraw our forces from the Shaqlawah axis. However, the PUK is still regrettably procrastinating. Once again, we place the Irbil residents before these realities, and we assert that the interests of both sides require withdrawal from Irbil [words indistinct]. The brothers in the PUK sometimes raise objections to what they call violations in other areas of Kurdistan. Whatever these objections may be, they do not absolve us all from the duty of preserving the city of Irbil's security and its residents' safety, particularly since international organizations and UN personnel are present in the capital. The Irbil masses have demanded in several ways steps to keep the fire of fighting away from inside the city and to stop fighting everywhere, just as the IKF, the INC, and our people's friends have demanded. We in the KDP call warmly and honestly for responding to the popular calls from Irbil, from all over Kurdistan, from national and social figures, from ulemas, from various popular sectors, and from the Iraqi and Kurdistan national forces and parties and for quickly putting an end to this deteriorating situation inside Irbil. In addition to this, the domination of the city by the two sides' forces has paralyzed the parliament and the Kurdistan Region's Government. It is well known that the fighters of the PUK have not yet withdrawn from the buildings of the parliament and the ministries. They have also erected barricades and checkpoints in the streets leading to the buildings of the parliament and the Council of Ministers. We beseech Almighty God to help us. God supports honest people. God's peace, mercy, and blesses be upon you.
