Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Carnegie Natural Gas Company (Carnegie), pursuant to sections 31.3 (a)(5) and (b)(5) of Carnegie's FERC Gas Tariff and the Commission's orders in Carnegie's restructuring proceeding in Docket No. RS92&hyph;30&hyph;000, submitted a report regarding its Account No. 191 to indicate the final balance in its account, and to indicate the adjustments necessary to the amounts collected or refunded to reflect the final posting to that account. Carnegie states that its filing includes two separate Account No. 191 subaccount reconciliation reports. The first, described in section 31.3(a), of Carnegie's tariff addresses unrecovered gas costs included in Account No. 191 prior to October 1, 1993, excluding amounts direct billed to Carnegie Account No. 191 transition costs by its upstream pipeline supplier, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern). Carnegie also states that the second report, described in section 31.3(b), addresses transition costs directly billed to Carnegie by Texas Eastern. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 18 CFR 385.211). All motions or protests should be filed on or before August 12, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A.
