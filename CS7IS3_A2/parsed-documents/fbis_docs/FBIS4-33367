Colombia will open its doors to all organizations that oversee human rights and display all acts of violence, facing up to reality without issuing unilateral, incomplete, or generalized information. The strategy, according to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio, is the defense and promotion of a search to end impunity. [Begin recording] [Sanin] We admit there are human rights problems in Colombia. What we cannot accept is the assertion by London's Amnesty International that the Colombian Government is involved in these violations. We encourage and defend human rights as a government. We do not accept the generalization made on violations of human rights by the Armed Forces either. [Pardo] This should also be seen in the context of Colombia's crime and violence. It is not the same to have human rights violated in a perfect state, a state where everything is absolutely controlled, and where justice works like clockwork, rather than a state where there are constant reforms, a state that is developing new mechanisms and has overcome huge problems in its integration and judicial system. [end recording] In today's meeting with the Colombian ambassadors to the European Union, the defense minister broached the topic of police reforms, which is one of the bases for the resolve to change. To reaffirm this will to change, the government would be willing to invite an Amnesty International commission to verify the situation on site. All these arguments have become even more heated with the report by the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights released a few days ago. Colombia does not get high marks from this report either. This document adds to Amnesty International's report and is what has the argument running red hot regarding the country's situation and reality. [Begin OAS representative Raul Valladares recording] Due to the complexity of the Colombian situation, even greater efforts are called for, and this is basically what the report calls for. [end recording] The argument is based on whether the human rights studies in Colombia are objective. For the Colombian Government, the lack of credibility of human rights reports, such as Amnesty International's, lies in the source of the data. The president, however, is not clear either on what investigative methodology is used. [Begin presidential human rights adviser Carlos de Roux recording] The problem, nevertheless, is that one cannot say that most political homicides in Colombia are committed by public force members or criminal public force members. The public force is not responsible for most of these murders, and this is where Amnesty International's report is not truthful. [end recording] A summit meeting will be held this afternoon between representatives of human rights organizations and the government to discuss criteria and face up to the problem. Human Rights Ombudsman Jaime Cordoba Trivino said that, although the human rights violations reports are exaggerated, the truth is that Colombia is also responsible. He added fuel to the argument by saying that Colombia is treating the matter mildly. [Begin Cordoba recording] Human rights in Colombia is far more than a problem of international image. More than the solicitous actions of our ambassadors to the EC and the United States, what is really required is urgent government action, which should be fully committed to the Constitution and fully open and which should set out from the unquestionable basis of admitting that the truth of the matter is that it is very serious. [end recording] Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper believes that an intermediate position should be sought in order to neutralize the serious economic effects that this argument could have at the international level. [Begin Samper recording] Colombia should not attempt to hide the fact that human rights are violated. When these are proved we should accept this responsibility, but likewise, we expect international organizations to accept that Colombia is making efforts to control human rights violations. [end recording]
