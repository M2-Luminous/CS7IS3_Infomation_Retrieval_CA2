"Democracy is only applied when it is convenient to serving certain parties' interests, said Deputy 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabr (Amman First district), who charged that some of the issues raised by lawmakers in the form of questions to the government were disregarded during the House's first ordinary session which ended last week. The IAF deputy told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the "sensitive issues" addressed by deputies were deliberately ignored by Mr. al-Masri who, he said, has failed to present them to the government. Mr. Jabr said he had questioned the government on why it had allowed 30 Jews into Jordan, but denied entry to two prominent Egyptian Islamists. He said Mr. al-Masri did not pass his question on to the government. The deputy also accused Mr. al-Masri of "overlooking" an IAF legislators' bid to introduce a law banning the consumption of alcohol in the country. A draft law on alcohol consumption has been presented by the government to the House, which referred it to its Parliamentary Committee. Parliamentary sources told the JORDAN TIMES the House has decided to "sit on the legislation" to avoid the controversy the draft legislation is expected to raise. The draft law puts some restrictions on the sale of alcohol, but does not ban its consumption in the Kingdom. The IAF wants alcohol prohibited in accordance with Islamic Sharia and is expected to use religious clauses clearly forbidding the use of alcohol by Muslims to embarrass deputies who would not support its bid. Other members of the House shared Mr. Jabr's discontent with Mr. al-Masri's "casual brushing" off of their questions and had demanded that all their queries be answered by the government in the House's last meeting on March 22. But that could not be done and many questions went unanswered by the government, Mr. Jabr said. During one of the last sessions of the House, several IAF deputies told Mr. al-Masri that he had nothing to "fear" in presenting deputies' inquiries to the government as it would be "pleased" to respond to all inquiries, some of which may be "too important" to leave unanswered. Mr. al-Masri, however, dismissed the deputies' accusations, saying that these measures had to be taken because of the "lack of time," and that new arrangements would be made to accommodate deputies' requirements. The disregard for democracy began long before this House convened in November last year, Mr. Jabr charged. He said it began when the government unilaterally introduced the one-person one-vote formula into the Election Law, which the Islamists and many other parties opposed. Mr. Jabr added that deputies have demanded to be presented with a new draft election law of what he termed was of a more democratic nature, to be discussed in their extraordinary session which, parliamentary sources said, is expected to convene next month.
