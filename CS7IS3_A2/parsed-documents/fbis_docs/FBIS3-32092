The act was formalised Tuesday through an exchange of notes between representatives of the two countries in the U.S. capital, Washington. On January 4, Barbados Foreign Minister Brandford Taitt and South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha had exchanged letters indicating their intention to establish formal relations. For over 30 years, Barbados had maintained a firm distance from South Africa because of apartheid. The thaw in relations occurred after South Africa started dismantling the system of racial segregation. This process will lead in April to the country's first all-race elections, expected to be won by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC).
