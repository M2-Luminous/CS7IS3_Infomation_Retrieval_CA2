In the interview, Takemura comments on such issues as the 11 February Hosokawa-Clinton talks, prospects for Japan-U.S. relations, tax reform, and the current political situation. Other participants in the panel discussion program -- Kyoto University Professor Masaaki Kosaka, New York City University Professor Yoshihiro Tsuyumi, Tokai Research Institute Director Kenji Mizutani, INSIDER magazine chief editor Hajime Takano, and co-moderator of the program Shinsuke Shimada -- occasionally join the interview. In connection with the Washington summit, Takemura says Hosokawa was pessimistic about the results of the talks even before his departure for Washington, saying: "I think he rather thought it is difficult to narrow the gap between Japan and the United States over the numerical target issue." In describing Japan's stance toward the numerical target issue, Takemura says: "Both Japan and the United States are market economy nations and enjoy the free trade and market systems. So, we thought it was totally impossible for the government to set up detailed target figures for the private sector and exercise public control over the market, because such a policy threatens the very foundation of the nation's economic system. Since we had a bitter experience from the semiconductor talks, we thought we must clearly convey our position this time." When asked about the Japanese Government's immediate tasks to redress worsening relations with the United States, Takemura says: "Japan should not only adhere to its position. From the viewpoint of the United States, Japan's trade surplus of over $130 billion is actually a huge amount. The United States is angry because the trade surplus is constantly growing. We must take some action concerning the issue, and we should be fully aware of Japan's responsibility. Fortunately, the rate of Japan's trade surplus showed a slight decrease in the third quarter of 1993. The rate was over 3 percent of Japan's gross domestic product at its peak, but it is currently declining to below 3 percent. According to the government's latest economic forecast, the rate is expected to drop to 2.8 percent in fiscal 1995. So, we should continue all efforts to lower it through such measures as market liberalization, expansion of the domestic market, and deregulation. I think it is important to keep telling the United States that the Japanese Government intends to lower the trade surplus, and it is actually being lowered." In response to a question asking how long the two nations need to cool down in preparation for the next round of the framework talks, Takemura says it would take "six months, at the longest," because Hosokawa and Clinton will see each other at the Group-of-Seven summit in July, and the two nations have an accord to carry on the summit talks biannually. He says Japan will prepare its own action plan by then to obtain U.S. understanding of Japan's efforts for reducing the trade surplus. Turning to the tax reform issue, Takemura describes the reason for his negative attitude toward Hosokawa's proposal for raising the consumption tax. He states: "I think everyone, including members of the Liberal Democratic Party, generally agrees on the need for tax reform. However, the proposal was made as a surprise announcement." He thus notes that the Hosokawa proposal was made with inadequate consideration for the current economic situation and for the position of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the largest group in the coalition government. Regarding Japan-U.S. policy coordination on a possible embargo against the DPRK, Takemura notes he thinks Hosokawa is well aware of the legal difficulties in preparing effective sanctions. He says: "The prime minister is being careful about this issue as he said Japan's action would be determined within the limitations of the law. I think that means Japan will follow the decisions of the international community within the limitation of laws and the Constitution."
