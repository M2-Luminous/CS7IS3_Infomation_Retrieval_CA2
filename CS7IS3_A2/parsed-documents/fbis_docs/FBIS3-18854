After a new meeting in Torshavn, David Anderson, the chief British negotiator, said that the demarcation line dispute may be resolved within a few months. Because of large oil finds in the sea between the Shetland Islands and the Faeroes, it has become extremely important to reach an agreement. David Anderson said that he would prefer that the two countries reach a negotiated settlement rather than the matter ending up before the International Court in The Hague. He believes that it will take months -- rather than years -- for the two sides to reach agreement. Faeroe Islander Arni Olafsson of the Danish Foreign Ministry, the leader of the Danish-Faeroese delegation, said that the British negotiators have moved a little from their original demand, but that it is still impossible to say whether a solution will be found within the next year. The Faeroes are demanding that the demarcation line between the two countries be drawn according to the median line principle, while Britain was originally demanding a demarcation line deep within the Faeroese economic zone. Two major British oil finds -- estimated to contain a total of 1 billion barrels of oil -- close to the edge of the Faeroese fisheries zone have made it particularly urgent to resolve the demarcation line dispute. After a decision in principle by the Lagting [Faeroese legislative assembly] that the country intends to begin activities in the oil industry, the Faeroes have put seismic surveys up for bid. According to oil experts, if oil is found in the Faeroese mineral rights zone, the demarcation line dispute must be resolved before actual oil production can begin.
