The inspection will cover all urban and township enterprises whether they are Chinese or foreign-funded, a ministry spokesman said. And it will run from April 1 until June 30. Among the things labour departments will be checking is whether enterprises have violated the law by using child labour or making women work in unsuitable jobs, the official said. The inspectors will also check contracts, wages, working hours, insurance and welfare treatment, the official added. The imperfect legal system and a lack of government supervision have caused a sharp rise in the number of labour disputes in China since the beginning of last year, said a recent Labour Ministry circular. The Beijing-based China Electronic News said there were more than 10,000 disputes last year, and the Labour Bureau in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone alone reported 2,353 in the first half of the year. Some enterprises, particularly those outside State ownership, have violated labour laws and regulations, infringing workers' legitimate rights and interests. The Shenzhen Special Zone Daily said a local joint venture hotel owed 238,000 yuan ($27,300) in back salarises to its employees in January. Some employers paid little heed to their workers' health and made them work prolonged hours. These firms also often ignored workers' safety. Some trade union officials on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have tabled proposals urging better protection for workers, particularly in foreign-funded firms, at the current Second Session of the CPPCC Eighth National Committee. The government is very concerned about the problems and has instructed labour departments to look into them thoroughly, said the official. Any illegal practices will be dealt with and those found guilty will be warned, fined or may lose their business licence. The Labour Ministry hoped industry, commerce and public security administrations plus trade unions and women's and youth organizations would work with labour departments during the inspection. It has also urged the country's mass media to publicize labour laws and regulations and provide consulting services on policies and laws.
