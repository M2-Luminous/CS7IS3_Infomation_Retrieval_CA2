"Sub-Saharan Africa has low savings, low investment, falling per capita GDP and relies heavily on foreign resources. This must change. The region has exhausted its capacity to borrow external funds on market terms. And concessional aid, already down from its peak, may fall even more i? the years ahead," the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana quoted the GCA's 1993 report as saying. Armed conflict had stifled development, drained resources and impoverished many African countries, the GCA said. Even after conflicts ended many countries had to undertake massive reconstruction programmes to repatriate refugees, resettle displaced persons and demobilise and re-integrate combatants. "The estimated 5.4 million refugees in Africa are evidence of the suffering. Unable to lead reproductive lives in their own countries, they burden host governments and the international community." GCA executive director Boubakar Daiby-Outtara emphasised the need for Africa to mobilise its own resources to compliment those received from abroad. "African countries should clearly see the need to take charge of their own priorities."
