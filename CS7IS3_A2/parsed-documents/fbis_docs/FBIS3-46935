In view of U.S. concern over a new economic bloc in Asia, Japan has been taking a prudent stand toward the proposal for an economic cooperation mechanism to be organized by ASEAN, Japan, the ROK, and China. Japan's policy change is aimed at demonstrating Japan's policy of attaching importance to ties with ASEAN, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministers conference is going to have summit talks on a regular basis. Also, Japan wants to check U.S. moves to make the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) an exclusionary economic bloc. The government intends to propose to ASEAN nations that they design the EAEC as a consultative body open to the world. The concept of the EAEC is based on Prime Minister Mahathir's 1990 proposal for the East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). At that time, the United States and Australia strongly opposed the proposal, saying that the EAEG was "an attempt to divide the Pacific region." Taking this into account, the EAEC was redesigned to not give the impression of a protectionist economic bloc. The framework of the EAEC is now under debate at the ASEAN economic ministers conference. While some quarters say that the EAEC should start as a subsidiary of APEC, details have not yet been determined. The Japanese Government has not clarified its stand toward the EAEC proposal in consideration of the positions of ASEAN, the United States, and Australia. Japan also thought that its participation in discussions on regional frameworks might affect developments in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which sought a global framework. Japan's policy change is based on the following factors: 1) The Uruguay Round has already been concluded successfully; 2) When the United States announced its "emphasis on the Pacific region" at APEC's Seattle summit in November, ASEAN nations strongly expressed their concern over U.S. hegemony in Asia; and 3) ASEAN nations also expressed their concern over the exclusionary nature of NAFTA. The government once welcomed the U.S. House's approval of NAFTA; however, the Foreign Ministry was displeased with the Clinton administration's attempt to use the "Japan threat" in persuading the House by stressing that "Japan will invade Mexico if NAFTA fails to pass." Under such circumstances, the government judged that Japan had better to take part in the "open" EAEC to balance its diplomatic policies toward Asia and the United States.
