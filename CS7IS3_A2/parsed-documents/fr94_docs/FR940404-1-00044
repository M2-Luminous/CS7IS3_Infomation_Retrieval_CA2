ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). SUMMARY: The Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB), proposes to revise its Disclosure Statement Form (CASB DS&hyph;1). Section 26(g)(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act requires that the Board, prior to the promulgation of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, publish a report and an ANPRM. This ANPRM addresses the Board's efforts to update and revise the CASB Disclosure Statement. DATES: Requests for a copy of the Disclosure Statement form must be in writing and must be received by June 3, 1994. Comments must be in writing and must be received by June 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Requests for a copy of the Disclosure Statement or comments upon its contents should be addressed to Dr. Rein Abel, Director of Research, Cost Accounting Standards Board, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, 725 17th Street, NW., room 9001, Washington, DC 20503. Attn: CASB Docket No. 93&hyph;02. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Rein Abel, Director of Research, Cost Accounting Standards Board (telephone: 202&hyph;395&hyph;3254). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Regulatory Process The Cost Accounting Standards Board's rules and regulations are codified at 48 CFR chapter 99. Section 26(g)(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 422(g)(1), requires that the Board, prior to the establishment of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, complete a prescribed rulemaking process. This process consists of the following four steps: 1. Consult with interested persons concerning the advantages, disadvantages and improvements anticipated in the pricing and administration of government contracts as a result of a proposed Standard. 2. Promulgate an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 3. Promulgate a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 4. Promulgate a Final Rule. This proposal is step two in the four step process. B. Summary of Proposed Rule The Board initiated a case to consider issues related to the revision of the Disclosure Statement (CASB DS&hyph;1), which was originally developed and promulgated in the early 1970s. Only minor revisions to the Statement have been made prior to the initiation of the current project. On April 2, 1993, the CASB distributed a Staff Discussion Paper incorporating a revised Disclosure Statement to certain interested parties who generally possessed actual field experience in submitting and auditing these documents. The Board is continuing the revision process to improve the quality of information presented in the Disclosure Statement form. The purpose of this ANPRM is to seek broad public comment concerning the format and data to be collected on the proposed form. In particular, the Board is interested in soliciting comments concerning the relevance and adequacy of the required disclosures to the quality of the government contract cost measurement process. Steven Kelman, Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and Chairman, Cost Accounting Standards Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7960 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3110&hyph;01&hyph;M
