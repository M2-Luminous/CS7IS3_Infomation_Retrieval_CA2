He has the right to refer it back to parliament for review. His first meeting was with supreme magistrates: Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov and his deputies, the chairwoman of the Regional Court of Sofia, etc. This is a modern and democratic act, but there are certain passages that contradict the constitution, apart from being undemocratic and immoral, Mr. Grigorov said. These passages, however, account for no more than 3 percent of the act. Mr. Grigorov maintains that the act cannot become operative immediately on the authority of Clause 4 of the Transitional and Concluding Provisions of the Constitution, which reads: "The organization of the judicial branch of government... shall come into force following the passage of the new structural and procedural laws." On the motion of an MP of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] parliament voted that the act should come into force upon its publishing in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE. The most controversial paragraphs are those concerning the years of service required for the holding of key posts in the judiciary system. Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev do not meet that requirement. The Constitutional Court should rule on the Judiciary Organization Act, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev told a news conference today. He will point that out at his consultations with President Zhelev tomorrow [22 June]. Members of the Supreme Judicial Council, the Prosecutor's Office and the Supreme Council of the Bar will also meet with the president tomorrow.
