The talks have been scheduled before the U.S. acts on its decision to slash import, quotas of Chinese textiles and clothes "by 25-35 percent" from next Monday. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) revealed yesterday that this fourth round of talks on the Sino-U.S. textile trade agreement would end the same day. But officials refused to comment on the talks in advance. Analysts also declined to predict the outcome of the last-ditch effort. However, if the bid failed, they said the U.S. would reduce some $1.2 billion worth of textile imports from China, which had threatened to retaliate. "It's not clear whether the two sides will make any compromise to avert a more bruising trade conflict," one observer said. China on Monday urged the U.S. to reconsider its decision and to negotiate a solution. It charged the U.S. with treading on the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and the Multi-Fibre (international textiles) Arrangement [name of accord as published] by unilaterally reducing Chinese imports last week.
