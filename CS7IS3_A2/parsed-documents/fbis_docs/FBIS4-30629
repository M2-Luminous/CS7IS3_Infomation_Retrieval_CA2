The first meeting in Washington also failed to achieve any positive results. The United States will definitely reject Indonesia's request for a 14 percent increase for its textiles and textile products export quota to the U.S.. It was only willing to grant a two percent increase. Indonesia, however, rejected the offer. Meanwhile, no concrete decision was reached in connection with the U.S. request for wider access to Indonesian markets for its products because of conflicting and disputed opinions. It warned that it would impose sanctions against any country which absorbs or circumvents the quota provided to Indonesian textile producers. The warning still remains effective even though Indonesia was submissive in reducing its import tariffs on U.S. products, together with its compliance to reconsider the issue of circumvention [preceding word in English] and cooperation in cases where another country sends textile exports to the United States under the export quota. Newspapers carried reports on reaction to the failed talks -- ranging from anger and disappointment to rational agruments. Indonesia was frustrated by the methods employed in the Bali talks. In fact, everyone anticipated that the talks would end in failure. Some Indonesian textile producers stated to the press last month that they expected the textile talks to fail after noting their previous lobbying efforts in Washington. Further talks will collapse if Indonesia does not concretely provide certain "concessions" to the United States in connection with its request for wider access for its products in Indonesian markets, coupled with Indonesia's agreement regarding the issue of circumvention. These two issues were brought up during the first round of talks in Washington. It can be surmised what ensued after the talks. According to our observations, Indonesia was a bit confused over certain issues. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) delegation was headed by one of its deputies, Carol Miller, a new member to the team. Thus, the assumption that the new team would speedily deal with the existing problems and grant Indonesia concessions because the meeting was held in idyllic Bali, a tourist haven, left Indonesia confounded. The team came to Bali for the meeting equipped with specific "trends" set by the USTR in Washington. Should Indonesia find the concession "card" provided to it unacceptable, then the USTR would revert to the guidelines laid down by Washington. The concessions, which provided for a two percent increase over the previous quota, was given only at the eleventh hour. Besides, the USTR team arrived for an official business meeting. A tit for tat [preceding phrase in English]. I will only give you something if you give me something in return. The USTR team does not take into consideration any clarification on national development or argumments concerning advocation of the nation's and people's interests when dealing with the issue of a possible increase in the existing textiles export quota. It would be more justifiable if we could convince the United States that Indonesia's textiles export is the major mechanism in warranting the country's economic growth -- the primary source of non-gas exports, which could provide numerous employment opportunities. The Indonesian delegation sought an increase for the textiles export quota for only certain categories during the first round of talks in Washington. The USTR side viewed the request as solely coming from Indonesian authorities and based on the country's performance with the export quota, beginning with the process of distribution until it reached the final destination in the United States. All this data is in the hands of the USTR, including the dealings conducted on the quota and the benefit procured by bureaucrats. One issue which the United States disagreed on for granting an increase in the textile export quota was an expansion of textiles and textile products industries in the Third World. The United states had similarly asked for such concessions for its industries. The USTR delegations's talks with the Indonesian side was definitely based on certain flexibilities and with a give and take [preceding three words in English] attitude. It should be acknowledged that such flexibilities were afforded through intensive lobbying by the Indonesian side. Lobbying was carried out simultaneously while the Indonesian delegation was attending the negotiations. The Indonesian textile producers stated that the lobbying, however, was a bit too late. That was the reason the USTR delegation had to follow certain "trends" laid down by Washington during the Bali talks. Lobbying was previously conducted to ascertain how seriously Indonesia's request for an increased quota would be taken by the United States and its demand for concessions for its products to enter the Indonesian market. The Indonesian Government stands to benefit from the business circle which has long-standing personal ties and lobbying access with their U.S. counterparts. Their influence will not only gain access to the USTR, but also to the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, the State Department, The Trade Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Inland Revenue Department -- apart from the American business circle's assistance in the lobbying. Our country has a number of influential businessmen with such capability and Indonesia could have seized on the opportunity before the talks commenced in Bali. Therefore, the success of the bilateral talks cannot be assured through formal and businesslike [preceding word in English] talks at the negotiating table, unless the negotiations are carried out in an informal manner with a personal relationship. Indonesia can achieve its expectations only through this method. This was done during the 1989 U.S.-Indonesia bilateral talks on textile trade in Bali. As such, the opinion of Dr. Mari Pengestu, an Indonesian economist, is considered convincing as he has proposed that the country embark on an early lobbying process before the next round of talks and prior to the expiration of the U.S. textile quota for Indonesia, which ends on 30 June. Finally, should there be a third round of talks, Indonesia needs to field a more effective negotiating team which will be as equally effective as the USTR team. In the structure of the U.S. administration, the USTR is a body directly under presidential jurisdiction and its chief executive official's status is equivalent to that of a minister. Besides, the USTR has more jurisdiction than the U.S. Trade Department. Apart from this, the Indonesian delegation could also incorporate itself with the business circle which conducts lobbying with the United States. The business circle is much respected by the U.S. due to its long-standing personal relations with the Americans who effect their influence through negotiations. All this is necessary for the sake of achieving a successful outcome for the talks, which will be mutually beneficial for the United States and Indonesia.
