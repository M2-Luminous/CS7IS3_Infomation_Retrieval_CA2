According to the statement by the MDF National Executive, the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition could gain a two-thirds majority, which would mean power on a scale which is undesireably excessive in a democracy. [passage omitted] The MDF cannot conceive of cooperation with the SZDSZ, even on a local level. MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak also said that in the election campaign it would be incorrect to warn against a left-wing danger because that is already a fact.
