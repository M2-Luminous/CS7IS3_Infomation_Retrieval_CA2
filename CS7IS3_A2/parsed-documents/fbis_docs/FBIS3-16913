At the present day the Lithuanian construction workers have already prepared a complex of five multiapartment blocks for handing over and are completing the assembly of another four buildings. Not only has the implementation of the plan helped Lithuania to resolve some economic problems and created some new jobs, it has also had a considerable impact on the timing and pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. Army Gen. Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, and Audrius Butkevicius, former Lithuanian minister of national defense, are rightly considered the founding fathers of the Selma-Baltflot project. Unfortunately, during his trip the Russian defense minister was unable to visit the Selma construction site. "The fact is," Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told journalists, "that someone in the Lithuanian leadership (I do not know who at the moment) has conceived the idea of preventing a meeting between the Russian defense minister and Vladas Laurikavicius, president of the Selma company." On the eve of the meeting with the Russian defense minister in Kaliningrad, the Selma president was arrested by the Lithuanian special services and taken to Vilnius, where he has been placed in a detention cell. "This fact will not help Russo-Lithuanian relations," Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told journalists. "Selma had faith in us and still does, it worked essentially on credit using its own resources. The Selma president was told that I was bringing a directive from the Russian Government outlining the terms on which we would settle our debts. I brought them a barter deal -- for oil. I have this directive in my briefcase but I cannot give it to the association's president or thank him for his work...." Here is the opinion of Povilas Astasiavicius, vice president of the Selma company. "Certain forces in Lithuania do not like what we are doing," he said. "Recently the Lithuanian press has waged an unbridled campaign accusing us of a variety of sins: They say that we are not building anything but are just getting rich. But you can see the homes that we have built, you can see the people who have already been given apartments in those blocks.... This whole campaign is being fuelled primarily by Mr. Piatkiavicius, a deputy in the Seimas...." However, I find this particular maneuver by certain political forces in Lithuania all the more incomprehensible because Mr. Piatkiavicius was the leader of the first official Lithuanian parliamentary delegation to visit this construction site in the summer of last year. It was he, when opening the rally dedicated to the completion of the assembly of the first building, who spoke a lot about the need to develop good neighborly relations between Lithuania and Russia and promised comprehensive support for the Selma-Baltflot project. But now he holds the opposite view.... Last Sunday I met with Audrius Butkevicius, Lithuania's former national defense minister, and asked him to comment on what has happened. "My apartment was also searched," Butkevicius said. "They were looking for explosives, which is really ridiculous. They also wanted to plant some documents on me which were nothing to do with me. Here, too, I express solidarity with Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev: The arrest of Laurikavicius is an act of provocation. A political provocation! And I very much regret that the Lithuanian side is to blame for this."
