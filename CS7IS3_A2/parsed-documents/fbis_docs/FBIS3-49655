The mainly Moslem Government forces made a "considerable" advance Wednesday in an action designed to cut the enclave in two and cut the land route linking Vitez with Busovaca, another Croat-held enclave, Lt-Col Bill Aikman said. Several points along the Vitez-Busovaca road were seized by government troops from the Croat Defence (HVO) Forces after heavy fighting, Aikman said. Fighting was continuing in the Vitez enclave early Thursday despite an announcement on Wednesday that Bosnian government and Croat leaders had agreed to work out the terms of a "total" ceasefire to become effective on Saturday. Aikman said he did not know whether heavy Bosnian bombardment of the locality of Bila, north of Vitez, on Wednesday signalled the start of a new offensive. Sarajevo radio said a helicopter of the regular Croatian Army fired several air-to-ground missiles at Bosnian civilian targets near Vitez and Novi Travnik Thursday. Military activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina eased slightly on Wednesday, Aitken said, with Sarajevo enjoying a quieter day than in much of the preceding period. Serbs besieging the city fired 350 shells, and were targetted in return by 10 shells. Six people were killed in Sarajevo and 36 wounded, he said. A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski, complained meanwhile that Bosnian Serbs were practising bureaucratic obstructionism in order to prevent the sick and wounded being evacuated from government-held areas. "The Serbs never openly say no, but they always find problems to drag things out," Janowski said, citing the cases of at least five people who died while waiting for Serb authorisation to be moved from the enclaves of eastern Bosnia. The UNHCR also encountered difficulties with the Bosnian authorities in the government-held northern town of Tuzla, who were demanding that they should be allowed to make their own choice among the wounded of candidates for evacuation, Janowski said.
