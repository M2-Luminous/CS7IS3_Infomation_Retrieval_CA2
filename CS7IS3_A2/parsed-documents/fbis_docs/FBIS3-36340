Kannik stressed the fact that the obligation taken by NATO in the initiative to hold consultations with new partners was "especially important for Estonia because of a possible political crisis in the near neighbourhood". "Estonian Government considers Partnership for Peace a positive programme and a great step ahead. We understand that it is a part of a process of becoming a full member of NATO," Kannik said. Head of the NATO mission, permanent representative of Germany in NATO Hermann F. von Richthofen told the press conference that as NATO was not a closed system, no obstacles were laid to any states in joining it, adding, however, that participation in the Partnership for Peace programme did not mean a soon membership of NATO, but was still a step towards wider and closer cooperation. Kannik said that in the report to be made to NATO as to the Estonian standpoints on aims of the Partnership for Peace programme and means necessary to participate in the programme, Estonia will make a proposition to hold a part of the joint exercises of the Partnership for Peace programme in Estonia to reduce cost of participation in the programme. At the same time NATO aid to founding the Baltic peacekeeping battalion was not out of question, he added.
