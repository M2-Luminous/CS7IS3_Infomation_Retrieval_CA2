FR940819-2-00010 FR940819-2-00002 Forest Service Environment Impact Statement, Shamrock Timber Sale(s), Tongass National Forest, AK AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The Forest Service will issue a supplemental Draft EIS for the Shamrock Timber Sale(s). The supplement will include an additional road and unit, minor road changes, designation of retention areas, a new Forest Service list of sensitive species, a change in subsistence findings, and a change in the range of timber volume in the Proposed Action and Purpose and Need. This revised Notice of Intent (NOI) updates and replaces the December 1991 Notice. The proposed action changes from 10&hyph;40 to 10&hyph;52 million board feet of commercial timber within the Shamrock area, and as before, to construct the associated road system. The timber would be sold in one or more timber sales beginning in September 1995. The study area includes Value Comparison Units 436, 438, and 429 on Kupreanof Island in southeast Alaska. This area, encompassing approximately 108,000 acres, has been allocated by the Tongass Land Management Plan to Land Use Designation IV, in which management emphasis is primarily on commodity or market resources. The original NOI was published on page 66428 of the 12/23/91 Federal Register. Notice of the draft EIS was published on page 45338 of the 10/27/93 issue, and the comment period of the Draft EIS was extended on page 59033 of the 11/5/93 issue. The purpose of this project is to provide 10&hyph;52 million board feet of timber for harvest according to direction described in the Tongass Land Management Plan, to meet the Federal obligation to make timber volume available for harvest by timber operators, and to improve the timber productivity of the project area by harvesting mature stands of timber and replacing them with faster growing stands of second-growth timber. The decision to be made is whether to harvest 10&hyph;52 million board feet of timber from the Shamrock Study Area, and if so, in which locations and under what conditions. This decision will be made by Abigail R. Kimbell, the Stikine Area Forest Supervisor. EFFECTIVE DATE: Public scoping began in April 1992 and has been ongoing since that time. Interested publics are invited to comment. The comment period on the supplemental Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability appears in the Federal Register. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The Shamrock analysis is being conducted by EA Engineering, Science and Technology under contract to the Petersburg Ranger District. Questions and comments can be directed to Ron Bockelman, EA Engineering, Science and Technology, 8520 154th Avenue NE., Redmond, WA 98052, phone (206) 869&hyph;2194. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A public scoping letter was sent to all persons who indicated an interest in the project by responding to the Stikine Area Project Schedule, or who otherwise notified the Stikine Area that they were interested in the Shamrock Timber Sale(s). Alternatives include the no-action alternative and four action alternatives that would harvest form 20&hyph;52 million board feet of timber from 1,066&hyph;2,592 acres and construct 22&hyph;40 miles of specified road. Yarding systems would include shovel, highlead, skyline, and helicopter. The following issues have been identified: 1. Transportation: What effect will road construction and subsequent maintenance following harvest have on access to and within the Shamrock Area? 2a. Timber Resources: How will long-term forest health and productivity be affected by harvesting and the specific harvest treatments in the Shamrock area? 2b. Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Plants (TES); Wetlands: Will harvesting and road construction result in adverse impact to any populations of TES plants? What are the expected losses of wetland area and functional value under each harvest alternative? 3. Wildlife: What effects will timber harvest and related activities have on wildlife habitat? 4. Fish: What effects will timber harvest and road construction have on habitats used by trout and salmon? 5. Biodiversity: How will timber harvesting associated with the Shamrock area affect the biodiversity and old growth structure of Kupreanof Island? 6. Watershed: Will timber harvesting adversely affect the hydrologic balance and water quality of streams in the Shamrock area?
