He commented on the state budget of 1994 and expressed his satisfaction about the fact that a possibility had been found to finance restoration of historical buildings. Then Slezevicius returned to current problems. At present one of the major problems is the forthcoming farmers' strike in February. Slezevicius said that he had met with the chairman of the strike committee Jonas Ciulevicius just before the news conference. At the meeting which lasted about an hour possibilities of avoiding the strike were discussed. "The right to go on strike is guaranteed by the Constitution, but the organizers of the strike must know that they have no right to force farmers to go on strike and stop supplying processing enterprises with produce. The fact that strikers will take their produce to market places instead of processing enterprises shows that this action could hardly be called a strike as they had a similar right before", Slezevicius said. Another important problem is the construction of the oil terminal. Slezevicius emphasized that the construction of the oil terminal in Liepaja did not mean that another terminal would not be built in Butinge. Slezevicius told the press once again that if the terminal is build in Liepaja, Lithuania should have the controlling block of shares, that is 51 percent of capital. In addition, Lithuania should get some land in the port territory for building the joint-venture as well as some land for construction of the oil pipeline to Mazeikiai. The final decision on the issue should be adopted next week in Liepaja at the meeting of Lithuanian and Latvian state delegations.
