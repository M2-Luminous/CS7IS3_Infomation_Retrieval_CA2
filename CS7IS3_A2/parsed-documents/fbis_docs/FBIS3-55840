He said that since the beginning of the year, Russia had supplied Ukraine with 600,000 tons of crude oil. Oil with a high content of sulphur accounts for a greater part of Russian oil supplies. It can only be processed by the Kremenchug oil refinery located in Ukraine. Moscow and Kiev have reached the agreement on preserving the price of $80 a ton in 1994. Earlier, Russia was planning to sell oil to Ukraine at $100 a ton. A high-ranking representative of the state enterprise Rosneft (Russian Oil) told Interfax that Russia was not planning to sharply reduce oil supplies to Ukraine in 1994. He believes that Ukrainian officials often make such allegations in order to put pressure on Russia. They do not understand that the most important problem for us is to receive payment for the oil already supplied, he said. This year, Kiev requested that Russia sell it more than 30 Mn tons of oil. He also noted that a possible curtailment of oil supplies to Ukraine was due exclusively to technical problems. In 1993 Russia sold 19.293 Mn tons of oil to Ukraine, although initially it was planning to supply 19.5 Mn tons of oil to this republic. Kiev owes Moscow more than 204 Bn rubles for the oil already supplied.
