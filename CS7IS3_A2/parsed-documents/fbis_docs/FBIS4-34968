"The essential thing is to develop the idea of Urupabol based on complementary interests and not on a confrontation between interests," he said. While he admitted that Paraguay and Uruguay have to compete within Mercosur among common interests in a single market of 200 million consumers, he added that this does not necessarily mean confrontation, as common interests and common positions among the four countries must be sought. The Uruguayan foreign minister added: "What we must seek within Mercosur is a clearer and more definite integration, and especially a strict fulfillment of the obligations assumed by the (four) countries. This is true for the large ones (Argentina and Brazil), in particular, because they are our main markets. It is also true for the small ones, or those suffering the imbalances (Paraguay and Uruguay), both because of our exporting potential and also based on the importance that needs to be given to the obligations assumed." Bolivia is part of the Andean Pact, and for this reason is not a member of Mercosur, as the Asuncion Treaty does not allow it. The Uruguayan foreign minister said, however, that bilateral agreements can be achieved with Bolivia through the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) headquartered in Montevideo. He further explained that improved trade can be achieved through ALADI, as a way of explaining that there are no difficulties for Paraguay and Uruguay in exchanging products bilaterally with countries that are not members of Mercosur. "The presence of Bolivia is very important, not only within the framework of cooperation, but essentially within the framework of trade -- only with the legal instruments we already have, and not with the legal structures that prevail in the Mercosur market," he said. Abreu Bonilla said his country has offered Paraguay and Bolivia its port services for export of their products through the Atlantic Ocean, considering that both are landlocked countries.
