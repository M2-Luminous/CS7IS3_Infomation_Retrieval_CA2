Amorim is concerned about the excessive importation of some products following the opening of the economy. Under the new legislation, the Industry Ministry might establish quotas on products for which importation is considered excessive. During a GAZETA MERCANTIL-sponsored seminar entitled "The New Map of World Commerce," Amorim emphasized that Brazil must have appropriate instruments to fight commercial dumping. The minister said the U.S. Department of Commerce has 600 employees working in the anti-dumping area, while Brazil has only four or five professionals.
