G.": "Kinkel Meets Kravchanka"] [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- Foreign Minister Kinkel called on Belarus to continue economic and political reforms even after the election defeat of President Shushkyevich. At a meeting with Belarus Foreign Minister Kravchanka in Bonn on Thursday [3 March], Kinkel said that Germany possibilities for providing Belarus with financial assistance had been exhausted. However, the faster privatization and reforms proceed, the easier it will be to successfully attract foreign private investment capital to Belarus. Kinkel and Kravchanka signed a cultural treaty that should facilitate the work of private organizations. A "memorandum of understanding" [preceding words in English] was signed on promoting cooperation in alleviating the effects of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It should eliminate bureaucratic obstacles in dealings between the two states and thus assist the work of private German relief organizations. Kravchanka said that only 1 percent of the territory of Belarus was unaffected by contamination resulting from the Chernobyl accident. The effects of the accident have caused suffering to 2.4 million Belarussians. Kinkel praised Minsk's compliance with disarmament treaties. Like Kinkel, Kravchanka said he was in favor of an unlimited extension of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons until 1995. Kravchanka asked for technical and financial support for the destruction of tanks in accordance with the Vienna CSCE treaty on the scrapping of conventional weapons. Belarus must use its own financial resources to destroy foreign -- Soviet -- tanks and needs assistance. All formerly Soviet tanks that were withdrawn from abroad, including those that were stationed in the GDR, were brought to Belarus. Almost 2,000 tanks and 150 aircraft had to be destroyed, more than in the United States, Great Britain, and France. The destruction of missiles in line with START I nuclear disarmament is also costly. Kinkel promised that Germany would send experts to Russia to check what costs are involved. He could not, however, make any financial commitments. Kravchanka said that Belarus essentially took a "positive" view of the NATO offer of a Partnership for Peace, but had not made any official decision so far. Belarus would like to strengthen economic and political relations with Germany.
