Kogblevi, an adviser on technology and development of agriculture and forestry of Benin, a small African country, was just one of swarms of foreign visitors to probe China`s agricultural success. The year of 1993 has seen a China brisk in agricultural exchanges with the outside world. "The Ministry of Agriculture has received delegations from such countries as Senegal, Jordan, Mexico, Myanmar (the former Burma), Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Cuba, and the United States this year," said Jin Shisheng, an official responsible for international cooperation in the ministry. "Prominent among the visitors was American Agricultural Minister Mike Espy," Jin said. "He was the first American cabinet member touring China since Clinton took power. "He was also the first American agricultural minister coming to China since the establishment of the Sino-American joint working group on technological cooperation in agriculture in 1980." Espy's visit was considered "the new starting point for Sino- American agricultural cooperation," Jin said. Another important figure was Arturo Gusman Pascual, the chairman of the Cuban Price Commission, who was authorized by Fidel Castro, Cuba's top leader, to have a thorough look at the booming agriculture here. Meanwhile, 4,400 Chinese people have been sent abroad for the purpose of investigation, training and promotion of trade this year. He Kang, China's former minister of agriculture, visited Japan and later went to India where he found both sides were interested in exchanges of sources of seeds and science and technology. The visit of incumbent Minister Liu Jiang to Israel scored rich achievements: the setting up of a joint commission of agriculture and the signing of a memorandum between the two agricultural ministries. Scientific communications and economic cooperation in agriculture have been given a strong impetus with these busy exchanges. So far China has fostered scientific and economic relations with 114 countries and almost all the international agricultural organizations and institutions, while involving itself in many important agricultural activities. The Ministry of Agriculture has reaped as much as 83.5 million U.S. dollars worth of aid this year, up 20 percent on 1992, with which Germany and Australia will help China in the fields of bringing up fine breeds of pigs and dairy cows and protection of dry land. World Food Program offered China 13 million U.S. dollars worth of food aid gratis, and the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization approved programs costing over 6 million U.S. dollars for preserving fresh fruit and fish. The U.N. Development Program also sanctioned this year "the Development Plan in Northwest China", worth of 8.59 million U.S. dollars, consisting of six projects. In order to strengthen China's cooperation with the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization [FAO], Minister Liu Jiang attended the FAO's 27th conference, held in Italy this year. China was also a participant in the World Agricultural Development Foundation's 16th conference on management, and was elected a member of the organization's executive bureau. In September, at the 49th meeting of the executive bureau, a project covering agricultural development in Yunnan, a remote province in southwest China, was ratified, and a preferential loan of 25.79 million U.S. dollars was promised to China.
