Because of the clearly higher employment quota at the time of the GDR, an east German retired couple today gets an average of 2,505 German marks or 99.7 percent of the pension in the west, even though the relation of basic pensions is only about 75 percent. While the comparable figure for men is only 86.6 percent, women get about 130 percent. However, Minister Geisler pointed out that elderly people in the former GDR hardly had any major assets and are, therefore, covering their vital needs largely from the benefits paid by the legal pension insurance. In order not to let the difference in the widow's pensions become too big, the resulting higher claims in the east should "perhaps be reduced" in future increases by some percentage points, Geisler said. The minister said that he is surprised by the relatively high number -- 17 percent -- of single fathers in Saxony. Of the 818,000 families with children, 23 percent are so-called single-parent families.
