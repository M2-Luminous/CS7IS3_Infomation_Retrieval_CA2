A new semiconductor factory for computer memories and logic circuits will be set up in the Saxon capital, probably employing 1,200 people. A group spokesman confirmed that major investments are planned in microelectronics. But the details will not be announced until Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger is in Dresden on 23 December. The construction of a microchip factory in Dresden was already under discussion about two years ago. When Siemens was looking at various possible sites to build such a factory, the then Federal Trade and Industry Minister Juergen W. Moellemann came out strongly in favour of the Saxon capital. But at the same time he refused "special financial support" for the project. As Siemens market researchers came to the view that sales of memory chips would decrease significantly over the next few years (because of their greater capacity), the Semiconductor Division was grappling with enormous losses, and the subsidy offered was not what the group expected, at the time Siemens put the project on hold. Now a decision has evidently been made. According to a report in the magazine "BILD", a chip factory costing one billion German marks [DM] will be built in Dresden with a DM300 million government subsidy. It was further reported that DM2.4 billion will be invested at the Saxon location over the next 10 years. The Federal Ministry of Research and Technology will grant as much as DM30 million a year in subsidies to specific research projects at the factory under the budget heading "Microelectronics Research and Development." Siemens could, of course, also claim the normal investment subsidies available in eastern Germany. The factory, to be built on a site close to Dresden airport, is initially intended for dynamic memory chips (the so-called DRAM [dynamic random access memory] semiconductors), but will later also make logic circuits, in particular customer and application-specific chips (ASIC [application-specific integrated circuits]). The memories will, so to speak, secure the necessary basic quantities of work, on which ASIC manufacture can then be built up. When completed, the factory will probably employ 1,200 people, 100 of them in the laboratory. The same number of jobs will be secured or created with future suppliers. Siemens is understood to be seeking additional industrial partners for the new works. It will cooperate with the Dresden Microelectronics Center (ZMD), in which the Commerzbank AG and the Dresdner Bank AG, both of Frankfurt, have a holding, and which Siemens is already providing know-how, managerial staff, and orders. There is also the possibility of cooperation with a Fraunhofer Institute that developed out of the ZND's precursor company. Microelectronics could thus again become one of Dresden's major industries. How far Siemens' proposed involvement in Saxony denotes a change in company policy in the semiconductor sector remains to be seen. Dresden is likely to make the 16 and 64 megabit memory chips. Under earlier plans, the former was to have been built with U.S. computer giant IBM in France. A new factory was not previously planned for the 64 megabit chip either. Instead, existing manufacturing plants were to have been adapted accordingly. But it seems that the chip boom that has resumed in the meantime has led to a rethink.
