Argentina is supposedly safe from hazardous wastes coming from other countries. In principle, a controversial law (24.051) bans this, though some environmentalists say that its later enacting regulation (Decree 831/93) leaves open a window through which some wastes could be introduced, disguised as industrial components. It is a fact that throughout the world such materials are "roaming around" in search of storage sites. It is the duty of the authorities to keep their eyes open and their pockets shut. [passage omitted] For Argentina, the enemy is within. Generators of hazardous wastes and unscrupulous waste disposal contractors cannot be controlled. The unevenness of legislation throughout Argentina, the inadequacy of the organizations that are supposed to conduct controls, and the lack of industrial facilities to process these materials place the population at serious risk. Tragic isolated events may suddenly make the problem obvious. The widespread feeling among specialists is that Argentina is living on a time bomb, and there are no legal or political mechanisms to dismantle this bomb.
