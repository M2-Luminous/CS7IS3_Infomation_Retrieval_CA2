The confiscation of a record amount of drugs by the Brest custom-house (2,389 kg) brings a new sense to the word "Mafia" and makes one think about the place of Belarus in the international drug business./ "International cartels actively use the West European market for drug sales, including such dangerous drugs as heroin and cocaine." Such was the conclusion in a statement made by the board for combating smuggling to the chairman of the State Committee for Customs. "Belarus has been given a role of a trans-shipment base with some drugs remaining on the spot." In 1992, there were 740 cases of crime related to drugs in Belarus; the militia confiscated 800 kg of drug substances. In the first half of 1993, there were 545 criminal cases and 500 kg of confiscated drugs. The State Committee for Customs' specialists for combating smuggling assert that international drug cartels consider Belarus to be a state with a more weaker customs regime than those in the West. According to the data as of 20 December 1993, Belarusian customs officers deterred 38 drug smuggling cases and confiscated 2,645 kg of intoxicating substances. Formerly, confiscated drugs were reprocessed at one Russian pharmaceutical plant; now they are simply destroyed. In the majority of cases, the deadly substances are shipped to Germany; shipments to Poland are rare. Among the arrested smugglers, Germans constitute 50 percent--they are immigrants from Central Asia (mainly from Kazakhstan) which is a traditional drug supplier. The age of the "pushers" averages between 20 and 30 years. According to specialists, small drug dealers can join vast Mafia structures. Russian N., who was driving to Poland in his Volkswagen "Passat," has been caught with 7,400 grams of drug substances that were hidden under the car trunk as well as under the front fenders. He asserted that he had planted hemp on the fields of Prokhladnenskiy Rayon 40 km from Nalchik. A student from Lvov was carrying with him 5,040 grams of poppy straw in a St. Petersburg--Lvov train; according to his statement, he stole it from one Lithuanian national who traveled on the same train. A question ensues: Given today's transparency of borders as well as the deficiency of technical equipment for customs control, are the detections of large drug shipments not accidental? Are some other containers with drugs not "racing" on Belarusian territory, as it happened with that shipment of raisins, which contained 2,389 kg of marijuana? According to the information from the board for combating smuggling, detection of drugs are due only to the intuition of customs officers. In prospect, the personnel of the board for combating smuggling will be expanded, and special dogs will be trained to detect drugs. Customs officers already have special tests to identify drugs. Argentina--Singapore--Pakistan--Afghanistan. Now we can add Belarus to this traditional route. "The point is not only in the fall of the Iron Curtain and the Soviet Union," states G. Gribach, head of the board for combating smuggling within the State Committee for Customs. "We assume that Belarus has become the route for drug shipments from the `Golden Crescent' countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran) because of the closing of the Balkan route due to warfare there. This assumption can be corroborated by a container with a large shipment of drugs, which, before reaching Belarus, crossed the `Termez' check point at the Afghan-Uzbekistani border and traversed Kazakhstan and Russia. One more container with such a load has been detained by the Polish customs service. Recently, specialists of the board for combating smuggling reached an agreement with their Russian counterparts on reestablishing the old system of cooperation in combating smuggling in order to block the route of the `white death.'"
