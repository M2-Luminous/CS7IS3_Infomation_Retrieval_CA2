The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department announced that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.5 percent in annualized terms in the October-December quarter. "Expansion in exports contributed chiefly to the improvements," the source said. Touching on the yen-dollar rate, the BOJ source said, "Forex players will now shift their attention to economic conditions of both countries -- away from Japan's domestic political uncertainty -- with mounting expectations that a gap in their economic fundamentals will not shrink further for a while."
