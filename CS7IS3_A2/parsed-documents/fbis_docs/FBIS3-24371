But the Way Out Is Through Unity, Not Confrontation. That Is What the Stavropol Kray Trade Union Aktiv Decided After Discussing the Economic Situation in the Region"] [Text] Yevgeniy Kuznetsov, head of the Stavropol Kray administration, met with executives of the kray trade union council and trade union activists. He told them about the state of the economy. It is, alas, catastrophic. Mainly because of the reformist center's radicalism. The time has come to conclude a tripartite agreement between the executive power, the employers, and the trade unions. The main link--the employers--proved to be the least reliable. They are no longer subordinate to anyone, while the authorities, as the governor conceded, no longer have any levers of control over their territory. What does such excessive independence lead to? Let us take the example of Neftekumsk Rayon. Before it produced 7.2 million tonnes of oil, now it extracts barely 1.2-1.5 million. It is high time for municipal ownership to take over the oilfields. But no, their managers, with support from the center, resist: This is ours, don't dare to intervene, these aren't "the old days." Now the rayon is on the verge of a strike. The entire responsibility for the social protection of its inhabitants has shifted to the executive power, while the main culprits--the no-good industrial managers--remain on the sidelines. Nor do the trade unions have their former influence over the employers, especially in the new, post-reform structures. The managerial corps is running loose, setting unthinkable salaries for themselves and their associates, while defrauding and hurting the workers. The people's lack of legal rights is crowned by arbitrariness. Perhaps saddest of all is that now there is no political force in the kray capable of influencing the public frame of mind. Numerous dwarf parties are up to their ears in political squabbles. The executive power's only hope is the trade unions as a more or less organized force. Moreover, it should be recognized openly that these are all not just Stavropol's problems. Rather, they are an exact reflection of the situation in the country: Working people no longer demand higher wages and lower prices, all they demand is that the government pay off its own debts for work long since done and produce shipped. What we see both here and in the villages is: Last harvest's grain and sugar beet have still not shipped and everything is rotting on kolkhoz threshing-floors. Wool, too. It turns out that it is more profitable for the state to import wool from Australia and sugar from Canada than to produce its own. The country's only sheep and goat breeding scientific-research institute has closed down. Elite herds and flocks have been slaughtered. The situation is much the same in all of Russia's granaries. For example, in Orenburg Oblast they also reduced agricultural production to a minimum; all that is left is for their own needs. But the Orenburg people at least have a powerful industry, which the Stavropol country doesn't have. The kray is fully dependent on the center. Because of this the governor asked the trade union officials to assume public control over food production and the use of various social protection funds. Nevertheless, in response to their questions Yevgeniy Semyonovich displayed optimism. "I don't agree that everything is going totally wrong. A new society is forming. There is a glimmer of hope that the economy will be renovated. Housing construction is proceeding at the same rate. Construction of a local oil refinery is in the works, and a rare-earth metals mine is planned. The administration is doing everything to prevent total failure." As for calls for the government to resign and the formation of a "government of popular trust," in Kuznetsov's view, "It is foolish, a new spiral of politicking. Doubtlessly, there are forces in the country who would like to fish in the muddied waters of unbridled radicalism. "We had before us the example of China, which has achieved the expansion of its economy without overreaching, but we didn't make use of it. Figuratively speaking, now it's not the Chinese but we who have made the 'great leap' into the market. And it looks like we've landed in a deep puddle." The administration is now sustained only by pride, understanding that it must lead the kray out of the dead end. "There's no one else to do it," Kuznetsov says. A bitter but honest admission. Trade union officials asked the administration chief many questions. For example: How were low-income people to pay heating bills? What is being done to restore collapsed health care in the villages? Will losses suffered from a hailstorm in Novoselitskiy Rayon be covered? The governor asked for the trade unions' help. For example, it was necessary to place the targeted distribution of subsidies to low-income people under public control, establish control over property insurance for kolkhozes and private farmers so as to prevent them from being helpless in the face of natural disasters, and so forth. It occurred to me that many of those questions would have been resolved long ago if only V. Krasulya, deputy chief of the kray administration, who oversees them, would view the trade unions as his allies, and not as opponents of his ultraradical "democratic" views. But everyone knows that he refuses to visit the kray trade union council! The trade union activists were, understandably, concerned when the unceremonious administrative interference in internal trade union affairs would finally end. Why do departments subordinate to V. Krasulya devote such great efforts to breaking up the kray's trade unions rather than strengthening them? They resort to administrative instructions, hatching of intrigues... "Brush off whoever encroaches on your affairs," the governor said. "Of course, one can't expect peace and accord between trade unions and the executive power. They are bound to worry one another. But only in the interests of the working people, not to their detriment. Every rayon administration chief who promotes confrontation between the authorities and the largest public organization will be held responsible to me personally." On the whole, the meeting was surprisingly useful and constructive. The trade union aktiv saw a leader deeply concerned with the kray's fate. It is really hard for him today. Isn't that also the concern of his partners? That means the executive power and the trade unions should become allies. In hard times it is necessary to give the kray executive authorities worker support, that was the result of the entire meeting. It seems that in Stavropol both sides have mastered this simple truth. It would be good if it finally reached the center.
