The company, based in Shiyan in northwestern Hubei, is one of the three car manufacturers designated by the Chinese Government. A provincial government official said that the company plans to build 800,600 motor vehicles a year by the year 2000, including 360,000 passenger cars. Its annual production will rise to 1.16 million units by 2005, including 620,000 cars, the official said. He said he believed that the implementation of the company's development plan would enable Hubei's economy to take off. A committee for invigorating Hubei's automobile industry has been set up, with provincial Governor Jia Zhijie serving as its head, he said. It will mobilize local governments and departments to aid the company in carrying out its development plan. To this end, the provincial planning commission has decided to gear the company's production plan with the plan for the growth of Hubei's economy as a whole, he said. Relevant provincial departments have been requested to include production of metals, machinery, electronic products, rubber, engineering plastics, textiles, glass and other auto-related goods into their long-term production plans, he added. In addition, provincial departments in charge of environmental protection, taxation, land administration, urban construction and transportation have been mandated to formulate preferential policies in support of the company in implementing its production plan. Local manufacturers are being encouraged to co-operate with the company, he said, adding that the company can become a principal shareholder in these manufacturers. To meet its production target for the year 2000 the company will require 34 billion yuan in investment, the official said. The provincial financial department has decided to allocate one billion yuan in bank loans annually over the next five years to help local manufacturers modernize the production of auto parts and accessories, he said, adding that banks will increase loans to the company. Moreover, businesses manufacturing auto parts for the company will issue shares in China in a move to raise money, he said. Economists in Hubei agreed that government backing is essential for the takeoff of the automobile industry, as shown in Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Hubei has good conditions for expanding the auto industry, with a whole range of well-developed related industries, such as metallurgy, chemicals, rubber, plastics and electric power, one economist noted.
