FR940105-0-00012 FR940105-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;208&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8783; AD 93&hyph;24&hyph;51] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This document publishes in the Federal Register an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S. owners and operators of all Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes by individual telegrams. This AD requires repetitive operational tests of feel and limitation computers (FLC) 1 and 2. This amendment is prompted by a report that the pitch control on a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function. DATES: Effective January 20, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by telegraphic AD T93&hyph;24&hyph;51, issued December 1, 1993, which contained the requirements of this amendment. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 20, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;208&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The applicable service information may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Slotte, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797; fax (206) 227&hyph;130. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 1, 1993, the FAA issued telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51, which is applicable to all Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report from an operator that the pitch control on a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. Investigation into the cause of this stiffness revealed that the feel and limitation computer (FLC) failed and caused stiff operation of the pitch control. This condition, if not corrected, could result in stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. Airbus Industrie has installed these computers on all Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. Each airplane has two FLC's, designated FLC 1 and FLC 2. The FLC and the pitch feel fault lights are integral components of the pitch feel system. (The pitch feel fault lights indicate a failure of the FLC.) Currently, these airplanes are allowed to operate with one inoperative pitch feel system. If the airplane is operated with one inoperative pitch feel system, failure of the other FLC could result in stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function. This failure could also allow excessive elevator movement, which could expose the airplane structure to excessive air loads. Airbus Industrie has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 27&hyph;14, dated November 2, 1993, applicable to all Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes, that describes procedures for performing repetitive operational tests to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The Direction &Gacute;eńerale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic airworthiness directive 93&hyph;202&hyph;153(b), dated November 2, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 to require repetitive operational tests to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT previously described. Any FLC that fails the operational test is required to be repaired or replaced in accordance with a method approved by the FAA. The AD also prohibits operation of any airplane with an inoperative pitch feel system or inoperative pitch feel fault lights.
