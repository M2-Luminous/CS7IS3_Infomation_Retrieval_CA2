The provincial government reported that 1,000-plus local enterprises that used to operate at a loss have gained new vitality, and consequently 2.3-billion-yuan-worth of idle assets have been put to use again. In 1993 alone 408 enterprises in Sichuan eliminated losses and began to create profits after their property rights were transfered. To further expand the reform of property rights, governments at all levels have somewhat relaxed the relevant restrictions to permit the sale of a certain amount of state-owned assets. Known as the "Sichuan model", the province's experience in transfer of property rights distinctly features careful planning and good organization. Property rights exchange centers have been established to stimulate and supervise the annexing, sale, leasing and auction of the property of state-owned and collective enterprises. Frequent property rights fairs are held and the latest information is released in time to boost the healthy and active activities of local property rights markets. In June last year the Sichuan Provincial Government listed 16 small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to be sold to foreign buyers during trade talks held in Hong Kong.
