Mr. Badibangi, leader of the Zairian Socialist Union affiliated to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition hard-line faction [USOR], said he was convinced that the only way to find a solution to the current political deadlock is "by resorting to arms." The problem will be quickly resolved by "engaging the people in an armed struggle, instead of hesitating and wasting time with consultations and other meetings by the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament." Mr. Badibangi also said his party reserved the right to quit the USOR in case the latter "would prefer to continue to toe the line of nonviolence, a principle which has still not proven to be effective. Another radical opposition political leader, Jacques Malanda, of the Convention of Nationalist Reformers, also affiliated to USOR, had earlier threatened to resort to an "armed resistance" at a news conference held on 2 March in the Angolan capital.
