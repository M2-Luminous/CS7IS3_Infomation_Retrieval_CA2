The official session this morning was chaired by the Kenyan foreign minister in the presence of the foreign ministers of the four Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] countries. All three negotiating parties, the Sudanese Government and the two rebel factions, attended the meeting. It has been resolved that each of the three negotiating parties should be represented in the talks by six persons. The government delegation stated that the talks would be based on previous agendas and start from where the Abuja talks had ended. The united faction agrees with the government in this regard, but the attitude of Garang's faction towards the previous agenda is ambiguous. [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 1900 GMT on 22 March adds: "The peace negotiations between the government and the two rebel factions will resume in Nairobi at 1000 tomorrow with all the delegations continuing to discuss the agenda, relief, and other humanitarian issues." ["This evening's session assumed a bilateral form between ministers of the IGADD committee and the Sudanese Government delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah. During the session, the IGADD ministers submitted an agenda derived from what had been submitted in the previous peace rounds."]
