FR940810-2-00044 FR940810-2-00024 Mixed transuranic waste is stored on a pad at Area 5 under conditions set forth in the July 1992 Settlement Agreement between DOE and the State of Nevada. A consent agreement signed by DOE and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection in 1994 allows storage at Area 5 of mixed waste generated during characterization activities. Through 1994 there have been 1054 nuclear tests conducted by the United States, 928 of which were conducted on the Nevada Test Site. Defense research and weapons test verification activities were conducted at other test locations in Nevada. Nuclear devices were detonated underground at the Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area. From 1957 to 1963, many safety tests using special nuclear materials and chemical explosives were conducted at sites on the Nevada Test Site, Nellis Air Force Range, and Tonopah Test Range to test the safety of nuclear weapons in accident situations. These tests have resulted in the release of radioactive materials and surface contamination over large areas. The Yucca Mountain site is located on the southwestern boundary of the Nevada Test Site. In the 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), Congress directed DOE to characterize the Yucca Mountain site for possible development of a geologic repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste. Prior to passage of the 1987 amendments, DOE had prepared an environmental assessment (EA) which included an analysis of the effects of site characterization activities at Yucca Mountain (DOE/RW&hyph;0073, May 1986). If DOE ultimately recommends approval of the Yucca Mountain site to the President, that recommendation must be accompanied by an EIS prepared under the specific provisions of the NWPA. All activities regarding the characterization of the Yucca Mountain site, and any eventual construction and operation of a repository, including environmental review, are regulated by the process prescribed in the NWPA. Therefore, the Nevada Test Site EIS will address ongoing Yucca Mountain site characterization activities only as they relate to the cumulative impacts of activities on the Nevada Test Site during the period covered by the EIS, using the Yucca Mountain EA as a baseline. Public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management surround the Nevada Test Site and Nellis Air Force Range on all sides. The Tonopah Test Range is located in the northwestern portion of the Nellis Air Force Range, and is operated by Sandia National Laboratories, under contract with the DOE Albuquerque Operations Office, and through a Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of Energy's Albuquerque and Nevada Operations Offices. The Central Nevada Test Area is located approximately 60 miles east of Tonopah between Warm Springs and Currant (approximately 160 miles north of Las Vegas), and the Project Shoal Area is located approximately 30 miles southeast of Fallon (approximately 90 miles east of Reno and 285 miles northwest of Las Vegas). The Nevada Test Site, Nellis Air Force Range, and Tonopah Test Range each have restricted-access areas that are not open to the public for purposes such as agriculture, mining, land disposal of wastes, or mineral leasing. With the exception of very limited special hunting access to a portion of the Nellis Air Force Range, these sites are not open for recreational use. The Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area are not restricted-access areas and are open for general public uses including grazing and recreation, but not to mining. Public roads link the Project Shoal Area and the Central Nevada Test Area with the Nevada Test Site and these may be used to ship wastes to the Nevada Test Site. In addition, some public roads may be used to transport waste from Nellis Air Force Range and Tonopah Test Range to the waste management locations on the Nevada Test Site or elsewhere. Public roads are also used to ship low level radioactive waste from other DOE sites to the Nevada Test Site and to ship hazardous waste from the Nevada Test Site to permitted disposal facilities. Preliminary Identification of Alternatives The proposed action is to develop a resource management plan for the Nevada Test Site. The Department of Energy needs a site resource management plan that would allow it to continue its missions in a way that minimizes or avoids environmental impacts. A preliminary set of resource management alternatives for evaluation in the EIS has been identified below. The final set of alternatives and issues to be considered in the EIS will reflect consideration of the public input received during the scoping period. No Action Under the no action alternative, existing missions and operations would continue at the present level. Environmental restoration activities would continue at the Nevada Test Site and at off-site test locations within the State of Nevada. Off-site test location activities would be consistent with the applicable land use plans of the controlling agency. This alternative includes the potential to resume underground nuclear testing and conducting other nuclear weapon related experiments at the Nevada Test Site. Expanded use of the Nevada Test Site for defense-related experiments, alternative energy source technology development, non- or counter-proliferation research and development and environmental technology development would not be pursued. Waste management activities would continue to support existing DOE missions and operations in the same manner and degree as at present and in the recent past. Continuing activities at the Area 3 and 5 radioactive waste management sites include: the disposal of low-level radioactive wastes generated from both on-site activities and off-site DOE and Department of Defense facilities such as the Fernald Field Office near Cincinnati, Ohio; the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (formerly the Rocky Flats Plant), Golden, Colorado; the Amarillo Area Office (Pantex), Amarillo, Texas; and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland. Other continuing activities include storage of transuranic and other wastes, accumulation of hazardous wastes prior to off-site shipment for disposal, and disposal of on-site generated mixed waste that meets the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) land disposal restriction criteria. Groundwater characterization would continue with the associated waste management activities. This alternative is intended to encompass current operations, including waste management and technology development operations without the improvements or expansion which would occur under the expanded use alternative. Expanded Use Under this alternative, maximum use would be made of the Nevada Test Site in support of national programs of both a defense and non-defense nature. National Defense activities could include a resumption of underground nuclear testing with the required support activities; conducting other nuclear weapons related experiments; the construction and operation of various types of simulator facilities and other experimental test facilities; tritium production; plutonium storage and disposition; nuclear weapons storage and disassembly and similar activities that could be best conducted at a remote site. The site could also be used for various exercises and technology development aimed at countering nuclear terrorism or proliferation activities. Non-defense programs could include the study of alternative energy sources including the construction and operation of various solar energy facilities that would demonstrate the effectiveness of the technologies; expanded use of the Liquefied Gaseous Fuels Spill Test Facility; and increased use of the site as an Environmental Research Park.
