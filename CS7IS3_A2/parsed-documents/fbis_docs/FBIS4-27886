Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito returned early from a European tour to attend the meeting, which set the line for trilateral consultations with the United States and South Korea expected to be held Friday in Washington. The U.S. has warned it will seek economic sanctions against North Korea if the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is prevented from examining discharged nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon to determine whether spent fuel has been diverted to manufacture nuclear weapons. North Korea over the past two weeks has been removing spent fuel rods from the reactor and is expected to have fully reloaded the reactor within one or two days. The IAEA has warned that its capacity to carry out tests will be lost "in days" unless Pyongyang halts the unmonitored fuel exchange and places the discharged rods under international supervision. The Washington consultations aim at formulating joint punitive measures against North Korea in case China, the communist nation's longtime ally, vetoes a UN Security Council resolution threatening economic sanctions. Washington is expected to reiterate its demand that Tokyo halt yen remittances to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan, which are believed to be a major source of foreign currency for the isolationist, economically weak country. The talks will also "prepare for the worst scenario," a ministry source said, alluding to a possible military confrontation over the nuclear issue. North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from carrying out full inspections of its nuclear plants, fueling suspicions that it is secretly developing nuclear weapons. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed grave concern over North Korea's refusal to comply with the UN and its nuclear watchdog's inspection demands. "If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will lead to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of the concern of the international community." A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to seek a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue. "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference. Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's Security Council statement urging Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguard requirements. Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be seen. A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official later said three-way talks among Japan, the U.S. and South Korea in Washington on Friday will focus on measures to deal with potential action by the UN Security Council. The options are either the implementation of sanctions or a warning if North Korea continues to reject international inspections, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said the three countries will explore the possibility of supporting a step-by-step approach to the North Korean nuclear issue, an approach which would win China's support.
