ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT). NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues, and this meeting is being held to discuss the Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee agenda for the coming year. The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic, and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-based approach to environmental management. The Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee will evaluate opportunities to re-orient the Agency's use of its existing authorities to integrate ecosystem management into its decision-making processes; identify incentives and barriers to promoting an ecosystems orientation or place-based approach to environmental protection; and identify opportunities for partnership-building with other federal agencies as well as co-regulators at the state, local, tribal levels. The Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee and NACEPT include a representative cross-section of EPA's partners and constituents. However, in order to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested parties as this Committee begins its work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public. Any member of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting Gwendolyn Whitt or Debra Miller at the address and telephone numbers below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will be strictly held to five minutes, and slots are limited. Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first serve basis to those scheduling a presentation in advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to, or at, the meeting.
