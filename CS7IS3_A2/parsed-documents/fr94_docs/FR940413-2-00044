FR940413-2-00044 FR940413-2-00028 [OPP&hyph;50779; FRL&hyph;4773&hyph;8] Receipt of an Application for an Experimental Use Permit for Use of Bromoxynil on Herbicide Tolerant Cotton Plants AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On February 18, 1993, EPA received from Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co. an application for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) and a petition for a temporary tolerance for the use of Buctril Gel which contains the herbicide bromoxynil, on cotton plants genetically modified to be tolerant to this herbicide. On June 4, 1993, the EUP was accepted for a period of 1 year with the provision that the crop be destroyed or used only for research purposes. The registrant has requested that the EUP be extended on a crop destruct basis until the temporary tolerance is established. Due to recent interest in the introduction of genetically modified herbicide tolerant plants into commercial agriculture, the Agency has determined that this application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, in triplicate, should bear the docket control number OPP&hyph;50779 and be submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice to the submitter. Written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert J. Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 241, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 18, 1993, an application for an EUP and a Petition for Temporary Tolerance was received from Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 for the use of Buctril Gel, which contains the herbicide bromoxynil, on cotton plants genetically modified to be tolerant to the herbicide. The EUP was requested for a period of 2 years. Data submitted in support of the temporary tolerance were insufficient to grant the temporary tolerance for the 1993 growing season. The EUP was subsequently issued on June 4, 1993, (EPA Reg. No. 264&hyph;EUP&hyph;93) for a 1&hyph;year period with the provision that the food or feed derived from the experimental program would be destroyed or fed only to experimental animals for testing purposes, or otherwise disposed of in a manner which would not endanger man or the environment. Since the temporary tolerance for bromoxynil has not yet been established, the registrant requested on March 14, 1994, that the EUP be extended for a period of 1&hyph;year under the previous provisions, which would not allow food or feed to be sold, while the issues concerning the temporary tolerance are being resolved. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service published a notice in the Federal Register of September 8, 1993 (58 FR 47249), of their receipt of a petition for determination of nonregulated status of genetically engineered cotton lines. This notice and the referenced petition contain information related specifically to the genetic modification of the herbicide tolerant cotton plants which will be treated under this EUP. The purpose of the EUP as stated on the product label is to evaluate the control of certain broadleaf weeds in transgenic Bromotol cotton. Applications of the product can be made by ground equipment only to transgenic Bromotol cotton that has been genetically modified for crop tolerance to postemergence over-the-top applications of bromoxynil. The objectives for the 1994 testing program are stated to be: (1) Evaluate product efficacy on major broadleaf weeds that infest cotton, (2) compare weed control with commercial standard weed control systems on cotton, (3) verify transgenic seed purity during seed production, and (4) compare Buctril weed control system with commercial standard weed control systems of cotton in major cotton growing areas using standard commercial production methods and varieties. The application for the 1994 EUP request use of 4,000 pounds of the active ingredient bromoxynil on a total of 4,000 acres of cotton. Testing is proposed for the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Upon review of the EUP extension request, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information, EPA will decide whether to issue or deny the EUP extension. If issued, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments are to be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP by the Agency will be announced in the Federal Register . EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has a Public Docket Room where a copy of the EUP application deleted of all ``Confidential Business Information'' will be available for public inspection. The Public Docket Room is located at Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA; the hours of operation are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. Dated: March 31, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
