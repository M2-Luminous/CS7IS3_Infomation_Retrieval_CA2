FR940511-1-00024 FR940511-1-00004 In considering whether to propose amendments to the APY formula, the Board focused on two issues: a desire for an APY that reflects the time value of money, and a concern about the compliance costs and impact on depository institutions if changes were made. The Board published a proposal that would factor into the APY calculation the specific time intervals for interest paid on the account_that is, the time value of money (Approach A). However, the Board also requested comment on a narrower approach that would affect only noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. For these accounts, the APY would never be lower than the interest rate (Approach B). The Board also solicited comment on leaving the regulation unchanged (Approach C). The Board received about 500 comments on its proposal. Nearly 90% of the comments were from financial institutions. Considering all comments received, approximately 5% supported Approach A; 15% supported Approach B; and 75% supported Approach C. The remainder presented other alternatives or expressed no opinion on the specific approaches. (2) Discussion Approach A: Proposal of an Additional Formula Based on the comments received and upon further analysis, the Board is withdrawing the proposed amendments to the APY formula. Overall, the Board believes that the proposed formula (Approach A) would be complex and costly to implement, and the costs would outweigh the benefits derived from the proposed changes. (See Docket R&hyph;0836 elsewhere in today's Federal Register for proposed amendments which the Board believes might better capture the intent of the act's purposes in a less complex way.) The Board believes the formula proposed in December would correct the APY anomalies produced by the current formula, and has considered the view of some commenters that the short-term costs of correcting the formula might be worthwhile over time. However, the Board is more persuaded by the commenters_including both consumer groups and industry associations_that believed the costs of compliance outweigh the benefits from implementing the proposed APY formula. Commenters reported that substantial costs recently had been incurred to implement the regulation, and they believed the distinctions in the APY produced by the complex formula proposed by Approach A did not warrant the substantial costs of implementing changes to the regulation_perhaps as much as 50% of the initial costs to implement the regulation. The Board concurs with the commenters that voiced concern about the complexity of the proposed formula. These commenters noted that the formula was complex for both consumers and institutions. Many commenters stated that although an internal rate of return formula is a standard mathematical tool in the financial markets, its introduction in APY calculations would eliminate, as a practical matter, the use of many handheld calculators for preparing disclosures or quoting APYs to consumers. Commenters also noted due to the complexity of the APY calculation there would be an increased risk of error and potential civil liability in making this calculation for a wide variety of accounts. The Board also notes the views of commenters that believed that in adopting Approach A, the Board would merely be trading one set of assumptions for another set of assumptions. Many commenters concurred with the Board that the current APY does not always reflect the value of periodic interest distributions, for example. But they also believed that the proposed APY also would not be factually accurate in all circumstances. For example, commenters remarked that the proposed APY would fail to reflect the fact that interest payments cannot always be immediately reinvested at the same rate as the account from which the interest was paid. They also believed it would be inappropriate to assume such a reinvestment rate for small monthly interest checks, for example, since rates typically rise based on the length of maturity and amount of principal. They noted that elderly consumers who hold multi-year CDs and who rely on periodic interest payments for living expenses would be particularly affected by the assumption. Commenters noted that returns on deposit accounts traditionally have been based on the rate of interest paid and any compounding frequency. Higher yields historically have been equated with higher dollar interest payments_not more frequent interest payments_and commenters believed that consumers expect an APY to reflect those factors. Many commenters believed that the underlying premise of Approach A_the time value of money_is inappropriate for deposit account disclosures. Many believed an assumption based on potential earnings outside the account relationship was misleading for the APY calculation. They believed the purposes of Truth in Savings are not best served by an APY disclosure based on the timing of interest payments that is higher for consumers who receive less interest overall. Due to concerns about costs and questions about the benefits provided, the Board believes this approach would not be the best solution. Approach B: Noncompounding Multi-Year CDs The Board also is not adopting Approach B, based on the combination of the limited scope of the problem Approach B seeks to address, the creation of new anomalies, and the cost to the industry of reviewing and implementing new calculation and disclosure requirements. On the one hand, the Board believes Approach B is a simple, direct approach to correct one anomaly produced by the current APY formula. The Board also recognizes that the disclosure of an APY that is lower than the interest rate on a noncompounding multi-year CD that pays interest at least annually may be confusing to some consumers. 3 3 The Board notes, however, that even if Approach B were adopted, institutions would still disclose an APY lower than the interest rate, such as for a multi-year CD that does not compound and pays interest only at maturity. Overall, however, the Board is more persuaded by commenters that voiced concern about the accuracy of the APY disclosed under Approach B. For example, commenters echoed concerns expressed about the proposed formula in Approach A. They remarked that the APY permitted under Approach B assumed the interest payments received during the term would be reinvested at the same rate as the account from which the interest was paid. Others believed it would be anomalous to disclose the same APY is disclosed for two multi-year accounts, one compounding annually and the other not compounding at all. The Board also notes the commenters' concerns about the cost to the industry of reviewing and implementing new calculation and disclosure requirements. They noted the costs of implementing Approach B would be less significant, compared to Approach A. Although the change would affect a single class of accounts, commenters reported that some computer programming changes would be required and additional disclosures would be appropriate. Commenters stated that since consumers would see the same APY for compounding and noncompounding CDs, a statement might be necessary in advertisements and account disclosures to help consumers understand the terms of the account. (For example, assume two institutions offer a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest rate. One compounds annually, the other offers annual interest payments. Both could advertise a 6.00% APY, even though a consumer depositing $1,000 receives $120 if interest checks are paid and $123.60 if interest is compounded.) Finally, the Board notes some commenters remarked that institutions could easily remedy the current anomaly with a simple change to their product. They noted institutions could advertise and disclose an APY equal to the contract interest rate under the current formula by offering CDs that have annual compounding, regardless of any payment options. Due to the limited problem Approach B seeks to address, the limited resolution of anomalies produced by the current APY formula, and the costs associated with adopting the approach, the Board has determined not to adopt Approach B. (3) Regulatory flexibility analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act The Board solicited comment on the potential cost of implementing the proposed APY formula, such as the proportion of existing accounts would require the new formula for computing APYs, the changes institutions would have to make to implement the new formula, the cost to make these changes, and the likelihood of changes in the number of different account terms and types of accounts offered would result if the new formula were adopted. In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions were reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after consideration of comments received during the public comment period. The Board's Office of the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed revisions to Regulation DD, a copy of which may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, at (202) 452&hyph;3245.
