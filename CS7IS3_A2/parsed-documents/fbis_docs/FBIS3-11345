About 60 professors, and officers and civilians were in the college auditorium to listen to a lecture by Cuban Higher Education Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, who fought next to Fidel Castro and was vice minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. "Times change," said the former officer, who faced in a natural way the fact that the school was a center for anti-communist preaching during the military regime. ESG Commander Brigadier Sergio Ferolla said: "The doors of the school are open to all without restrictions."
