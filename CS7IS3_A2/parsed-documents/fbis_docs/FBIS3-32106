FBIS3-32106 "drlat022_j_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 Panama MUN Urges Unity Among New Parties PA0102212694 Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 27 Jan 94 PA0102212694 Panama City Telemetro Television Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] [Text] The entire National Unity Mission [MUN] leadership organized a news conference this morning to call on political parties such as Papa Egoro and Solidarity, as well as civic organizations and other business groups, to support an agreement that would lead to urgently needed changes. In addition, MUN called for an alliance that would continue not only up to the elections, but all through the 1994-1999 period. It also called for the government to adopt programs prepared jointly by the parties and aimed at developing the country. [Begin MUN presidential candidate David Guerra recording] [words indistinct] has decided to make an urgent and direct call to all those new political parties that decided to organize with the intention of bringing some type of hope to this country. We urge them to take on the historical commitment the country demands and to come forward with their respective programs to make up one single driving force, free of any politics, party interests, resources or power dealings, and guided by the socio-economic development this country -- which is shouting for an opportunity -- desperately needs. MUN would also like to call on every group, including all those unions who have looked in vain for concrete answers to their just and unpostponable demands, the teachers union, the IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification] and INTEL [National Institute of Telecommunications] workers, transportation sector workers, doctors, students, nurses, and all other citizens groups to abandon all neutral and silent positions which, if they persist, will only bring more harm to this country. We urge these groups to make up their minds today to actively participate in an agreement that will determine this country's fate. We would like to call on the country's economic forces to join this historic effort to save democracy and establish the foundations of an administration that will really understand the people's needs. This will ensure social stability, which is so needed if the country expects to accomplish the economic development it deserves. MUN, as one of the new parties hinted, opens its doors to that national agreement the country desperately needs. MUN is aware that it is a big risk for any political party to participate in the elections on its own. Although we are not apprehensive about participating on our own, MUN is responsible enough to acknowledge that every new party is obligated to provide the country with the new answers and alternatives it needs. That is our communique and position at this time. [end recording]
