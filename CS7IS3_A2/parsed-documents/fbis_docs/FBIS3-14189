Meanwhile, the Kurdish administration has told Western states that Iraqi military deployments on the front lines with the Kurds have assumed a serious form -- which points to aggressive intentions. The sources expressed their hope that the coalition states would officially warn Baghdad against any aggressive actions against Kurdish areas, whose inhabitants now feel the danger and are worried. The sources pointed out that the Iraqis have deployed two Republican Guard divisions on the front lines in Chamchamal and Karkuk. They said that Kurdish forces are watching the Iraqi movements and expect any potential strikes to focus on areas situated south of Parallel 36.
