How far that defiance will go remains to be seen. It is quite possible that the councillors will choose to amend the second, more controversial, part, in particular an extension of the franchise in the functional constituencies, comprising members of different professions and trades. However, whether they tone down Mr Patten's proposals or not, the rupture between the British and Chinese governments seems complete. Beijing's threat to disband the Legislative Council when it takes over in 1997 -- first made at the end of last year -- has been reiterated in the wake of Wednesday's LegCo vote. The goal of a smooth transition from British to Chinese sovereignty, one of the main aims of the 1984 Joint Declaration, is receding to vanishing point. Failure to attain it will mark a signal failure in the policy of each country. The political arrangements for Hong Kong having apparently reached an impasse, there will be a rush to judgment. Writing on the facing page, George Walden ascribes the lion's share of blame to the British Government for believing that it was ever possible "to have anything approaching serious democracy in Hong Kong." Yet it seemed vital to some ministers and some passionate democrats in Britain, following the Joint Declaration, that the colony should seek to establish a distinctive political identity before it was handed back to China. That document spoke of a Special Administrative Region with "a high degree of autonomy" and a legislature "constituted by elections." The tactics which Britain has used to define this new identity are open to criticism. But it should not be forgotten that Mr Patten's plan for a limited extension of democracy has enjoyed wide support among the people of Hong Kong; and that it is they, through LegCo, who will decide its fate. The breakdown of relations between London and Beijing over Hong Kong need not cast too dark a shadow over the future of the colony. The economy of southern China, in which it plays an irreplaceable role as entrepot and capital market, is booming. Continued prosperity in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian is essential to the growth of China as a whole. Without such growth, the Communist Party will lose its sole remaining claim to legitimacy. A second cause for optimism is the example which Beijing will set over Hong Kong for the much greater task of reunification with Taiwan. The more drastically it intervenes in the first, the more it will encourage the second to keep its distance. The next three years will be tense and difficult for Hong Kong. But the Taiwanese and economic factors may yet enable the colony to pull through to a brighter future than Beijing currently threatens.
