FR940928-2-00097 FR940928-2-00067 Criterion 2 This update of the fire protection modifications contained in Table 1 of the July 31, 1979, fire protection SER does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaulated as follows: Item 7C_The use of the an air compressor rather than the cascade recharging stations does not adversely impact the ability to supply breathing air for the fire brigade and is acceptable under BTP APCSB 9.5&hyph;1. Item 9_The use of unrated metal hatches has been accepted by the NRC in a SER dated June 17, 1988. Item 20_The new fire pumps have already been accepted by the NRC in the SER dated March 31, 1993, Amendment Nos. 171 and 154. The retirement of the old screenhouse diesel driven fire pumps is based on the availability of another supply of ``backup'' fire suppression water. Criterion 3 This update of the fire protection modifications contained in Table 1 of the July 31, 1979, fire protection SER does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as follows: Item 7C_The use of an air compressor rather than the cascade recharging stations does not adversely impact the ability to supply breathing air for the fire brigade and is acceptable under BTP APCSB 9.5&hyph;1. Filled spare breathing air bottles are on-site and the local municipal department will provide assistance as needed. Item 9_The use of unrated metal hatches has been accepted by the NRC in a SER dated June 17, 1988. Item 20_The new fire pumps have already been accepted by the NRC in the SER dated March 31, 1993, Amendment Nos. 171 and 154. The retirement of the old screenhouse diesel driven fire pumps is based on the availability of another supply of ``backup'' fire suppression water. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085. Attorney for licensee: Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. NRC Project Director: Ledyard B. Marsh Indiana Michigan Power Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;315 and 50&hyph;316, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Berrien County, Michigan Date of amendment request: July 19, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications by removing the specific scheduling requirements for Types A, B, and C tests and replacing these requirements with a requirement to perform Types A, B, and C testing in accordance with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Criterion 1 This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed changes to the T/Ss do not affect the assumptions, parameters, or results of any UFSAR accident analysis. The proposed changes do not modify the response of the containment during a design basis accident. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing equipment. The proposed Types A, B, and C testing schedules will be consistent with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that the changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Criterion 2 The proposed changes do not involve physical changes to the plant or changes in plant operating configuration. The proposed changes only remove the restrictive schedular requirements for conducting Type A testing from the T/Ss and substitute the schedule specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. For Types B and C testing, the schedular requirements are removed from T/Ss because they are already specified in Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Criterion 3 The margin for safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed change in the schedular requirements for Type A tests. Types B and C schedular requirements are not changed by removing them from T/Ss. Although the changes allow more flexibility in scheduling Type A tests, the proposed amendment continues to ensure reactor containment system reliability by periodic testing in full compliance with 10 CFR 50, Appendix J. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that the changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
