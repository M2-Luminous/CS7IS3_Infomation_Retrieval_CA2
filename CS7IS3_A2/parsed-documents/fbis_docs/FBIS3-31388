FBIS3-31388 "dreeu033__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Slovak Measure Jeopardizes Customs Union AU1602074994 Prague CTK in English 2116 GMT 15 Feb 94 AU1602074994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliamentary Agricultural Committee sent a letter to its Slovak counterpart body today requesting that it push for the cancellation of the requirement that food products imported into Slovakia carry a Slovak quality certificate. Slovakia introduced the requirement unilaterally and with only one day's notice on February 11. In the letter chairman of the Czech Parliamentary Agricultural Committee Jan Cerny told Pavel Koncos that the new measure "quite clearly discriminates against Czech exporters of food products." The move also seriously interfered with the functioning of the customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, he said, because the quality norms of both countries were the same and because the basis of any customs union was mutual recognition of the other state's laboratory analysis and certification. Cerny stated that he hoped the Slovak Parliamentary Agricultural Committee would contribute to the requirement being revoked or to the drawing up of an agreement in the interests of preserving the customs union.
