He affirmed that the use of arms "will never resolve the Algerian crisis." In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, he urged a return "to the sensible option and the need for all political partners in the Algerian arena to sit together around the dialogue table, lay down their arms, and convince each other by reasonable and legitimate methods." He drew attention to the fact that HAMAS has chosen dialogue. He added that "dialogue in the end led to closer views and led to a meeting between the Algerian defense minister and the FIS leaders in prison." Referring to the "split within FIS," he said that "such a thing was expected and will continue until the appearance of evidence to the contrary, especially after one of the FIS founders declared that the issue of the current violence in Algeria can be resolved neither by Cheik Abbasi Madani, nor by Cheik Ali Belhadj, nor by Cheik Abdelkader Sahraoui -- which proves that the violence has gone too far and is out of control." Nahnah warned against interference by "opportunists, the economic mafia, criminals, fools, thieves, and people with ulterior motives acting under the cover of the prevailing violence in Algeria." He reaffirmed that the policy of taking up arms "will never solve the Algerian crisis." Nahnah criticized the "exploitation of Islam, culture, and democracy for personal gain and the involvement of these matters in the issue of national dialogue in Algeria." He urged "everyone to give up and sacrifice his personal interests in favor of Algeria's general interests and the unity of its people." He spoke of the need to "purify the dialogue issue" and called on the people concerned to "join the dialogue without seeking to settle historical, economic, or political scores, because such a dialogue would take us to safe shores at the earliest possible time and the least cost." Nahnah urged the Algerian leadership to "declare frankly that it is not hostile to Islam and to clarify its position on the question of foreign aid and the way of settling the Algerian state's debts." He criticized the "tardiness of successive Algerian governments in rescheduling debts." He called for "a frank declaration of the reasons for and causes of its delay in settling this matter." He also stressed that the old economic laws and regulations should be abolished and new laws promulgated to free the economy, investments, and specialization. He urged the current Algerian Government "to announce its boycott of the members of the former socialist regime and its bankrupt symbols, and to have the full courage to move on to a new political, economic, and social phase." He warned "the Islamists and those who promote the ideologies of al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin [renegades and assassins, old Islamic sects] and seek to foment sedition and chop off heads without clear reasons" that they "will meet the same fate as the al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin in history." On the current situation in Algeria, Nahnah said: "Algeria is witnessing blind sedition. Our motto will continue to be dialogue, tolerance, and the abandonment of personal interests in favor of the nation's higher interests, particularly that of upholding God's religion without conflict with the divine teachings, either in words or in deeds in society." He praised the style of President Liamine Zeroual's government in dealing with "the FIS and in bringing together the political partners around the dialogue table, and releasing some FIS leaders." He asked: "If that is going to continue, what is the point of killing people and spilling blood on Algerian soil?"
