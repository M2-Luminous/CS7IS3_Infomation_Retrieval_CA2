FR940203-0-00050 FR940203-0-00014 40 CFR Parts 185 and 186 [FAP 3H5659/R2021; FRL&hyph;4738&hyph;3] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Food/Feed Additive Regulations for Hexakis AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This regulation establishes or increases tolerances for the combined residues of the miticide hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane and its organotin metabolites calculated as hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane in or on the food commodity citrus oil and the feed commodities dried citrus pulp, dried apple pomace, and raisin waste. The regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the miticide was requested in a petition submitted by E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective February 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by the document control number, [FAP 3H5659/R2021], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (A-110), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Dennis H. Edwards, Jr., Product Manager (PM) 19, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 207, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-6386. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54355), EPA issued a notice announcing that E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., had submitted a food/feed additive petition (FAP 3H5659) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR parts 185 and 186, under section 409 of the FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 348, by establishing a tolerance in or on citrus oil and increasing tolerances in or on dried citrus pulp, dried apple pomace, and raisin waste for the combined residues of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane and its organotin metabolites calculated as hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane. The Agency has determined that citrus oil may be a human food, and a tolerance in or on citrus oil must be included in 40 CFR 185.3550. Tolerances exist for residues in citrus fruits, apples, and grapes (40 CFR 180.362). Studies submitted in support of the reregistration of hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane showed that it concentrates during the processing of these commodities. The Agency requested that Du Pont submit a food additive petition that proposed tolerances that would be adequate for the increased concentrations of residues. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are sought and capable of achieving its intended physical or technical effect. The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances include the following: 1. A subchronic rat feeding study (data requirements satisfied by the chronic rat study) with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 50 parts per million (ppm) and a lowest-effect level (LEL) of 100 ppm, based on increased BUN. 2. A 21-day rabbit dermal toxicity study with systemic NOEL greater than 5 milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) of body weight/day and dermal NOEL of 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on erythema and edema. 3. A chronic rat feeding/carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 5 mg/kg of body weight/day) and LEL of 600 ppm (equivalent to 30 mg/kg of body weight/day), based on increased alkaline phosphatase and testes weight. Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential was not demonstrated. 4. A chronic dog feeding study with NOEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day and LEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on vomiting and diarrhea. 5. A mouse carcinogenicity study with NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 15 mg/kg of body weight/day) and LEL of 300 ppm (equivalent to 45 mg/kg of body weight/day) based on decreased body weights. Under the study conditions carcinogenic potential was not demonstrated. 6. A rat developmental toxicity study with maternal NOEL of 15 mg/kg of body weight/day and maternal LEL of 30 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on postimplantation loss and decreased body weight. The developmental NOEL was 30 mg/kg of body weight/day. 7. A rabbit developmental toxicity study with a maternal/developmental NOEL of 1 mg/kg of body weight/day and a maternal/developmental LEL of 5 mg/kg of body weight/day, based on slightly decreased maternal body weight/intrauterine mortality. Maternal death resulted at 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. 8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with maternal/reproductive NOEL of 75 ppm (5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day in males and 5.98 mg/kg of body weight/day in females) and maternal/reproductive LEL of 250 ppm (17.4 mg/kg of body weight/day in males and 20.3 mg/kg of body weight/day in females), based on decreased maternal body weight and food consumption and decreased pup body weight during lactation. 9. The Ames gene mutation assay was negative up to cytotoxic levels. 10. Several other mutagenicity studies that were all negative. These include a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutation assay, a human lymphocyte assay for chromosomal aberration, and an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. 11. A general metabolism study in rats shows that bioaccumulation is low, with the highest levels found in the liver, heart, and kidneys. Most is excreted unchanged within 72 hours in the feces. The reference dose (RfD) based on the two-generation rat reproduction study (NOEL of 5.2 mg/kg of body weight/day for reduced body weight and food consumption in both sexes of pups of the first and second generations) and using a 100-fold uncertainty factor is calculated to be 0.05 mg/kg of body weight/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from existing tolerances is calculated to be 0.068104 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will not increase the TMRC, and no dietary risk exposure analysis was conducted. Published tolerances for meat and milk will cover any secondary residues that may result from use as feed items. Adequate gas chromatographic analytical methods are available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II), for enforcement purposes. There are currently no actions pending against continued registration of this chemical. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR 185.3550 and 186.3550 would protect the public health and use of the pesticide would be safe. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; the resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
