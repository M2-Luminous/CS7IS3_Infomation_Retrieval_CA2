He said that the proposal for convening a national conference which was made by a joint meeting of the government, political parties and public organisations of the DPRK on April 11 represents the desire of the entire fellow countrymen for the reunification of the country. The conference will be a very significant meeting which makes it possible for the entire fellow countrymen in the North, the South and overseas to promote the great national unity and open a new phase of reunification by pooling their efforts and wisdom, irrespective of differences in ideology and idea, political view and religious belief, he said, and continued: Those who do not want our nation to fall victims to big powers and who hope it will defend its dignity and live a happy life together in a reunified country must take the road of national unity, irrespective of their residence and occupation, and prove their patriotic will by unhesitatingly rushing out to the plaza of the national conference which will unfold a new chapter of reconciliation and unity. We cannot tolerate the anti-national crimes of the South Korean authorities who dislike to shake hands with the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation and unity and are hatching up a plot to unleash a reckless nuclear war at the sacrifice of the interests of the nation in conspiracy with the outside forces. The South Korean authorities must stop betraying the expectation of the whole nation for the convocation of the national conference and refrain from obstructing the participation of political parties, organisations and individual public figures of South Korea in a nationwide dialogue. All the members of the Chondoist Chongu Party and Chondoists in the northern half of Korea will make every possible effort to hold the national conference to accelerate the reunification in the 90s by achieving the great unity of the nation in the intrinsic idea of Chondoism intended to promote welfare of the country and the nation, declared the spokesman.
