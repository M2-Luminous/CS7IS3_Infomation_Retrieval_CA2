In an informal meeting with NGO representatives from the Caribbean, Pacific, Mediterranean, and Atlantic regions at the (Sherbon Center) in Bridgetown, Fidel Castro said these organizations are fully aware of policies concerning environmental and other matters. At the beginning of the meeting, (Jean Franz), coordinator of such Caribbean organizations, recalled the support expressed for Cuba in the recently concluded forum of those organizations. A resolution was approved defending the Cuban people's right to choose its own model for alternative development and condemning the U.S. Administration for the economic and financial blockade against Cuba. Fidel Castro expresssed thanks for the expressions of support and solidarity and added: We must change the negative environment the United States has created around Cuba with the blockade which prompts serious problems in the supply of foodstuff, medicines, and many other products essential to our development. Fidel Castro received lengthy applause from the people when he said: We feel like friends, like brethren among you, and for this reason I am leaving this country and this conference with a feeling of joy. Among other subjects discussed during the informal meeting, the Cuban leader joked about speculations on the state of his health which appeared in the local press and about which he was asked several times by reporters from a Miami television station who traveled to Bridgetown on learning of the Cuban statesman's presence in that capital. You are continuously asking me about the state of my health, and whether I sat down before and after the speech at the plenary session. In fact, I can no longer do the many things I used to do in Sierra Maestra days, but I still walk a great deal and swim for several hours, Castro said. In his final remarks, Fidel Castro underscored the importance of that meeting in organizing an action strategy to defend the islands from the serious problems that are threatening them, such as pollution, radioactive wastes, and climatic changes.
