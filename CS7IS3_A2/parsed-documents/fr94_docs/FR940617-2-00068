FR940617-2-00068 FR940617-2-00044 [Projects No. 2325, 2389, 2552, 2555, 2556, 2557, 2559, 2329, 2671, and 2613; 11433] Central Maine Power Co., et al; Edwards Manufacturing, Inc., and Town of Madison, Maine; Notice of Intent To Prepare An Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings June 13, 1994. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of hydroelectric projects within the Kennebec River Basin in the State of Maine. The hydropower projects are located north of the City of Augusta along the Kennebec River. The projects are: Weston No. 2325, Ft. Halifax No. 2552, Automatic No. 2555, Union Gas No. 2556, Rick Rips No. 2557, Oakland No. 2559, Wyman No. 2329, Moosehead No. 2671, Moxie No. 2613, Edwards No. 2389 and Sandy River No. 11433. The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. Scoping Meetings The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while a morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. The first scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 13, 1994, from 7:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. in the Cushnoc Auditorium, Augusta Civic Center, Augusta, Maine. Issues of primary concern to to general public will be the focus of the meeting. The second scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, July 14, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. at the Augusta Civic Center Drive, in the Washington and York rooms. The Augusta Civic Center can be reached from the Maine Turnpike by taking Exit 31-South onto Civic Center Drive; proceed one-half mile to the Civic Center entrance. Prior to the meetings, Scoping Document 1 Revised (SD 1&hyph;R) will be mailed to the list of interested parties. SD 1&hyph;R identifies resources issues to be address in the EIS. Copies of SD 1&hyph;R will also be available at the scoping meetings or can be obtained by writing: FERC-Kennebec Projects, c/o Doug Hjorth, Stone Webster, 245 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02210. Objectives At the scoping meetings the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis in the planned EIS; (2) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS; (3) identify resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue; and (5) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views. Procedures The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal record of the Commission proceedings. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record. Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS. Participants at the public meetings are asked to keep oral comments brief and concise. Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until August 15, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Kennebec River Basin EIS. All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the licensing proceeding are asked to refrain from engaging staff or its contractor in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings. Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list.
