[passage omitted] "My speech during the opening of the Federal Assembly can and must be viewed as political advice to the new Russian parliament from which the Russian people expect major democratic accomplishments," Boris Yeltsin told Interfax before his departure from the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He said that shortly he would address a joint session of both chambers, highlighting Russia's domestic and foreign policies, and economic targets for the next couple of years. As the Federation Council has not elected its chairman yet, on Boris Yeltsin's initiative the session is chaired by the Federation Council's oldest member, Yuriy Chernichenko, whose candidacy was supported during an open vote.
