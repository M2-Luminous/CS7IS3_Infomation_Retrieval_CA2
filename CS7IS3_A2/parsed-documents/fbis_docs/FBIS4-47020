Thus, if we take the average wage in April, R142,750, in keeping with the rules in effect as of today the following withholdings will be made from this amount: trade union dues--1 percent, or R1,428, the pension fund--1 percent (R1,428), and income tax--12 percent (R17,130). Total withholdings come to R19,986, and R122,768 will be issued to the individual. However, it should be taken into account in this instance that, as an average statistical citizen, every one of us is a consumer of goods and services which are part of the subsistence minimum. This means that, when buying these goods and services, everyone who draws a salary (1.52 million) pays out of his earnings value-added tax (VAT) in the amount of R5,995, or 4.2 percent of our average wage. Besides this, we should not forget about yet another indirect tax which we, once again as the average statistical citizen, pay out of our salaries--the excise tax on wine and vodka products. These payments come to R8,870 per month, or 6 percent of our average wage. Summing up the total, we see that only R109,703 remains of the wage issued to us (R122,768). Now let us move on to the indicator of the standard of living. The average per capita income in our republic comes to approximately 0.6 average wages. Therefore it is possible to consider that, after all withholdings, the average per capita income comes to R64,700 (107,903 times 0.6), whereas the standard of living will be equal to 1.43 (64.7 over 45.38). Additional outlays are incurred by the labor compensation fund in order to pay employees who are on forced administrative furloughs or working short work weeks. There are almost 200,000 such people in the republic, of whom, according to data from the Republic of Tatarstan State Committee for Labor, no fewer than 60 percent receive wages at the level of the minimum labor compensation on a monthly basis out of the labor compensation funds of enterprises. Therefore, no less than 2 percent, or R2,855 per one employed person per month, are withdrawn from the labor compensation fund to pay for incomplete employment. If we take into account this additional burden on each employed person, too, the remainder of the wage will come to R105,048, and the real value of the standard of living--1.38. Taking into account everything stated above, this low indicator of the standard of living confirms yet again the crisis condition of the socioeconomic situation in the republic which was stated at the 20th session of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet.
