The agreements covered matters relating to epidemiologic surveillance, human resource training, essential medicine, vaccinations, biotechnology products, and the drafting of a public health support system for Colombia. President Fidel Castro attended the agreement-signing ceremony, which was held at the Convention Palace. Castro spoke with the visitors about the health situation in both countries and referred to Cuba's family doctor program and low infant mortality rate. With regards to the latter, the Cuban leader reported Cuba's 1993 infant mortality rate was 9.4 for every 1,000 live births. He said the possibility of going below 10 in a tropical country had always been questioned. In a brief assessment of his visit to the island, which started on 2 January, Londono stated he had found a health system superior to existing systems throughout the rest of the continent. After noting that primary attention in Cuba is not only effective but also efficient, the Colombian health minister emphasized the signing of an agreement with the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Center for the purchase of 2.5 million Hepatitis-B vaccines. Likewise, an agreement was reached with the Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute to draft a support program to control specific public health problems in Colombia.
