"Further negotiations on this issue are required, to determine the procedure of their implementation, not to define or change the agreements reached at the highest level," he said. With reference to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Dubinin pointed out that "it can be resolved, and must be resolved, particularly from the point of view of care for the Fleet's personnel." "The ways to resolve this issue were determined at the highest level, and what remains now is to reach agreement on the order of implementing what was planned," he said. The problems existing in relations between Russia and Ukraine "must not be driven into a corner; they must be resolved fairly, on the path of friendship and cooperation," the diplomat stressed. "Both nations want it," Dubinin said. Russia's Foreign Ministry believes that it is imperative to implement all the agreements reached earlier between Russia and Ukraine, he pointed out.
