[passage omitted] In connection with the Czech Republic's membership in the UN Security Council, Czech radio has asked Ambassador Karel Kovanda, our country's permanent representative to the executive body of the international community, what the Czech position is on the adoption of the sanctions. [Begin Kovanda recording] The possibility of introducing sanctions against North Korea is a very complicated matter. On the one hand, the issue is that some countries do not at all regard sanctions as a good instrument of international politics. North Korea itself has said on several occasions that it would respond to possible sanctions as a declaration of war. One of the countries that never believes in sanctions and never accedes to them is China, which almost always abstains from each resolution regarding sanctions. So far, China has been very much against any indications of sanctions on the part of the UN Security Council. The next development will depend on the behind-the-scene discussions between the Big Five, the five permanenent members. The main role will be played here by the United States and China. The side role, outside the UN Security Council, is being played by Japan and South Korea. I dare say that, in this matter, the Czech Republic will very unanimously support any measures to which the U.S. mission to the UN Security Council decides to resort. [end recording]
