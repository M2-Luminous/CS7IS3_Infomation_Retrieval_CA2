According to the newspaper, which is published in this capital, Foreign Minister Amorim referred indirectly to the U.S. embargo against Cuba at a lunch with Lage on 3 February when he condemned some countries' adoption of unilateral measures, disregarding international law. According to this publication, Amorim kept reiterating such actions undermine both Brazil and Cuba's development. Commenting on this, Amorim said his country rejects the imposition of extraterritorial law (Torricelli Law) on third countries, although he did not specifically mention the Torricelli Law, also known as the law for democracy in Cuba. Amorim discussed his expectations regarding political changes in Cuba, and expressed his support for Cuba's reintegration in the hemisphere. He pointed out that Brazil and Cuba can join forces to overcome their weaknesses, and cited as an example the benefits that should result from a recent bilateral agreement, by which the Brazilian market will obtain Cuban medicines. Amorim said the Federal Government will distribute the medicines to the poorest people of this country for free. Amorim also referred to cooperation with Cuba in sugar, science, and technical areas. Meanwhile, in an interview by a Brazil news agency, Lage emphasized that the U.S. blockade against his country has caused many problems, and he said Latin American rejection of this aggression is important. According to the news agency, Lage told Amorim that Cuba is interested in paying off a $30-million debt with Brazil, making the medicines' agreement possible. The value of the medicine is greater than the debt. Lage noted that the medicines' agreement will also promote Cuban-Brazilian economic relations, and added that Brazilian businessmen are interested in investing in Cuba, especially in tourism, health, agriculture, and biotechnology. According to JORNAL DO BRASILIA and the Brazil news agency, Cuba has placed special emphasis on tourism and oil. The newspaper says Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum], a state oil company, invested in oil exploration in Cuba, but stopped its operations. The publication stresses that the Cuban Government wants Petrobras to resume those activities. According to the sources, Lage believes his visit to Brazil will help achieve an increase in bilateral trade. JORNAL DO BRASILIA says that, according to Lage, in 1992, Cuban cash purchases to Brazil totaled $47 million, and consisted mainly of food, spare parts, chemical products, and so on. On the third day of his visit to Brazil, Lage will lunch with Health Minister Henrique Santillo, then later he will meet with the vice president of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Associations. The itinerary will conclude with a news conference. On Saturday, Lage and his delegation will arrive in Rio de Janeiro for a 48-hour stay. Lage's official visit will conclude on Monday with his departure to Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia.
