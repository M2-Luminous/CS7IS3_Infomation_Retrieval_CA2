FR941116-0-00060 FR941116-0-00011 Pursuant to section 605(b), the Commission certifies that the rules and amendments will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The pipelines subject to this rule are not small entities. X. Information Collection Requirements The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.14 (footnote) require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this final rule are contained in FERC&hyph;6 ``Annual Report of Oil Pipeline Companies'' (1902&hyph;0022) and FERC&hyph;550 ``Oil Pipeline Rates: Tariff Filings'' (1902&hyph;0089). The Commission uses the data collected in these information requirements to carry out its regulatory responsibilities pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), the Act of 1992, and delegations to the Commission from the Secretary of Energy. The Commission's Office of Pipeline Regulation uses the data for the analysis of all rates, fares, or charges demanded, charged, or collected by any pipeline common carrier in connection with the transportation of petroleum and petroleum products and also as a basis for determining just and reasonable rates that should be charged by the regulated pipeline company. The Office of Economic Policy uses the data in its functions relating to the administration of the ICA and the Act of 1992. The Commission's Office of Chief Accountant uses the data collected in Form No. 6 to carry out its compliance audits and for continuous review of the financial conditions of regulated companies. Because of the proposed revisions to both FERC&hyph;550 and Form No. 6, and the expected reduction in public reporting burden of the latter, the Commission is submitting a copy of the final rule to OMB for its review and approval. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), Washington, DC 20503, FAX: (202) 395&hyph;5167.
