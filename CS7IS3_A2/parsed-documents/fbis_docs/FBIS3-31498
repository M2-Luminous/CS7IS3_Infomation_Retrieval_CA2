The committee unanimously supported the nomination. The general, who is also chief-of-staff of the Army, is to replace Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz, who is retiring. The appointment will be signed by the president of the Republic of Hungary, who is the commander-in-chief of the Army. During the 90-minute hearing, Deak stated that the mood among officers is not too good. He said that improving this is not merely a financial issue, but that the social prestige of military careers must also be increased. There is presently a shortage of officers out among the troops, according to Deak. On the other hand, there are 13,000 officers in the army. In his view, this number is overly high and should be readjusted to around 8,000. Deak also said replacements should be ensured not merely from the military colleges, but also from the university of arts and sciences, and the technical university.
