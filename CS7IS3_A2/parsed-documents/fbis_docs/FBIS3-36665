Shumeyko told ITAR-TASS at the airport here that even in dealing with international matters some statesmen had the habit of "looking what the neighbour will do" and waiting for somebody to make the first step. "This is why," the speaker of the Council of the Federation (the upper chamber of the Russian parliament) believes, "the economic union treaty, signed on September 24, 1993, has still not been ratified by CIS parliaments." Shumeyko believes that the main task confronting the current session of the Interparliamentary Assembly is to create a mechanism to settle problems linked with the ratification of inter-state treaties. Shumeyko thinks the leaders of the delegations, attending the current session, are able to reach an agreement on the simutlaneous ratification of the economic union treaty by all the CIS parliaments.
