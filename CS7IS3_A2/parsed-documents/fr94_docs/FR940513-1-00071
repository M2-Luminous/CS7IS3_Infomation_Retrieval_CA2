FR940513-1-00071 FR940513-1-00017 The analysis leading to a decision to regulate emissions from ballasting and steam stripping operations is presented in section D, Selection of MACT Regulatory Approach. 2. Impacts of the Regulatory Alternatives The EPA developed model (i.e., example) vessels and terminals for use in estimating the environmental, cost, and economic impacts associated with the actual terminals represented by the waterborne commerce in the United States (WCUS) data base. The impacts that resulted from this analysis are presented in Tables 1 through 3. The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the regulatory alternatives considered for these regulations. Potential price, output, and employment impacts for affected products and for the marine transport industry and for small businesses were examined. Estimated maximum price increases for any product loaded in bulk varied but were not large under any of the regulatory alternatives. These price increase estimates reflect the control cost increase for both transporting crude and transporting refined products. Because the price increases are small and because the elasticities of demand for petroleum products are small, estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were minimal in all but Regulatory Alternative V. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions were also small (less than 20) in all but Regulatory Alternative V.
