In the first place the income from privatization will not be the $886 million which the executive branch forecast when it prepared the 1994 Budget. Let us say, in a preliminary way, that the income from privatization will be very much larger. To the $1,391 million which the Spanish offered (obtained by subtracting $691 million for the purchase of 15 percent of the new shares of stock from the $2,002 million available) should be added $67 million from the sale of Cementos Yura [Yura Cement Company] and what is expected to be obtained from the sale of CENTROMIN [Central Mining Enterprise]--despite the fact that $60 million will be contracted in additional foreign debt. This amounts to about $300 million in cash. From the sale of INTERBANC [International Bank] and Banco Intercontinental [Intercontinental Bank] it was anticipated that about $200 million would be received ($50 million for INTERBANC and $150 million for Banco Continental). Another source of resources will come from the sale of the Lima Electricity Company, from which another $500 million are expected to be obtained. From the privatization of the Tintaya Mining Company, it is reasonable to expect $50 million; from Cementos Lima [Lima Cement Company], $55 million; from the PARAMONGA Company, another $40 million; from Cementos Pacasmayo [Pacasmayo Cement Company], $30 million; from Pesca Peru [State Fishmeal and Fish Oil Production Agency], $30 million; and from Electro Peru [Peruvian State Electric Power Enterprise], another $300 million. Adding all of this up, we can say that if the flow of cash which began with the sale of CPT--Entel Peru [Peruvian Telephone Company--National Telecommunications Enterprise] should continue, the government may wind up receiving nothing less than $2.5 billion from the company privatization program. The only thing left to do is to make sure that the rest of the Special Privatization Committees (CEPRIS) show the same seriousness, professional integrity, and openness as were displayed by Javier Tovar in the privatization of the Peruvian Telephone Company and Dr. Alberto Pandolfi in the sale of the Yura Cement Company. When the government thought that it would barely obtain $886 million from the privatization program, it also had as its goal tax income barely amounting to 8.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product [GDP]. The present pace of tax collection has grown spectacularly. It now stands at 12.5 percent of GDP. Sandro Fuentes, the superintendent of the Tax Administration, has just collected 1,971 million nuevos soles in January and February 1994, setting an astonishing record. At this level of tax collection the government will have an additional 4.0 percent of GDP in tax income which it did not anticipate when it prepared the budget. These four percentage points of growth in tax revenue amount to no less than $1,640 million in additional funds for budgetary expenditures. What good luck! You do not have to be a wizard to bet that government officials are going around with big smiles on their faces. The $2.5 billion obtained from the privatization program (compared to the $886 million anticipated from it), plus the $1.6 billion from additional tax collections, are a welcome surprise for anyone. According to the 1994 Budget Law, budgeted expenditures amount to $5.9 billion. At the present rate of tax collection about $5.0 billion could easily be collected in 1994, as a result of which the government will soon have a budget surplus of 7.0 percent of GDP (about $2.8 billion). Calculating the result is easy if you add to the $5.0 billion in tax collections the $900 million obtained from foreign loans, the $300 million from the issuance of domestic bonds, and the $2.5 billion in income from the privatization program. This amounts to $8.8 billion in income, against expenditures in the order of $5.9 billion, as provided in the budget law. The $2.9 billion surplus will be a great temptation for President Alberto Fujimori. Perhaps that is why the IMF visiting mission has urged that the income from the privatization program ($2.5 billion) should go into an account which cannot be touched. The election coffer which President Fujimori had before the resources obtained from the sale of the telephone company to Spanish interests appeared on the scene was not insignificant. The government had and still has $650 million budgeted for investment expenditures in 1994. With these resources the construction of the Pasto-Grande, Chavimochic, and the Olmos and Tinajones projects, etc., will be continued. To these investment expenditures the government is adding the $154 million which Manuel Estela Benavides has available under the FONCODES [National Compensation and Social Development Fund] for programs to relieve poverty. As if all of the foregoing did not amount to much, we published in issue No. 364 of SI a confidential document from the Ministry of the Presidency, in which it is proved that Raul Vittor Alfaro, the new cabinet minister, will have $456 million to spend in 1994 from resources obtained from FONAVI [National Housing Fund]. (Some $156 million of this total were carried over in the accounts from 1993 and almost $300 million will be provided by FONAVI in 1994.) The arbitrary way in which the government spends the resources of FONAVI is an open secret. As an example of the height of irresponsibility no reliable system has even been set up to recover these resources. Out of the hundreds of millions of dollars which have been misappropriated only a handful of dollars has been recovered. Each time that the president makes a trip to some outlying area of the country he offers running water and drainage systems, or the construction of a college, with resources obtained from FONAVI--as if this money was part of the budget. Another important resource which the president's reelection campaign will have is the $500 million in International Technical Cooperation which will come into the country in 1994, as Eduardo Ishi Ito, the deputy minister of international cooperation, stated on 17 January to EL PERUANO, the official daily newspaper. Finally, how these $500 million dollars--which other countries extended to us as a gift--will be divided up remains a great mystery. On repeated occasions SI has tried unsuccessfully to obtain this information from the highest reaches of the government. The silence has been that of the tomb. Finally, Ishi Ito has drawn aside the veil over the astonishing size of these resources: $500 million. Having so much money available is quite a temptation. There are the $2.5 billion from the privatization program and $1,640 million from additional tax collections. These funds will be a powerful kind of fuel for the reelection campaign which is approaching. If you add to this additional income the $650 million in investment expenditures under the budget, the $154 million from FONCODES, the $456 million from FONAVI, and the $500 million in International Technical Cooperation funds, the campaign chest will burst from its present state of being full. In short, even before the bid for the purchase of Telefonica Peru [Peruvian Telephone Company] is opened, the government already has a powerful election campaign chest of $1,760 million. To this figure should be added the $1,614 million in increased income from the privatization program and the steady increase in tax collections, expected to amount to $1,640 million in 1994. These $5,014 million should not be spent or given away on public works which do not support development over the medium term. On the other hand it is not easy to spend so much money. The daily pace of expenditures should be in the order of $13 million. Neither the government nor the country as a whole presently has design and construction teams and projects on hand to use up this money. This is not a small matter. It would amount to more than $218 in expenditures for every Peruvian, the result of dividing more than $5,014 million among the 23 million people living in this country. The election coffer which President Fujimori has is the largest which any presidential candidate has had in the history of Latin America. If Fujimori loses his reelection bid, it will not be the result of a lack of money but simply because so much money killed him with indigestion.
