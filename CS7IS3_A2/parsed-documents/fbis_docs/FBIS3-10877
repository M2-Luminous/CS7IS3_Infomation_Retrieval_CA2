This is a demonstration of the armed institution's efforts to improve civilian-military relations. General Ernesto Corado Figueroa, former defense minister, said at the close of the event: "For the first time in El Salvador's history an education course with civilians has been established to analyze aspects of security, defense, and development that will have an important impact within society." Corado added: "This demonstrates that the Armed Forces can work together with the people for the nation's well-being, despite the ideological and partisan differences." The general explained that this course is part of the education efforts and restructuring that are taking place in the armed institution in times of peace. For Corado, civilian-military relations were significantly marred during the 12-year armed conflict. After the signing of the peace agreement, however, the need to improve relations was acknowledged. In this regard, the changes made by the armed institution have allowed the promotion of participation -- under equal opportunities -- of civilian and military personnel in projects of national interest linked to the nation's development and have lead to strengthening harmonious coexistence, the general noted. Alfredo Cristiani, president of the Republic and Armed Forces general commander, was present at the graduation ceremony. Cristiani highlighted the Defense Ministry's effort by providing a course that sets an example for the overall handling of national leadership. "The new reality prevailing in the nation demands top level preparation in all fields; the Armed Forces are contributing to the consolidation of peace," Cristiani said. Likewise, the School of Strategic High-Level Studies yesterday inaugurated the second running which will include 36 students who represent the government, the Armed Forces, the private sector, universities, political parties, and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. Ferman Cienfuegos, FMLN member said: This course has a historical transcendency because for the first time after the war, civilian and soldier are united; this will contribute to constructing a national consensus. Cienfuegos indicated that the armed institution is changing because it no longer is manipulated by the political parties. This is a very important precedent because the Armed Forces are state institutions currently at the service of the people. The first running of Strategic High-Level Studies initiated in September 1993 falls within the framework of the new Armed Forces Education System, according to the constitutional reform passed in April 1992.
