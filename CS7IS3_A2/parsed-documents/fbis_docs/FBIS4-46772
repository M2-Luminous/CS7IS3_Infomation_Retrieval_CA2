The president of this well-known scientific research organization and leader of the authors' collective Aleksey Podberezkin answers the questions of our correspondent Olga Sapozhnikova. [Sapozhnikova] What basic factor influenced the publication of your book at such a complicated time? [Podberezkin] In Russia today all the problems are closely intertwined: There cannot be economics without spirituality, there cannot be military security without ecological security and so on. The contemporary Russian idea with an answer to these questions should find its expression in the formulation of a national doctrine. (The Russian idea is more than a geographical concept--it reflects the interests of all citizens living on the territory of contemporary Russia and within the boundaries of the former USSR.) Our work is an attempt to bring together and to show in its interdependence a strategic conception of the development of our state at the current time. [Sapozhnikova] The "Russian idea" is a claim to a definite ideology. In the title of the book there are the words "National Doctrine." One recalls immediately the lexicon of American presidents. What is the genre of your book? [Podberezkin] If one proceeds from the fact that a doctrine is an aggregate of officially adopted views toward common national goals and the ways to achieve them, then, of course, it is not an official document because it was prepared by non-official structures. It is more a practical attempt to inspire the process of forming a national doctrine. [Sapozhnikova] What can representatives of the political establishment find in a book entitled "The National Doctrine of Russia?" [Podberezkin] In our book the key feature is the development of the factor of spirituality as a condition for resolving all the remaining problems. To establish the priority of the problems, having determined them and analyzed their situation today, and to give some hardly inarguable variants for resolving them--that is our task. [Sapozhnikova] Society in our country today is seriously splintered. How can your book influence this situation? [Podberezkin] One of the most important tasks of our work is to show realistically this problem of society's splintering and possible prospects for overcoming it. The nation faces a choice: either we will develop according to the Georgian scenario, where the sides cannot come to an agreement and sooner or later a violent confrontation will begin, which acquires its own internal logic and in the end everyone forgets who fired first; or we will not have civil war. It is necessary to do everything so that the first variant does not develop. This requires serious efforts on all sides. Here the main difficulty is how and to what degree to arrive at a compromise. [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine begins with the fact that a nation forms for itself an ideal of development. You call spirituality such an ideal. But we are also split over the question of spirituality. There are forces who consider that Russia is an uncivilized country and that it is necessary for us to be integrated into "world civilization." And there are those who are activiely seeking the ideal of spirituality in the 15th-16th centuries. As long as society will not achieve agreement regarding an ideal of development, the remaining problems will bear a secondary character. [Podberezkin] Problem number 1 is the achievement of an agreed-upon spiritual ideal. We are Eurasian. From a geopolitical point of view we are located in the center of a continent, unique in its historical, geographical and cultural features, and we should work out our own model of development, our own world view. In it the primary role belongs to the spiritual factor, which is coompletely unrecognized by the supporters of the Western model of development. Our mentality wull be formed on the basis of our historical and cultural traditions... [Sapozhnikova] The "new Russians" don't think so. [Podberezkin] A large part, but not all of the "new Russians" support the comprador model of development. These people take for themselves the values, lets say, of Austria or Holland. If it works out for one of them to become Austrian or Dutch, which, frankly speaking, I doubt, then good; if it doesn't work out, which I am to a greater degree convinced of, that person, whether there or here will be a foreign body. The spiritual and ieological factors form the basis of the development of our state both in the future, and in economics. If we use both of them, we will come to the unavoidable conclusion that we can solve economic and social problems. But now these factors are simply not taken into account. Financial culture, education, science, the current tax system--these are the destruction of the nation's spirituality, the destruction of the factor which can lead society out of the crisis. [Sapozhnikova] A national doctrine is an all-society agreement. It presupposes the presence of a conscious group of interests. We have still not formulated them, the social structure of our society is changing: there are the "new Russians," the criminal associations...How to move society toward a realization of its common interests? [Podberezkin] An original conclusion from this situation was proposed in our work. If we view the political party spectrum according to its interests, we see that agreement is practically impossible. The interests of these strata are varied and it is very difficult to find a social-political basis on which to unite them. If we try to look at society according to a different spectrum, dividing it into a system of priorities of all-national interests, having removed the party factor of personality and ambition, society will be divided into two camps. The first are the state patriots, seeing their Russia as a strong great power with a developed economic structure, intellectually and economically independent. Therefore in this camp there will be some supporters of the president, of parliament, and followers of your newspaper. In the second camp are the compradors. What Russia will be is all the same to them. [Sapozhnikova] How did the work on preparing "The National Doctrine of Russia" proceed? [Podberezkin] The first version of the work, presented as a document on the strategy of national security was conceived and completed in two weeks. After the book was printed and we began to get reactions it became clear that the work was not finished. In the course of a month we produced its expanded version. Nearly 300 people, leading specialists in their areas, to a greater or lesser degree participated in preparing the final text (the creative collective directly). These experts are well known and recognized not because they have big titles or because they often appear on television, but first of all they are respected in their professional field. Among the authors is Nikita Nikolayevich Moiseyev, a star of the first magnitude, and other well known names. [Sapozhnikova] Did "Group Most" finance the work? [Podberezkin] Not completely. The work was done on an equal footing, since our corporation took upon itself a large part of the financing. "Group Most" paid for printing. Without financial support we would not have been able to publish the book--there was not enough money.
