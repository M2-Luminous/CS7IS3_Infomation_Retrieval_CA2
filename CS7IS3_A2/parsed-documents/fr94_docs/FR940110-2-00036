SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE) has received an application by Tucson Electric Power Company (TEP) to rescind the Prohibition Order issued on July 15, 1981 (46 FR 37960, July 23, 1981), pursuant to the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) 42 U.S.C. 8301 et seq. The order prohibited the burning of oil or natural gas in TEP's Irvington Generating Station Units 1, 2 and 3, located near Tucson, Arizona. Pursuant to 10 CFR 501.102(b), TEP filed its application based on a substantial change in the circumstances upon which the Prohibition Order was originally issued. TEP claims this change in circumstances to be beyond its control. TEP cites the sharp reduction in economic benefits to be realized from the conversion to coal and the potentially costly environmental disincentives to using coal, combined with TEP's financial situation, as the impetus for the requested relief. TEP requests rescission to permit the company to continue to use oil or natural gas above the percentage limits specified in the prohibition order. Procedural Matters Any party or person desiring to be heard or to protect this application for rescission should file five copies of any comments, petitions to intervene, or protests at the address provided above. Any request for a public hearing must be made within the public comment period. In making its decision regarding the requested rescission action, DOE will consider all relevant information submitted or otherwise available to it. The public file containing a copy of the application and other documents and supporting materials on this proceeding is available, upon request, at the address above. Issued in Washington, DC, on January 5, 1994. Anthony J. Como, Director, Office of Coal & Electricity, Office of Fuels Programs, Office of Fossil Energy.
