The principle calls for no remunerations for workers when they do not work during the period of labor disputes. Minister Nam said another principle his ministry will uphold will be the policy that "essential matters related to rights to personnel and management cannot be subject to labor disputes." In an exclusive interview with the YONHAP news agency, Nam said his ministry will abide by these principles if only to dispel confusion in labor-management negotiations this year. "No work, no wage" policy is a general principle that has been broadly recognized around the world, he said. As for disputes over personnel and management rights, the labor minister said that though the labor rights are guaranteed under the Constitution, they cannot infringe on the essential elements of other basic rights. "Since the right to management is based on the right to properties guaranteed under the basic law, labor disputes aimed at interfering in management cannot be justified," Nam said. He added, however, that in case matters falling under the realm of personnel or management rights have a serious effect directly on working conditions or the standing of workers, disputes could be justified only to such an extent.
