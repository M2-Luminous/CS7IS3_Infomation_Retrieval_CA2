The demonstrators said they would take over the city hall building tomorrow unless they receive their May salaries. Meanwhile, the tense situation continues in Salta and Santiago del Estero. In Catamarca, municipal workers protested outside government house, city hall, and the legislature. They lit fires with the garbage that has accumulated in the streets as a consequence of the indefinite garbage workers strike that started on 14 June. [passage omitted] The fires made aerosol cans explode. The fire damaged the government house main door before firefighters arrived. Police and border police agents confronted the demonstrators to prevent serious incidents. [passage omitted] A large percentage of public workers continued their "work to rule" today, a measure they will continue until they receive their May salaries. The protest has virtually paralyzed the provincial public administration. It includes assemblies and rallies in work areas to demand their back salaries. [passage omitted] In Salta, public workers went on strike and mobilized in front of the provincial legislature demanding a basic salary of 500 pesos. Miguel Quiroga, ATE-Salta [Association of State Workers-Salta] social action secretary, said the protest "seeks the payment of salaries on time because health workers and pensioners did not receive their salaries yet." In Santiago del Estero, the State Unions Front organized a rally for tonight. The rally follows a strike involving teachers and judicial branch workers that is being widely observed. The strike was to protest the transfer of the pensions fund to the nation, to demand an emergency salary increase, and against the policy of privatizations announced by Federal Trustee Juan Scharetti.
