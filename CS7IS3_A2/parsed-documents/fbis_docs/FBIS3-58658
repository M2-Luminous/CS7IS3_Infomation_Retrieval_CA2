In the opinion of the political decisionmakers--members of the Eduskunta and ministers--Finland should follow a foreign policy line of cautious neutrality, one that adheres to nonalignment. Politically, supporters of this approach are found in the left and in the center. In the opinion of high-ranking officials responsible for foreign policy and international relations in the ministries, Finland should try to align itself. Two Schools According to the hopes of the officials, Finland should move closer to the European Union (EU) and the NATO defense alliance. The managers of the big export companies are in sympathy with the officials' views. The difference in point of view comes out in an opinion poll commissioned by the Foreign Policy Institute, which was published on Wednesday [15 December]. Dr. Weijo Pitkanen, an institute researcher and political scientist, conducted the poll. The Finnish and Russian Peoples' Friendship Society funded the poll. Pitkanen refers to the first-mentioned school as the "neutrality school" and the second one as the "alignment school." Conducted by the Finnish Gallup Company, 214 influential people responded to the poll. The questions were sent to representatives of the church, the political parties, the big export companies, the Armed Forces, and the news media, in addition to the politicians and government officials. The president of the Republic did not participate in the poll. Pitkanen described the respondents as "Finland's foreign policy elite." All of the respondents either directly or indirectly influence the making of foreign policy decisions. Officials Changed Views Pitkanen saw in the results of the poll a noticeable change to the old way of handling foreign policy in the days of the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line. Specifically, in past years officials saw to it that Finland adhered closely to a policy of neutrality, while politicians were willing to be flexible, as necessary. The Armed Forces and the church are trying to walk a tightrope between the two schools of thought. The Armed Forces support EU membership, but, as supporters of an independent defense, the military entertain doubts about NATO membership. The news media's position is inconsistent. According to the poll, the media are hesitant about EU membership, but there is support for NATO membership among them. A certain indecisiveness is reflected in the results of the poll. The "secure," bipolar system has disintegrated, and a new system of cooperation that gives the impression that it will endure has not yet been found. The respondents are pleased with the disappearance of the old system. In agreement with the official line, nine out of 10 respondents declared that the bases for Finland's foreign and security policies are an independent defense and action within the framework of the CSCE. They expressed the hope that the CSCE would be developed into a new, pan-European security system, but they do not have very great faith that it will. Only a fifth of the respondents felt that the CSCE is an effective guarantor of the stable evolution of Europe. They had even less faith in the United Nations. Confidence in EU and NATO On the other hand, they had great confidence in the EU and the NATO defense alliance. Three out of four respondents felt that NATO is an effective guarantor of the stable evolution of Europe, and two out of three respondents felt that the EU is. Eight out of 10 respondents felt that membership in the EU is desirable. They took a more cautious view of membership in NATO: The percentages of those in favor of membership in it and those opposed to it were even. Membership in the EU was felt to be especially desirable by 42 percent, while only 14 percent felt that way about membership in NATO. Russia Feared Their attitudes toward Russia were also split. On the one hand, they hoped that Russia would participate in European cooperation and, on the other, they expressed suspicion and fear of it. Russia was not viewed as a military threat, but primarily a civil threat. They felt that Russia's environmental problems, the increase in professional crime, its economic difficulties, and the rise in big brother nationalism are the biggest threats. Two out of three respondents thought that "the threat posed to Finland by the situation in Russia is growing." The poll was conducted in the fall, in part before Rutskoy's and Khasbulatov's attempted coup, but clearly before the Russian elections. The respondents were asked for their opinion as to how Finland should prepare for the Russian threat. The influential respondents' indecisiveness shines through their responses: Over half of them reject the view that Finland should apply for membership in NATO because of Russia and over half of them are also in favor of traditional neutrality. Karelia Not Wanted The return of Karelia did not receive very much support in the poll. Only a small percentage of the respondents stated that they support the submission of an official proposal to Russia that negotiations on the return of Karelia be initiated. Some sympathy for negotiations on Karelia is to be found in the church and the Armed Forces. The influential respondents' optimism was also assessed in the poll. In Weijo Pitkanen's opinion, most of the respondents are pessimistic [about the future]. Only the members of the Eduskunta and the ministers were categorized by Pitkanen as being "optimistic."
