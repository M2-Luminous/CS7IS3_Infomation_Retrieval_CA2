Manelis under the ``Signal Processing'' rubric; received after rework Nov.11,1991; UDC 621.391.82:621.396.62] [Abstract] The objective of the work was to study the effect of an error of estimating parameters of narrow-band Gaussian noise on the effectiveness of a detection algorithm and to derive design formulas for detection characteristics for a case of quasi-optimum processing. Results of calculations using the derived formulas are presented. The detection algorithm is extremely sensitive to the accuracy of estimates of spectral parameters of the noise. The derived results make it possible to formulate valid specifications for a noise situation meter in order to ensure the required efficiency of detection. Figures 1, references 4.
