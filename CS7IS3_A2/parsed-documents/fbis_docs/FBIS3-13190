In the same connection, Mr. Morteza Sarmadi, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, yesterday strongly denied the charge, and he expressed regret that the president of a country has asserted such baseless and unfounded comments merely on the strength of fabricated and distorted information against the Islamic Republic of Iran. Comments of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak against Iran have appeared in his recent interview carried by the Kuwaiti-based daily of AL-QABAS. These say that the Islamic Republic of Iran, by paying $13,000 to an Egyptian terrorist, has allegedly tried to kill the Egyptian prime minister. In the opinion of political observers, baseless charges leveled by Egypt against the Islamic Republic of Iran are not viewed as new development. It is not for the first time that political and propaganda circles have sought, by making use of such a tactic and without presenting any acceptable reason and evidence, to distort Iran's political image in the region. In fact, this attempt by leaders of the Egyptian regime, aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust against Iran in the region in political terms, is a move which can supplement the U.S. policies in the area. This is the point that the Egyptian president and the politicians of that country have often clearly stressed during their meetings with the U.S. officials. The regional media affiliated to the West too have added fuel to the fire and have tried to project in the region an image of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which because of its opposition to the so-called Middle East peace plan is interfering in the internal affairs of the regional countries, including Egypt, and in certain instances, as the Egyptian president has said it, has even attempted to assassinate the prime minister of that country. This is a fact that the Cairo leaders are fully aware of the weak points and the vulnerable foundation of the ruling system in Egypt; and the world people, who are daily witnessing the suppression of the opponents of the Egyptian regime by the state elements, are quite sensible to think about what is going on in that country. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the motive of the Egyptian regime in deviating the public opinion and linking the country's critical situation to beyond the Egyptian borders. This should, however, be reminded [as heard] that the Islamic Republic of Iran considers it very essential to counter this propaganda firmly, since it is considered as a kind of political assassination committed against a country on the international and regional scene. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran will never allow the use of various tactics for destroying the climate of confidence towards the Islamic Republic of Iran in the region and not allow the use of these tactics as a tool to further the common design of the Egyptian regime and the U.S. in the region.
