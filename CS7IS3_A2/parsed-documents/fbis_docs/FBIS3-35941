According to him, "both sides are concerned at this problem and are working to bring North Korea, which has frozen its participation in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, back to it again". At the same time, said Bely, "there are nuances in the two countries' positions on this problem". In particular, the Chinese side is strongly opposed to any sanctions in relation to North Korea, while Russia, which does not advocate any sanctions and considers them a forced measure, believes that the question should be tackled by the whole world community.
