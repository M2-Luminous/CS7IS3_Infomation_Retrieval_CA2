It is already known with certainty that the DEA has been and continues to be a decisive factor in these actions. This much is known precisely because of the apologies presented by the U.S. Embassy to the Costa Rican Government, and through a DEA communique explaining the appearance and later disappearance, in Costa Rica, of Bolivian citizen Edgar Fernandez Lazcano. Nothing of the kind has occurred in La Paz, until today, despite the fact that our country was directly affected by those U.S. actions, which have hurt our national dignity. The explanations offered here by the ministers of government and social communication regarding the Fernandez case are not convincing. We do not understand why our government does nothing effective to bring him back to the country, particularly as he is considered a key element in the Chamber of Deputies Justice Commission hearing, and given the fact that he himself has stated his willingness to testify before the commission following a previous detention by the FELCN. His extradition seems to be impossible due to a lack of charges against him. However, it should not be impossible for Bolivian authorities to ask the DEA -- which currently holds him detained, or protects him, and which is also suspected of helping him get out of the country, enter Costa Rica, and later leave it, presumably for Miami -- to bring him back to the country. But independent of what the Bolivian Government does or does not, it is the U.S. Government which has the obligation, or at least the moral duty, to explain its participation in these affairs.
