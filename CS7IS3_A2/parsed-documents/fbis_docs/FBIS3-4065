[Jing] Starting 1 January this year, full-scale reform was introduced in the industrial and commercial tax system of our country. Could you please give us an idea how the new tax system has been working? [Jin] Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the operation of the new taxation system has been basically smooth and normal. This mainly finds expression in the following phenomena: First, commodity prices, which people are most concerned about, did not fluctuate wildly because of tax system reform. Second, tax revenue has maintained a steady growth. Third, the printing, distribution, issuing, and use of invoices used exclusively for value-added tax [VAT] did not have much problem. Fourth, on the whole, the new tax system did not impact production and circulation negatively. Fifth, in the implementation of the new tax system, the party and government departments at all levels, the broad spectrum of enterprises, and the general public have been supportive and the comments it has received from various quarters are generally positive. Naturally, we have come across some problems during the implementation of the new tax system. Some problems in such major reform are inevitable, and we will encounter new problems in the future. Among these problems, some are related to policies, and others to operation. We have taken steps to solve some of them in good time, while vigorous efforts are being made to solve some others and the rest are yet to be solved after further investigation and study. In a word, we should work hard to implement the new tax system, constantly sum up our experience, keep improving it, and give full play to the role of taxation in pooling revenue and strengthening macroregulation and control so as to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid development of the national economy. [Jing] Introducing the value-added tax on a full scale is an important aspect of this tax reform. But many people are still not very familiar with VAT. Could you please tell us something about VAT? [Jin] VAT is a type of circulating tax levied on commodity production and circulation, and labor service. "Value added" is the incremented value created by the taxpayer through his productive or business operation or the added value of commodities. It can also be defined as the amount of the taxpayer's revenue through the sale of commodities or provision of labor service within a given period of time in excess of the amount paid in purchasing commodities or labor service. The VAT regime changed the practice of the traditional circulating tax regime whereby taxes were levied on all sales income at each transaction link, so that duplicate taxation could be avoided. Also, it is characterized by an extensive scope of taxation; timeliness, balance, and stability in tax collection; and fairness of distribution. It is not only conducive to the pooling of revenue, but also helps encourage enterprises to follow the principle of economic efficiency and choose the optimum organizational form for production and business operation. It also facilitates total tax reimbursement for export commodities in keeping with international practice, so as to make our products more competitive on the international market. That is why we say this is a scientific and rational tax category. [Jing] Could you please explain the scope of collection and the range of taxpayers in connection with VAT? What are the tax rates? [Jin] VAT is applicable to all produced, wholesaled, retailed, and imported commodities, as well as labor service in processing, repair, and servicing. All industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as other units and individuals, that sell taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service are payers of VAT. The VAT rates come in three grades: 1. The basic VAT rate is 17 percent, applicable to the great majority of general commodities and taxable labor service. 2. The low VAT rate is 13 percent, applicable to daily necessities and agricultural means of production, such as grains, edible vegetable oils, tap water, gas, central heating, books, newspapers, chemical fertilizers, and farm pesticides. 3. A zero rate is applicable to export commodities, which means VAT paid will be fully reimbursed after the commodities have exited. [Jing] Could you tell us what is meant by taxes not included in the calculated prices? Some enterprises have put a 17 percent VAT on the original prices of their commodities. Is this the right practice? [Jin] An important aspect of the reform introducing VAT is that the previous practice of including tax in the calculated prices has been switched to that of not including tax in the calculated prices. In the process of commodity sale in all the stages before the retail stage, the receipt should specify the price without VAT and the amount of VAT charged. According to a survey, when the old practice of including tax in calculated prices was in effect, the proportion of tax in each 100- yuan price averaged 14.5 percent. After the practice of not including tax in the calculated prices was introduced, the tax portion should be deducted from the taxable value, and therefore the price would be 85.5 yuan, representing a smaller tax base. But according to the guideline for the reform which requires maintaining the original tax burden on the whole, the state must collect 14.5 yuan in tax on the basis of the commodity price of 85.5 yuan. Therefore, the original 14.5 percent tax rate should be converted to a rate not included in the calculated prices, i.e., 14.5 divided by 85.5 equals 17 percent. This way, when a commodity is sold, the specialized VAT invoice should contain two separate entries, namely, the net price of 85.5 yuan and the tax of 85.5 x 17 percent = 14.5 yuan. The total price payable by the buyer remains 100 yuan (85.5 yuan + 14.5 yuan = 100 yuan). Therefore, the separate calculation of VAT does not cause price hikes and it is wrong of some enterprises to add a 17 percent VAT to the original commodity price, which should be redressed immediately. The State General Administration of Taxation [SGAT] has demanded that taxation authorities at all levels cooperate with local price control departments in checking and penalizing this practice. We also hope that all enterprises will conscientiously abide by the state tax law and that all circles in society will support our work. [Jing] How is payable VAT calculated? Is the 17 percent VAT levied on every link of commodity production and circulation? Will it cause an overall increase in commodity prices? [Jin] Let me explain and analyze this topic in detail. First, let us find out how the payable amount of VAT is calculated. Just now we said that VAT is levied on the added value arising from the sale of commodities and provision of labor service. But, in economic activity, the added value is hard to calculate precisely so as to provide a basis for tax calculation. Therefore, the method of indirect calculation is commonly used for this purpose, i.e., the sales volume of a commodity is first used as a basis for tax calculation, on which the applicable tax rate is used and the VAT is levied on the buyer. This amount of tax is called sales tax. The balance of the commodity seller's sales tax minus the VAT he already paid when procuring the commodity (known as the procurement tax) is the actual VAT payable by this commodity seller. Next, I will take garment production and the subsequent business transactions as an example of how the payable amount of VAT is calculated. Given that a textile mill sells 2 million yuan's worth of cotton fabric to a garment factory and the sales tax is 2 million yuan x 17 percent = 340,000 yuan, and that the deductible procurement tax already paid is 100,000 yuan, the VAT payable by this textile mill will be: 340,000 yuan - 100,000 yuan = 240,000 yuan. The garment factory sells to a wholesale enterprise the garments manufactured from the cotton fabric purchased from the textile mill at a price of 4 million yuan. The sales tax is: 4 million yuan x 17 percent = 680,000 yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 340,000 yuan. The VAT payable by the garment factory will be: 680,000 yuan - 340,000 yuan = 340,000 yuan. The wholesale enterprise distributes the garments purchased from the garment factory to a retail shop at the price of 5 million yuan. Its sales tax is: 5 million yuan x 17 percent = 850,000 yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 680,000 yuan. The VAT payable by the wholesale enterprise will be 850,000 yuan - 680,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan. The retail shop sells the garments purchased from the wholesale enterprise to consumers at the price of 6 million yuan. Its sales tax is: 6 million yuan x 17 percent = 1.02 million yuan. The deductible procurement tax paid is 850,000 yuan. The VAT payable by this retail shop will be 1.02 million yuan - 850,000 yuan = 170,000 yuan. According to the existing price regime in our country, retail prices contain taxes and are the sum of net prices plus sales taxes. In other words, the price at which the retail shop sells the garments to the consumers is: 6 million yuan + 1.02 million yuan = 7.02 million yuan. Though sales tax is calculated according to the sales price and the 17-percent tax rate for each taxpayer, because deduction of the VAT paid at the previous transaction point is allowed at each transaction point, the taxpayer only has to pay the balance of the sales tax minus the procurement tax paid, and the tax bearing ratio is less than 17 percent. The final tax burden is entirely borne by the consumer, the tax bearing ratio being 17 percent. That is why the actual VAT will not cause duplicate taxation, nor will it increase the burden on the taxpayer, still less cause overall price hikes. [Jing] What are the VAT-related regulations on small taxpayers? [Jin] Considering the specific circumstances of some small enterprises and private business operators, in order to strengthen the management over tax collection and ensure fiscal revenue, we have adopted a simple method of taxation for small taxpayers whose annual sales income is below the standard level and whose accounting calculation mechanism is not adequately developed. By this method, we collect VAT according to their sales income and a 6 percent tax rate. Small taxpayers mainly refers to taxpayers who produce taxable commodities or provide taxable labor service and whose annual sales volume is under 1 million yuan and taxpayers who are engaged in the wholesale or retail of taxable commodities and whose annual sales volume is under 1.8 million yuan. If a small taxpayer has an adequately developed accounting calculation system and is able to accurately calculate payable taxes according to the accounting regulations and the requirements of the tax authorities, it may, at the discretion of competent local tax authorities, pay taxes in the capacity of ordinary taxpayers. Some time ago, some small taxpayers complained that, because they could not use specialized VAT invoices like ordinary taxpayers, their production and business operations were negatively impacted. In this regard, we have taken some steps and alleviated this problem. For instance, the tax authorities in various localities stepped up the classification of taxpayers and upgraded to the level of ordinary taxpayers some small taxpayers who basically met the requirements of ordinary taxpayers. The SGAT specially issued a circular stating that, at the discretion of the authorities, the taxation office may issue specialized invoices for the goods sold or taxable labor service provided by small taxpayers who have been conscientious in performing their obligations as taxpayers. Here, I would like to stress that we hope all enterprises will develop their accounting system, strengthen financial management, and pay taxes according to law. This is very necessary for ensuring the revenue of the country, improving the management of enterprise operation, and raising economic efficiency. [Jing] You just mentioned specialized VAT invoices. What are the state regulations in this regard? [Jin] Specialized VAT invoices are not only an important type of commercial instrument used in the taxpayers' economic activities, but are also legal proofs recording the tax obligations of the selling party and the procurement tax of the purchasing party. They play an extremely important role in the calculation and management of VAT. For this reason, the SGAT specially formulated and promulgated "Regulations on the Use of Specialized VAT Invoices." Taxation organs at all levels must attach great importance to the use and management of VAT invoices and should take the initiative in obtaining the support of the party and government leaderships at all levels, as well as the support and cooperation from all relevant departments, such as financial departments, banks, auditing departments, industrial and commercial administration, public security, courts, and procuratorates, in strictly controlling the printing and use of special invoices. Those who use them in violation of regulations must be immediately stopped and given an appropriate penalty. Those who dare to defy the law and forge special invoices to evade state taxes and undermine the economic order must be sternly punished according to law. In the meantime, we hope all VAT payers will use the specialized invoices in strict accordance with the stipulations of the tax authorities. This is not only to protect the state tax revenue and economic order, but also to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers. [Jing] Director Jin, as far as we know, there are still some people who are not very clear about the consumption tax. They think that it is a new levy on all consumer goods that will cause overall price hikes. Could you please explain the consumption tax a bit? [Jin] Yes. Consumption tax is a tax levied on specific consumer goods. This is a new tax introduced following reform in the industrial and commercial taxation system. But in essence, consumption tax is derived from the product tax and VAT in the original tax system. It is a product of the replacement of the old system with the new, not an extra tax levied on consumers. The prices of commodities under the consumption tax used to contain product tax and VAT (e.g., the product tax rate for Grade A cigarettes being 52 percent). Now, after the introduction of the uniform 17 percent VAT rate, the tax burden on such commodities has been reduced. Compensating such reduction by way of collecting consumption tax is to ensure fiscal revenue on the one hand and, on the other, adjust the consumption structure and guiding consumption orientation. This does not increase the overall burden of taxable commodities. In other words, the consumer goods subject to consumption tax are, on the whole, maintaining their previous levels of tax burden. Besides, a consumption tax is not levied on all consumer goods; it is applicable only to a small number of consumer goods designated by the state. Therefore, introducing a consumption tax will not, and should not, cause price increases. Toward the end of last year, rumor had it that the state would start levying consumption tax on home appliances and therefore the prices of commodities in this category would be significantly increased, thus starting a small wave of panic purchasing. This was a sheer misunderstanding. In fact, commodities under the consumption tax do not include home appliances.
