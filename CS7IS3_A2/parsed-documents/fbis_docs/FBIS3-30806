On 29 January 1994, a group of his colleagues were forced by gangsters to leave the Kalotina checkpoint at the Serbian border and were followed to their hotel in Sofia. [Krusteva] Mr. Stanislavski, how many times did you discover embargo breaches? [Stanislavski] We just had a case in Vidin where a cargo ship presumably tried to transport 5,000 tonnes of fuel deliveries to Serbia. The vessel had arrived downstream during the night with its lights out, without establishing any radio contact with the shore authorities, and it was caught thanks to the cooperation between the Bulgarian customs officials and members of the Sanctions Assistance Mission and of the WEU Control Group. [Krusteva] How did it happen? [Stanislavski] A customs official who had the evening off and was staying at home looked out of his window and heard the vessel approaching. He informed his colleague who was on duty at the customs office. The ship was followed with a fast motorboat, but did not stop until the joint crew showed its weapons. The vessel's crew, which was presumably sailing under a Czech flag, declared that it had never heard about an embargo. The same cargo ship, however, was involved in a similar case, in 1993, when its attempt to bust the embargo was prevented by the UN mission and Bulgarian customs officials. In another case, which occurred in December 1993, the Bulgarian river fleet tried to sell seven cargo ships, three barges, and three passenger ships to Serbia. [Krusteva] Similar violations presumably occur also on the border with Serbia? [Stanislavski] In December 1993, I witnessed how the Bulgarian customs officials lost control of their territory in Kalotina, because of criminals who were in control of the situation. The majority of customs officials are afraid of being killed and hence, they are not in a position to cope normally with their tasks. It was just before Christmas 1993 that the police organized an operation in the border area and seemed to have solved the problem for the time being. The current situation is peaceful, but one never knows how long this is going to last, because the criminals who were arrested during the operation were released within seven days. [Krusteva] Are you concerned about the 29 January 1994 incident, and what are the problems, generally speaking, that you are confronted with in this country? [Stanislavski] Sometimes we have difficulties in communicating and establishing contact with customs officials. We are also confronted with security problems that have nothing in common with the economic situation. The greatest problems are emerging at the small border checkpoints where people are waiting in line. Minor breaches of the embargo are always likely to occur. I am talking about violations that the customs officials are deliberately overlooking. We call them the "illegal traffic of the ants." We could prevent them, but our task is to cope with large-scale illegal traffic, which involves smuggling several tonnes of goods. [Krusteva] What are you supposed to do when you discover an act of busting the embargo? [Stanislavski] We are only assistants, which means that as soon as we discover a breach we are obliged to inform the Bulgarian authorities, namely the customs officials, and sometimes even the Prosecutor's Office. It is their duty to adopt the necessary measures.
