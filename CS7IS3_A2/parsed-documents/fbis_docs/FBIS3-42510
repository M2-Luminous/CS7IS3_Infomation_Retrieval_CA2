President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev decided to become personally acquainted with the first model of that aircraft, visiting the Kiev Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex imeni Antonov together with President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. The leadership of the military departments of Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, meanwhile, have displayed an even greater interest in the new aircraft. And that is not surprising. The chief customers for the An-70 aircraft, after all, are the ministries of defense of Russia and Ukraine, who are ready to put this aircraft into service. All the more so as the development and construction of the new transport aircraft is one of the few examples of very close collaboration between Russia and Ukraine, based on an international agreement. President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk pointed out on that score that economic integration is an objective necessity in the international relations of the CIS countries. It was pointed out that the An-70 transport aircraft has capabilities surpassing those of all existing transport aircraft. (The editors will talk about the An-70 in more detail in an upcoming issue.) This aircraft is planned to be manufactured at aviation enterprises in Ukraine, Russia and Uzbekistan. The first series-produced An-70 aircraft, however, will appear in the skies, at best, only in 1996.
