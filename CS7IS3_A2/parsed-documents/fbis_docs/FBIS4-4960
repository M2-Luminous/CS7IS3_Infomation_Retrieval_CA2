FBIS4-4960 "dreas066_a_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Stationing AWACS at Hamamatsu Base Proposed Stationing AWACS at Hamamatsu Base Proposed OW0404091694 Tokyo KYODO in English 0837 GMT 4 Apr 94 OW0404091694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) has proposed freeing air space in the vicinity of a base in Shizuoka Prefecture for civilian use in exchange for converting the base into a host facility for AWACS [airborne warning and control system] aircraft, Defense Agency sources said Monday [4 April]. The sources said the proposal was made in talks between the Defense Agency and the Transport Ministry over the use of skies off the ASDF base at Hamamatsu, which is used for training exercises over the Pacific Ocean. Under the proposal, the base would be used exclusively for AWACS-converted Boeing 767 passenger planes, while its current training function would be shifted to another base, possibly on the Japan Sea coast. The Transport Ministry has long been eyeing a return of the training air space since a major air corridor runs through it, utilized by about 330 civilian aircraft a day. The number of those planes is expected to increase with the opening of the new Kansai International Airport this fall. AWACS stands for airborne early warning and control system, where airborne vehicles are equipped with search and height-finding radar and communications equipment for controlling weapons.
