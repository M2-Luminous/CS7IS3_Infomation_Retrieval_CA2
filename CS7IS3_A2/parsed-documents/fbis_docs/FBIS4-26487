Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in Melbourne today, Li said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series of major reform measures since talks started on China's resumption of its GATT membership in 1986. He said that China "will fulfill its due obligations and its economic and trade systems will be further integrated with the international ones" once China's GATT membership is resumed. With the support of the majority of the signatories, including Australia, Li said that the talks "have now entered the substantive stage where protocols are being negotiated." Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia after ending his tour to New Zealand. On the economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, Li said that the principle of "mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, opening up to each other and common prosperity" should be complied with.
