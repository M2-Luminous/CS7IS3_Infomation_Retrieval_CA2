FR941206-0-00017 FR941206-0-00001 FSIS believes that adoption of advanced meat/bone separation machinery may reduce the incidence of cumulative trauma disorder among meatcutters by eliminating some tasks which contribute to the disorder. Thus, this final rule may result in a reduction in costs associated with any reduced incidence of cumulative trauma disorder among workers. The U.S. Department of Labor reported an incidence rate for repeated trauma of 1,493.7 per 10,000 workers in the meatpacking industry in 1991, the highest rate of any listed private industry segment. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing with respect to the premises, facilities, and operations of federally inspected establishments any requirements that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, impose recordkeeping and other requirements within the scope of section 202 of the FMIA, if consistent therewith, with respect to any such federally inspected establishment. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and establishments. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of a program official. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR Part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions. Effect on Small Entities The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This rule does not require either large or small establishments to use advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems. Although there are initial costs involved with the purchase of machinery, there are no apparent direct competitive advantages that large establishments would have over small establishments.
