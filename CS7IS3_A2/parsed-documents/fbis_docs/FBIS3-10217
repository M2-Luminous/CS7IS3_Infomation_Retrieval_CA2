Elias Mata and Aurelio Mhr said that this measure seeks to expose to international public opinion the financial problems depositors have had to face since the intervention of Banco Latino. In this particular case, they want the Dutch consul to ask the Dutch ambassador to Venezuela and Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to suggest to the Dutch and Venezuelan Governments that they establish a commission to investigate the Latino NV Curazao case. They also urged the Dutch and Venezuelan Governments "to see that the culprits in the Latino NV Curazao case are punished." We are also demanding that the Dutch Government guarantee deposits that are currently frozen in Latino NV, Curazao. This action also demands the expeditious treatment of an emergency law submitted for Congress' consideration, they added. Front members asked the national government to allow "representatives of those affected by the Banco Latino and its branches crisis to participate in the commissions discussing the emergency law." This afternoon, Dutch Consul George Vinck reportedly gave the protesters a document written in English, which reportedly states his government's position on this situation.
