FR940304-0-00047 FR940304-0-00015 We anticipated that each physician that did not report ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM codes before April 1, 1989 would either send one or more persons for training, or may have determined that formal training was not needed. Some of those physicians may not have sent any staff since they are in a group practice, (in which case, one staff member may represent several physicians), or because they work for hospitals (in which case they would not submit Part B claims.) Below, in two examples, we are providing the extremes of estimated training costs using the same methodology as set forth in the impact analysis of the proposed rule. In the first example, we assume that all physicians who did not code prior to April 1989 sent, on average, one of their office staff to attend a half-day session sponsored by a national firm. We anticipated that the cost of such a training session could have been as high as $100.00. Thus, for this estimate, we are assuming a cost of $100.00. Furthermore, we assume the physicians paid an hourly rate of $9.65 per hour to their employees while they attended the coding session. Given these assumptions, we estimated training costs as follows: (All estimates are rounded to the nearest $10,000.) ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Half-day (4 hours) at $9.65 per hour=$38.60; $38.60×57,000 employees $2,200,000 Session cost $100.00×57,000 employees 5,700,000 n,s Total training costs $7,900,000 In the second example, we assume that physicians who did not code before the requirement was established in April 1989 sent, on average, one of their office staff to coding sessions sponsored by carriers or insurance companies at no cost. Assuming that the office employee was paid $9.65 an hour, we estimated the total training costs as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Half-day (4 hours) at $9.65 per hour=$38.60; $38.60×57,000 employees $2,200,000 Session costs 0 n,s Total training costs $2,200,000 Below, we show the total estimated first year costs for the two examples. •For the first example, the total estimated first year costs consisted of: 1␣ 1␣ Coding costs $5,120,000 Training 7,300,000 Books 3,700,000 n,s Total $16,720,000
