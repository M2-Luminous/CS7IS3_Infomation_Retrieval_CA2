Taking advantage of new business without incurring the wrath of the European Union. This will be the salient line of Telecom Italia, the single telecommunications operator that is currently being set up, the macro structure of which is now in the finishing stages. It will be divided into five divisions: network; business; mobile radios (that will also deal with part of the satellite activity in the future); basic and international services. How was this decision reached? One of the main goals that STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] set itself in 1992, when the law on the reorganization of the telecommunications sector was approved, was the establishment of Telecom Italia. Up to now telecommunications has been a fragmented realm of competencies and functions, that has obviously brought about waste and lost opportunities. It was a precise goal, but not an easy one. So STET created a special internal task force (that comes directly under Managing Director Michele Tedeschi), called in external consultants, and to avoid the usual rows with Brussels, intensified its monitoring of the European directive on deregulation that is becoming increasingly restrictive as demonstrated during the recent bidding for the GSM cellular telephone. For example, amongst the many directives from Brussels, there is number 44 of 1992 (which is being incorporated into the Italian regulations) that provides for "transparency" of the network based on the so-called ONP [Open Network Provision]. A special division with responsibility for the network has also been planned for Telecom Italia to avoid failure to comply with European Union directives. But let us proceed in an orderly way. The reports of the four consulting companies called upon by STET (Bain Cuneo, McKinsey, Tesi and Telos) to compare the possibilities for realigning the Italian telephone with the leading industrialized countries and to make a detailed study of the structures of the other administrations, were delivered before Christmas. They were immediately distributed to the strategic task force, to the operational structures of STET and IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry], to the executive committees, and to the advisors of the companies involved in the operation. The dossiers of the four consultants are set out in different ways and reach several conclusions. The McKinsey report is based more on international comparison, the others are more of an organizational nature. Let us start with the first. After having compared the principal operators in the sector at a world level, the McKinsey report reached the conclusion that today STET is more efficient than the very well-known (and privatized) British Telecom (BT), but a little less efficient than the French operator and the German Telekom. Furthermore, still according to McKinsey, SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company] should still have ample margins to improve the quality of its service, its purchasing policy, and its dealings with major international clients. As far as the tariff side is concerned, the Italians recognize the fact that a single operator is a good opportunity to restructure the tariffs too, since the existing restrictions can finally be lifted. Now that the reports have been thoroughly studied, the men from STET seem to have come to a fairly precise idea about how to structure the Telecom Italia that is being created. But they know well that the process will not be a short one, because once the optimal structure has been outlined, its realization needs to be careful and gradual. The first key point is the confirmation of Tecnitel, the subholding led by Umberto Silvestri, for the management of companies like Italtel, SIRTI [Italian Telephone Network Company], AET [Electrical Telephone Equipment], and NECSY [Network Control Systems] operating in the manufacturing and installation sector of the STET group. Furthermore, according to the prevailing hypothesis, the other companies that are not involved in the management of services (Finsiel [Information Systems Finance Company], Saritel, CSELT [Telecommunications Study Center and Laboratories], Telesoft, etc.) will be excluded from the reorganization. And what about the sole operator (that has always been called Telecom Italia, even if the name could change)? Barring last minute modifications -- that are always possible -- the divisional structure chosen by SIP in the fall of 1991 should be substantially confirmed, at least as far as its philosophy is concerned. SIP currently comprises a dozen staff functions (the areas covering quality, programming, technology, network, strategic planning, real estate, purchasing, external relations, auditing, central affairs, administration, and personnel), and four divisions (basic services, business, public telephones and mobile radio telephones). Telecom Italia is moving toward a structure that has more divisions and a further balance of staff functions. The most important transition is the transformation of the basic network connecting districts, excluding the local network, into an autonomous division. The Telecom infrastructure will be created by merging the SIP, Iritel, Italcable, and Telespazio networks, while a single administration and control of the technical area (for plants and operations) have become essential prerequisites as far as marketing is concerned. In particular the network division will become the sole supplier both for "internal customers" and for the external ones (for example the operator of the private GSM or the major companies), as provided for by European Union directives. Then a new division will be formed for international communications, while public telephones will become part of the basic services that will lose the major part of the network. So Telecom Italia will have five divisions. And a couple of warnings: First, within a period that still has to be defined, mobile radios should break off to become an autonomous business, while the policy of alliances could produce new structures. If this is the new Italian telecommunications structure that is emerging, the levels of autonomy of the various structures, the details of the staff areas, and the relative weights to be given to the various boxes shown on the organization chart [not shown] must still be defined.
