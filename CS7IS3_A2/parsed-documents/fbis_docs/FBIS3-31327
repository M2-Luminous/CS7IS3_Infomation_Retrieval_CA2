"We have not yet received the commission's report, but we have been informed that it concludes it is impossible to determine whether the shell was fired from the Muslim or the Serbian side, and therefore impossible to establish responsibility for the massacre," Krajisnik said. "We are very dissatisfied with such a report because the commission did not carry out a detailed investigation and make an in-depth analysis", Krajisnik explained, recalling that the Serbian side's demand that it not only establish whether the shell was fired and by which side, but also that a forensic study of the victims' bodies be carried out. "This would have told us something about the nature of the injuries and answered whether a mortar shell could have killed so many people," Krajisnik said. "Our demand has not been not met. This is strange and we are all the more disenchanted with the fact that the truth has not been not established, because we know the massacre was committed by the Serbian side," the Srpska republic assembly chairman underscored. Commenting on the commission's explanation that some time has passed since the massacre, Krajisnik said: "I believe it is now a problem to gather all the evidence and ascertain the nature of the crime." "However, we cannot accept such practice," Krajisnik added, recalling that, immediately following the massacre, the Serbian side demanded that a mixed commission and then an international commission of experts be formed, but that there was too much procrastination. "Many indications exist that the device which exploded had been planted, and doubts remain," Krajisnik stressed. According to Krajisnik, a larger number of various international experts should have been included in the investigation, because this case, as he said, has grave consequences for one side -- the Serbian side -- and could have far-reaching repercussions on the entire peace process and peace in the region. Recalling that the massacre has been a reason for NATO to issue an ultimatum, Krajisnik stressed that the report in its present form cannot be a reason for the rigorous threat against the Serbian people. "We fear that at this moment, a few days before the expiration of the ultimatum, politics have had a significant influence on the results of the investigation," Krajisnik said. Asked whether Serbian experts were included in the work of the international investigative commission, Krajisnik replied that a Serbian representative was not a full member of the commission, and was unable to vote, or in any way influence results of the investigation. He, as an additional member, had an insight into the work of the commission, could offer explanations, and inform them about the findings of the Serbian side regarding the massacre at Sarajevo's marketplace, Krajisnik explained.
