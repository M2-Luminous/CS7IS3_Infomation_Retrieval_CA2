The rally in the Small Arena of the Luzhnikiy Stadium was timed to the third anniversary of the referendum of the future of the former Soviet Union. According to the police, about 3,000-4,000 people took part in the rally. On March 17 1991, about 70 percent of the voters favored the preservation of a renovated Soviet Union. According to Zyuganov, "the ruling regime is devastating Russia as a superpower and destroying its science and culture. But the conscience of the people is waking up." Zyuganov pointed to the need for an immediate adjustment of the course of reforms, the formation of a government of popular confidence, "an end to the destruction of the army and state security bodies and the restoration of a united state." The leader of the Russian All-People Union, Sergey Baburin, said that "justice demanded an uncompromising struggle against those who dismantled the Soviet Union. We are ready for civic accord, but we expect the sinners to make the first step." According to Baburin, if President Yeltsin "wanted peace, let him come to us and repent." He called on opposition forces for consolidation and pointed out: "We will resuscitate our fatherland (meaning the Soviet Union - IF's note) despite any obstacles." In his address to the rally, Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov proposed the movement Accord for Russia be turned into another movement called Accord for Restoration of the Soviet Union. He also proposed the new movement set up its regional committees to encompass local nationalist, patriotic and pro-Communist forces. The committees could organize the struggle for the restoration of the Soviet Union, Lukyanov was quoted as saying. The rally was also attended by former Soviet Deputy Sazhiy Umalatova, Secretary General of the Communist Bolshevik Party of All Soviet Union Nina Andreyeva and Russian Communist Workers' Party Secretary Viktor Anpilov.
