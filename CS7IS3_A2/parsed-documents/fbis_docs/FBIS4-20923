Cocom's "death" symbolizes the disappearance of one more relic from the "Cold War." Cocom was formed in 1949 by the NATO countries with Australia and Japan to establish strict controls over the export of strategically important technologies and raw materials to the socialist bloc countries. As far as Cocom's "successor" is concerned, it will not be a structure similar to its predecessor, but basically a new organization which should implement an international programme to monitor the movement of arms and dual-use technologies, ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. The new organization should forestall the purchase of such goods for military purposes, but will hopefully not be aimed against one state of group of states. Work on an agreement concerning the new organization is due to begin in the near future. China, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have announced their interest in being part of the Cocom-successor organization. So far, a decision has been made to found three working groups which will outline the main purposes of the future international institution. Consultations on the approaches of various countries to the problem of export control will be continued. Russia has already taken part in such negotiations and is ready to continue to play an active role in them on a partner-like basis. The most important question remains that of working out an effective international control mechanism which will replace the old principles and help maintain the necessary high level of knowledge about the spread of strategic technologies and materials.
