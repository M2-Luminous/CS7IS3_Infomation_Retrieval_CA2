Mr. Akmadzic, good evening. [Akmadzic] Good evening. [Correspondent] We are pleased to welcome you once again to our program. It seems that many interesting things have been happening on the eve of the next round of the Geneva talks that are scheduled for 8 February. It looks as if Croats are in vogue once again. Several events have led to the conclusion that considerable pressure has been exerted on the Croatian negotiating team and on the Croatian state. Do you have the same feeling? [Akmadzic] I have this feeling, naturally. However, I would like to say that pressure is being put on all the three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. on all the sides that are taking part in the Geneva talks, which means the three warring sides as well as the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia, which are also taking part in the Geneva talks. The pressure has been planned in advance. It has been exerted for a long time, and I believe that it has now been intensified to a certain extent. [Correspondent] Within the context of this pressure, the most interesting thing was the recent speculations about sanctions against Croatia. How would you comment on yesterday's accusations and claims contained in Butrus-Ghali's report, i.e. his letter to the UN Security Council about members of the Croatian Army fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina? As we could see, the figure in question is 3,000-5,000 Croatian soldiers. [Akmadzic] This first started with a letter to the UN Security Council president by Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic in which Silajdzic accused Croatia of armed intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have -- I personally and many other structures in Herceg-Bosna and in the Republic of Croatia -- strongly denied these accusations. There are no regular units of the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is certain; this is absolutely true. Namely, there are only volunteers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who reported as individuals or as small organized groups to defend their homes, their homeland, and their families in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is, therefore, not an intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the outside. I said before that both Mr. Izetbegovic and Mr. Silajdzic have known this. They knew about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina a year ago, and the situation has not changed since. There is nothing new. The new situation is that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has been suffering defeats in its [word indistinct] actions against the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. Because of this, it is looking for excuses and looking to justify itself by accusing the Republic of Croatia. [Correspondent] Either way, the fact is that everyone has taken yesterday's Butrus-Ghali letter seriously. For instance, the Danish foreign minister has already announced that Denmark would call for sanctions against the Republic of Croatia at the next session in Brussels on 7 and 8 February. On the one side, we have your stand, and on the other is a report from the United Nations. [Akmadzic] Of course, what the world is thinking is what is important and not just what has been happening. I must say that the present situation -- in this respect -- is very serious. I believe, however, that the world will see and that we will prove -- through international observers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] -- that there are no regular units in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Likewise, the world cannot consider individuals from Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the Croatian Army's presence and then threaten Croatia in some way. I would not say that sanctions will be introduced in Croatia. I think that this would be too strong. There will be no sanctions. The international community is aware of the fact that it would be a very bad and risky move on their part. I do believe, however, that the Croatian delegation will be cautioned in Geneva, and I hope it will end on this. [Correspondent] But could this pressure result in the Croatian side's concessions at the Geneva talks -- in unwanted concessions? [Akmadzic] There is no question of any concessions. As far as the talks on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, we are negotiating about a lasting political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are not talking about an isolated case that happened and that could [word indistinct] such fundamental decisions as the organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There will be no concessions. The international community -- both the EU and the United Nations -- gave us their support so that what has been promised and given as concession [words indistinct] will remain and that the Croatian side will keep to that. There will be no fresh concessions or demands for fresh concessions. [Correspondent] In our program last night, we talked to Mr. Jelic about the Croatian convention, which is to take place on Sunday, 6 February in Sarajevo. You are also going to be there. What information do you have about the convention? What are its objectives, and what stance will you take there? [Akmadzic] I have registered to take part at the Croat convention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would call it a so-called convention. It is really a gathering of Croats that has no legitimacy with regard to representing the Croat people. [passage omitted] I will travel to Sarajevo on 5 February to take part in the talks between the Croatian, Muslim, and Serbian people--which regularly take place at the airport. These talks on reestablishing mutual trust are held on the level of a working group. If it is possible for me to stay the night in Sarajevo, if UNPROFOR gives me permission, I will stay and attend the convention. As things stand now, however, this is not likely. It seems that it will not be possible for me to stay. [Correspondent] Does this mean that there will be nobody from Herceg-Bosna in Sarajevo? [Akmadzic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna has requested that UNPROFOR allow some people to attend, the people who were designated to attend by the coordination committee in Sarajevo that convened the gathering. We have not received any reply to confirm that we will be allowed to enter Sarajevo. If we do receive it, we will go to Sarajevo, of course. You also mentioned the extraordinary session of the Chamber of Deputies, our fifth session so far, scheduled to take place in Livno on 8 February. This will be a session of the extended Chamber of Deputies. I would, in fact, call it a real convention, although it is not officially a convention. All current political and military questions, the current military situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be discussed there. The Chamber of Deputies is expected to make some very concrete decisions, outlining the direction for the Croatian people at this very important historic period, at this very difficult time for the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croatian people are facing aggression, first by the Serbs and then also by the Muslims, in continuous fighting that has been going on for a long time. We must make a decision on the course of our further activities. We must decide which path to take in the search for peace because our lasting objective is peace, not peace at any cost, but peace within the limits of justice and what the Croatian people deserve. [Correspondent] Let us get back to the gathering in Sarajevo on 6 February. You said it was a so-called Croatian convention. The fact is that nobody is entitled to prevent Croats who remain outside of the borders of Herceg-Bosna from trying to articulate their interests. They really are in a specific position, and it is a fact that a number of Croats remain outside of Herceg-Bosna, outside of the region that will probably be one of the three parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They do have the right to articulate their interests. What objections do you have to their gathering? Why are they [word indistinct]? [Akmadzic] I said so-called convention because the word convention usually means a legislative body. [passage omitted]
