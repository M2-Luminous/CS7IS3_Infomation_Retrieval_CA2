In 1993 alone the province signed 3,209 economic co-operation contracts with other provinces. Those which have been carried out involve a total investment of 23.3 billion yuan and have produced 13.3 billion yuan in output value, a provincial official said. According to the official, over 10,000 enterprises solely funded by other provinces or jointly invested in by Guangdong and other provinces have been licensed in Guangdong. Such ventures make up more than one third of the total in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Huizhou, all of which are major industrial cities in the province. So far, Guangdong has established a co-operation network with five provinces and three cities in central and south China. Zhaoqing and Zhuhai have developed close co-operation ties with three cities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. As a province which has a shortage of natural resources, Guangdong has also co-operated with three provinces in the southwest, which have rich power resources, to build power stations and railway lines. The Shenzhen Special Economic Zone has already invested over five billion yuan in inland provinces to build 500 co-operative projects. A large number of township enterprises have also invested in inland provinces to start factories. Guangdong has invested 2.5 billion yuan in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the official said.
