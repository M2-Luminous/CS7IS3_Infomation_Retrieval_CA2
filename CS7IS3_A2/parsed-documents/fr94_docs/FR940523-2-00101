The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance. The amendment modified the Technical Specifications to increase the pressurizer safety valve (PSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +3 percent and ^1 percent, the main steam safety valve (MSSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +/^3 percent, reducing the high pressurizer pressure trip setpoint (HPPT) response time from 1.15 seconds to 0.5 second, and reducing the TS minimum auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump flow requirement from 750 gallons per minute (GPM) to 650 GPM. The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the Federal Register on December 27, 1990 (55 FR 53220). A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice. By Memorandum and Order dated May, 9, 1991 (LBP&hyph;91&hyph;19), a petition for leave to intervene and a request for hearing filed by the intervenors was granted. However, the intervenors later withdrew that challenge. By Memorandum and Order dated September 30, 1991 (LBP&hyph;91&hyph;37A), the proceeding was terminated. The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the issuance of this amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 17403).
