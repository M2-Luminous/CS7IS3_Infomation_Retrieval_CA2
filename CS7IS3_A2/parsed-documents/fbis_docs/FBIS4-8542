One of them has, thus -- perhaps to make this reckoning seem a "historical inevitability" -- compared Manolic to "Macek in 1941, when the creator of the Bannat of Croatia established that the antifascist coalition would win the war." He said that the estimate was good, but Macek did not benefit too much from it in 1945. Manolic would have fared the same way at present with his story about the "integral Bosnia-Herzegovina" if President Tudjman had not helped the Croats there in their defense against Serb aggression. If we neglect the fact that it was Tudjman, rather than his opponent, who was obsessed with the idea of the Bannat, which is one of the reasons that the Croat-Muslim conflicts escalated, the basic question remains: Who does Croatian President Franjo Tudjman represent in this analogy? There is only one logical, but also historically acceptable, answer: Josip Broz. More precisely, he became so only after the Washington agreement, while at the beginning of the Bosnia-Herzegovina plot he seemed more like a "poglavnik" [reference to Ante Pavelic -- wartime Croatian leader], convinced that the Muslims must accept the Croat-Serb squaring of accounts regarding "the most complicated country in the world." Who Is "Rankovic" and Who Is "Tito"? However, if Tudjman is Tito in this analogy, who has after all always fascinated him with his style of ruling, then Manolic can only be the personification of the protagonists of the Croatian spring, Savka [Dabcevic-Kucar, president of the Croatian National Party] and Miko [Tripalo], his parliament colleague. Namely, Tito overthrew the Croatian leaders after they had correctly identified the "carcinoma" of the Yugoslav federation of the time. The Croatian "pair of oars" had to fall; although Tripalo had been "predestined" to be Tito's successor, a radical constitutional reform, as they conceived it, could not be avoided. A similar thing has been happening with the reestablishment of Manolic's view of Croatian policy toward Bosnia, as well as the problems of the internal strengthening of the legal state. This is why the claims, formed by the "right" faction in the party in power, about Tudjman in fact removing "the Croatian Rankovic", are somewhat tragicomical. Namely, Manolic's political trouble started the moment he started to support the democratization of Croatia -- too loudly and on the recognizable antifascist basis -- rather than its transformation into a police state. The problem was also that the former "number-two man" had, during his "Udba" [Yugoslav State Security Service] career, when he did not bother Tudjman at all, created too wide a circle of political enemies for himself, mostly in the top state circles. Eventually the "anti-Manolic coalition" became so numerous and influential that it was much easier for the Croatian president to say goodbye to his old friend than to directly oppose those whose politics have been seriously shaken by the Washington change. The worst thing for Manolic in all this was that, until the last moment, he could not believe that the rule of unquestioning obedience also held true for Tudjman's closest associates, and even for those who made his breakthrough to power possible, which his opponents had been making good tactical use of all the while. They will verbally support the Croatian president as long as he keeps them in their present positions, that is, until they raise the issue of his responsibility for joint mistakes. Be that as it may, the key question at the moment is how the departure of the leader of the "left" within the ruling party [Croatian democratic Community -- HDZ] will be reflected on the Croatian political scene. The answer cannot be unambiguous, but Manolic's departure will surely incite new political regrouping as well as a clearer profiling of the HDZ from a movement into a party of the proclaimed Christian democratic orientation. This aim ensues from the conclusions of the Second General HDZ Congress, when the intraparty conflict was temporarily "conserved," but in the new circumstances there is no reason not to start implementing it. Naturally, the precondition for this is Tudjman reestablishing the balance of his "left" and "right" factions -- concealed behind whose ideologized names there are, in fact, radically opposed views on the democratization of state power -- or getting rid of all their leaders as soon as possible. More precisely, it is a public secret that "Susak's faction" will now try to remove Stipe Mesic, with whom it "waged a war" in a more open way than with Manolic until the Second General Congress. If Mesic falls, the fate of the other "Manolic followers" who hold important positions within the parliament is also sealed -- primarily Degoricija and Boljkovac -- after which the purge of the "technomanagerial" faction will follow, ranging from Franjo Greguric to the present Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. Valentic's Threat "Frozen" The "lobbyist" information on Valentic's recent threat to resign, which would have disastrous consequences on the final success of the economic reform, speaks of how important Manolic's departure is in this disturbance of relations. Tudjman has temporarily "frozen" this threat by promising some -- still insufficiently known -- personnel "abortions," but it is clear who it is in the party in power who bothers Valentic the most in implementing the further stage of restructuring the Croatian economy. If Tudjman opts for the policy of balance, it is inevitable that he will not only have to prevent more departures of "soft" HDZ members, but also to listen to Manolic's swan song and get rid of Defense Minister Gojko Susak, for whom it is not difficult to find something "incriminating" regarding the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In these complex combinations, Vladimir Seks, the government person most responsible for the poor functioning of the legal system, is in the same danger as lower parliamentary officials such as Ivan Milas and Luka Bebic. The claim of the "right" that it had already bled because of Vice Vukojevic's departure from the information service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not satisfy the opposite side, because his intraparty influence has not decreased significantly. Involving the "retired" Mate Boban in this story would be even more absurd, considering the fact that he is a politician from a neighboring country. If the current international situation is taken into account, which, after the Croat-Muslim agreement, is much more favorable than in the period when the conflict between the HDZ factions culminated, it is certain that Tudjman will keep an eye on the intraparty balance, but in the way that he will gradually get rid of both the "left" and "right" factions. The most important thing in these politics, which could most easily be described with the proverb regarding drinking half and giving the other half to the horse, is perhaps the fact that a start was made by eliminating Tudjman's best known friend and fellow fighter, so that the other "elimination candidates" could be informed that their political future will cause even fewer dilemmas. Naturally, political wit will not allow Tudjman to make such replacements in a "package," considering the fact that, in such circumstances, there is a danger of a mass escape of members to competitive parties. The "certificates of withdrawal" will arrive individually, equally on both sides, and after each the pulse of the electoral body will be felt with great care. Tudjman has the whole of two years to "renovate" the party in power, which is how far ahead the following parliamentary elections are, so it is to be supposed that the written-off officials, including Manolic, will not be capable of causing a serious parliamentary crisis or a paralysis of the political system, let alone of threatening a coup. Of the protagonists in the current intraparty conflicts, the only faction spared will be the above mentioned "technomanagerial" one, which Tudjman needs to shape a modern market economy. On the other hand, all the important instruments of power will be held by the representatives of the Christian Democratic faction, primarily Jure Radic and Mate Granic, who will, at the lower level, rely on the "subsequent" HDZ members not burdened by the present ideological conflicts. The only winner in that period will, all in all, be President Tudjman, so that at the next elections there could be a test of how interesting the party, redesigned in terms of personnel and program, is to potential voters. During this two-year HDZ "cleaning up," the chances of Manolic and those who will soon follow him making a political career are slim. If Manolic's positions are analyzed, it is evident that they are already contained in the programs of some Croatian parties, primarily in the Liberal and Social Democratic parties, so that, in the case of a new party being founded, he could not expect too many members joining. It would be more realistic for the future "renegades" to join related parties, unless the leaderships of the latter establish that the HDZ "early guerrilla fighters" are too great a weight around their necks. No One Needs Losers As far as Manolic is concerned, he immediately felt what it meant to be a political "renegade." After he sought the support of the parliamentary parties and the general public for the replacement of his opponent Gojko Susak, the leadership of the main opposition party spoke up, but in defense of the defense minister. Namely, Liberal leaders Drazen Budisa and Damir Zoric estimated that it was a good opportunity for improving their relations with the Herzegovinian lobby, as they intended to cover the Bosnia- Herzegovina areas too. Manolic was thus tricked here too, and Tudjman had no more reason to hesitate. The later support of the Liberals in preventing Manolic's abdication at the Chamber of Counties bears no special significance, because it is known in advance how the HDZ "machine" will vote next time. Evidently, no one needs political losers, even when the events confirm their premature "cock's crow."
