The United States' sensitivity to the export of weapons by other countries is part of their sophisticated strategy to sell their "own commodities." The WALL STREET JOURNAL of 28 January reported that "since the end of the Cold War, the United States has become the greatest exporter of conventional weapons" and that "in particular, the United States achieved record weapons sales of $340 million last year." Weapons sold by "the police" have seeped to third countries where disputes frequently take place to become lethal weapons there. The WALL STREET JOURNAL denounced the United States regarding this for "actively exporting weapons while urging other countries to refrain from exporting weapons under the pretext of world security." Last year, the United States assumed a hard-line attitude and imposed trade sanctions on China for exporting missiles to Pakistan. Even though China strongly denied the charge, world opinion supported the "defense of peace" position of the United States that strong measures be taken against suspected arms-selling countries. Although an excuse, the cause of world peace seemed plausible. However, according to the WALL STREET JOURNAL's report, the United States sold a total of 484 missiles in the five years from 1989 to 1992. This is almost eight times the 63 missiles China exported. It is unreasonable for the United States to strongly slander China for arms sales which are so slight in comparison to its own sales, and it is unreasonable for it to do so under the pretext of peace while continuing its own sales. It has been learned that arms dealers even manipulated disputes for their own interests. The world is anxiously watching the two faces --"police" and arms dealer--of the United States.
