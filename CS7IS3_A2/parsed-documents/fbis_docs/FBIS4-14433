The Ingush delegation returned to Nazran. Earlier, Republic of Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev forwarded to Akhsarbek Galazov, head of the Republic of North Ossetia, a package of proposals on a settlement of relations between the two republics. Since terms for the return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia and preparations for a meeting between the Republic's leaders early in April were supposed to form the main topic of the talks in Terek, in the Ingush side's assessment the failure of the North Ossetia delegation to come to the talks can be assessed as "boycotting the process of normalizing the situation in the region."
