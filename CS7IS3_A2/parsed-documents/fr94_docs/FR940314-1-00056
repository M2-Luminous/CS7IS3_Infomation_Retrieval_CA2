FR940314-1-00056 FR940314-1-00012 (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship foods into the United States, the business activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in the United States. * * * * * (18) Food products that are low-volume (that is, they meet the requirements for units sold in paragraph (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section); that, except as provided in paragraph (j)(18)(iv) of this section, are the subject of a claim for an exemption that provides the information required under paragraph (j)(18)(iv) of this section, that is filed before the beginning of the time period for which the exemption is claimed, and that is filed by a person that qualifies to claim the exemption under the requirements for average full-time equivalent employees in paragraph (j)(18)(i) or (j)(18)(ii) of this section; and whose labels, labeling, and advertising do not provide nutrition information or make a nutrient content or health claim. (i) For food products first introduced into interstate commerce before May 8, 1994, the product shall be exempt for the period: (A) Between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, if, for the period between May 8, 1993, and May 7, 1994, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 600,000 units of that product were sold in the United States or, if the product was not offered for sale for a full year before May 8, 1994, it is reasonably anticipated that fewer than 600,000 units of the product will be sold between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995; (B) Between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, if, for the period between May 8, 1994, and May 7, 1995, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 300 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 400,000 units of that product were sold in the United States; and (C) Between May 8, 1996, and May 7, 1997, if, for the period between May 8, 1995, and May 7, 1996, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 200 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 200,000 units of that product were sold in the United States. (ii) For all other food products, the product shall be eligible for an exemption for any 12-month period if, for the preceding 12 months, the person claiming the exemption employed fewer than an average of 100 full-time equivalent employees and fewer than 100,000 units of that product were sold in the United States, or in the case of a food product that was not sold in the 12-month period preceding the period for which exemption is claimed, fewer than 100,000 units of such product are reasonably anticipated to be sold in the United States during the period for which exemption is claimed.
