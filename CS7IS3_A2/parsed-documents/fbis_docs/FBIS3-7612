Korean Authorities Accused of Blocking Pyongyang Trip of Large-Scale High-Level Foreign Peace Mission" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today denouncing the South Korean authorities for having blocked former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level politicians of different countries from visiting Pyongyang through Panmunjom. The spokesman said: Former presidents, prime ministers and other high-level politicians of different countries, who had attended the Second World Peace Conference a few days ago, expressed their willingness to visit Pyongyang, passing through Panmunjom, in order to have a better understanding of the realities of the DPRK and manifest their support and solidarity for the Korean people's efforts for peace and reunification of the country. Among them were about 100 prominent political activists from different continents -- some 30 former heads of state and government including former Costa Rican presidents Rodrigo Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman Sowar el Dahab and former Prime Minister El Katim el Khalifa, former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor-General Edward Schreyer; incumbent and former high-level politicians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand and other Asian countries, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and other Middle East countries, France, Spain, Norway and other European countries, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other countries in Latin America; and high-level politicians from the United States. The spokesman said: "Though we had made preparations and kept our side's portion of Panmunjom open to welcome them as envoys of peace and friendship, their visit to Pyongyang could not be realised due to the obstruction of the South Korean authorities." Branding the South Korean authorities' act in barring their Pyongyang visit by blocking the South side's portion of Panmunjom as a rude act against international courtesy and morality, he said: What must not be overlooked in their act is that they abused the issue of their Pyongyang visit for the purpose of North-South confrontation. As was already reported, they unilaterally broke up the working contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South and froze all the dialogue between the two sides, driving the situation to the brink of war. They raised a hue and cry over "the threat from the North" to stir up uneasiness among the people and, at the same time, made public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027," openly crying for "unification by prevailing over communism." Their racket became noisier when the issue of foreign envoys' visit to Pyongyang was raised. Thus they created a grave situation under the eyes of foreign envoys and, on this pretext, demanded the cancellation of their projected passage through Panmunjom and visit to Pyongyang. This was really a disgusting, despicable act. Clear is the reason why they blocked the foreign envoys' visit to Pyongyang. They were afraid that the quite different realities of the North and the South should be known to the world public. Had the mission visited Pyongyang, it would have clearly seen that, under Korean-style socialism centering on the popular masses where the leader, the party and the masses are singleheartedly united, all the people are leading an independent and creative happy life with no worries about food, clothing and housing, stepping up peaceful economic construction not "preparations for a war", and are aspiring after a reunified Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers advertise. And multifarious social evils of South Korea, corrupt and ailing under the present "civilian" rule, which stakes its fate on outside forces, would have been brought into bolder relief in contrast with the North. If the mission had seen the DPRK which is animated with peaceful construction, a scene quite different from South Korea across the Military Demarcation Line where powder- reeking war fever is being incited, it would have understood who really wants peace and reunification and who really pursues war and division. This is what the South Korean authorities were afraid of. Truth and lie are bound to be made clear. As the sun cannot be covered by a palm, so the South Korean authorities can never cover up the high external prestige of the ever- victorious DPRK by checking the tour of the international mission to the North. The South Korean authorities should no longer continue the anti- national act of pursuing division and confrontation against the desire of all the fellow countrymen and the peaceloving people of the world and the rash action of impairing the image of our nation known as the eastern country of good manners. We always keep the door open to foreign missions who come to do work favorable for the peace and peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula with good intention toward us.
