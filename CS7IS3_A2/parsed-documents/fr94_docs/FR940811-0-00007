OMB has determined that this rule is significant. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Executive Vice President, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Consequently, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this final rule do not preempt State law to the extent such laws are not inconsistent with the provisions of this final rule. This final rule is not retroactive. Before any action may be brought regarding the provisions of this final rule, the administrative appeal rights set forth at 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed for this final rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This final rule does not impose new information collection or recordkeeping requirements on the public. The information collection requirements of the current rule at 7 CFR Part 1435 have been approved through July 31, 1995, by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and has been assigned OMB No. 0560&hyph;0138. Executive Order 12372 The program covered by this final rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Background Section 1105(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 206(i) of the 1949 Act to provide that, only for the 1991 through 1995 crops of sugarcane and sugar beets, the first processor of sugarcane or sugar beets shall remit to CCC a nonrefundable marketing assessment in an amount equal to 0.18 cents per pound of raw cane sugar processed by the processor from domestically produced sugarcane and an amount equal to 0.193 cents per pound of beet sugar processed by the processor from domestically produced sugar beets. The amendment also provided for the imposition of civil penalties if any persons were to fail to remit such assessments or to comply with such requirements for recordkeeping which are required to carry out section 206(i). Because the 1991 crop year was to begin on July 1, 1991, an interim rule was promulgated to implement these assessments, which became effective on June 19, 1991 (56 FR 28034). Based on consideration of the comments received, a final rule was promulgated effective on November 1, 1991 (56 FR 55606). Subsequently, the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991 (the 1991 Act, also known as the technical corrections to the 1990 Farm Act), which became effective on December 13, 1991, amended section 206(i) of the 1949 Act, to: (1) Provide that the assessments would apply only for marketings of raw cane sugar and beet sugar during the 1992 through 1996 fiscal years, (2) Specify the timing of collections of marketing assessments, and (3) Clarify that the assessments would apply to sugar derived from sugar beet molasses or sugarcane molasses. A proposed rule was promulgated on December 31, 1992 (57 FR 62486) to reflect the statutory amendments enacted in the 1991 Act and, at the same time, to ease the regulatory burden of the assessments and to further clarify certain provisions of the regulations. Section 1107 (a) of the Reconciliation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), which became effective on August 10, 1993, amended section 206 of the 1949 Act, to provide that: (1) Assessments would apply to the marketings of raw cane sugar and beet sugar for two additional fiscal years, through fiscal 1998, (2) The assessments for fiscal years 1995 through 1998 would be 10 percent higher per pound of sugar than assessments for fiscal years 1992 through 1994, and (3) Processors who knowingly market sugar in excess of the allocation of the processor shall pay an assessment which is double the applicable assessment required per pound of sugar marketed. In this final rule, CCC is adding amendments to the regulations to reflect the statutory amendments enacted in the Reconciliation Act. Summary of Comments One national and two State sugar associations commented on the proposed rule. All three were critical of §1435.203(e) which requires remitting the marketing assessment fee by October 30 on the quantity of sugar produced during the preceding fiscal year but not marketed by September 30. Even though such sugar would not be subject to a second assessment when it is marketed, the payment on sugar inventories was considered an unfair burden on the processors. Two of the commenters recommended that the marketing assessment should be imposed only when the sugar is actually marketed, except that in the last fiscal year (fiscal 1998), any (1991- through 1997-crop) sugar not marketed by September 30, would be subject to the marketing assessment fee. Regardless of the merits of the recommendation, CCC is required by statute to implement §1435.203(e) as written in the proposed rule and therefore adopts the section as final. The third commenter agrees that current statutes uphold the need for §1435.203(e), but asks CCC to acknowledge the inequity and thereby pave the way for remedial legislation. One commenter contended that Hawaiian producers should be permitted credit for assessments paid on sugar processed during July 1 through September 30, 1991 ``as was done for beet processors.'' CCC addressed this issue extensively in the proposed rule and maintains that the assessment rules were applied consistently among all processors, both beet and cane. Thus, CCC adopts the provisions as provided in the proposed rule, except for revisions to §§1435.200, 1435.202, and 1435.204 to reflect statutory requirements of §1107 (a) of the Reconciliation Act.
