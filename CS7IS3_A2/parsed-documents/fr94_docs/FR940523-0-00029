ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations adding language to the existing regulations regarding civil actions by persons other than taxpayers, to clarify language that is ambiguous or confusing. The final regulations provide that when the IRS levies on property that is in the custody of an agency of the Federal Government, a third party (i.e., someone other than the taxpayer) who is injured by such levy may have a cause of action against the Government for wrongful levy. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective December 23, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerome D. Sekula, (202) 622&hyph;3640 (not a toll-free call). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains final regulations amending the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). On December 23, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking relating to civil actions by persons other than taxpayers was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 68092). No written comments were received. No public hearing was requested or held. Because no comments were received, the proposed regulations under section 7426 are adopted without revision by this Treasury decision. The preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking contains the explanation of the provisions of this Treasury decision. Special Analyses It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Jerome D. Sekula, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (General Litigation), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.
