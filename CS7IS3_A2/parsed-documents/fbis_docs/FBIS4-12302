Addressing a news conference in the Parliament House in Islamabad this morning, she said this is a firm commitment of her government with the people of Pakistan. She said Pakistan will not open its nuclear facilities for inspection unilaterally as this would be discriminatory and against the wishes of the Pakistani nation. Ms. Benazir Bhutto emphasized that there should be an even-handed approach by the United States on the problem of nuclear nonproliferation, arms race, and missiles race, but these are to be resolved in South Asian subcontinent. Pakistan has given several positive proposals for nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, but these have been rejected by India. The prime minister said Pakistan wanted to improve bilateral relations with the United States not for acquisition of F-16 aircraft or for arms purchases, but because Pakistan and the United States have a history of old friendship. She said the United States is now the only superpower and so it has a role to play in the solution of the Kashmir problem. Referring to the U.S. deputy secretary of state's forthcoming visit to Pakistan, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan will inform Mr. Strobe Talbott that it believes in nonproliferation in South Asia, but there should a regional approach to it. She also urged the opposition to give up its negative attitude of confrontation and join hands with the government on the sensitive issues of national importance like nuclear and Kashmir.
