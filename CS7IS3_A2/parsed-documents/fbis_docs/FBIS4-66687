Shares in government companies and organizations will go on sale on the stock market, at auction, and through negotiations. Sales will be done after determination of the base sale price for cash and installment payments after a decision by the minister in charge of the organization making the transfer as to the nature of the transfers. Mas'ud Roghani-Zanjani, chief of the Plan and Budget Organization and spokesman for the Economic Council, gave a press conference yesterday (Saturday) in which he announced the above. He discussed the procedure for making installment sales of transferable shares belonging to the government, the organizations, and the government companies in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. He said installment sales will be done at the discretion of the minister in charge of the transferring organization. He said: Installment sales will be done only in cases where the buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the shares at one time. The spokesman for the Economic Council discussed the procedure for installment payment sales to general applicants and company workers and managers. He said: If general applicants pay 30, 40, or 50 percent of the cost of the transaction for the company, they may pay the remainder of the price over periods of 3, 3.5, and 4 years, respectively. He discussed the fact that the cost of an installment payment transaction will be the cost of a cash sale of the shares in addition to the banking system's profit on installment payment sales in the industrial sector. He added: To provide banking facilities for company workers and managers, if they so desire and if conditions are otherwise equal with other buyers, these people may pay 20 percent of the price of the transaction and pay the remainder of the value of the shares over a period of 4 years in the form of installment payments. Continuing, he discussed the fact that the base price of the sale of the shares must be approved by the minister in charge of the organization transferring the shares. He added: The public must be informed about the transfer of the shares in an advertisement to be placed three times in one week in at least two high-circulation domestic newspapers and, at the discretion of the organization making the transfer, in the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He said: If the organization making the transfer does not sell the shares within one year, the designation of a new base price will be the responsibility of the minister in charge. He said the minister in charge of the organization making the transfer will be responsible for determining the type of transfer, whether by auction, negotiation or sale on the stock market. He said: With regard to companies, which have been accepted on the stock market, priority will be given to sale on the stock market. Mr. Roghani-Zanjani discussed the procedure for determining the base price of shares of government companies that can be transferred. He said: The base price of profitable producing companies will be determined by dividing the company's average annual pretax net profit for the last three years by the rate of capital return, with consideration for the factors that affect the adjustment of profits. He added: If the company's capital has increased in the year of the transfer of the shares or the year prior to the transfer of the shares due to cash earnings, 100 percent of the increased capital will be added to the company's total value and the sums kept in the company for any reason from the profits of the year before the transfer will be added to the company's base price. The chief of the Plan and Budget Organization discussed the completed price of the development projects and the completed price for semicomplete or ready to operate projects . He said: If it has been more than one year since these projects went into operation, the Central Bank or experts will recalculate the completed price by adjusting the foreign exchange cost at the current foreign exchange price and adjusting the rial costs by the announced wholesale price indicator, and after approval by the company's general assembly, the difference obtained will be added to the base price of the shares. He emphasized that before transferring shares the organizations making the transfers are required to pay any debts incurred by drawing cash from the Treasury for development projects, or they must make an agreement with the Treasury concerning the method of repayment.
