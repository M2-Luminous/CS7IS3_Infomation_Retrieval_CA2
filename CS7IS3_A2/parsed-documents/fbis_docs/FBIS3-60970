It turns out that these are the same kind of people as us, with the same cares and worries. There is much more rumor than reliable information about the Alpha unit. The unknown is always more frightening. In August 1991 Alpha was supposed to storm the White House, but did not do so. The slogan -- "Hurrah for the Alpha Lieutenants" -- appeared on the Moskva hotel and other buildings. In October 1993 Alpha did take part in storming the Supreme Soviet, which was armed to the teeth, and without firing a single shot. The words -- "Alpha's coming" -- were enough to make the gunmen drop their weapons. So who are these super warriors? [Begin recording] [Correspondent Z. Gindeleyev] The Alpha anti-terrorist group: a unique military unit and the only one in the country whose profession is to stop acts of terror. The unit has dozens of successful operations under its belt, including the release of hostages from remand cells in Sukhumi, and from aircraft seized in Tbilisi, Sarapul, Ufa, and Tashkent. They disarmed the Serov gang in Yerevan and the (?Levshiyants) band of criminals. The recent successful operation to free the Rostov schoolboys was largely due to the professional skill and patience of Alpha members. The first interview with the commanding officer of Alpha in the entire history of the unit has been given to the Vesti program. [G. Zaytsev, Alpha commander; identified by caption] Analysis of the crime situation in the country, including the operation in Mineralnyye Vody, leads to this conclusion: We cannot expect the level of terrorism to fall. On the contrary, incidences of not only criminal but also political terror are on the rise and we must be ready for this. I think that an integrated anti-terrorism system should be formed and that it should be directed and coordinated from a single center. [Gindeleyev] Hero of the Soviet Union Maj-Gen Zaytsev, who has accounted for 14 terrorists, is worried about the safety of Russian citizens, although the future of Alpha itself is not clear during the current reform of the country's security agencies.
