However, they will continue to reflect to the central authorities the strong reactions of foreign businessmen. During an interview with MING PAO yesterday, Yuan said frankly that they had recently heard quite a lot of strong views about the value-added land tax from foreign businessmen. However, the state is listening to views from various quarters and will soon publish detailed rules on the implementation of the value-added land tax. Therefore, before the rules are published, the Guangdong authorities concerned will accurately reflect the views of foreign businessmen to the central authorities. He said that in the past, the local governments of some cities and counties in Guangdong Province had formulated their own regulations on levying value-added taxes on a trial basis. After the central authorities published regulations on levying a unified value-added tax, Guangdong of course will implement the regulations by the central authorities. However, he believes that the detailed rules on the implementation of the value-added land tax to be published by the central authorities will certainly have relatively great flexibility. He said that the purpose of levying the value-added land tax is to crack down on land speculation. However, if the first-hand land market is strictly controlled by the state and the management of the second-hand land market is strengthened, the practice of speculation can be curbed. At present, the fact that the practice of speculation has developed to a red-hot state is a problem whose origin lies in the lagging behind of the management of the second-hand market. For example, in some places, the work on large quantities of title deeds for houses is in arrears and this has provided loopholes of which speculators take advantage. Yuan also talked about the situation of approving land for development across Guangdong Province last year and this year. He said that this year, the amount of land to be used for various purposes in the whole province will be limited to 465,000 mu, of which land for real estate will total 116,000 mu, slightly less than the 136,000 mu of land for real estate last year. Last year, the revenue from sales of land throughout the province was more than 8.6 billion yuan and in the previous year it was 9.4 billion yuan. This year, the sales of land are expected to bring in about 9 billion yuan to the provincial government treasury. Yesterday, Yuan also gave a brief account of the situation of putting things in order in development zones across the province. During the peak period in 1993 there were as many as 315 development zones of various kinds across the provinces. After things have been put in order and rectified, only 53 development zones remain at present (approved by the State Council or the provincial government). Besides, 14 are being examined and verified. All the land in more than 200 development zones which do not have the necessary conditions has been taken back and the total amount of such land has reached 580,000 mu.
