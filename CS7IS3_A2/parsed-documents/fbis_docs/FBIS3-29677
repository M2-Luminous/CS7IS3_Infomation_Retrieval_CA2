The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Saturday it had set this year's rice output at 5.08 million tons (37.2 million sok), down 4.6 percent from 5.35 million tons in 1993, a bad crop year due to cool summer weather. Farmland was estimated to drop 21,000 hectares to 1.11 million hectares based on the past five-year average decrease, with each 300 pyong (990 square meters) producing 456 kilograms for this year's output quota. As a result, in view of the 1993 provisional record of 96.9 percent, the rice self-sufficiency rate is expected to be under 100 percent in 1994 (estimated at 89.1 percent) and 1995 (95.9 percent), but Korea will attain 100 percent self-sufficiency in edible rice by 2001 The ministry said it had revised this year's rice policy to put quality above quantity in the wake of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade agreement.
