"Not always, but more and more often" he can see "flourishing landscapes" there. The harmonization of the living conditions in east and west is making good progress. Economic growth in the former GDR increased by 7 percent last year, and a similarly high increase is expected for 1994, while in the old laender only 1 percent is expected. These favorable developments were primarily achieved by the people in the five eastern laender, Bohl said. Under completely new conditions, they have made decisive achievements. The atmosphere in talks with individual people is even often better than the assessment of the situation in general. Bohl described the many and various measures taken by the Federal Government that have promoted this process in the past few years: - The financial transfer to the new laender amounted to some 177 billion German marks [DM] (gross), while 1994 plans involve DM175 billion in gross transfer payments. - For the transport investment in the new laender DM13.8 billion were provided in 1992 and DM13.2 billion in 1993. For the further extension of federal highways DM4.2 billion will be spent this year alone. Until the year 2002 the Federal Government will invest some DM33 billion into the former German Reichsbahn railroads. - A total of 2.2 million new telephone lines have been installed since reunification, and 95 percent of all households should be connected by 1997. The investment volume of Telekom for this modernization amounts to DM60 billion, which makes it the third largest individual investor and secures more than 90,000 jobs in the new laender. - Every other new business that was set up in the new laender was promoted with public funds. Some 213,500 credits for the establishment of new businesses have been granted since 1990 involving a total investment sum of DM86 billion. Some 450,000 businesses now employ 3 million employees. The chancellory minister also sees a significant upswing in the sphere of housing construction. While in the first half year of 1993 some 27,500 apartments were licensed, it was as many as 47,500 in the second six-month period. The development of pensions was also positive. The monthly pension payments at the end of the GDR era were 450 marks, while now the average is DM1,406, or some 75 percent of Western levels.
