In its annual report covering the year just past, ISTAT did acknowledge that the recent launch of the 1994-96 plan for the environment, new laws on water supplies and the setting up of a national agency to deal with environmental protection, "steps in the right direction" but the findings of the survey suggest that the Italian population harbor large doubts about air pollution, drinking water, and dirty streets. According to 31 percent of Italians interviewed the air they breathe is increasingly unfit, with only 3.5 percent expressing satisfaction at the quality of the air where they live. The trend shows that those in the North are most afflicted by smog and that people are aware that motor vehicle exhaust fumes are the main culprits. Similarly, the poor quality of tap water and the shoddy service offered by water distribution networks were points that 38 percent expressed worries about, with many of those interviewed up and down the country choosing bottled water to drink rather than trusting their local supply. Sicily and Sardinia are the worst hit by irregular and undrinkable water supplies. Cleaner streets is one of the cries most heard from inhabitants of the bigger cities and from regions in the South, although at the same time, according to the survey, there is a general lack of "necessary awareness" about the problems of the rising levels of refuse in Italian streets. In fact only 27 percent of all interviewees referred to their streets as "too dirty." On a wider scale, other figures published by ISTAT show that last year was catastrophic for Italy's national forests, 1.5 percent (104.34 hectares) of which were destroyed by 11,932 reported forest fires. Italy's beaches do not escape scrutiny either with just over half (59.7 percent) of the nation's total coastline vaunting offshore waters in which swimming is allowed. People are advised to stay away from the seas elsewhere because of excessive levels of pollution or the lack of necessary analyses. However, in comparison with 1992, ISTAT stressed that this represents an actual rise of eight percent in the total quota of "swimmable" beaches. Some good news does emerge from the Institute's report regarding the numbers of environmental monitoring stations being developed throughout Italy that eventually will feed a nationwide network of research centers.
