The survey showed that most of the companies that were polled and that have already decided their recruiting plans for next spring intend to reduce their workforce, although most believe the economy will pick up by the end of the year. Of the 150 major companies nationwide polled, only 60, or about 40 percent, have already worked out recruitment plans for the year starting in April 1995, reflecting the lingering uncertainty over the economic outlook. Only four of the 60 firms are willing to boost the number of recruits for next spring, while 37 plan reductions and 19 will keep this fiscal year's level. The prudency about recruiting came despite a finding in the same survey that most of the companies polled think the economy has bottomed out or will hit bottom by the end of the year. Those which projected an economic recovery during the October- December quarter this year numbered 54, while another 22 firms answered that the economy has already hit bottom. The two groups and others which forecast a pickup by the year-end account for a dominant 77 percent of the 150 companies polled. The survey, taken in mid-April, showed that labor policies are particularly austere in such industrial sectors as construction, dogged by the after effects of the series of bribery scandals, high yen-hit automakers and electronics makers, and airlines suffering from dwindling earnings. For instance, major contractor Kajima Corp. plans to halve the number of recruits for next spring to 200, while Taisei Corp., also a leading builder, has decided on a 20 percent cut in its fast-track career staff. Leading exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. cited the dismal business climate and the murky economic outlook as reasons for recruits-cutting programs. Japan Air System plans to employ no new recruits next fiscal year, while Japan Airlines also will hire only pilots. Steelmakers like Kobe Steel Ltd. and Nippon Steel Corp., which are in the midst of drastic labor reductions, and foodstuff and pharmaceutical makers, including Ajinomoto Co. and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., also have decided to slim labor. In contrast, Japan's telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and video game behemoth Nintendo Co. are among those willing to increase the labor force, especially for their promising new businesses such as multimedia. The KYODO survey also found that an increasing number of companies are shifting to more flexible employment and see no need to cling to a longstanding Japanese corporate custom to collectively recruit in spring. In a question about future employment policies, two thirds of the 129 companies which came up with answers said they will continue spring-time recruitment but many of the others said they are studying employing more experienced workers and recruiting not only in the spring but in other times of the year. The latter group includes consumer electronics giant Sony Corp., known for its maverick labor policies, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Jusco Co., a leading supermarket operator.
