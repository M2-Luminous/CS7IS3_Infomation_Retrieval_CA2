"Logically, interested parties manipulated the masses to do this. If you study psychology you will see that people can easily be prompted to do such things. Honestly, it is nothing more than a reflection of the democracy achieved in this country," he added. Discua Elvir also denied that this is an attitude shared by Hondurans in general. "The population does not just consist of people in Tegucigalpa. There are 5 million inhabitants in this country, and there were only approximately 15,000 people at the stadium. They do not represent the entire country." He said that what has most affected the institution's image are the mistakes committed by the military in the past. "As responsible persons, we must face the challenge. We must never look back, and we must continue on." Discua Elvir explained that in Honduras "we must look for what is best. A great future is envisioned for the country. Dr. Reina was very clear in his inaugural speech when establishing the rules of the game, so let us hope that the people support him." He stressed that people must pay attention to the last part of the president's speech, when he said that "united people can solve their problems." The chief of the Armed Forces expressed that he does not feel like people showed disrespect for him. "I think it was a very well organized demonstration. This is not the first time this kind of action has taken place." Discua Elvir regretted this kind of demonstration, however. He added that it divides the Honduran people because "the members of the institution are part of society; they have children and other relatives; no matter what, we are part of the Honduran family." Consequently, he said that "if we begin this government with division in the family, I think we will not go anywhere." Discua Elvir asserted that he hopes the people do not leave President Reina alone and that in the next few days he can consolidate part of what he has said. Concerning the promise made by Reina during his campaign on the application of a military education service, Discua Elvir revealed that the Armed Forces are "absolutely ready. We have reviewed our system and determined that it is too costly. It would be more suited for a developed country." He explained that countries such as Mexico and South American nations do not use a system like this for youngsters to fulfill this citizens' duty. However, he added that Honduras cannot be the first Latin American country to implement such a system. "As we are a very cultured and educated people, it is going to turn out alright," he said in a sarcastic tone. Regarding the possibility of eliminating the position he holds, Discua Elvir remarked that he has not heard such a thing. Nonetheless, he said that in other countries information is being sought, while "here it is being taken away." [sentence as published] "I have no problem with that," he continued. He stated that if the post of chief of the Armed Forces is eliminated, the defense minister would have to assume his post. He noted he has some ideas on the police and the country's defense that he will present to President Reina. "We are advancing in keeping with Latin America's political reality. Let us hope it all turns out alright and Hondurans can reconcile with themselves, which is so much needed." Gen. Discua Elvir concluded that many new reforms could be implemented during the present presidential period.
