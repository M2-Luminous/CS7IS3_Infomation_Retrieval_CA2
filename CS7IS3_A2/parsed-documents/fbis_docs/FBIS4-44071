Speaking after the two-day summit ended here, he said the 12-member European Union would seek more funding for this purpose from other industrialized countries at the Group of Seven summit in Naples, Italy, next month. The sum pledged by the EU includes a loan of ECU400 million and a gift of ECU100 million. The summiteers agreed during the two-day meeting on the necessity of closing down Ukraine's dangerous Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they would press for an agreement on the financing of the shutdown at the G7 summit. It is a "very important area," Mitterrand said, adding that the EU plan for shutting down Chernobyl included "overall reform of the energy sector" in the former Soviet republic of the Ukraine. Before the EU summit, France and Germany sent a joint letter to their partners stressing the urgency of a quick and total shutdown of the entire Chernobyl complex, where the April 1986 nuclear disaster was caused by an explosion in one of its reactors.
