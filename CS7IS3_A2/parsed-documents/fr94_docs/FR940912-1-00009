FR940912-1-00009 FR940912-1-00003 3. Multiple Burst: (Component H). In-flight data-gathering projects have shown bursts of multiple, low amplitude, fast rates of rise, short duration pulses accompanying the airplane lightning strike process. While insufficient energy exists in these pulses to cause physical damage, it is possible that transients resulting from this environment may cause upset to some digital processing systems. The representation of this interference environment is a repetition of short duration, low amplitude, high peak rate of rise, double exponential pulses that represent the multiple bursts of current pulses observed in these flight data gathering projects. This component is intended for an analytical (or test) assessment of functional upset of the system. Again, it is necessary that this component be translated into an internal environmental threat in order to be used. This ``Multiple Burst'' consists of repetitive Component H waveforms in 3 sets of 20 pulses each. The minimum time between individual Component H pulses within a burst is 50 microseconds, the maximum is 1,000 microseconds. The 3 bursts are distributed according to the following constraints: (1) the minimum period between bursts is 30ms, and (2) the maximum period between bursts is 300ms. The individual ``Multiple Burst'' Component H waveform is defined below. The following current waveforms constitute the ``Severe Strike'' (Component A), ``Restrike'' (Component D), ``Multiple Stroke'' (1/2 Component D), and the ``Multiple Burst'' (Component H). These components are defined by the following double exponential equation: i(t)=I o (e &hyph;at &hyph;e &hyph;bt ). where: t=time in seconds, i=current in amperes, and
