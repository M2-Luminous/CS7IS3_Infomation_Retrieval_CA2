President Milosevic expressed his support for the start-up of the peace negotiations between Knin and Zagreb, expressing his conviction that the peace talks were the only correct way of resolving the Yugoslav crisis and that their success would, without doubt, be a defeat for those in favor of war. The Serbian president at the same time noted the danger of extremists and extremism, which are damaging the interests of the Serb people, and in particular he pointed to the danger of the activities of some members of the Serbian Radical Party and other irresponsible groups and individuals in the RSK. Their destructive behavior in the RSK Assembly clearly shows that the interests of Krajina are their least concern. The danger of extremists supplementing their moral and political defeat in Serbia by running amok in Krajina is a serious threat to the interests of Krajina. Hence, it is vital that these forces are marginalized and placed under the control of the Serb authorities in Krajina as soon as possible and that individuals who have contravened the law and are up to their necks in crime are brought to book as soon as possible. The Serb nation, which is proud of its freedom-loving past, should not allow extremists and criminals to tarnish its reputation, President Milosevic stressed. Stressing that the normalization of Serb-Croat relations as a whole is of crucial influence for peace and stability in the region, the Serbian president wished the new leadership of the RSK success in its work and success in the realization of the cease-fire agreement between the Croatian army and the RSK army. It was announced that Milan Martic and Borisav Mikelic expressed their agreement both as regards the policy of resolving disputes by peaceful means and as regards the danger of extremism, and they stressed their efforts to strengthen the legal institutions and legality. Mirko Marjanovic, prime minister of the Republic of Serbia, also took part in the talks.
