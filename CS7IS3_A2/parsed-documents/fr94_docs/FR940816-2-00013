ACTION: Issuance of Modification 3 to Permit 825 held by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (P513). On September 15, 1993 notice was published (58 FR 48354) that an application had been filed by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission for a modification to Permit 825 to take listed Snake River chinook salmon as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). Notice is hereby given that on August 9, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 3 to Permit Number 825 (P513) to take listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon subject to certain conditions set forth therein. The modification increases the take numbers for a cryopreservation study, but restricts the take to post-spawned adult male fish. Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices, by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, NOAA, 911 North East 11th Ave., Room 620, Portland, OR 97232 (503-230-5400).
