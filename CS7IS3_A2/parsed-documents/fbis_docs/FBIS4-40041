This time our parliament demonstrated unprecedented efficiency -- only three days were required to consider a broad range of questions and to adopt a number of very important draft laws. This, of course, does not mean that all documents were passed with a "hurrah." As before, differences were observed in the positions of the people's representatives, although this time they spoke, in the main, not for parliamentary factions, but for themselves personally. The most eloquent discussion revolved around two draft laws: The question in the first concerned giving the president of our republic additional powers in connection with the socioeconomic situation that has developed, and in the second -- extending the law of the Tatarstan Republic "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime" to 1 January 1995. As could be expected, not all of the deputies perceived with optimism the new formulation that was heard the day before in the speech of the president of the Tatarstan Republic. But he, in particular, noted that it was necessary for the government to develop a state program of economic and social progress for the Tatarstan Republic by October of this year. Some of the representatives of the deputy corps were troubled by the fact that the title of the future document makes no mention about the crisis. But the "additional powers" for leaders of the republic were at times classified as an encroachment on the age-old rights of parliamentarians. However, Chairman of the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet Farid Mukhametshin gave the following explanation: Legislative guarantees of reforms are needed quickly, but the Supreme Soviet, not working on a professional basis, is not yet in a condition to react quickly to changes in the socioeconomic situation. Debates regarding "the additional powers" were continued almost for the entire next day of the 20th Special Session of the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet. Two drafts of the future law were brought to the attention of the deputies: One was from the Cabinet of Ministers, and the other -- from a group of members of the Supreme Soviet. The first document stated that "before the adoption of appropriate laws that regulate budget-financial economic, social, and administrative spheres of the Tatarstan Republic, grant the president of the Tatarstan Republic the right to publish edicts on the enumerated questions." And the second -- "grant the president of the Tatarstan Republic the right to publish edicts that regulate the legal relations in the social and economic spheres of the Tatarstan Republic." But here the period of validity of the law was established at up to 1 January 1995. The views of the speakers on this question differed. Even the members of the "Sovereignty of the People" faction did not display their customary unanimity. Thus, Ildus Sultanov declared that this document in any wording will violate the principles of the constitutional system. But Zinnur Latypov, in his turn, thinks that, under the conditions that have developed, it is necessary to adopt edicts, but that it is desirable at the same time to have the active participation of expert advice. In the opinion of Yuriy Reshetov, the Treaty Between Russia and Tatarstan changed the political situation in many ways, but it is hardly likely that the Supreme Soviet in its present composition is capable of publishing appropriate laws. After weighing all of the pros and cons, the people's deputies, nevertheless, adopted a variant with additions that was proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers. In order to make changes to the law of the Tatarstan Republic "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime," whose period of validity expires within three weeks, a roll call vote was necessary. But the people's deputies first familiarized themselves with an exhibit of special means purchased for hard currency for militia employees (incidentally, the armored personnel carriers in photos in yesterday's IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA are part of this exhibit) and listened to information of Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Kirilov and Minister of Internal Affairs Iskander Galimov. It is now known from competent sources that crime has been reduced since the beginning of this year in the republic as a whole, the number of grave crimes has dropped, and the number of violent attacks, robberies, and thefts of state and personal property has fallen.... The cited figures, perhaps, are the most substantial argument in favor of extending the action of the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime." What is more, new "varieties" of crimes have appeared -- "showdowns" among groups, the apartment racket, and contract murders.... The authors of 400 telegrams that were addressed to the Supreme Soviet reminded the parliamentarians of the need to extend the action of the law. Of course, it is good when "our militia protects us," displaying a higher degree of vigilance than before. And, nevertheless, it was impossible not to lend an ear to the alternative speeches of a number of deputies who spoke convincingly about the fact that the constitutional rights of citizens have been violated more than once. For example, more than 2,500 persons were detained for 30 days, but criminal charges were brought against barely half of them. But the rest "learned" from their bitter experience with what "extraordinary measures" are fraught. In addition, the law enforcement organs will have to be content with a small "catch": Until the law "On Corruption" is passed, the big "fish" feels safe. Despite these and other costs, the majority of the deputies came to the conclusion that the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime" is still necessary; and, therefore, the term of its validity was extended to next year. The three days of work by the parliamentarians did not present any kinds of surprises. All stayed with their interests and in their positions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the government. Rumors about impending replacements in the government were not confirmed. The matter was restricted only to unimportant caustic deputy remarks aimed at the executive branch. Prime Minister Mukhamat Sabirov responded to one of these "attacks" with the repartee: "If we had a professional parliament, it would not be necessary to undertake any kind of extraordinary measures."
