Assessing the report to journalists today, President Denktas pointed out that the report was drawn up unilaterally, based on threats. He added: The UN is trying to make its scenarios accepted by disregarding the feelings of the Turkish Cypriots and through artificial answers to problems. Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures were sacrificed when the UN Secretariat General reached an understanding with the Greek Cypriots and turned the nondocument into a proposal. It is unacceptable, Denktas stressed, that the Turkish Cypriot side should be easily blamed in the report when it displayed so much goodwill. Denktas stated that the report was announced before there was time to properly assess his meeting with Feissel. He said: The report hides several truths by claiming that Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis is ready to implement the confidence-building measures. The president recalled that Kliridhis accepted the confidence-building measures only for the purpose of tactics. Denktas also criticized Butrus-Ghali for having said in the report that he doubts if an agreement can be reached even if the changes demanded by the Turkish Cypriot side are made. Denktas added: This shows how the honorable secretary general views the Turkish Cypriot community and what kind of feelings there are between him and the Turkish Cypriot leadership. Denktas stressed that Butrus-Ghali does not have the right to say such a thing. He added: Had they included the changes they promised us -- for the good of our people, as they said -- in the 21 March document, and had we rejected that, then he would have the right to conclude what he concluded. The president said it is very regrettable that Butrus-Ghali is acting with prejudice. Denktas recalled the remarks in the report which say: At the end of one month of efforts to reach an agreement, we have lost hope from the Turkish Cypriot leader. Denktas pointed out that during that month of talks, efforts were made to ensure that the promises made to the Turkish Cypriots were fulfilled. Commenting on the coercive measures mentioned in the report, Denktas said: They have been using coercive measures against us in the form of embargoes for the past 30 years. Undoubtedly, they can do worse things. People who defend their rights cannot be defeated by coercive measures. If the UN does that, it will be the greatest shame for the UN Security Council. Denktas stressed that coercive measures would unite the Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish nation. This must be well thought of, he said. On Butrus-Ghali's contention that the Turkish Cypriot side lacks political will, Denktas said: We have political will. This political will will be used in line with the 30-year development of Cyprus realities. It is our political will that makes us resist the Greek Cypriot Administration which has been recognized as the legitimate government of Cyprus for the past 30 years. We have the steel will to sign any balanced agreement that is based on the sovereignty of two equal partners, and that does not weaken Turkey's guarantees. Denktas pointed out that the report says that the Turkish Cypriots had bitter experiences before 1974, and that the current efforts aim to prevent the recurrence of such experiences. Denktas said: It is impossible to see from New York what can affect the basic security and political stand of the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas said Butrus-Ghali claims in his report that Denktas' stand will lead to grave results as far as the prosperity of the Turkish Cypriots are concerned. Denktas said: All this depends on the assessment of the Turkish Cypriots. The main thing is our political equality and future, Turkey's guarantees. We will continue to reject anything that casts a shadow over these. Denktas pointed out that the two sides must come together to diagnose realistically and assess why the problem has remained unresolved for the past 30 years. The only reason why the problem has remained unresolved, he stressed, is because the guilty party has been accepted as the legitimate government of Cyprus. Denktas denied the allegation that the Turkish Cypriot side ignores international requests. He stated that the Turkish Cypriots themselves complain that the international community ignores their rights. He said: If we are to be punished because we do not accept their pressures, the Turkish Cypriots can easily face this punishment. The president pointed out that the report mentions an alternative to the talks on confidence-building measures -- talks on the 1992 maps and set of ideas. Denktas said: On behalf of all my people, I say a strong no to that, never. That package is dead. Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures will not be complete unless the rights promised to the Turkish Cypriots are given to them. On the alternative of an international conference, Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriots would participate in such a conference only as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. We will never participate in such a conference unless our status is recognized. Also, we will reject any decision to be reached at a conference where we are not represented.
