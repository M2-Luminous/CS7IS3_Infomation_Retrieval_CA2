FBIS4-58997 "drnes090_m_94003" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 10 May 1994 JORDAN U.S. Acceptance of Proposal Reported U.S. Acceptance of Proposal Reported JN1005095294 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 10 May 94 pp 1, 10 JN1005095294 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] [Text] Amman--The United States has officially informed Jordan of its acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace the sea-inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound shipping with land-based verifications of cargo by the independent British company Lloyds Register, informed sources said Monday. The sources said the U.S. decision was communicated to the Kingdom Sunday in a letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. American Embassy sources declined comment when asked about the letter. The sources said the U.S. decision would remove the obstacle to Jordan's resumption of its active role in the Arab-Israeli peace process and is a step towards restoring Jordanian-U.S. "normal and friendly relations." The sources, which requested anonymity, said the siege on al-'Aqabah would be lifted after completing work on what they described as minor technicalities. That would be soon, they said. They said the "fine-tuning" which Mr. Christopher referred to when he announced the acceptance of the Jordanian proposal in London on April 25 was almost over. Mr. Christopher said at a joint press conference with His Majesty King Husayn in London that the U.S. had accepted the Jordanian proposal to have Lloyds Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo once it is unloaded in the port instead of the sea-inspections which the Kingdom says had caused enormous losses to its economy. The American decision came a few days after France announced it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound shipping while enforcing the sanctions against Iraq. Informed sources said that Canada had rejected an American offer to replace the French in light of Jordan's provision of an alternative to the sea-inspection. The Lower House of Parliament Monday praised what it called the "belated" but "positive" French decision, expressing hope that other countries would follow suit, end the siege on the Red Sea port and compensate the Kingdom for the losses it has incurred from it. "The (French decision) reflect's France's awareness of the correctness of Jordan's policies and the fairness of its demands." Al-'Aqabah Deputy Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said the U.S. decision to end the siege on al-'Aqabah is "a victory for the justness of the Jordanian demand over the logic of power which was exercised over it." Mr. al-Kabariti said the lifting of the siege should be followed by more steps to improve the economic situation in the country because "a stable, moderate and strong Jordan will strengthen the cause of stability in the whole region." Mr. al-Kabariti called on the United States to take concrete steps towards realising President Bill Clinton's promise to help write off some of Jordan's foreign debts, hoping the decision to end the sanctions would constitute a first step towards addressing the economic woes of the Kingdom, which, he said, has been in the forefront of forces for moderation in the region.
