Well, strange or not, truth can certainly be a gripping addition to an otherwise fictional tale, as a group of Beijing short story writers have recently demonstrated. Using a style called "new experience fiction," the writers set their fictional narrators firmly in the maelstrom of real life. Real policemen, real doctors, even real millionaires provide the nitty-gritty details that form the springboard from which the narrator leaps into the world of the imagination. The ensuring tale is a form of contemporary history--with a spin. With support from a number of literary magazines in Beijing, the first batch of "new experience" works has already been published. The pioneer is Chen Jiangong, a Beijing-based writer. His first nouvelle [word as published throughout] in the style is "With a Criminal Record," published last September in the Chinese language literary bi-monthly, Chinese Writers. The nouvelle reveals what the first-person narrator sees, hears, and feels about the work of a policeman in charge of neighbourhood security. Every bit of the detail is real, Chen claims. The story records what the policeman says and does, what happens to the policeman and the people around him and, above all, what thoughts these events trigger in the writer himself. "New experience fiction' should, first of all, tell the personal experience of the narrator--who is not just a bystander, but also a participant in events," Chen Jiangong explains. "In this way, the story links the material world with the mental world, where fiction or non-fiction can take place with cause and effect, or without cause and effect." He believes that the personal accounts, which bear some traits of news-feature style, may be more readable than conventional fiction. "New experience" writers may spend exhausting weeks of research preparing for a story. For example, Bi Shumin, before writing her nouvelle "Appointment with Death," visited many hospitals and crematoriums, jotting down volumes of notes, and even lay down in hospital beds where sick patients had been. "Tears ran down my cheeks many times when I did interviews at a hospice in Beijing," she recalls. "I am not a woman who always sheds tears, but I was so saddened there that I seemed to be immersed in salt water." However, when she began to write, "I became very detached," she says. And she learn from the experience. "It was death that gave me courage and joy, and taught me to treasure life and love the elderly." She created a story that linked scattered scenes in the minds-eye of her fictional narrator. "Can writers write like this only after having personal experience?" some one asked Bi. She replied: This is the way I write this kind of fiction. I simply hammer into pieces the true-life stories I have collected and grind and mash them together with my own ideas and emotions to form a whole." Xu Moqing, another writer now living in Beijing, has also ventured into "new experience" fiction. His most recent nouvelle is called "How Much Time Does It Take to Become Rich." Xu tries to answer the question posed by his books's title by setting himself up as narrator against Ke Zijiang, a millionaire in Fujian Province. In this way, he says, "I can dissect myself so as to see the world more clearly, as if using an X-ray." As a result, instead of "playing god" as the narrator does in conventional fiction, the "new experience" fiction drives the narrator into the mundane world and makes him or her see his or her own weakness," Xu said. "The narrator joins the men-in-the-street in their joys and sorrows." "New experience" fiction has aroused keen interest among literary critics and writers. Critic Xing An says that a style similar to "new experience" already exists, for example, Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood," which the author describes as "non-fiction". Because "new experience" fiction stresses the need for the writers to involve themselves in the real world, it depicts a complicated and broad social arena that readers may understand more easily, Xing says. "New experience' fiction is not only a literary creation," he says. "It also is the writer's involvement in making contemporary history." Writer Mu Guozheng says that "the word used most in tens of thousands of literary critiques since the founding of New China is 'death'." Throughout New China's various social periods, from the Great Leap Forward Movement (1959) to the "cultural revolution" (1966-76), critics invariably prompted literary works that had "death." However, as time passed, novels once widely-acclaimed as having "deep social implication" are now almost forgotten, Mu says. Over the past decade, there have also been works of "depth," but many--borrowing ideas and philosophy from the West--are very difficult to understand. After going through so many twists and turns over the years, Mu says he believes that "new experience" fiction may attract more readers to Chinese literature because it departs from the pursuit of "depth" and tries instead to give vivid portrayals of the lives of common people. Whatever the critics' comments, "new experience" fiction is sure to stay and grow for a while, but it will take time to see whether it will catch on with the public.
