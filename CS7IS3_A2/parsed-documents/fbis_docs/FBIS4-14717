As already reported, he rushed in the Georgian Parliament building with a group of armed policemen, for which fact he found himself later in "off-side" position. Zeikidze announced that, instead of thirty, he could have brought the whole three thousand his supporters into the parliament on the day of intrusion, who, as he claimed, back up Eduard Shevardnadze. "I was removed by the opposition who made Shevardnadze face a deadlock", said the former commander of city police, adding that he will yet utter a sensation. Zeikidze informed he intends to establish his own party and engage the active political life.
