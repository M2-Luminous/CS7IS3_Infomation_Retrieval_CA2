All of them failed to take measures to prevent the fires in the Ashkhabadskiy and Gyaurskiy rayons, which have done considerable damage to the environment. The blaze started on 5 June and mainly engulfed the border zone. A separate decree has dismissed Nurmukhamed Ashirov, minister for the use and protection of the natural environment, and his deputy for the same reason. The money will be transmitted to a special account to be opened by the Republic president's staff with the AKB "Turkmenistan" bank. In the future all fines for ecological crimes in the Republic will come to this account.
