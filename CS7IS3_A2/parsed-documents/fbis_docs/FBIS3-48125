"We're looking at the situation in Japan closely," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said. "Obviously it's a fluid situation in which no one is quite sure what the outcome will be." Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy and the White House point man coordinating the "framework" trade negotiations was more brunt. The upper house's rejection of Hosokawa's initiative to overhaul the Japanese electoral system is a "significant setback" for the Japanese Government, cutter said in an interview on CNBC cable television. Hosokawa's political troubles came as senior officials from the two countries were gearing up for a final round of trade talks ahead of a summit meeting in Washington with President Bill Clinton on February 11. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky said the trade talks would proceed as scheduled. Like Kantor, she declined to comment on whether Hosokawa's political troubles would cloud prospects of the summit meeting. Some U.S. political analysts were less circumspect. "The political situation in Japan has become very dicey," said Douglas Paal, former special assistant for Asian affairs on the National Security Council. Paal told a private forum on U.S.-Japan trade relations that he believes the political upheavals in Tokyo will have "a big impact" on the Hosokawa-Clinton summit. In his television interview, Cutter said Clinton remains "extremely supportive" of Hosokawa's reform efforts. Senior U.S. Administration officials have said Washington had hoped Hosokawa would shift his focus to reviving the stalled Japanese economy once the political reform issue was out of the way. Cutter said Friday that Clinton still expects the Japanese Government to introduce a stimulus package, noting that the issues of political reform and economic stimulus are "quite distinct." U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in Tokyo on Sunday for talks with Hosokawa and Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. Tokyo and Washington are currently engaged in wide-ranging trade talks through which Washington hopes to secure a Japanese commitment to adopt specific measures to reduce its vast trade surplus and open up specific market sectors of particular interest to U.S. businesses. The Clinton administration has repeatedly said the size of Japan's trade surplus is "politically untenable." Clinton himself reinforced his determination to cut the trade gap with Japan, saying on a television talk show Thursday that Japan is one of the "biggest problems" for U.S. trade.
