At a press conference held here this afternoon, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai issued [a] statement by his ministry saying the decision meets the approval of the American and Vietnamese people, and that of many other countries as well. U.S. President Bill Clinton on Thursday [3 February] declared the embargo on Vietnam at an end, and proposed the mutual establishment of liaison offices in the two countries. Le Mai said that improvement in U.S.-Vietnamese relations would make a significant contribution to peace, friendship, and cooperation among nations. The Vietnamese Government reaffirms its policy of attaching importance to relations with the United States and expresses the wish for normal relations between the two countries, he continued. Officials of the two countries will meet immediately to discuss the details of setting up liaison offices. Vietnam sees this development as a transitional step towards full diplomatic relations between the two countries, he added. Le Mai also reiterated Vietnam's policy of regarding the question of Americans missing in action in the war as a humanitarian concern, and not linked to political issues. In consonance with their humane tradition and policy, the Government and people of Vietnam have been, and will be cooperating in a constructive spirit with the American Government and people to solve this issue to the fullest possible extent, he stressed. The vice minister said that Vietnam is willing to become a friend of the international community and will work for the sake of peace, stability and development in Southeast Asia and the world. Le Mai said it will be a long and difficult process between lifting the embargo and normalizing relations, and it is up to the extent of sincerity shown by both sides to decide whether there will be obstacles in this process. He expressed the wish that the United States will look upon Vietnam as a friend, just as Vietnam looks at the United States as its friend. John Cray, head of the U.S. MIA office in Hanoi, today also told reporters that the lifting of embargo will help strengthen cooperation between the two countries in solving the MIA issue.
