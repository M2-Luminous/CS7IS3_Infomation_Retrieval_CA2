We appreciate the good intentions that prompted all these brothers and friends to take their initiatives, and value highly all the efforts they exerted in the past to end the sharp crisis fabricated by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the secessionist clique in the Socialist Party. We also want to remind them about how far the political leadership has gone in the past months to respond positively to these initiatives and good offices, and to remind them of the tolerance and patience it displayed and the concessions it made, even at the level of sacrificing certain election gains, hoping that the Socialist Party leadership would reconsider its position and abandon its intransigent positions. It also hoped the Socialist Party leadership would abandon its insistence on continuing the crisis and not allow its arrogance and extortionist attempts to reach the extent of plunging into defiance and rebellion and entrench a de facto division. However, al-Bid and other members of the secessionist clique in the Socialist Party did not stop at that point. First, they started to kindle the fire of sedition among the ranks of our one Yemeni people. When they discovered that they failed in this attempt, they moved to incite fighting among the ranks of the Armed Forces by using some of the hardline military commanders who are members of the Socialist Party itself and who are involved with them in the scheme of secession and insurgency. The sequence of the conspiracy against unity and constitutional legitimacy and the attempt to drive the homeland into the furnace of fratricide continued. The first episode was the futile attack against the al-'Amaliqah Forces in the Abyan area the day after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in Amman on 10 Ramadan, corresponding to 20 February, and the start of fighting in (?Harf Sufyan) and Shabwah. That series reached its climax in the 'Imran camp, where the 3d Armored Brigade attacked the 1st Brigade, which was stationed alongside the 3d Brigade in the same camp. The result of that painful and bloody fighting was tragic by all standards and caused the hearts of all honorable people in Yemen to bleed. Large number of soldiers from the two brigades were either killed or wounded and our Armed Forces lost scores of tanks and equipment, as well as many valiant men. Leader President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had wished that this tragic incident and major loss would be the last of the tragedies and calamities at this difficult and serious stage in the history of our great people. Instead, the insurgent secessionist gang controlling the Socialist Party did not learn from this very costly lesson. It embarked on an all-out war in a flagrant defiance of all requirements of constitutional legitimacy and in a painful and flagrant insurrection that runs counter to all values and traditions. This started by ordering the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar to mobilize and deploy its tanks outside its camp and inside the city without any justification, and to start an attack against the Republican Guard battalion stationed at a distance from it. Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was distressed by the escalating situation. In a serious and sincere attempt to contain that serious development, which started at 2010 on Wednesday 4 May, he issued his decisive and prompt orders to immediately cease fire. He also ordered the commander of the Republican Guard battalion not to respond to fire from the Ba Suhayb Brigade, even unilaterally, regardless of how long the Ba Suhayb Brigade continued to open fire. Indeed, the Republican Guard battalion ceased fire upon the orders of the brother president while the Ba Suhayb Brigade continued to fire its bombs and rockets in all directions, even in the direction of the houses of defenseless families. Less than an hour later, the guns and tanks of insurgency and secession in Aden started fierce attacks against the Central Security soldiers, who only had automatic machine guns as weapons. Meanwhile, military elements from the gang of insurgency and secession stationed in al-'Anad, Lahij Governorate, started a fierce and ceaseless attack against the 2d Brigade, which is stationed in (?Rassal). With these escalating, serious developments, the political leadership found itself facing a flagrant mutiny, a clear military coup d'etat attempt, and a state of a comprehensive aggression. It had to confront that handful of conspirators and mutineers after things reached a climax. The people, with all their honorable factions and national forces, particularly their valiant Armed Forces which abides by the constitutional legitimacy, are confronting the mutineers who deviated from the national and popular consensus. The political leadership is assuming its responsibilities and powers to protect law and order, unity, and democracy in all parts of the one and united Yemeni homeland. In the light of what we mentioned before, it is very clear that what is going on in Yemen is, beyond any doubt, not a civil war or a struggle between two powers or the south and north, but an operation carried out by a rebellious outlaw group that refuses to come under the canopy of constitutional legitimacy and seeks to fragment the homeland and unity, abort unity and democracy, and return to the time of division and authoritarian role and the time of pre-22 May 1990. This is a battle we have no choice but to fight. It was dictated on us by those who took terrorism and violence as a profession and who have exercised suppression, plunder, and the violation of all human rights throughout their long criminal history, and those who were intoxicated by devious Communist ideology. It must be clear that any solution that returns the homeland to the time of fragmentation and authoritarian role and the single party system is out of question. All fraternal states must realize that the matter is not a struggle between parties over power, but a struggle between the entire people and the elements of insurgency and division who violate law and order. There is a type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle thee and he calls God to witness about what is in his heart, yet is he the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic verse]
