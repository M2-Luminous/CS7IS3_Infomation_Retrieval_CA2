Yang Chuantang, Standing Committee member of the regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the regional government, made a closing speech. He urged cadres across Tibet to, in line with the tasks and objective set by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Regional Party Committee and by the current conference, work conscientiously with one heart and one mind to push the regional economic structural reform and development to a new height. Gyamco, executive vice chairman of the regional government, chaired the conference. Attending the conference's closing were regional leaders Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Buqiong, Puqung, Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, Pudoje, Gong Daxi, Baima Duoji, Gying Puncog Cedain, Zeren Sangzhu, Yang Song, Ciren Zhuoga, Luosang Dunzhu, Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog, Cedain Zhoima, and Zhou Qishun; as well as Yang Youcai, chief procurator of the regional people's procuratorate. The conference transmitted and studied the guidelines of the national economic work conference and conferences of special trades convened by the relevant state departments, analyzed the current economic situation, mapped out arrangements for the regional economic structural reform and economic work in this year, and discussed and revised a number of major reform measures. During the conference, its participants held animated discussions on the conference documents, focused on the theme of reform, development, and stability; and offered many constructive suggestions and opinions. Comrade Yang Chuantang said: Through study and discussion over the past few days, conferees have deepened their understanding of the necessity of accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure, increased their sense of responsibility and urgency toward expediting reforms and promoting economic growth, clarified the guiding principles and tasks of this year's economic work and the basic ideology for reform, and strengthened their confidence in successfully carrying out the tasks. They agree that the conference, which has witnessed in-depth study of issues centering around a clear-cut theme, reveals a new outlook of reform and opening up, a new momentum of hard work, and a prevailing mood of concentrating all resources on economic construction. Discussing the conference guidelines, Yang Chuantang pointed out: It is necessary to, first, study; second, transmit; and third, organize the implementation of the guidelines effectively. Comrade Yang Chuantang said: The theory and practice of China's socialist construction and development have testified that reform is the propelling force for economic expansion and the only way for liberating productive forces and opening up a new situation in the work of all fields. The rapid growth of the regional economy over the past more than a decade has been achieved mainly through reform. To continue our advance and effect a new leap in the future, we should continue reforms. At present, we are facing an excellent opportunity of accelerating the development as well as the pace of reform. This is because, first of all, through the 15-year practice of reform, we have accumulated rich experiences and promoted reform from single to comprehensive projects. Second, Deng Xiaoping's talks during his southern tour and the 14th CPC National Congress have determined the establishment of a socialist market economic structure as the objective of reform. Third, the nation and the region have increased their overall economic strength and laid more solid material foundations. Fourth, the broad masses of people have greater tolerance and sense of urgency for reform, while party committees and governments at all levels are more capable of grasping the tasks of reform. Fifth -- and most important of all -- we have the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our guide and the strong and effective leadership of the party Central Committee. We must not miss the opportunity. Therefore, to strengthen the intensity of reform and quicken the pace of reform is an inevitable trend of history. He said: As far as the question of reform is concerned, whoever takes a firm grip and makes an early start will achieve faster growth; and whoever makes a slow start will lag behind and be placed in a passive situation. Without making reform, or making slow-paced reform, we will retreat. In a sense, the rate of economic growth depends on the range and intensity of reform. Yang Chuantang called on leaders at all levels to raise their understanding of the importance and urgency of reform, guide the overall situation through reforms, work relentlessly and innovatively in carrying out this year's reform measures, and promote economic development through reforms, thereby opening up a new situation in all fields of endeavor in Tibet. As far as this question is concerned, it is necessary to achieve unity in not only thinking and understanding, but also in action. Meanwhile, leaders at all levels should step up study and practice, constantly studying new circumstances and solving new problems. They should, in the light of the realities of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, diligently study the basic tenents of Marxism and the important theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; the party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies; knowledge of the market economy and modern management and science; and knowledge in general so they can become experts in developing a socialist market economy. In the course of study, they should be bold in exploration and practice. As reform is a penetrating and complex evolution, temporary differences in thinking and understanding are only natural. However, once a reform measure is adopted, it is necessary to organize its implementation. When in doubt on an issue, it is necessary to apply the criterion of "conducive to three causes," avoid squabbling, explore further, and be bold in practice so as to unify understanding and emancipate the mind through the practice of reform. Moreover, it is also necessary to discover and use advanced models as pacesetters, as well as to identity and help typical cases of lagging behind in reform, thereby promoting reform as a whole through grasping both ends to bring along the intermediate zone. Yang Chuantang emphasized: The key to achieving, or more effectively achieving our established goal, lies in concrete action. Upon returning to their work units, conferees should translate the conference guidelines into concrete action in every aspect of work and ensure effective implementation of each and every policy measure. They should vie with each other in striving to achieve fruitful results in the course of implementation. It is necessary to strictly enforce a responsibility system, and clearly define tasks and requirements, as well as reward and penalty. While implementing various tasks, it is imperative to improve the style of work, and encourage the pragmatic spirit of more solid work and less empty talk. To this end, leading cadres at all levels should guard against and overcome piles of documents and countless meetings, the formalism of issuing general calls while lacking concrete guidance, and the bureaucratism of divorcing from realities and failing to go down to the grass roots to do concrete work. They should periodically go down to the frontline of reform and development to conduct investigation and study, to give guidance in work, and to discover and solve problems in good time, thereby facilitating the smooth progress of reforms. Meanwhile, in carrying out a new reform measure, it is necessary to stress scientific approach; under no circumstance should we do things on the spur of the moment or according to subjective wishes. We should conduct scientific verification based on investigation and study to ensure each and every policy measure and specific project can yield the optimal economic and social benefits. In improving the workstyle, it is also necessary to attach importance to and strengthen the mass work. We should foster a firm awareness of the masses; and periodically go down to the grass roots to mingle with the masses, to do thorough and meticulous mass work and propaganda and guidance work, to listen to the opinions of the people, and to grasp the pulse of the man in the street. We should conduct in-depth investigation and promptly solve problems reported by the masses in general. Meanwhile, we should care about the livelihood of the people, paying particular attention to those who still do not have enough to eat and wear, to workers of enterprises in production stoppage or semi-stoppage, and to retirees. We should show the concern of the party and government for them by helping them solve practical problems, thereby forging closer ties between the party and government and the masses, safeguarding and bringing into better play their enthusiasm, and working concertedly to more successfully carry out the three major tasks of reform, development, and stability. In conclusion, Yang Chuantang said: The whole year's work depends on a good beginning in the spring. While transmitting and implementing the conference guidelines, all localities should pay close attention to economic work, spring farming preparations in particular. They should step up efforts to organize the allocation and transportation of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural production means, ensuring their prompt delivery for spring farming. Industry, communications, commerce, and capital construction departments should also conscientiously implement the tasks set by the current conference and the regional planning conference, striving to get off to a good start and lay a sound foundation for comprehensive fulfillment of the various tasks for this year. Public security and judicial organs, mass organizations, and civil affairs departments should also make their share of contributions to creating a favorable social and external environment for reform, opening up, and economic construction. He said: This year will be a crucial year for promoting overall reform and achieving a breakthrough in key areas. Cadres throughout the region should, in accordance with the tasks and goal set by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Regional Party Committee and the current conference, work conscientiously with one heart and one mind; and channel the enormous enthusiasm of the broad masses to reform in promoting the expansion of productive forces and accelerating economic construction in Tibet so as to greet the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region with outstanding achievements in building material and spiritual civilizations.
