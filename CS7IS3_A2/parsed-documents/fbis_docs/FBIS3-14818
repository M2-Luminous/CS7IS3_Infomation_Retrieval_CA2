As ITAR-TASS has just reported, Georgiy Satarov, the head of state's aide, told the briefing that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has prepared certain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and society. He refused to specify the form in which these measures would be carried out. However, Yuriy Baturin, the president's assistant for national security, added that these steps might even be taken today. He described press speculation that this would include a TV address as being close to the truth.
