I think my current visit to China was a meaningful opportunity to upgrade the substantial cooperation between our two countries a step further. I very sincerely and extensively exchanged views on matters of common interest between our two countries with the Chinese leaders. In particular, President Jiang Zemin and I met again, four months after we met in Seattle last November. He and I talked in a very intimate atmosphere this time. I invited President Jiang Zemin to visit the ROK soon [kakkaun siil nae], and President Jiang willingly [kikkoi] accepted my invitation. The ROK and China established diplomatic relations one and a half years ago. This was an action that our two countries took after actively responding [nungdongjoguro taeung] to the establishment of a new international order of reconciliation and cooperation. The two countries know well each other's potential and realize a need to promote cooperation for the sake of each country's national development. The world has been undergoing great political and economic change. In the midst of this change, a discussion has been under way to invigorate a regional economic cooperation system for common prosperity in this region. We reached an agreement that it is necessary for the ROK and China to build a more in-depth and multisided [poda simchungjogigo tawonjogin] cooperation system in step with such an international trend. Domestic and foreign reporters: Our two countries share the view that the tension on the Korean peninsula surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue is not beneficial to either country. President Jiang Zemin and I again confirmed this during our summit talks. We have so far cooperated to resolve this issue through dialogue and persuasion and will not give up our efforts for dialogue. The ROK and China share the same interest in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, stability there, and peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. I expect North Korea will become a responsible member of the international community and join in the tide of world history, which is reform and openness. When North and South Korea have substantial dialogue and cooperation and, ultimately, achieve North-South Korea reunification, genuine peace will be achieved on the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia. It is necessary for the ROK and China to develop long-term relations of cooperation, looking forward to such North-South dialogue and cooperation and a reunified Korea in the future. I stressed this point to the Chinese leaders during my current visit to China. We were of the same opinion that a reunified Korea will be greatly beneficial to not only to the Korean people but to China and other neighboring countries of ours. Since it began to carry out the policy of reform and openness, China has continuously maintained an alarming economic growth. Since they established diplomatic relations, our two countries have learned the other's good points and promoted cooperation. In this course, our two countries have gained much reciprocal benefits. The two countries have reached a point at which they must widen a systematic basis [chedojok kiban] to further accelerate economic exchanges. To this end, an ROK-China industrial cooperation committee was inaugurated as a result of my visit to China. I am pleased about this. We will promote industrial cooperation in the production of automobiles, electronic telephone switchboard systems, aircraft, and various other fields. The double taxation prevention agreement that was signed this time will accelerate economic exchange between the two countries. We extensively discussed the expansion of bilateral economic cooperation and the invigoration [hwalsonghwa] of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. We will closely cooperate to build an open, free Asia-Pacific economic order. China has promulgated various laws and eased restrictions and taken various other measures to enter GATT. The ROK assesses that these measures by China would contribute to strengthening the multilateral trade system. We will positively extend cooperation to ensure that China enters the GATT system. Since the ROK and China established diplomatic relations, the exchange of people between the two countries has significantly increased. Over 150,000 people of the ROK and China visited each other's country last year. I have significantly simplified the procedures necessary for our people's visits to China. We opened a ROK consulate general in Shanghai last year and will open one in Qingdao. The expansion of the exchange of the people between the two countries will greatly contribute to promoting a mutual understanding and friendship. Our two countries will promote more intimate relations of cooperation based on their historically and geographically close relations. We, as genuine neighbors who need each other, will consolidate friendship in all fields. Cherishing deep in my heart the Chinese people's friendship, I will depart for Seoul tomorrow. Before leaving for Seoul, I will go to Tianjin to visit a place where the people of our two countries are working together for common prosperity. I express deep thanks to the Chinese leaders and all Chinese people who warmly welcomed me and my delegation and extended warm hospitality to us. Thank you.
