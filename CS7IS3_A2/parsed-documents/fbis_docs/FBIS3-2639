According to a statement reportedly left by Wang Dan, Zhuo Duo and Min Qi, they have left Beijing "voluntarily" and have asked the U.S. Government to renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, the sources said. It was widely rumored that Christopher, who will arrive in Beijing on Friday evening, would meet Wang. But Christopher said Thursday in Tokyo that he has no plans "at the present time" to meet Chinese dissidents during his visit to China. Several other dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng, have reportedly stated that they have left the capital "voluntarily." No direct confirmation of these reports has been possible. Police surrounded Wei's house last week and Wang's residence Thursday. The dissidents are reportedly under pressure from the central authorities to leave town during China's ongoing National People's Congress (NPC) and the Christopher visit. Christopher is expected to confront the Chinese leadership on human rights issues, including the detention and jailing of dissidents for peacefully expressing their political views. On Thursday, Wang issued an open letter calling on deputies to the NPC to bring the MFN debate, which has been raging between the U.S. and Chinese governments, on to the congress agenda. The U.S. has linked extending China's trade status with "overall significant progress" in human rights and laid out an agenda of hoped-for progress.
