This province, which enjoys special legislative power as the largest special economic zone in the country, claims to lead the way in economic reform legislation. From 1988, when the province was established, to the end of 1992, Hainan promulgated over 24 sets of regulations to ensure the smooth and healthy development of a market economy. In 1993 the province's legislative work speeded up, with 18 sets of new legislation put into effect. The regulations provide simplified procedures for the application and registration of enterprises, and so far over 19,000 enterprises have been registered, among which 3,889 are foreign funded. The provincial people's congress recently passed three regulations on insurance to get everyone, employed or self-employed, covered by social insurance.
