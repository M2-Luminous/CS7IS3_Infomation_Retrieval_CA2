She added that she simply went there to listen to opinions on his candidacy. Minister Sanin pointed out that President Gaviria will take the time necessary to make a decision on the issue. She abstained from commenting on possible support from the nations of the region for his candidacy. "I did not go there to request votes, nor to count them, but to make consultations. We enjoy broad support because our president is admired, well-liked, and his international leadership ability is recognized. Although this is not the decisive factor, President Gaviria stays calm," she said. Sanin added that she is totally at peace with herself. She said that she is glad that she listened to opinions and is proud that she worked to ensure Colombia's chance to reach the OAS secretary generalship, which is the most important organization in the region. "Any serious country would do the same through its foreign ministry," she underscored. She added that she is very optimistic about the results of her tour, but President Gaviria has the last word. Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Relations Minister Jose Raul Mulino said yesterday, upon his arrival in Colombia, that his country cannot support Gaviria's candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general because it already pledged its vote to the Costa Rican candidate. Mulino added that his government only has words of thanks and admiration for the Colombian president, whose foreign policies were praised.
