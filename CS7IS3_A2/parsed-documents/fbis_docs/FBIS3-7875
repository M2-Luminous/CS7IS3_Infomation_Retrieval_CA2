Moravcik says that another sources of uncertainty about Slovakia are "some politicians, especially the series of ambiguous statements by Mr Premier Vladimir Meciar." Turning to Hungarian-Slovak relations, Moravcik says that the conclusion of a general treaty, which would confirm the inviolability of the state border, is the most important thing at the moment. He also stresses the need for international standards of protection of the rights of ethnic minorities to be worked out. The internal political aspect of the problem is to seek consensus with minorities' political representatives, Moravcik says. He points out that opposition political parties have already entered into negotiations with the Hungarian political parties represented in the Slovak Parliament, though solutions the questions at issue have not been found yet. Moravcik says that he has ended his diplomatic career for the time being and will now devote himself to home politics. Though the creation of a new political party is still in the phase of considerations, talks on the creation of the strongest possible "grouping of the center" have already started. He added that the grouping would also embrace supporters of former foreign minister Milan Knazko, ousted by Meciar last March, and of Lubomir Cernak, who was stripped of chairmanship of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) in mid-February.
