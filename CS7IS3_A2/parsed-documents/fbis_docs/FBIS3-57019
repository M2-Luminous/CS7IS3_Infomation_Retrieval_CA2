The commentary says the following: "In accordance with the treaty between Belarus and Lithuania `On legal aid and legal relations in civil, family, and criminal cases' signed in October 1992 and ratified by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet in February 1993, the Belarusian side provided assistance to a group of Lithuanian law enforcement officers headed by a deputy procurator general in detaining citizens N. Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius. Legal grounds for detaining and handing over other persons who are not citizens of Lithuania are not established, and this was stated to the Lithuanian procuracy. The actions by the Belarusian law enforcement officers correspond to the afore-mentioned treaty and to international legal norms."
