"The date that has been proposed by the Somalis themselves is May 30," spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from Mogadishu. The talks to prepare the ground for a national peace and reconciliation conference were proposed after Somalia's two chief warlords, Mohamed Farah Aidid and self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, signed a UN-brokered national reconciliation agreement in Nairobi on March 24. Mohamed Awale, a close aide of General Aidid, expressed optimism that the meeting would go ahead as planned this time.
