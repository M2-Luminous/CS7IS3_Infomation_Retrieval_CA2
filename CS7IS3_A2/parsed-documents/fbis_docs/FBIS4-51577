The ratification, now by both houses of Congress, paves the way for the bill's formal enactment into law. Senate bill 1586 is entitled "An act amending certain sections of Republic Act 6957 entitled An act authorizing the financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of infrastructure projects by the private sector." While the compromise bill retains the 60 percent-40 percent nationality requirement for BOT contracts, the scheme provides for several variations in which the private sector may participate. Among them are: -- build-and-transfer, where the private sector undertakes financing and construction and turns it over to government which shall pay the contractor its total investment plus reasonable rate of return; -- build-own-and-operate, where the private sector constructs and operates project and is allowed to recover investment by collecting tolls and other fees; -- build-lease-and-transfer, where the private sector finances a project, turns it over to the government on a lease arrangement for a fixed period of time, after which the project is automatically owned by the government; -- build-transfer-and-operate, where government contracts out project to the private sector which builds the facility, assumes cost overruns, delays, and other risks; -- contract-add-and-operate, where the private sector adds to an existing facility which it is renting from government, and operates it for a period of time. Other variations of the BOT as spelled out in the bill of Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, are the develop-operate-transfer, rehabilitate-operate-transfer, rehabilitate-own-operate, and project proponent where the private sector assumes contractual responsibility for the project. The senator said only projects with an estimated cost of more than P300 million [Philippine pesos] will require approval by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Local projects to cost from P50 million to P200 million will need the approval of the regional development councils. Another feature of the bill which is expected to "attract" foreigners is a provision minimizing congressional inquiries into an ongoing BOT project, she said. [passage omitted]
