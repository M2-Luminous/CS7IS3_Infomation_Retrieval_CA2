A regular round of Russo-Latvian talks began here on Monday. The two delegations reached an agreement on social welfare guarantees for the retired Russian military. According to the agreement, those of them who permanently resided in Latvia as of January 28, 1992, are "guaranteed the right to unhindered residence in Lithuania and use of their movable property and real estate". The agenda for the current round of talks includes discussions of an agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and an agreement on legal status, conditions, terms and order of work of the Russian radar station in Skrunda.
