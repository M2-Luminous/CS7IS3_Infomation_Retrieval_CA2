It is their prerogative. The information area is already overloaded with rumors, proposals, and plans on the future work of the Federal Assembly, and particularly the State Duma. We are expecting sensations, we are steeling ourselves for scandals. Perhaps it is not a bad thing that the "machinations" are being concealed from society for the time being. Ultimately, it is not scandal we need, but constructiveness. There is just one factor which prompts wariness. The essence of the talks, the latest round of which took place yesterday, is concentrated on the search for candidates for State Duma chairman. Why does this question concern the deputies so much? After all, if we proceed from the new Constitution, the figure of chairman is purely ceremonial: He chairs sessions, and he is in charge of internal order. Neither party allegiance, nor his attitude toward reforms, nor his stance in respect of the government and the president should be decisive in the make-up of the speaker: All that is required is an upstanding manner, organizational ability, and a high degree of empathy with and loyalty to the various points of view. Finding such a person among 450 deputies would not be such a difficult problem, provided there is agreement over the priorities. But clearly, the matter is precisely one of priorities. The old Soviet habit is coming into play: The most important thing is not the law (in this case, the Basic Law) -- the most important thing is who is chief. If the chief is "one of yours" you stand a chance, but if he is "someone else's" there will be additional problems. Given that we all realize how difficult it is to break this habit, the agreement (or the readiness to agree) that the candidate speaker ought to be sought not amid the strongest "pressure groups" but in the small factions was very pleasing to begin with. At the very least, this is a guarantee that the political "hue" of the chairman will not have a decisive influence on the activity of the Duma. But nothing of the sort. Three of the "strong" (the agrarians, the Communists, and the liberal-democrats) have already prepared a candidacy "between themselves," and everyone is already avidly totting up the votes they can collect. The next logical step in this system is as follows: If the "strong" fail to install their chairman, then it will be necessary to secure for themselves the deputy chairman's seat at least. Thus there will be as many deputy chairmen as there are "strong" elements. And it may be that the idea springs to mind -- and why not? -- to install a deputy chairman from each faction. To keep a balance, it could be said. All this is only too reminiscent of the old Supreme Soviet, and only too far removed from the civilized parliament toward which everybody is striving. Equally far removed is the idea to give the new parliament a newspaper. Who will undertake to determine the orientation of this publication, and the principles according to which it will act? A cursory dismissal greeted all talk of an information bulletin. No, it must be a popular newspaper, with ready-made subscribers, with all the attributes of a sociopolitical publication. Accordingly, this will constitute either a guarantee of frenzied and grueling brawls between the political groups across the pages of one publication circulated throughout the entire country, or a puppet publication subordinate to the chairman (or the presidium, if there are a lot of chiefs) wholly in the spirit of the old ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. Soviet power, of course, did not leave us unscathed. And it will continue to survive for a long time yet -- if not in form, then in essence. It has a serious base in the new parliament. It merely remains to hope that the effectiveness of this type of rule will prove less than high in the new conditions. You can pour old wine into new wineskins, but the taste will inevitably differ.
