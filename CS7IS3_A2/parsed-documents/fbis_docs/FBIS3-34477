I also thanked him for his condolences, which he conveyed to the embassy, on a common calamity that has pained us and all the Lebanese. Such incidents will not affect Jordan or Lebanon. They can happen anywhere. I do not believe this incident will deflect the Jordanians from the correct course and the wise policy pursued by the king. [Correspondent] Have you identified the motives of the crime? [Abu-Talib] The motives and the investigation are in the hands of the Interior Ministry and the security departments; they are the ones qualified to make statements on the investigation. We are not conducting the investigation. [Correspondent] There is talk .... [incomplete sentence as heard] [Abu-Talib] I cannot confirm or deny who the culprits are. We are being put in the picture but we are not the ones authorized to officially state where the investigation has reached. [Correspondent] Will Jordan demand the culprits' extradition? [Abu-Talib] This is premature. [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to the Jordanian regime behind the incident? [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for the incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent regimes, which still resort to such incidents. [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes? [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of Lebanon or the Arab nation. [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes? [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me. [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are Palestinians, do they not? [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard. [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this? [Abu-Talib] We have not. [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter? [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role that is not ours to play.
