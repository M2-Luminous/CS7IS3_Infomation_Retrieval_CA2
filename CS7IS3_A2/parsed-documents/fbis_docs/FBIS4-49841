In a press conference on a sports meeting for the handicapped in the Far East and South Pacific region, Mr. Deng, the son of Deng Xiaoping, made these remarks in reply to a question on the relationship between humanitarianism and human rights. He said that humanitarianism and human rights were closely related with the former regarded as an ideal to be sought for which covers the fact that every person is entitled to enjoy the rights of man and humanitarianism can help realize the value of mankind. He added that China put a strong emphasis on humanitarianism and human rights. During the last few years China did its very best to protect the rights and interests of the handicapped. With China's reform and open door policy going further, Mr. Deng said that the living standard of the general public was becoming better while that of the handicapped was improving gradually. He added that there had been dramatic changes in China in the past few years when people's lives took a turn for the better. People could achieve their goal and hopes through their own efforts. Mr. Deng pointed out that generally speaking the living standard for handicapped people in China had to some extent improved while many disabled people were still facing various kinds of difficulties including clothing and food problems with their economic life in no way guaranteed.
