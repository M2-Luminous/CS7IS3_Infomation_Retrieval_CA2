The nature reserve has been admitted to the international network of biosphere reserves of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) along with nine other such reserves in China. Since 1988, it has co-operated with the worldwide fund for nature to protect wild elephants and study the breeding of insects, and the development of forestry and farming outside the reserve as well as the relationships between tourism and wildlife protection. Meanwhile, it has started a training class in the management of wild animals in co-operation with experts from the association of wild animal protection of the United States. Established in 1958 in a remote part of southwest China's Yunnan Province, and known as "the kingdom of plants", the nature reserve is made up of five linked reserves with a total area of 240,000 ha. Specially designed to protect the local ecosystem of primeval forests, and rare animals and plants, the reserve boasts 4,000 kinds of tropical forest and rain forest. So far, a total of 341 wild plants are cultivated in the reserve, 52 of which are under special protection from the central government. In addition, 99 wild animals in the reserve are under top protection from the Chinese Government. Some 150,000 Chinese and foreign tourists, many of them experts and scholars, visited the reserve last year.
