FR941202-0-00190 FR941202-0-00019 The FAA finds that the ATA presents a logical argument in that flights should not be delayed for modification of the EMK and that an equivalent level of safety will be provided by locating the pair of protective gloves required for the EMK in a location on the aircraft that is accessible to crewmembers. Good Cause for Immediate Adoption The FAA finds that notice and public comment for this rulemaking is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This amendment contains a minor adjustment to the rule based on the fact that sufficient numbers of modified EMK will not be available by the compliance date of December 2, 1994. In addition, the FAA finds that there will be no adverse affect on safety since the required number of protective gloves will be made available on each aircraft. Comments on the amendment are invited, however, and the Administrator may amend or rescind the amendment in view of public comment. Comments should identify Docket No. 27926 and be submitted in triplicate to the address provided above. All comments will be available for public review, both before and after the closing date for comments. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble of Amendment No. 121&hyph;242, issued September 26, 1994, and based on the findings in that Regulatory Flexibility Determination and that International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, it is certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This regulation is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
