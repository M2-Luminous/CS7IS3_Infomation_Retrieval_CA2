The Russian Finance Ministry, in the person of Acting Minister Sergey Dubinin, and the Communications Ministry, in the person of Vladimir Bulgak, are forming an interesting alliance. These two official representatives of the Cabinet of Ministers are considering reducing the amount of television broadcasting to 20 percent. Does this mean that our blue screens will be mostly silent? What is interesting is that Western television companies from time to time tell us that they are being offered spare air time. In general, it is not too hard to guess where the remaining spare air time will go and who will be offering it. It remains for us to rely on the common sense of the Russian president and prime minister, who should understand that deprived of television, they will lose control of the country.
