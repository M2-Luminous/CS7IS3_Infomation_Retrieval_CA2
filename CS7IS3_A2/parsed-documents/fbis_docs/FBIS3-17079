The country's legislation should provide a common customs duty but it should be implemented gradually to prevent a too rapid unification of tariffs, said WB coordinator in Latvia, Inguna Dobraja. A WB mission worked in Riga last week and acquainted itself with the local system of customs tariffs in view of introducing a new model, Dobraja said. WB experts suggested that Latvia promotes exports by repaying customs duty for exported goods which are made with imported equipment and raw materials, Dobraja noted. The WB mission toured the Riga trade port, the Riga airport and a customs checkpoint to study the local conditions. The mission will prepare a detailed survey on the results of the visit. But they already noticed that Latvia needs to improve the customs bookkeeping and revise the mechanism of collecting customs duties. The customs duties should be collected through non-cash accounting to avoid corruption, the WB specialists said. The next WB mission will continue to study the Latvian customs late in April.
