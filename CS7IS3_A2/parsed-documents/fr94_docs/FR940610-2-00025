SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office announces that pursuant to the Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7, it intends to award a cooperative agreement resulting from an unsolicited research proposal offered by Montana State University. The objective of the work that Montana State University will be performing is as follows: (1) To study and develop reasonable Data Quality Objectives (DQO) approaches and processes to obtain only the data necessary for effective decision making relative to remediation site sample characterizations and (2) to improve the substance and objectivity of the national debate on nuclear waste and remediation issues by providing a quantitative evaluation of the risks associated with the cleanup process. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary A. Johnson, U.S. Department of Energy, 850 Energy Drive, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83401&hyph;1563, (208) 526&hyph;0982. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The statutory authority for the proposed award is the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91), as amended. The proposal meets the criteria for ``non-competitive'' financial assistance as set forth in 10 CFR Part 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A). The applicant is a state institution of higher education. To date DOE and the EPA have provide approximately $2,400,000 (over a six year period) to MSU's research and development programs in the areas of environmental restoration and waste management. Under these earlier awards MSU has initiated several major research studies, including one focused on enhancing the DQO process. These studies are ongoing and will build upon progress already made by MSU in previous awards. The anticipated total project period to be awarded is three years. DOE will provide $1,050,000 over this three year period. $350,000 is proposed for FY 1995. Montana State University will share approximately ten (10) percent of the total project costs. David W. Newnam, Acting Director, Procurement Services Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14192 Filed 4&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
