This is particularly the case today, when unforeseen uncertainties and threats compel us to envisage an entire series of situations quite different from those of yesterday's cold war. How is it possible to set new missions for our armies without the certainty of guaranteeing them the necessary capabilities and means in the present state of our finances? Nothing is less certain! Of course, in 1993 the government temporarily stopped the decline in our defense expenditures. Does this mean we can be sure that in the next five years the military planning law that will come up for a vote in three months will allow the continuation of large-scale programs already significantly delayed and the simultaneous manufacture of new types of weapons necessary for our defense by the year 2010 or 2015, such as satellites, laser systems and antimissile defenses? Nothing is less certain, since there is already a shortage of more than 40 billion francs simply to carry out present plans properly, without even mentioning the difficulty of taking care of the military planning law, which will amount to at least 600 billion in the next five years. Without contesting the credibility of the analyses and evaluations of the white paper, we cannot fail to note the serious gap that exists in it between the size of its ambitions and the precariousness of the financial resources to be allocated to our armies. How can one hope to finance the costly means demanded by the new "all-crisis" missions envisaged in the white paper when it is presently a fact that a bitter discussion centers on whether to grant more than 1 percent of the annual growth of the defense budget, at a time when a growth of 5 percent ought to be contemplated to face all the needs of our armed forces, and when below the painful cuts below the 2-percent mark will have to be made? Cuts are thus inevitable, even if the more necessary ones are rejected in favor of the least painful ones that will ensure easier passage of the law. Courage would consist in not obstinately continuing to manufacture weapons planned 20 years ago for cold war conflicts, which will be obsolete when they go into service after many delays. Will new programs such as the NH90 helicopters be sacrificed in order not to stop existing orders? On the other hand, why preserve--perhaps to cancel it later like the Hades--the contested M5 missile program, so dear to President Mitterrand, to equip the new nuclear submarines, and, on land, the obsolete Albion plateau silos that are increasingly losing their usefulness because of their vulnerability? And all this to the detriment of a more flexible second nuclear airborne component? Can anyone seriously believe that we will remain credible without nuclear testing, which does not appear in the white paper, or with an air force reduced to less than 300 aircraft and ground forces that will have failed to draw lessons from a Gulf war won through the superiority of intelligent weapons and real time, communications, and battlefield control electronic intelligence systems? Is it known that it will be a long time before France possesses the four intelligent weapons that ensured an overwhelming victory in the Gulf war, without mentioning the 3,000 computers used on the battlefield and linked to some 30,000 computers in the United States? Such will be tomorrow's war. Maintaining conscription within the framework of a mixed army will slow down the necessary reform of the military service and the increased professionalization of our projection forces, which are still in great need of transportation, logistics and intelligence means. Showing too much prudence, the authors of the white paper fail to sufficiently stress the need for France to double its space program so as not to be disqualified in tomorrow's world vis-a-vis the superpowers. But how can one be present on these new battlefields without strongly reinforcing our defense system, an initiative not envisaged in a white paper written by an "establishment" [English in the text] more sensitive to continuity and prudence than to innovation and updating? How is it possible to plead for a European defense--the need for which is illustrated by the Bosnian tragedy--and not propose at the same time improved strategic and industrial European cooperation? Since it is obvious, in light of these needs, that it is not through the usual budget procedures that the maintenance of capabilities and the modernization of our defense will be ensured, why not contemplate other forms of financing, without shrinking from allocating to our armed forces part of the significant revenues from privatizations? After all, this would be just as useful for the future of our nation than to use such revenues to fill the abyss of the Air France, Bull or National Railroad Company deficits brought about by their leaders' disastrous management. It is better to pay for a good life insurance policy than to undertake Sisyphean tasks.
