Here is correspondent Audrius Baciulis with a report from the news conference and about other events which took place at the Lithuanian Seimas. [Baciulis] Algirdas Brazauskas said that today a response is expected from Brussels concerning Lithuania's wish to join NATO. He also said that when NATO received the written membership application from Lithuania, it was immediately disseminated among all its sixteen members. According to the president, not all the states had submitted written applications asking to join NATO. In the president's view, although there will be no specific date given from which Lithuania will become member of NATO, Lithuania nevertheless supports the Partnership for Peace initiative proposed by the USA which, according to Algirdas Brazauskas, is a starting point in the process of joining NATO.
