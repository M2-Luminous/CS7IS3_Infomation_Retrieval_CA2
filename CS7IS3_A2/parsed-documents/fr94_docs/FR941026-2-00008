FR941026-2-00008 FR941026-2-00006 [I.D. 101794E] Endangered Species; Permits AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Receipt of an Application for a Modification to Scientific Research Permit 818 (P211C). Notice is hereby given that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has applied in due form for a modification to Permit 818 (P211C) requesting an increase in the take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-227). ODFW requests authorization for an increase in the take of juvenile, endangered, Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) because of their plans to expand their research sampling at Catherine Creek as a part of their life history, smolt migration, and habitat studies in the upper Grande Ronde and Imnaha River basins. In addition, an unexpectedly high production of juveniles in 1994, partially attributed to recent progeny production from listed Rapid River Hatchery adults passed above the hatchery to spawn, is resulting in greater capture numbers and associated indirect mortality. The juvenile salmon's larger than expected escapement in the spring of 1995 will allow ODFW to increase the sample size for their scientific research. A larger number of juveniles would be captured, handled, and receive passive integrated transponder tags for the modification and the increased take would be authorized for 1994 and 1995 only. Written data or views, or requests for a public hearing on this application should be submitted to the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Hwy., Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226, within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Those individuals requesting a hearing should set out the specific reasons why a hearing on this particular application would be appropriate. The holding of such hearing is at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA. All statements and opinions contained in this application summary are those of the applicant and do not necessarily reflect the views of NMFS. Documents submitted in connection with the above application are available for review by interested persons in the following offices by appointment: Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1315 East-West Hwy., Room 13229, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, 525 North East Oregon St., Suite 500, Portland, OR 97232 (503-230-5400).
