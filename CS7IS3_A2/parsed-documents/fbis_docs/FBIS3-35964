Security Council to prolong the U.N. observer mission mandate in Georgia, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information and press department Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today. In the opinion of the Russian side, the mere prolongation of the mission mandate "can hardly be viewed as an adequate answer to the moderate but real progress achieved at Geneva negotiations in December 1993 and January 1994, repeated requests of the Georgian and Abkhazian side to send peace-makers to the conflict zone, and the real situation in the region." Karasin expressed regret with the "lack of worthy response to Russian proposals of a genuine peace-making operation in Abkhazia". Further delay in such decision objectively confirms the current status quo -- isolation of Abkhazia and Georgia -- and freezes the soonest and safe return of refugees, which is a key humanitarian and political problem. In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this policy reduces chances for an agreement on political status of Abkhazia and increases the risk of a new bloodshed as result of spontaneous actions of refugees and displaced persons, whose number has reached 200,000 in the conflict zone. Karasin believes this reality should be foreseen. "We are convinced that the introduction of peace-makers in the conflict zone is the only chance to achieve regional stabilization and create a real basis for final political settlement of the conflict, including the establishment of a political status of Abkhazia," he said. In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the mere beginning of a peace-making operation throughout Abkhazia by U.N. forces or other peace-makers authorized by the United Nations may create conditions for the implementation of agreements on lasting settlement by the warring sides. On its part, Russia is ready to make a positive answer to the sides' requests for its participation in the operation. Karasin expressed the hope the U.N. secretariat will timely consider military-technical, financial and other aspects of a peace-making operation in Abkhazia in accordance with the U.N. Security Council's resolution of January 31, 1994, in order to enable members of the Security Council to discuss the operation in detail and decide on its beginning.
