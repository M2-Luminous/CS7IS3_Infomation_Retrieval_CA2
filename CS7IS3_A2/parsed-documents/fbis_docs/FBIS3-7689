Because of the sensitivity of the idea, he was careful not to set out a specific timetable. But "this year and next year could be crunch years for APEC" to show some concrete results, he said. Trade liberalisation is an issue that is "coming to the fore" in 1994, and Australia wants to see trade liberalisation within the group "when people are ready for it" he said. APEC should liberalise at a pace that its 17 members find "comfortable", but not "proceeding at the pace of the slowest country". Mr McMullen's comments come at a time when Thai officials are talking about a rethink of the country's policy towards APEC and other regional economic groupings. The officials identify the United States and Australia as the two APEC members pressing hardest for economic integration within the group. They are particularly concerned about the failure of Thailand and other ASEAN countries to influence APEC's agenda and to resist what they see as less desirable developments in the group. Thailand and ASEAN fear that the larger nations will use APEC as a forum for exerting pressure on the smaller countries, for example to obtain lower trade barriers, tighter protection for intellectual property rights and market-opening in service industries. APEC would be used, Thai officials fear, to make commitments that go beyond what has been agreed globally in the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Some Thai officials say the government needs a clearer assessment of where APEC is heading so that Thai and ASEAN responses can be prepared ahead of time. So far, they say, the steady insertion of new items on the five-year-old group's agenda -- by Australia and the United States in particular -- has subtly but swiftly shifted APEC away from the loose grouping that ASEAN initially accepted. At each stage, they conclude, ASEAN was caught unprepared. The Australians have always argued openly that if APEC is to be meaningful it should work for trade liberalisation. The Americans, on the other hand, have repeatedly stated that they have an open mind about APEC's development. The Thai officials take a different view, citing in particular a draft investment code that US officials are circulating for comment by APEC members, and proposals for trade liberalisation contained in a report by a group of "eminent persons" commissioned by APEC. The group's chairman is an influential US economist, Fred Bergsten. Some Thais contrast the Australian pressure for trade liberalisation on a broad front with what they describe as the Americans' gradual introduction of new issues such as the investment code and financial services liberalisation. One Thai official recently recounted how APEC had started off as a "loose consultative forum" when it was launched at its first ministerial meeting in Canberra in late 1989. After that, work programmes were introduced on a number of topics, ranging from the creation of trade databases to human resources development. Those programmes needed funding, which led to an APEC budget and a secretariat. Last year saw US President Bill Clinton host the first of what is increasingly seen as a regular series of APEC leaders' meetings, and the creation of a new APEC committee on trade and investment. This month APEC finance ministers met for the first time. The official said this demonstrates how far ASEAN has allowed APEC's original shape to be eroded. Other officials say ASEAN should counterattack by proposing its own agenda so that APEC's emphasis can return to areas of interest to smaller countries, for example training and technology transfer. There are some differences of opinion in the Thai bureaucracy. While some Thai officials talk of hidden agendas and a US "master-plan" for APEC, others question whether the Clinton administration would be able to pass APEC trade liberalisation laws through Congress. Some Thai officials believe the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks could ease some of the pressure for specific trade agreements in APEC. For example, earlier suggestions that APEC might handle trade disputes between its members might be dropped because the Uruguay Round deal includes a stronger and more streamlined dispute settlement process under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The possibility of APEC being a forum for the United States and Japan to patch up their bilateral trade dispute was raised yesterday when Mr McMullen was interviewed in a television-telephone link-up with Canberra. "APEC is not a dispute settlement body," he said. But he added that APEC meetings could be occasions for ministers from the two countries to discuss their differences. Mr McMullen said that while Australia is concerned about the Japanese trade surplus, Canberra opposes Washington's use of unilateral pressure to try to force Japanese markets open. One of the reasons why US companies have insisted on the controversial numerical targets set by Washington for access to Japanese markets is the fact that earlier American success in lowering Japan's trade barriers against beef led to a surge in Japanese beef imports from countries, including Australia.
