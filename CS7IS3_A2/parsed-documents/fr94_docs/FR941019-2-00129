FR941019-2-00129 FR941019-2-00080 Third, with reference to the discussion of foreign sovereign immunity in Section 3.31 above, the order must come from the foreign government acting in its governmental capacity. The defense does not arise from conduct that would fall within the FSIA commercial activity exception. Illustrative Example J Situation: Greatly increased quantities of commodity X have flooded into the world market over the last two or three years, including substantial amounts indirectly coming into the United States. Because they are unsure whether they would prevail in an antidumping and countervailing duty case, U.S. industry participants have refrained from filing trade law petitions. The officials of three foreign countries meet with foreign firms and urge them to ``rationalize'' production by cooperatively cutting back. The foreign firms agree among themselves to limit production, but there are governmental penalties contemplated for a failure to do so. Discussion: In the facts stated here, the Agencies would not find that sovereign compulsion precluded prosecution of this agreement, assuming for the purpose of this example that the overseas production cutbacks have the necessary effects in the U.S. market to support jurisdiction. Other doctrines, such as the foreign analog to the domestic Noerr-Pennington doctrine, 81 may also be relevant in these circumstances. 81 See Section 3.34 infra. 3.33␣Acts of State As it presently stands, the act of state doctrine is a judge-made rule of federal common law. 82 It is a doctrine of judicial abstention based on considerations of international comity and separation of powers, and applies only if the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the foreign sovereign within its territorial jurisdiction on matters pertaining to its governmental sovereignty. The act of state doctrine arises when the validity of the acts of a foreign government constitutes an unavoidable aspect of a case. 83 In such cases, courts have refused to adjudicate claims or issues that would require the court to judge the legality (as a matter of U.S. law or international law) of the sovereign act of a foreign state. 84 Although in some cases the sovereign act in question may also compel private behavior, other situations may arise in which the act imposes no such obligation. 85 While the act of state doctrine does not compel dismissal as a matter of course, abstention is appropriate in a case where the court must ``declare invalid, and thus ineffective as a rule of decision in the U.S. courts,*␣*␣* the official act of a foreign sovereign.'' 86 82 Banco Nacional de Cuba V. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 421&hyph;22 n.21 (1964) (noting that other countries do not adhere in any formulaic way to an act of state doctrine). 83 W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., 493 U.S. 400 (1990). 84 International Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers V. Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, 649 F.2d 1354, 1358 (9th Cir. 1981). 85 See Timberlane, 459 F.2d at 606&hyph;08. 86 Kirkpatrick, 493 U.S. at 405, quoting Ricaud v. American Metal Co., U.S. 246 U.S. 304, 310 (1918). When a restraint on competition arises directly from the act of a foreign sovereign, such as the grant of a license, award of a contract, expropriation of property, or the like, the Agencies may refrain from bringing an enforcement action based on the act of state doctrine. For example, the Agencies will not challenge foreign acts of state if the facts and circumstances indicate that: (1) the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the sovereign, (2) the act was taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereign, and (3) the matter is governmental, rather than commercial. 3.34␣Petitioning of Sovereigns Under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, a genuine effort to obtain or influence action by governmental entities in the United States is immune from application of the Sherman Act, even if the intent or effect of that effort is to restrain or monopolize trade. 87 Whatever the basis asserted for Noerr-Pennington immunity (either as an application of the First Amendment or as a limit on the statutory reach of the Sherman Act, or both), the Agencies will apply it in the same manner to the petitioning of foreign governments and the U.S. Government. 87 See Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961); United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965); California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972) (extending protection to petitioning before ``all departments of Government,'' including the courts); Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 113 S. Ct. 1920 (1993). However, this immunity has never applied to ``sham'' activities, in which petitioning ``ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, is a mere sham to cover *␣*␣* an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.'' Professional Real Estate Investors 113 S. Ct. at 1926, quoting Noerr, 365 U.S. at 144. See also USS-Posco Indus. v Contra Costa Cty. Bldg. Constr. Council, AFL&hyph;CIO, 31 F.3d 800 (9th Cir., 1994). Illustrative Example K Situation: In the course of preparing an antidumping case, which requires the U.S. industry to demonstrate that it has been injured through the effects of the dumped imports, producers representing 75% of U.S. output exchange the information required for the adjudication. All the information is exchanged indirectly through third parties and in an aggregated form that makes the identify of any particular producer's information impossible to discern. Discussion: Information exchanged by competitors within the context of an antidumping proceeding implicates the Noerr-Pennington petitioning immunity. To the extent that these exchanges are reasonably necessary in order for them to prepare their joint petition, which is permitted under the trade laws, Noerr is available to protect against antitrust liability that would otherwise arise. On these facts the parties are likely to be immunized by Noerr if they have taken the necessary measures to ensure that the provision of sensitive information called for by the Commerce Department and the ITC cannot be used for anticompetitive purposes. In such a situation, the information exchange is incidental to genuine petitioning and is not subject to the antitrust laws. Conversely, were the parties directly to exchange extensive information relating to their costs, the prices each has charged for the product, pricing trends, and profitability, including information about specific transactions that went beyond the scope of those facts required for the adjudication, such conduct would go beyond the contemplated protection of Noerr immunity.
