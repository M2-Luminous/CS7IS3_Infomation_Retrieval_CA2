However, there is a condition: should there be an Islamic court, with an Islamic jury, before which Libyans could stand, then, as far as I am concerned, whether this court is set up in Britain, America, France, Egypt, or Malta, the venue would not matter any longer. As long as we have put a condition that an Islamic court would be better, whether it is in the center of Britain or America, this would be better. If the judges are Muslims, and prosecution is Muslim, and where the court opens its session with Koran recitation, then we would accept it. [cheers] Should there be a court like this which meets this condition, then, I will consider it an historical action, and we will not mind whether they [the suspects] be given a capital punishment. This would not matter; what matters is that an historical event, a historical turning point would have taken place. As Muslims, our condition, regardless of Scotland or Britain because this is an international issue, is that the court is a Muslim one. We do not mind the venue of the trial as long as the judges are Muslim and as long as the court opens session with Koran recitation. [passage omitted] Let us expose them and confirm their hostility to Islam by letting them face this test and this court. [passage omitted] Libya is flying the flag of Islam and the flag of struggle and the holy war. It is inconceivable that the position of Libya should be similar to that of any submissive state, which receives orders from Paris, Washington, London, and Tel Aviv. No way. I would like to set up a significant group that should bear this burden and put up with this holy war in the month of Ramadan. You should go and meet Shah Mas`ud, Rabbani, and Hekmatyar. Libya should be the one to end this fighting between Muslims. Anybody who refuses to halt the war, Libya should send forces to fight him in accordance with the Koran. [passage omitted] We should implement this verse and announce that anybody who disobeys, we should fight him in accordance to what God has decreed. Either I select a group from you, or you choose one, to go, with my permission, to meet those brothers of ours. Libya should be the one responsible for finding a solution to the issue of Afghanistan. These are Muslims who are killing one another during this holy month of Ramadan; children and women are killed; mosques are being destroyed and cities demolished, torture is everywhere, it is Satan who now rules Afghanistan. It is the Christians, nonbelievers, and Jews who are behind this war. This situation is similar to the one when Iraq and Iran declared war against one another. The United States used to supply Iraq with arms, exactly as did Israel with Iran. You have seen this; and this has been proven in full view of the whole world. Can you imagine this? The United States and the Israelis, who are two heads of the same spear, decided to arm Iraq and Iran. What is important to them is that Muslims should be annihilated. Even these days, they are plotting against Afghanistan, and they are arming each side. We should not arm each side; we should bring reconciliation against them, and anybody who refuses to do so, we should send forces to fight them. This is what the Koran decreed, and we should implement what the Koran says; this has been tried before. Even the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be left to the Christians. There is a republic called Bosnia-Herzegovina that should become independent. The talk about Bosnia-Herzegovina is but a political issue, the real issue is the annihilation of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which represents a crusading war. We should expose this war. We are friends of the Yugoslavs, the Serbs. The Orthodox doctrine of Russia and Serbia is close in nature to Islam. It is anti-Catholic and anti-protestant. However, now there is an agreement and a plot in which the Orthodox doctrine finds itself in opposition to Islam. There is an anti-Islamic plot which, in addition to Bosnia-Herzegovina, will also affect Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Turkey, and then the Arab world. Consequently, a new crusading war will be declared. We Libyans should also send delegations to Yugoslavia. We should tell them that you Serbs have been our friends since Tito's days, the Orthodox doctrine is similar to Islam; you should not fall into the plot of the Catholics, the Protestants, the Christians, and the Israelis. The issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is one thing, where as the annihilation of Muslims in Bosnia is another thing. We are against the annihilation of Muslims; we should stand by them in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As for the political war, i.e the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, border demarcation, etc., this is another issue that relates to all republics of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] A delegation should go to Somalia to meet Aydid, Ali Mahdi, and the president of the Somali land in the north. We must reach a solution. We should implement on them what has been implemented in Afghanistan. We should send forces, not America. Libya should send forces which fight against the side which rejects reconciliation. [passage omitted] Britain and America are taking revenge against Egypt by dividing it into two or more countries. Where do you think this trend came from? Who told Iraq to invade Kuwait? It was America. America told Iraq that because Iraq waged war against Khomeyni, we [the United States] would give you Kuwait. He [Saddam Husayn] believed this and invaded Kuwait. Once this was done, they came and destroyed Iraq. Who set fire to 100 oil wells? It was not Iraq. It was the West and America, which for imperialist reasons, set fire to the Kuwaiti wells. Because Iraq was defeated, it admitted it did so. He [Saddam Husayn] did not do this. It was America which burned the Kuwaiti oil. We are saying that should the Kuwaiti and the Saudi independence depend on the American forces, then this is a false independence. They would be better off uniting with Iraq, which they are fearing, or Yemen, rather than having their independence dependent on the presence of foreign forces. [passage omitted] We hope that our brothers in Saudi Arabia recover their senses and do not prevent the Libyan pilgrims to go by air to Mecca. This would be a disaster. Last year, the Libyan pilgrims defied them and went to Jerusalem as long as Mecca is occupied. It would have been the same, Jerusalem is occupied and so is Mecca. I am worried a delegation of Libyan pilgrims, if prevented from going to Mecca, would go to the Vatican in defiance of Saudi Arabia or the Arabs. This could happen. [passage omitted] We must announce our sympathy to the Kurdish nation. It has got the right to unity and liberation. We want it to be a sister nation which has got its position in the near east along the other Islamic nations, the Arab, Turkish, and Persian ones. [passage omitted] How come the Christian interfere in the business of the Shia and the sunnis? How can the U.S. ambassador reconcile between Sanaa and Aden? Is it logical to see a Christian reconcile among the Muslims, solve their problems, send their forces, protect Muslims and their mosques. For us this is unacceptable. This is our revolution, this is the true holy war for which we were born and for which we are prepared to die. [passage omitted] Libya defies the Christians and the Jews will which harm Islamic sanctities, the dignity and honor of Islam. We defy them even if we have to sacrifice millions of people; it will not matter because this is a historic battle.
