The figures come as new evidence discloses serious shortcomings in surgical practices in many hospitals. Hospitals in Harrogate, Lancaster, and Eastbourne are among the riskiest, with death rates from appendicitis and abdominal surgery more than twice the average, while those in Chesterfield, Bradford and Bromley are among the safest, with death rates less than a quarter of the average. Reasons for the variation are suggested by an investigation into 2,700 deaths after operations in hospital, published yesterday, which highlights dangerous practices by some surgeons and ignorance of safety measures. The report by the National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (deaths within 30 days of an operation), says that too many operations are being performed at night by unsupervised junior surgeons on very sick patients. Hospitals that lack staff and equipment to care for patients safely are failing to refer them to specialist centres. The report is based on confidential questionnaires returned by more than 1,000 surgeons and aneasthetists. A quarter of those approached did not co-operate. The report says this was unacceptable.
