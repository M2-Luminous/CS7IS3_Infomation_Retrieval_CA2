Many of the speakers at the rally condemned the government of national unity and committed Azapo to struggle for what they termed true political rights, Cape-based TANIS [expansion unknown] news agency reported. Another speaker at the rally, Azapo's political commissar Mr Mzukisi Madlavu, condemned salaries that were paid to members of parliament.

He said the money could be effectively used to help the Reconstruction and Development Programme.
