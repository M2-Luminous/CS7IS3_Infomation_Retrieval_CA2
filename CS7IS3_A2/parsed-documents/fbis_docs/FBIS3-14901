Palchevskiy; place and date not given: "Andrzej Bortnowski: `My Task Is To Strengthen Friendship Between Our Armies'"] [Excerpt] [Palchevskiy] During World War II, Belarus and Poland suffered heavy losses in population and material resources. We are now preparing to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Belarus' liberation from German fascist invaders and the 50th anniversary of the victory of Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War. Is Poland going to celebrate these events, too? Do Poles remember being liberated by the Soviet Army? [Bortnowski] Yes, our nations suffered very heavy losses during that war. The memory of the fallen is sacred. Poles, undoubtedly, have not forgotten from where the deliverance from fascism came. In Poland, there are graves of Belarusians who fought for the liberation of Poland, while in Belarus are the graves of Poles who fought our common enemy. Our nations are fraternal, and Belarusian-Polish brotherhood in arms has been sealed by blood. This cannot be forgotten. With regard to the current day, the ties between our Armies are strengthening and mutual contacts are becoming permanent and multifaceted. As of recently, for example, working meetings have been held between the defense ministers of both our countries, as well as meetings between military delegations on various levels, including border troops from your 28th Army Corps and our Warsaw Military District. [Palchevskiy] Not long ago, Poland was a member of the Warsaw Pact, but now it strives to join NATO. What is the reason? Such a step is surely designed to incite anxiety among Poland's neighbors to the east. [Bortnowski] With regard to the anxieties of our eastern neighbors, it may be said with full certainty: Poland wants to live with its all neighbors in peace and friendship. With regard to military and political reorientation, it can be attributed to the change of the world's general situation. In addition, it belongs to the competence of politicians, not servicemen. The leadership of any country, while taking care of its security, has to adopt definite resolutions. That is all I can say. [Palchevskiy] Colonel, due to well-known circumstances, the prestige of military service in our republic has suffered a decline over recent years. What is the situation in Poland? [Bortnowski] Military service in Poland is very prestigious -- it is distinguished and well-paid. The prestige of the Army rose considerably after the 1980's and the installation of the new state leadership. [passage omitted]
