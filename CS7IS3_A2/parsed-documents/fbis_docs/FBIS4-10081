President Eduardo Frei decided to set up this commission to combat signs of corruption in the country. The issue of honesty in public office has been uppermost in the head of state's mind since he came to power. The idea of establishing the National Commission on Public Morals answers this concern. This commission, which is to be made up of leading figures from all political sectors, will have a 100-day deadline for submitting its proposals. [Begin Frei recording] We establish this national commission today in order to streamline the legal mechanisms established to ward off and suppress occurrences such as corruption and trafficking of influence. The reason that prompted me to establish this national commission was to underscore that corruption and its attendant problems are things that concern the whole country, as the efforts of a particular government are not enough to prevent and overcome it. All the democratic forces of our country should be united in this endeavor. Every upright and efficient government official ought not to be worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work, and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly distinguish illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We are pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to give citizens aboveboard and competent service rather than the construction of an efficient and bureaucratic state. [end recording]
