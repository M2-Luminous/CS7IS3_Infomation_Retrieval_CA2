On 18 January at the Champigny command post (Val-de-Marne), Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and Mr. Michel Giraud, president of the Ile-de-France Regional Council, formally inaugurated the link-up of the experimental fleet with the traffic monitoring information system for eastern Paris (Sirius). Equipped with high-powered electronic terminals, drivers will be guided in real time, intersection after intersection. The equipment includes a GPS (Global Positioning System) position-location module and a mechanism for obtaining "finer" location fixes using sensors attached to the vehicle wheels. The computed path to destination can also be corrected "in real time" to adjust for traffic congestion as the terminal receiveds and decodes traffic monitoring data. Information and computed paths are displayed on a liquid-crystal screen built into the dashboard. The driver sets the vehicle's destination: A green arrow appears showing the general direction, and on the left is a simplified schematic of the next intersection showing route to be followed, junctions, "Do Not Enters" (in red), and distance in meters to the next turn. By pressing a key, the driver can see the name of the street along which the vehicle is currently proceeding. A soft voice gives a timely alert message: "Turn right in 200 meters." If the driver makes a mistake, the itinerary is corrected. The geographic data is located on digital optical disks prepared with the help of the National Geographic Institute (IGN). The most costly part of the program is compilation of the maps to be entered into the laser disks. The system operator is an economic interest group (GIE) made up by Renault, TDF, and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez. The enterprises concerned believe it will take another two years before the system is totally operational and ready to be marketed at a price between 12,000 and 15,000 French francs. By that time, digital disks will have "mapped" the entire country, including all towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants. When it was introduced in Paris, the on-board computer performed quite satisfactorily, handling geometrically complex intersections such as Place Denfert-Rochereau, indicating highway junction points and displaying side-roads as they approached one by one, along with pedestrian walkways and outlets of private roads. The utility of the system for road transport professionals seems obvious (deliveries, express parcel service, taxis). With profitability assured from these sources, it could then be made available to the general public at a reasonable cost, which Renault believes would be comparable to an option such as air conditioning. Europe-wide standards should make it possible to prepare compatible digital maps for the most important European Community countries.
