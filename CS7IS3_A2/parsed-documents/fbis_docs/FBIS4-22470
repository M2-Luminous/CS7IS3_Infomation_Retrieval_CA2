In particular, what actually happened on the evening of 24 September next to the staff headquarters of the CIS United Armed Forces? The only person who could shed light on this is Colonel Stanislav Terekhov. But at that time he had been arrested and was out of the game. But there were many versions floating about: from accusations of terrorism--in the democratic press--and provocations--alas, in certain patriotic publications--to suggestions that he was captured when he left the House of Soviets to see his family. In a word, everything is covered by a shroud of mystery. Therefore when I went to see Terekhov in his home the first thing I asked him to do was clarify the incident on Leningrad Avenue. [Terekhov] Then I shall begin "from the beginning." On 21 September at 2000, as soon as the coup d'etat had taken place, quite different mechanisms from the ones that had been operating theretofore were put in play. We understood quite well that the presidential side should not wait until the House of Soviets had been worn down by the blockade to such an extent that it would have been possible to starve them out as the Tatars once captured Russian fortresses. The blockade in the center of Moscow could not last forever. On 23 September several sources informed me that under the leadership of Korzhakov and other figures who have armed state structures, a "surprise" was being prepared for the opening of the special Congress of People's Deputies. By that evening the probability of a "surprise" was very great. It was necessary to make a decision. I spoke with several of our leaders in the Supreme Soviet: We must not remain passive because if we are we will be swatted like flies. X hour was approaching, there was no time left to verify and verify again. The Congress was just about to open and then the mechanism of provocation would go to work. I was faced with a choice: Either hope for the best and not do anything, or.... [Garifullina] And you decided to act? [Terekhov] I understood that in order to extricate ourselves from the situation imposed on us with the fewest losses I had to take responsibility for myself. I will not call this self-sacrifice, but believe me I knew where I was going. Speaking in military language, I decided to divert the enemy's attention by conducting a secondary maneuver. [Garifullina] In other words, you went to the staff headquarters of the CIS United Armed Forces. But why did you have to do this? [Terekhov] Indeed, everyone was confused: Why? But if we were to take something it should be the staff headquarters--it is a kilometer away from the House of Soviets. And the CIS staff headquarters was absolutely abandoned, there were no weapons, and no communications...of course, if you look at it seriously it is insignificant, but it would do for a diversionary maneuver.... The action I undertook made it possible--I am not speaking about after-effects now--to introduce confusion into enemy ranks. They are not about to storm the House of Soviets if there is some kind of trouble in their rear, and they know nothing. In brief, when they cannot understand the intention, the enemy usually becomes stupid and begins to rush about. And, as a rule, they postpone their basic operation. The maneuver succeeded; the diversion of attention was significant, you know that. And at that time I was shut off from all sources of information. But you knew the reaction both from the other side and from the leaders of the Supreme Soviet: They either pretended not to know or really did not guess the true meaning of what was happening. And those who wanted to clear themselves simply placed the responsibility on me. [Garifullina] And what role did Anpilov play in these events? [Terekhov] I want to say this right away and put a stop to all the rumors that have been circulating since that evening: He is not a provocateur, not a spy, and not a secret agent. Viktor Anpilov as a public leader and the chief of his party has done his job to the best of his abilities and opportunities. That is a statement of fact. And the insinuations that are being spread around him are on the conscience of those who did this. [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, on that evening Anpilov called for people to come to the headquarters of the CIS United Armed Forces to help you. This is why passions have flared up concerning him. Tell us, did you have a conversation with him before your departure for Leningrad Avenue? [Terekhov] The conversation occurred somewhere around 15 or 20 minutes before nine, about five minutes before I departed for Leningrad Avenue. Incidentally, I did not inform him or the others of the details; I told them briefly in two words: I am going there, I am going to stir up a ruckus there, and you make sure that the forces are drawn there...it was necessary to convince the people, otherwise they simply would not have gone there...the 150 or so men who arrived at the staff headquarters made the operation a success. Those who did not want this began to raise a ruckus around me and Anpilov. They said that this action did much harm. Excuse me, but if what should have happened on that evening in front of the House of Soviets had actually happened, if we had not frustrated their plans, then you would have had something to say about the actions of Terekhov and Anpilov and those who were with us. [Garifullina] Tell me, did you actually take the place over? [Terekhov] We did not have to. I was blocking the checkpoint, where the soldiers were, in the first place, in order to prevent people from getting into the staff headquarters. While I was blocking it some pistols were taken from the soldiers. I was blamed for this. But, please, why would I want to steal pistols when I had an automatic and my people, the ones that were providing the protection, were armed? They had nothing left to do but look for formal indications of the commission of a crime. First: resisting the militia. But, on the contrary, I wanted to save the militia. And the person who fired at the militiaman did that as a special case, I want to emphasize that. My order from the very beginning was--do not shoot! [Garifullina] Did you give the commands over a loudspeaker? [Terekhov] No, it was night on a deserted street and you could hear well, even witnesses have confirmed this. And suddenly, during the course of the operation, in spite of my command, a shot rang out...I was forced to remain there and make sure nobody was wounded. Not a single bullet was fired at the staff headquarters and not a single person went in there. Therefore what kind of seizure could there be? In front of the House of Soviets people were told to divert and shift the attention of the opposing side. [Garifullina] I want to clarify one more detail pertaining to Anpilov. Did you ask him to announce this operation at the rally? [Terekhov] Yes, yes! [Garifullina] Why am I asking you this? Viktor Ivanovich told me: "I promised Stanislav and I kept my word. If I had it to do over again I would not have done it that way." [Terekhov] He did what I told him to do. And I said that the officers were conducting an operation on Leningrad Avenue and they had to be supported. They went there and supported them, and there would have been no casualties were it not for the shooting that we did not start. And the bullet that hit the elderly woman was fired after I had left in the crossfire between the militia and someone else who appeared later. And again the real murderer was not found! We were accused of theft, bearing arms, resistance, and mass disorder, but nobody was accused of murder. It is strange that the person who fired the weapon was not found, just like the one who ran down Tolokneyev on 1 May. [Garifullina] Under what circumstances were you arrested? [Terekhov] My arm was injured, the upper half of my shoulder was paralyzed. Incidentally, I gave the command to leave weapons on Khodynskoye Field, and I threw my automatic down there too because I knew that if they saw me with an automatic within a hundred meters they would shoot as though they were in the middle of crossfire. Then when they were taking me around to all the militia divisions and command headquarters they were continuously, every five minutes, poking me with the muzzle of their gun and saying: We are going to shoot you now. And I was already helpless, in handcuffs. [Garifullina] What was the most difficult thing for you after your arrest? [Terekhov] A person can stand anything--beating, insults, when they have you against the wall, on the floor, or wherever they wish. After a certain amount of time the wounds heal, the pain passes, and the organism restores itself. There are nonphysical aspects-- betrayal, an extremely vulgar, brutish attitude toward an officer-- this is the sort of thing that is not forgotten. After my arrest I was sent to the military command post. I spent almost a day there. The next day the military investigator from the military procuracy of the Moscow Military District arrived--he was the chief of the investigation division, Colonel Morin. I emphasize that he was a representative of the procuracy! Incidentally he came with a representative of the Main Military Procuracy. They came with a platoon of special-purpose militiamen and representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and took me to the 109th Division. That I will never forget!... They wanted to break my morale; they probably thought that all it would take would be one stressful blow and they could wind me around their finger. At 0300 in the morning they were working me over with cross interrogation, constantly bringing in militiamen from the division, who were half drunk to boot. Chance helped to get me out of there alive. I told them: I will testify only through my wife, after she calls a lawyer. And I also told them directly if anything happens to me that you have thought up, things will go badly for you as well. I no longer had anything to lose. But they stopped the physical torture. But they continuously threatened to shoot me if I tried to escape...they brought me to the point where the doctor insisted on immediate hospitalization. But the investigator had received a categorical instruction--in no case send him to the hospital. The vehicle with the special purpose militia detachment was constantly at my side. They would take me in the vehicle--there were five automatic riflemen with me, in front--a car and behind--a bus. They took me to the doctor--also surrounded by automatic riflemen, and I was in handcuffs, I could barely stand on my feet, I could barely move...and that is the way it was until they put me in the detention cell.... [Garifullina] Were you surprised that the army participated in those events and on the side of the ones committing the coup d'etat? [Terekhov] That, of course, is the most difficult and bitter question. It is difficult to accuse the entire army, although I am not now inclined to defend the military. On the contrary! Most of the officers in this conflict proved themselves to be helpless and indifferent individuals. I do not want to generalize, I am speaking only about those who looked on apathetically at what was happening in the House of Soviets...they all waited, quieted down, and continued as if there were nothing for them to do. If the Supreme Soviet had won they all would have shouted for joy, fired into the air, saluted, and rushed back to their jobs. This is how morally degraded our power structures are! I think we will have to work very long and hard to make the sense of duty and honor correspond to the ranks, shoulder boards, and positions.... Maybe it is not right to accuse those who were in the military units. If the order had been clear and if they had done preparatory work, what we could have hoped for! But they tell us: You are the Union of Officers. Yes, we, the Union of Officers, sent all of our forces there. But in the final analysis we are a public organization, we do not train terrorist groups, and we are not a state structure with weapons, vehicles, and everything else. We express the position of a certain part of the population. But there are people who, because of their service duty, respond--the vice president, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the power ministries.... But to reproach the officers we have left...our officers--regardless of whether they were full time or reserve--went and stayed until the end, they were the last to leave, and all this was under gunfire. [Garifullina] But why did we still suffer a defeat? [Terekhov] You have touched upon what is really the most painful and bitter subject. Believe me, in jail during those sleepless nights I was tortured by the question of why all this happened. And I will tell you frankly that this is the lesson I learned. The high leaders, placed in an extreme situation, should have thought everything through ahead of time and made wise decisions...their passivity, their inactivity, and even lack of talent with respect to many issues--I do not want to go into this now--contributed to the defeat. I attended meetings of the high leaders with the participation of Rutskoy, Makashov, and Achalov, who were supposed to organize a powerful resistance, which was the main thing at the time. The tasks were set but as though for God himself: There was no mechanism for specific people to carry out the orders. Even at that time I understood that we were hostages. I circulated in the high spheres and at the same time I had sources of information in the lower structures. We found ourselves surrounded by flags and sooner or later the shooting had to begin. And it began.... [Garifullina] The president is preparing a memorandum concerning accord. There are also other forces that are calling for us to reach out to one another--this is from the opposition. How do you feel about these proposals? [Terekhov] In principle it is natural to speak about accord and civil peace. We too are in favor of this. The form in which it is expressed and by whom are another matter. I personally do not intend to sign any agreements with people who are criminals and want to make me one. Second, and I want to emphasize this especially: Some people want their hands untied so that they can continue their shameless behavior, their unlawful and illegal activity to plunder the country. And they will "push" for this, tying the hands and feet of those who sign it. But let them sign their own paper and swear that they will never again fire weapons at the people, they will never again bring a tank out into the square, let them admit to their own people that they committed a crime and are prepared to take responsibility for this under the law or at least agree to early elections. And indicate this in a memorandum and then I will sign it.... [Garifullina] What are your immediate plans? [Terekhov] On 18 April we held the all-Union congress of the Union of Officers. Our telephone number is 257-01-68. Our purpose is to evaluate the situation, draw lessons from the October tragedy, and map out the future. We want to determine what is left of us in this stage, which forces we have preserved. As a public organization we are acting independently, we were not, and now we certainly will not be and do not want to be considered a military detachment of the CPSU, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, or any other, say, monarchist or national party. The Union of Officers is strengthening its roots, its foundations as military statesmen. At the same time I have understood for a long time that it is not enough to conduct active political work within the framework of the Union of Officers. We need a new independent political structure. But we want to preserve the basic principles on which the Union of Officers was built: These are statehood, great power status, patriotism, honor, and dignity. These are the precise goals a great-power party proclaims. [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you spent a total of 157 days in Lefortovo and, without exaggeration, you looked death in the face. This is true. Tell us, were you always optimistic or did you despair and have a sense of hopelessness? [Terekhov] Sometimes I had the feeling there was no way out. I knew that I was threatened with more than one sentence. They hit me with four charges, and two of them were serious, including especially dangerous state crimes--15 years apiece. Of all the people in jail nobody had more charges filed against them than I did: four of them! I understood that they would want to put me in jail, and that even if I beat my head against the wall I would not get out of there. And I was seized by hopelessness.... But I had confidence in the fact that this could not go on forever. In any case, these people would not live forever. [Garifullina] Did your family have a hard time without you? [Terekhov] If I believed in anyone to the very end it was my wife and family. I was simply moved by their moral steadfastness. Larisa and I have three daughters: The eldest is 17, she is finishing school, and she intends to enter a legal institute; the middle one is nine, and the youngest is a sixth grader. I received this apartment through my job but on 23 September I was discharged from the army; they quickly documented this with an order after the fact both from the minister and the academy. They apparently thought that after a person has been in jail he will not worry about violations with his discharge. Now, naturally, I will be reinstated, and again through the court. So, about my family. Larisa Aleksandrovna is a great person. Not every woman is capable of going through what she has been through. I have brought out in her capabilities which even I did not suspect she had. [Garifullina] Who do you consider to be your teachers? [Terekhov] I have had many teachers; I consider them to be the people who have gone through the school of life. I served in Nerchinsk, where they exiled the Decembrists, in Chita, Ulan-Ude, Krasnyy Chekoy, Sakhalin, and several places that are not even on the map...there my teachers were the commanders with whom I served. In recent years my teachers on the political plane have been those who have been caught up in the overall struggle. Some of them have strong points which I do not have. I learn from them. From Zhirinovskiy I learned one thing; everyone is learning from him now, incidentally. From Zyuganov--another thing, from Baburin--a third thing, from Sterligov--a fourth thing...these political figures have created themselves. How did they do it? What is keeping them from becoming nationwide leaders? In this sense I have no idol or guiding star. In prison I had a chance to think about everything unhurriedly, to sum up the past and think about the future if such a possibility were to present itself. Fortunately, it did present itself. I am back with my comrades again and life and the struggle continue....
