A co-chairman of Democratic Russia, priest Gleb Yakunin told Interfax Wednesday that "all democratic and centrist forces must unite to nominate a single candidate for the presidency, otherwise a nationwide disaster will happen." In his opinion, such politicians as Yegor Gaydar, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy or Sergey Shakhray have very little chance of winning the presidential elections in 1996, as all of them are inferior to Solzhenitsyn. At the same time, Yakunin said he was concerned and worried over some of the statements by Solzhenitsyn who had returned to Russia last month after a 20-year exile with respect to the national policy and the "Gaydar-Chubays line in the implementation of economic reforms." However, Solzhenitsyn's point of view may change as he gets to know Russian reality. According to the Russian Constitution, a citizen residing in Russia for no fewer than ten years may be elected as president.
