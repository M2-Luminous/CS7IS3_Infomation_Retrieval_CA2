Investigations had been under way since September 1993. In total, eight persons were found, but the heads of the drug ring, the couple Peter (42) and Ritua S. (38), have disappeared without a trace. The two are probably in India. From there the drugs had been smuggled to Austria for years, by means of condoms filled with drugs, which were swallowed. In the course of the investigations, a cocaine link with Poland was also discovered.
