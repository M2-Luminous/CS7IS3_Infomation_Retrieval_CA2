FR941207-2-00068 FR941207-2-00054 Biweekly Notice Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations I. Background Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from November 14, 1994, through November 25, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on November 23, 1994 (59 FR 60377). Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for each amendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. By January 6, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to (Project Director) : petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and 50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of amendments request: October 25, 1994 Description of amendments request: The proposed change would delete the remainder of Appendix B, Environmental Technical Specifications, including section 2/3.3.1, Water Level in the Discharge Canal, and Section 2/3.4, Meteorology. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Hydraulic - Water level in the Discharge Canal 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The deletion of the discharge canal specification of 4.5 [plus or minus] 1 ft mean sea level (msl) with daily monitoring still leaves the operating restrictions delineated in Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 2.4.8.3.3 (4.5 [plus or minus] 2 ft msl) and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements to minimize the impact of the discharge canal on the local groundwater supply. As stated in this UFSAR section, the effect on the local ground water regime will be minimal within this band. Level recorders in the control room facilitate the continued monitoring the discharge canal level in excess of the Appendix B Environment Technical Specification (ETS) listed daily surveillance. This change in no way affects the design or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The discharge canal level is an environmental concern with the effects of a spill of radioactive liquids (UFSAR Section 2.4.12.3) being a path to the intake canal, due to the areas natural gradient. With the estimated travel time for the liquid to reach the canal (intake) at 60 years, and the large flow rate the degree of dilution is such that this does not pose a threat to local wells. The amendment would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment; therefore, no new credible accidents are created. In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability of the response systems to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated; therefore, no new or different accident would result from this change. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The existence of these ETS does not provide a margin of safety related to the nuclear operation of the site. No safety limits are affected by this change. Therefore, this amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety. Meteorology 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The deletion of the meteorology specification still leaves the program delineated in UFSAR Section 2.3.3, Onsite Meteorological Measurements Program, and reporting/recording of the hourly meteorological data required to support Technical Specification 6.9.1.10.a, Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report. This program is based on the meteorological monitoring program described in Regulatory Guide 1.23, and NUREG-0654. While the existing ETS 30 day reporting requirement for extended out-of-service time and shiftly manual acquisition of data during batch or accidental releases are not otherwise covered, the program does contain the Regulatory Guide 1.23 reference to 90% data recovery and a backup phone line is available for data retrieval. This proposed amendment in no way affects the design or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The meteorological monitoring program is specified in UFSAR Section 2.3.3. The amendment would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment; therefore, no new credible accidents are created. In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability of the response systems to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated nor would the amendment reduce the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Plan; therefore, no new or different accident would result from this change. 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The meteorological ETS does not provide any additional margin of safety related to the operation of a nuclear plant. The meteorological program established in the UFSAR covers the requirements stated in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50 by providing meteorological systems adequate for determining the magnitude of, and for continuously assessing the impact of, the release of radioactive materials to the environment. The meteorological instrumentation is used to measure environmental parameters which may affect distribution of fission products and gases following a Design Basis Accident (DBA); however, it is not a primary success path for the mitigation of a DBA. No safety limits are affected by this change. Therefore, this amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety. Local Public Document Room location: University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297. Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: William H. Bateman Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and 50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County, North Carolina Date of amendments request: October 28, 1994 Description of amendments request: The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications to increase the surveillance test intervals and allowable out-of-service times for selected instrumentation addressed in Section 3/4.3. The proposed changes would permit specified channel functional tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. Specifically, the proposed changes would revise the surveillance test intervals and allowable out-of-service times for the reactor protection system instrumentation, isolation actuation instrumentation, emergency core cooling system actuation instrumentation, control rod withdrawal block instumentation, control room emergency ventilation system instrumentation, anticipated transient without scram - recirculation pump trip system instrumentation, end-of-cycle recirculation pump trip system instrumentation, and reactor core isolation cooling system actuation instrumentation, in accordance with NRC-approved General Electric Company Licensing Topical Reports and NUREG-1433, Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30851P-A, assessed the impact of changing RPS surveillance test intervals (STIs) and allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) on the RPS failure frequency, the scram frequency and equipment cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4, ``Significant Hazards Assessment'' of NEDC-30851P-1 states: ``Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a decrease of approximately one percent in core damage frequency''. This decrease is based upon the following: * Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3 scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant specific Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8. * The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even lower (less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients Without Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF due to fewer scrams. * The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease in core damage frequency. * The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service time is negligible.'' From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase in probability of a a scram failure due to RPS unavailablity is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident is decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in fewer inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The proprietary plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal (Enclosure 6) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic plant analyzed in LTR NEDC-30851P-A, the net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions. The generic Licensing Topical Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC 31677P-A, assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for BWR Isolation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 states: ``The results indicate that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicate that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowable out-of service times for RPS and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations.'' and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states: ``A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis can be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The chief contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs will cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase (10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months.'' From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase in probability of an isolation failure due to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. For those parameters common to RPS, the overall probability of an accident is actually decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific evaluation provided with this submittal (Enclosure 8) demonstrates that the conclusions of the generic analyses are applicable to BSEP Units 1 and 2. The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2), assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for all BWR ECCS Actuation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30936P-A (Part 2) states: ``The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety.'' From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase in probability of a water injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal (Enclosure 7) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A, the net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions. The generic Licensing Topical Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, and GENE-770-06-1-A assessed the impact of changing Control Rod Block STIs and AOTs on Rod Block failure frequency. GENE-770-06-1-A also assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on ATWS-RPT and EOC-RPT failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory's Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment 2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states: 1``The BWR Owners' Group proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for BWR control rod block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals from one to three months. These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the Reactor Protection System. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will be no significant changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented. In addition, there will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing.'' and Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states: ``Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation to overall plant safety.'' Based on the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes to Control Rod Withdrawal Block instrumentation do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Also, based on the generic assessment in GENE-770-06-1-A, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes to the ATWS-RPT and EOC-RPT instrumentation do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-06-2P-A, assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on BWR RCIC failure frequency. Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-2P-A states: ``The STI and AOT changes to the RCIC actuation instrumentation are justified based on their small effect on the water injection function unavailability and consistency with comparable changes to actuation instrumentation for the other ECCS subsystems.'' On this basis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes to RCIC instrumentation do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not alter the physical characteristics or function of any plant systems or components and they do not introduce any new mode of operation. Therefore, system and component performance would not be challenged in a manner that could create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the LTRs and has concurred with the BWR Owners' Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the probability of failure or availability of the affected Instrument Systems. The proposed changes to AOTs provide realistic times to complete the required actions without increasing the overall instrument failure frequency. Likewise, the extended STIs do not result in significant changes in the probability of instrument failure. Furthermore, the proposed changes will reduce the probability of test-induced plant transients and equipment failures. Finally, instrument setpoint drift will remain within present tolerances, thereby assuring that the margin of safety, as demonstrated by applicable safety analyses, remains unchanged. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes would not result in a reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: University of North Carolina at Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S. College Road, Wilmington, North Carolina 28403-3297. Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: William H. Bateman Carolina Power & Light Company, Docket No. 50-261, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, Darlington County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: November 4, 1994 Description of amendment request: The requested amendment will change the testing frequency of the turbine overspeed protection valves from monthly to quarterly. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The requested change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The requested change will have no influence on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The accident of concern to this requested change is a turbine overspeed with missile generation impacting safety related components or structures. The evaluation in WCAP-11525 shows that the probability of a missile ejection incident will not be affected with the requested frequency reduction to the turbine overspeed protection valve surveillance test. There is no change to the consequences of the event as the postulated accident event is unchanged. Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The change affects the test interval for the turbine overspeed protection valves and does not change the design, operation, or failure modes of the valves and other components in the turbine overspeed protection system. Therefore, the requested change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The requested change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The probability of turbine overspeed with an extension of the testing interval has been determined to be within applicable acceptance criteria. The change does not affect the design, operation, or failure modes of the valves or other components in the turbine overspeed protection system. Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Hartsville Memorial Library, 147 West College Avenue, Hartsville, South Carolina 29550 Attorney for licensee: R. E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551, Raleigh, North Carolina 27602 NRC Project Director: William H. Bateman Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. STN 50-454 and STN 50-455, Byron Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Ogle County, Illinois Docket Nos. STN 50-456 and STN 50-457, Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Will County, Illinois Date of amendment request: November 7, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would allow an increase to the allowable nominal fuel enrichment from 4.2 to 5.0 weight percent Uranium-235 (w/o U-235). The changes include: (1) increasing the allowable storage enrichment in Region 1 and allowing the use of Integral Fuel Burnable Absorbers (IFBAs) for reactivity equivalencing, (2) revising the Region 2 discharge burnup curve to include nominal fuel enrichments up to 5.0 w/o U-235, and (3) making editorial changes. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to Section 5 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The fuel enrichment increase will not affect reactor operation or the core design methods. The physical characteristics of the fuel assemblies are not changed, and fuel assembly movement will continue to be controlled by approved fuel handling procedures. Reload core designs will continue to be performed on a cycle by cycle bases as part of the reload safety evaluation process, using NRC approved codes and methods. Each reload design is evaluated to confirm that the cycle core design adheres to the limits that exist in the accident analyses and Technical Specifications to ensure that reactor operation is acceptable. The proposed changes are consistent with the analysis performed in the ``Criticality Analysis of Byron and Braidwood Station Fuel Storage Racks.'' The analysis was revised in June 1994 to include boraflex gaps and shrinkage. The revised analysis is provided in the proposed Technical Specification amendment. The analysis methodology has been previously accepted by the NRC and is consistent with the appropriate standards to establish the K eff limit for storage racks and to calculate the maximum K eff . The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated accident of a misloaded fuel assembly and has shown that having at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The concentration of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively controlled, is sufficient to maintain K eff less than or equal to 0.95. The analysis is bounding for a dropped fuel assembly on top of a rack or between rack modules, loss of cooling systems, and reduction the fuel pool temperature to less than 50 ○F. The proposed changes do not impact any other accident previously evaluated in the [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] UFSAR. There is no postulated accident that could cause reactivity to increase beyond the analyzed conditions in the spent fuel racks. There is no impact on the ability of the Spent Fuel Pool cooling system to maintain the bulk pool temperature within limits. The UFSAR analysis performed to calculate the maximum fuel cladding temperature and spent fuel pool cooling include assumptions which bound the use of more highly enriched fuel assemblies. Although fuel enrichment is not a specific assumption in any of these analyses, the heat load of a typical core offload may change with higher enrichments. The average burnup of the offload will be increased since few assemblies will be used per cycle; however, the new heat load will continue to be [bound] by the UFSAR analysis because the spent fuel pool racks have been analyzed for a total core offload with all fuel assemblies having 4.5 years of operating time. The radiological consequences analysis continues to bound the licensed fuel burnup and enrichment at Byron and Braidwood stations. The radiological consequences analysis results are a function of the core inventory of radioactive isotopes. Since the maximum fuel burnup limits and fuel peaking factors will not be exceeded, the assumed fission product inventory will remain valid; therefore, the limits of 10 CFR [Part] 100 continue to be met. Additionally, Byron and Braidwood addressed the issue of the impact on the radiation levels at the pool surface to the worker during non-accident conditions. These conditions are not changed as [a] result of this submittal, because the average fuel assembly burnup limit (isotopic inventory) and maximum power produced in each fuel assembly will not be changed by the increased fuel enrichment. B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. Each reactor core design will continue to meet all design requirements; operation of the core will not be affected. No modifications to the spent fuel pool are being pursued and the fuel parameters used in the analysis remain bounding. The method and manner in which the fuel will be stored in the spent fuel pool has not changed. The proposed changes ensure that 17X17 (Optimized Fuel Assembly, VANTAGE 5, VANTAGE +, and PERFORMANCE +) fuel assemblies can be safely stored, maintaining a K eff less than or equal to 0.95 under full water density conditions, in both Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel pool. All design criteria and criticality acceptance criteria continue to be met. The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated accident (misloaded fuel assembly) and has shown that having at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The level of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively controlled, is sufficient to maintain K eff less than or equal to 0.95. The reanalysis to increase the storage enrichment of fuel in Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel pool does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Additionally, approval of this amendment will not create a new accident with regards to the new fuel storage vault which is designed to handle the increased enrichment. The Byron and Braidwood new fuel vaults were previously analyzed using NRC accepted criticality analysis methodology in June 1989. This analysis was performed to increase the storage enrichment of the New Fuel Vault to 5.0 w/o U-235. The New Fuel Vault analysis was submitted to the NRC and is the current licensing basis. C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. All reactor design criteria will continue to be met. The methodologies used in the accident analyses have been accepted previously by the NRC and all criticality acceptance criteria have been met under all assumed conditions (normal and accident). The design basis for preventing criticality outside the reactor is that, including uncertainties, there is a 95 percent probability at a 95 percent confidence level that the effective neutron multiplication factor, K eff , of the fuel assembly array will be less than 0.95 as recommended by ANSI 57.2-1983 and OT Position Paper for Review and Acceptance of Spent Fuel Storage and Handling Applications, dated April 14, 1978. The analyses for both Regions 1 and 2 fuel storage were verified to meet the above design basis. The criticality analysis for Regions 1 and 2 has been revised to allow for storage of fuel assemblies with enrichments up to 5.0 w/o U-235. The proposed Technical Specification changes include those changes necessary to maintain K eff less than or equal to 0.95, including conservative allowances for uncertainties and biases, when the pool is flooded with unborated water. The proposed changes include a requirement for fuel assemblies with enrichments above 4.2 w/o U-235 to contain sufficient integral fuel burnable absorbers such that the maximum reference fuel K infinity is less than or equal to 1.470 in unborated water at 68 ○F due to restrictions on spent fuel storage. Should a postulated accident occur which causes a reactivity increase in the Byron and Braidwood Spent Fuel Pools, K eff will be maintained less than or equal to 0.95 due to the presence of at least 300 ppm of soluble boron in the spent fuel pool. The proposed changes do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. The proposed changes ensure that the design basis for preventing criticality in the fuel storage areas is preserved, and fuel cycle designs will continue to be analyzed using NRC accepted codes and methods to ensure the design bases are satisfied. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The Program Plans provide a methodology to be followed for scheduling plant modifications and engineering evaluations. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: YAPCO and NNECO have reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and conclude that the changes do not involve a SHC [significant hazards consideration]. The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. Operation of the facilities in accordance with these proposed changes would require the implementation of the IIS methodology described in the Program Plans. As such, it requires that CYAPCO and NNECO establish an administrative means for tracking, prioritizing, and scheduling NRC-required plant modifications and engineering evaluations, and licensee identified plant improvement projects. This methodology is intended to enhance plant safety by more effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues required for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, it does not affect directly the design or operation of the plant. Therefore, no accident analyses are affected and the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed license conditions establish a requirement related to scheduling of modifications and engineering evaluations. Because the license conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect directly the design or operation of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed license conditions renew administrative requirements intended to enhance public safety and reliable plant operation. The proposed license conditions do not affect any accident analyses, directly modify the plant configurations, or change the way the plants are operated. The methodologies are intended to enhance plant safety by more effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues required for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect directly the design or operation of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Attorney for licensee: Ms. L. M. Cuoco, Senior Nuclear Counsel, Northeast Utilities Service Company, Post Office Box 270, Hartford, CT 06141-0270. NRC Project Director: Phillip F. McKee Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York Date of amendment request: August 5, 1994, as supplemented on November 17, 1994. Description of amendment request: This amendment is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the Federal Register on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30242), which changed the Technical Specifications (TSs) Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance tests: (1) Charging Flow Instrumentation (2) Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump, and Reactor Cavity Continuous Level Instrument Channels (3) Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate Channel (4) Control Room Air Filtration System (5) Post Accident Containment Venting System (6) Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel (7) Steam Generator Blowdown Flow Channel (8) Liquid Waste Distillate Tank Level Channels (9) Primary Water Storage Tank Level Instrumentation (10) Flow Rate Monitors; Plant Vent (Unit 2) and Stack Vent (Unit 1) (11) Stack Vent Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-60) (12) High Pressure Water Fire Protection System (13) Fire Protection System Diesel Engine (14) Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building, and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems; (A) System Functional Test and (B) Spray Header Visual Inspection (15) Penetration Fire Barriers (16) Smoke Detectors/Electrical Penetration Area Inside Containment (17) Functional Testing of Containment Sump Pumps The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.'' Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) Charging Flow Instrumentation The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur. It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Charging Flow instrumentation be changed from 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. (2) Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump, and Reactor Cavity Continuous Level Instrument Channels The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the calibration and test frequency for the Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump and Reactor Cavity continuous level monitoring instrument channels be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. (3) Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate Channel The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate channel be revised from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the existing technical specification limits and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions to assure that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists between the current Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. (4) Control Room Air Filtration System The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Control Room Air Filtration System be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). For the flow tests, data from 1986 to date indicates that the Control Room Filtration System performed in an acceptable manner when surveilled on an 18 month (+25%) basis. The only discrepancy was due to a hardware error and was independent of the time between surveillances. Per Generic Letter 91-04, this past test history provides an adequate basis to conclude that an extended operating cycle would have minimal impact upon the flow characteristics of the Control Room Filtration System. The modification of the filtration system in 1993 only enhanced system performance. With regard to the absorbance properties of the charcoal, previous test data highlights a problem occurring during the 1986-1987 period which subsequent testing confirms was adequately resolved. With the 1993 modification which increased the carbon bed thickness from 1'' to 4'', performance can only be enhanced. Therefore, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which were time dependent. The modification, which was performed in 1993, can only enhance performance of the system. New fans, an increased charcoal bed thickness, and new HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters will increase the reliability of the system. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than that previously evaluated has not been created. 3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety. Past test data validated the acceptability of the previous air filtration system for an extended surveillance interval. The modification performed in 1993 will only enhance the reliability and performance of the air filtration system. Thus, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is not involved. (5) Post Accident Containment Venting System The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Post Accident Containment Venting system be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). A review of past test history from 1986 to date indicates that the Post Accident Containment Venting System performed in a satisfactory manner when the surveillance period was 18 months (+25%). There was one discrepant condition noted in the 1989 test, which, based upon subsequent tests in 1991 and 1993, does not appear to have been age related. The 1989 observation concerning a gasket is considered to be a one time only event and unlikely to reoccur as a result of extending the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 (+25%). An added consideration, in terms of safety significance, is the fact that the Post Accident Containment Venting system is diverse and redundant to the post accident hydrogen recombiners which are themselves redundant and the primary means of reducing the post accident hydrogen concentration within containment. The venting system is not relied upon for containment pressure control. Due to the satisfactory past test history of the venting system, together with its secondary role as a means of controlling post accident hydrogen concentration, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which are considered to be time dependent. Although one discrepant condition was observed in the 1989 test it was not repeated in subsequent surveillances. Per Generic Letter 91-04, this constitutes a sufficient basis for revising the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25) to 24 months (+25%). This extension in the operating interval is not expected to have an impact upon the availability of the system. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated has not been created. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. As past test data validates the presumption that an extended operating cycle will not impact the availability of the Post Accident Containment Venting Systems, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is not involved. (6) Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel be revised from every 18 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will be set to provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. (7) Steam Generator Blowdown Flow Channel The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Steam Generator Blowdown Flow channel be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. (8) Liquid Waste Distillate Tank Level Channels The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Waste Distillate Tank level of tanks 13 and 14 be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will be set to provided protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. (9) Primary Water Storage Tank Level Instrumentation The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Primary Water Storage Tank Level instrumentation be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month surveillance has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting form a 30 month surveillance. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in surveillance interval will result in a channel statistical allowance which can be accommodated over a 30 month operating cycle. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety. The above changes in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. (10) Flow Rate Monitors; Plant Vent (Unit 2) and Stack Vent (Unit 1) The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the flow rate monitors for the Plant Vent (Unit 2) and the Stack Vent (Unit 1) be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will be calibrated to provide data to assure that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an previously evaluated from occurring. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change in the surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. (11) Stack Vent Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-60) The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the stack vent noble gas activity monitor be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). The current monitor replaced the previous monitor and therefore there is only one refueling cycle surveillance data available which proved to be satisfactory. The vendor recommends a calibration period based on user experience. Insofar as the 18 month (+25%) surveillance has proven to be acceptable, extension to a 24 month (+25%) cycle is consistent with the vendor's recommendation. Any additional uncertainty generated due to the extended surveillance is bounded by the uncertainty inherent in a grab sample taken once per 24 hours which is the required compensatory action should the monitor be inoperable. Since setpoints for alarms are not critical to either plant operation or safety, since extensive margin is reflected between the setpoint and applicable limits, it is concluded that any additional uncertainty involved in a longer surveillance cycle will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. This monitor measures the activity of potentially radioactive gaseous effluent through the stack vent. The alarm setpoints are set at a point sufficiently above expected radioactivity levels to avoid unnecessary alarms and, at the same time, far below discharge limits. The purpose of the monitor is to annunciate in the event an unexpected spike in radioactivity level should occur so that corrective action can be taken prior to exceeding a discharge limit. The margin that exists between the discharge limit and the setpoint is more than sufficient to accommodate any drift that could be practically expected in a 24 month (+25%) operating cycle. In this capacity, the monitor does not have setpoints which are critical to plant operation or safety. Readings are not used in a quantitative manner nor is accuracy important. It is important that the instrument remain operable and respond to step changes in radioactivity level over the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that an extended operating cycle will not result in the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Sufficient margin exists between plant setpoints and applicable limits to accommodate any realistic drift projected to occur over a 30 month operating cycle. Furthermore, instrument indications are not used in a quantitative manner nor is instrument accuracy of importance. Therefore, it is concluded that no significant reduction in the margin of safety will result from an extended operating cycle. (12) High Pressure Water Fire Protection System The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the system functional test of the High-pressure Water Fire Protection System be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). This system is a static system which is not normally required to operate. The main fire pumps are on standby and are not in operation except for testing. Thus, almost no wear is induced as a function of time except that which results from being in standby status which is minimal and slow acting. Under these circumstances, extending the operating cycle between surveillances would be expected to have negligible affect upon system operability. It is therefore concluded that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as a result of an extended interval between surveillances. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. Extension of the plant operating cycle will primarily extend the time the pumps are in standby capacity. The potential for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur will be slow acting with respect to time. A significant deterioration would be detected by a monthly pump operating test. Thus, an extended operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form [from] any previously analyzed. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting. Significant deterioration would be detected by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances will involve no significant reduction in the margin of safety. (13) Fire Protection System Diesel Engine The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the Fire Protection System Diesel Engine Functional test be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). Except for periodic testing, the diesel is in a standby state and not subject to operational stress. Periodic testing imposes limited wear as evidenced by the absence of major repairs during past maintenance. Extension of the operating cycle for several months is expected to have virtually no impact upon diesel operability. Monthly testing would detect any degradation. Thus it is concluded that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as a result of an extended interval between surveillances. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. Extension of the plant operating cycle will, for the most part, only extend the time spent by the pumps in standby capacity. The potential for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur will be slow acting with respect to time. Significant deterioration in performance would be detected by the monthly pump operating test. Thus, an extended operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting and significant deterioration would be detected by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances will involve no significant reduction in the margin of safety. (14) Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building, and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems; (A) System Functional Test and (B) Spray Header Visual Inspection The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. (a) It is proposed that the functional test surveillance interval for the Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (25%). (b) It is proposed that the Spray Header visual inspection interval be revised from every 18 months (25%) to 24 months (+25%). Extension of the surveillance interval for Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building Fire Protection System functional tests will have virtually no impact upon the operability of these systems. These systems are accessible during normal operation and other sections of the Technical Specifications (4.14.A.1.g.(i) and 4.14.B.1.a(i)) require that the system valve tests be conducted on an annual (12 month) basis. These annual tests would reveal any system deterioration prior to the conclusion of the proposed extended surveillance interval. For the Fan Cooler Fire Protection System as well as the Spray Header itself, evaluation of surveillance data from the past five refueling outages indicates minor discrepancies which would not have impaired system operability. It is therefore concluded that extension of the proposed surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. For the Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building, extension of the surveillance interval will have a negligible affect as other portions of the Technical Specifications require the same surveillance on an annual basis. For the spray header and the fan cooler fire protection system, historical surveillance data validates operability over an 18 month (+25%) interval which lends confidence to conclude that operability will be maintained over a 24 month (+25%) interval. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been introduced. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Extension of the surveillance for two systems will have minimal impact as the Technical Specifications impose more frequent testing for system valves on an annual basis. For the Spray Header and Fan Cooler Fire Protection System, as well as the fire protection system for the Diesel Generator Building and Electrical Tunnel, it can be stated that these systems are static existing mainly in a standby capacity under which little deterioration would be expected. Past surveillance data validates system reliability. It is therefore concluded that increasing the time interval between inspections would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. (15) Penetration Fire Barriers The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the visual inspection frequency of the penetration fire barriers listed in the Technical Specifications be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). The fire barrier penetration seals are static devices existing in standby status. Normal environmental conditions exist during normal plant operations. The only deterioration expected would be that due to aging in a normal ambient which would be minimal to non-existent. Evaluation of unacceptable seals detected during surveillances indicates that initial seal installation was faulty and aging was not the cause. Surveillances during four refueling outages confirm this evaluation. Accordingly, it is not expected that the proposed change in surveillance interval will involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. In the few unacceptable seals detected, the initial installation procedure has been identified as the cause of the problems. Since the seals are static devices which exist in a standby condition and experience normal ambient conditions during normal operation, this would be the expected conclusion. In addition, the fire barriers are just one means of fire protection. Other means of fire protection exist such as fire alarms, sprinklers and heat detectors which provide defense in depth. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed change in the surveillance interval will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from that previously evaluated. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Aging has not been identified as a principle contributor to seal failures. In addition, there exists additional means of fire protection which provides defense in depth. Therefore, the proposed change in surveillance intervals is not expected to involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. (16) Smoke Detectors/Electrical Penetration Area Inside Containment The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the surveillance interval for the smoke detectors located in the electrical penetration area inside containment be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). Based on data taken from six surveillances from 1984 through and including 1993, these devices have proven to be highly reliable. No test failures were observed during this period. Based on the guidance contained in Generic Letter 91-04, this demonstration of reliable performance provides an adequate basis to conclude that the proposed extension in the surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. Only 3 of the 5 detectors are required during normal operation. Past surveillance data from six refueling outages indicate that it is reasonable to expect all 5 detectors will remain operable over the extended operating cycle which provides margin. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. The proven reliability of these devices indicates that a significant reduction in the margin of safety would not be involved in extending the operating cycle to 24 months (+25%). (17) Functional Testing of Containment Sump Pumps The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. It is proposed that the functional test of the Containment Sump Pump be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). No credit is taken within the FSAR for the Containment Sump Pumps as a means of mitigating the consequences of an accident. During normal operation the pumps serve as a means of quantifying leakage inside Containment and therefore serve a safety function in terms of accident prevention. However, in this capacity they are only one of several systems which are capable of serving this function and their failure would not result in a loss of this capability. In addition, evaluation of surveillance data back to 1986 indicates, with one exception, that the devices are very reliable. In one instance, the pumps did not actuate or cause operation within the setpoint tolerance but did operate as required. This was determined not to be a time dependent event. It is therefore concluded that extending the interval between refueling surveillances will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. Also, there exists a Technical Specification requirement to perform almost the same surveillance on a monthly basis in addition to every refueling outage. This monthly test diminishes any potential risk in extending the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. Past surveillance data indicates that pump operation is reliable. In addition, there are alternate means of providing the safety function fulfilled by these pumps. Also, a monthly test is required which would detect any malfunction prior to the end of an extended operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that extending the operating cycle by several months will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Brandenburg, Esq., 4 Irving Place, New York, New York 10003. NRC Project Director: Michael J. Case, Acting Florida Power and Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-335 and 50-389, St. Lucie Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, St. Lucie County, Florida Date of amendment request: November 2, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendments will upgrade existing TS 3/4.6.2.1 and TS 3/4.6.2.3 by adapting the combined specification for Containment Spray and Cooling Systems, contained in the Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering Plants, to the St. Lucie units. The changes account for plant-specific differences and include all related requirements of NUREG-1432, Rev. O, specification 3.6.6A. Accordingly, the proposal is consistent with the Commission's Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements (58 FR 39132). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows: (1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment will upgrade the existing Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) associated with the Containment Cooling and Spray Systems to be consistent with NUREG-1432, Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering Plants. The Containment Cooling and Spray Systems are not initiators of accidents previously evaluated, but are included as part of the success paths associated with mitigating various accidents and transients. The redundancy afforded by Containment Cooling and Spray Systems in conjunction with the requirements of the proposed LCO assures that the safety function of these systems can be accomplished considering single failure criteria. Neither the design nor the safety function of the Containment Cooling and Spray Systems have been altered, and the proposed amendment does not change the applicable plant safety analyses. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license. The changes are administrative in nature in that they do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment, nor do they otherwise alter the design of St. Lucie Unit 1 & 2 systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The safety function of the Containment Cooling System is to provide containment heat removal during normal operation and accident conditions. The safety function of the Containment Spray System is to provide containment heat and iodine removal during accident conditions. The proposed amendment, in conjunction with the redundancy afforded by the Containment Cooling and Spray system design, assures that these safety functions can be accomplished considering single-failure criteria. The bases for required actions and the action completion times specified for inoperable Containment Cooling and Spray trains are consistent with the corresponding specifications in NUREG-1432. The safety analyses for applicable accidents and transients remain unchanged from those previously evaluated and reported in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on the above discussion and the supporting Evaluation of Technical Specification changes, FPL has determined that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Indian River Junior College Library, 3209 Virginia Avenue, Fort Pierce, Florida 34954-9003 Attorney for licensee: Harold F. Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: Mohan Thadani, Acting Houston Lighting & Power Company, City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Central Power and Light Company, City of Austin, Texas, Docket Nos. 50-498 and 50-499, South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 7, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would change the number of diesel generators (emergency power supply) required to be operable during Mode 5 with the loops filled and Mode 6 with greater than or equal to 23 feet of water above the reactor vessel flange. In addition, changes to certain system specifications that are affected by the changes for the emergency power supply were also proposed. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. The equipment which is affected by the technical specification changes proposed here are not precursors to any accident postulated to occur in Modes 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of an accident is not increased. A design review has demonstrated the ability of the required systems to perform their accident mitigation functions for the postulated accidents during Mode 5 and 6 operation. Therefore, it is concluded that an increase in the consequences of the postulated accidents will not result from the proposed Technical Specifications. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The system design, function, and performance is not affected by these specifications. No new equipment interactions are created. Calculations and Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA) have been conducted for selected mechanical systems and show there are no failures which would cause situations where applicable accidents would not be mitigated or which would cause new accidents. On this basis, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The electrical power system specifications support the equipment required to be operable, commensurate with the current level of safety, including the equipment requiring a diesel backed power source. The design review results demonstrate that operation in Modes 5 and 6, in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification changes, is acceptable from an accident mitigation standpoint. The basic Modes 5 and 6 plant system functions are not changed. On this basis, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Wharton County Junior College, J. M. Hodges, Learning Center, 911 Boling Highway, Wharton, Texas 77488 Attorney for licensee: Jack R. Newman, Esq., Newman & Holtzinger, P.C., 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner Houston Lighting & Power Company, City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Central Power and Light Company, City of Austin, Texas, Docket Nos. 50-498 and 50-499, South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 7, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would permit both containment personnel airlock doors to be open while moving fuel during refueling operations. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.9.4, Containment Building Penetrations, would allow the containment personnel airlock to be open during fuel movement and core alterations. The containment personnel airlock is closed during fuel movement and core alterations to prevent the escape of radioactive material in the event of a fuel handling accident. The containment personnel airlock is not an initiator to any accident. Whether the containment personnel airlock doors are open or closed during fuel movement and core alterations has no affect on the probability of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does alter assumptions previously made in evaluating the radiological consequences of the fuel handling accident inside the reactor containment building. The proposed change allows for the containment personnel airlock to be open during refueling. The radiological consequences described in this change are bounded by those given in the South Texas Project Safety Evaluation Report and General Design Criteria 19. All doses for the proposed change are less than the acceptance criteria, therefore, there is no significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously analyzed. The proposed change will significantly reduce the dose to workers in the containment in the event of a fueling handling accident by accelerating the containment evacuation process. The proposed change will also significantly decrease the wear on the containment personnel airlock doors and, consequently, increase the reliability of the containment personnel airlock doors in the event of an accident. Since the probability of a fuel handling accident is unaffected by the airlock door positions, and the increased doses do not exceed acceptance limits, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed change affects a previously evaluated accident, e.g., a fuel handling accident inside containment. The existing accident has been modified to account for the containment personnel airlock doors being opened at the time of the accident. It does not represent a significant change in the configuration or operation of the plant and, therefore, does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The margin of safety is reduced when the offsite and control room doses exceed the acceptance criteria in the STP SER. As previously discussed in the response to question 1, the offsite and control room doses are below the acceptance criteria. Therefore, this proposed change does not significantly reduce the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Wharton County Junior College, J. M.

Beckner Houston Lighting & Power Company, City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Central Power and Light Company, City of Austin, Texas, Docket Nos. 50-498 and 50-499, South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 8, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would require only one of the two battery chargers associated with each Class 1E 125 VDC Channel I and Channel IV to be operable. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. A single charger is able to maintain the operability of Channel I or Channel IV at the design loading with a single failure condition. The proposed change does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously evaluated accidents. The consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not increased. On this basis, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel IV. The failure modes and operating modes would then be identical for all four STPEGS Class 1E DC channels. Failure modes and effects analyses already performed for DC Channels II and III would thus become applicable to Channels I and IV also. The change proposed by this Technical Specification revision is bounded by the failure modes and effects analysis provided as Table 8.3-8 of the STPEGS UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report]. On this basis, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel IV. The number and capacity of DC channels required is not affected by the proposed change. The electrical loads supported by these DC channels are not changed and the duration of their function is not impacted. On this basis, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Wharton County Junior College, J. M.

Beckner Houston Lighting & Power Company, City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Central Power and Light Company, City of Austin, Texas, Docket Nos. 50-498 and 50-499, South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 8, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would permit the substitution of an extended range neutron flux monitor for one of the source range neutron flux monitors during refueling operations. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as previously evaluated. During refueling operations, the Source Range channels are used only for monitoring changes in core reactivity, and does not provide inputs for automatically actuated equipment. The same function could be performed by an Extended Range channel. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. By providing the intended redundant core reactivity monitoring, neither the possibility or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are increased. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. During refueling operations, the Source Range Monitors are used simply as monitoring instrumentation. Extended Range Monitors are capable of performing this function. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. The proposed change would require revision of STP refueling procedures. However, the physical movement of fuel assemblies is within the scope of current refueling procedures. No new mechanism for fuel misloading or damage or boron dilution would be created by the change. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change provides core reactivity monitoring comparable to that provided by the use of the Source Range channels. The Extended Range channel is capable of detecting core reactivity changes and provides the intended redundancy. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. No margin of safety is compromised by this change. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Wharton County Junior College, J. M.

Beckner Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-309, Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station, Lincoln County, Maine Date of amendment request: October 24, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specifications Table 4.1-3 surveillance requirements for new emergency feedwater flow instrumentation. Specifically, the currently installed analog feedwater flow transmitters would be replaced by new, digital-type flow transmitters. The new digital flow emergency feedwater flow transmitters are continuously self-checking and have a recommended calibration interval of 9 years. The licensee proposes to verify flow whenever the system operates and send one transmitter back to the manufacturer for recalibration every refueling outage. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's analysis is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Performance of Technical Specifications Table 4.1-3 (items 10 a and b) ensures the emergency feedwater flow transmitters are operable when required. The proposed change will continue to ensure operabililty and therefore will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Emergency feedwater flow transmitter operability verification is maintained, with no change to the system's configuration. Thus, there is no unique operating condition that could adversely affect system functional performance. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no change to any Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 14 (Safety Analysis) event. There is no change to the demonstration of component operability; thus, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The proposed changes are consistent with the guidance of Generic Letter 93-07. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review is presented below. A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature or equipment. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures, there is no affect upon the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed. B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated. The proposed changes merely affect audit and review responsibilities and their deletion or relocation to other controlled documents does not introduce new or different accident scenarios. C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility. Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Exeter Public Library, 47 Front Street, Exeter, NH 03833. Attorney for licensee: Thomas Dignan, Esquire, Ropes & Gray, One International Place, Boston, MA 02110-2624. NRC Project Director: Phillip F. McKee Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO), Docket No. 50-245, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, New London County, Connecticut Date of amendment request: October 14, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed change clarifies the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) requirements as required by Technical Specification 4.5.A.2. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: NNECO has reviewed the proposed change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and concluded that the change does not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. The LPCI flow surveillance requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm does not relate to any previously analyzed accident. There are no accident scenarios which rely upon three pumps or 15,000 gpm. The existing scenarios are more limiting in that they rely on, at the most, two LPCI pumps. The actual testing of the pumps in accordance with the [inservice testing] IST program and Technical Specification 4.13 will not change. The testing of the pumps currently performed demonstrates that LPCI will function to mitigate the postulated accidents. Therefore, the elimination of the requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm will not involve an increase in the probability or consequence of any previously evaluated accident. The elimination of a requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation can not result in an increase to the probability or consequence of an accident, since no such instrumentation exists, or is required. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposed change will remove a requirement to perform a mathematical evaluation that provides no safety benefit. There is no change in the test methodology currently performed. All four LPCI pumps are tested. Deleting the requirement to verify that three LPCI pumps can produce 15,000 gpm flow does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident. Deleting the requirement to test the LPCI spray header instrumentation can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident, since there is no LPCI header instrumentation. This change corrects an error which was introduced by an earlier License Amendment. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. This change to the LPCI testing requirements does not change any of the actual testing, or individual component requirements which exist for the LPCI system. The change to remove the three pump, 15,000 gpm flow requirement eliminates the need to calculate a value which provides no relevant information in ascertaining the ability of the LPCI system to perform its required safety function. The existing testing ensures performance of the LPCI subsystem in accordance with the accident analysis requirements. The intent of the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement remains unchanged. Elimination of the requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation corrects an error introduced in an earlier License Amendment. No LPCI header instrumentation exists, therefore, no credit was taken for such instrumentation in determining the margin of safety. This change can not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since there are no changes to the surveillance requirements for any of the individual components of the LPCI system. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated The proposed license amendments are requested to implement a revision to 10 CFR 50.36a. The requested amendment[s] does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do they affect any accident evaluations. Also, the requested amendments do not involve any physical alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents. The proposed changes would only affect the reporting requirements concerning routine data for radioactive effluents.

Also, the requested amendments do not change the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. The proposed changes would only affect the reporting requirements concerning routine data for radioactive effluents. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated would not be created. 3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety The proposed license amendments are requested to implement a revision to 10 CFR 50.36a. The requested amendment[s] does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do they involve any physical alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents.

Therefore, a significant reduction in the margin of safety would not be involved. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Hannon Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-387 and 50-388 Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania Date of amendment request: October 25, 1994 Description of amendment request: The amendment would add to the Susquehanna Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications, isolation signals to Table 3.6.3-1 for the containment isolation valves on the sample lines for the containment radiation monitoring (CRM) and wetwell sample lines. This change is based on the licensee's design change for installation of a new CRM and wetwell sample system. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not affect any of the postulated initiating events identified in Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis or the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (NUREG 0776). The new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate containment sample lines is isolated from the primary containment under accident conditions. The power and control-power to the CRM from the Class 1E Division I and Division II sources is through electrical isolation schemes so that failure(s) in the CRM under accident conditions is isolated from the Class 1E systems. The addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate sample lines and isolation valves does represent a change in the probability of occurrence of a malfunction of equipment. The addition of the auxiliary relay to the Division I and Division II CAC System containment isolation logic does represent the source of another potential malfunction in the logic due to the additional relay in the circuit. However, the increase in probability due to the additional relay is considered to be so small or insignificant that the change is within the error bounds associated with the original design calculations and does not constitute a significant increase in probability of the overall system malfunction. Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not significantly increase the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety, as previously evaluated in the SAR. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis and NUREG-0776 were reviewed to determine if the proposed action had the potential of creating a postulated initiating event which was not within the spectrum of events which transient or anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions were analyzed. The review did not identify a postulated initiating event which would create the possibility for an accident of a different type. A random single failure in the CRM A or CRM B does not create a malfunction of a different type. A random single failure in the existing containment isolation circuitry, the new isolation valve control circuitry or the new valve position indication circuitry for the new containment isolation valves does not create a malfunction of a different type. The consequences of random single failure of the CRM or the CRM and Wetwell containment isolation valve isolation signal, control and indication circuitry is the same as the existing consequences. Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not create a possibility for an accident or malfunction of a new or different type. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The operability of the primary containment isolation valves for the sample lines to the new CRMs and Wetwell Sample Rack is governed by Technical Specification Section 3/4.6.3 entitled ``Containment Systems, Primary Containment Isolation Valves'' with Table 3.6.3-1 establishing the maximum isolation time. The bases for operability of the primary containment isolation valves is to ensure that the containment atmosphere is isolated from the outside environment in the event of a release of radioactive material to the containment atmosphere or pressurization of the containment. This is consistent with GDC 54 through 57 of 10 CFR 50, Appendix A. The bases for the containment isolation within the time limits specified in Table 3.6.3-1 is for those isolation valves designed to close automatically to ensure that the release of radioactive material to the environment is consistent with the assumptions used in the analyses for a LOCA. The new CRM and Wetwell Sample Rack sample line isolation valves are solenoid valves which close immediately on an accident signal. The proposed action does not affect the operability requirements of Section 3/4.6.3. The margin of safety as defined in the Technical Specification for the containment isolation valves is not affected. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department, 71 South Franklin Street, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18701 Attorney for licensee: Jay Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington, DC 20037 NRC Project Director: John F. Stolz TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 11, 1994 Brief description of amendments: The proposed amendment would modify the technical specifications (TS) by deleting accelerated testing and special reporting requirements for CPSES Units 1 and 2 emergency diesel generators. These changes are based on Generic Letter 94-01, ``Removal of Accelerated Testing and Special Reporting Requirements for Emergency Diesel Generators,'' dated May 31, 1994. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures has no relation to probability or consequences of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. There are no initiating events in accidents previously evaluated that involve testing of EDGs. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. A reduction in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time for maintenance and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement toward ensuring the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe shutdown of the plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions for performance monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish an alternate reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures introduces no new failure modes for the EDGs or other plant systems and therefore has no relation to creation of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The frequency at which EDG testing occurs does not affect the potential failure modes of the EDGs, which have already been assessed in the CPSES design. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? Acceptance limits and failure values are not affected by the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety impact associated with accelerated testing relates to EDG reliability and availability. A reduction in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time for maintenance and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement toward ensuring the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe shutdown of the plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions for performance monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish an alternate reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Edgar, Esq., Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell County, Texas Date of amendment request: November 11, 1994 Brief description of amendments: The proposed amendment would provide for cycle-specific allowances to account for increases in the Heat Flux Hot Channel Factor between monthly surveillances. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes provide for the use of cycle-specific allowances to account for F 2 Q c (z) increases between surveillances. No hardware or setpoint changes are involved; therefore, the changes have no impact on the probability of occurrence of any accident previously analyzed. The proposed changes ensure that F 2 Q c (z) remains within its limit. Thus, the changes do not increase the consequences of any accident previously analyzed. 2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated? The proposed changes provide for the use of a cycle-specific allowances to account for F 2 Q c (z) increases between surveillances. The proposed changes do not involve any hardware or setpoint changes. Therefore the changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? The proposed changes do not affect the failure values of any system or any event acceptance criteria. Higher cycle-specific allowances ensure that remains below its limit between surveillances and within the bounds considered in the safety analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Edgar, Esq., Newman and Holtzinger, 1615 L Street, NW., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20036 NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin Date of amendment request: November 8, 1994 Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications to allow application of a voltage-based repair limit for the steam generator (SG) tube support plate (TSP) intersections experiencing outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: This proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed change will not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions show burst pressures in excess of 5,000 psig for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on five intersections pulled from the Kewaunee SGs with up to a 2 volt indication showed measured tube burst in the range of 9,537 to 9,756 psig. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications show burst pressures in excess of 6,300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and the minimum strength levels, tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety factor requirements of RG 1.121. Tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the presence of the TSPS. Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes with through wall EDM notches 0.75 inch long, when the notch is adjacent to the TSP. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operating conditions, the criterion that must be satisfied to demonstrate adequate tube integrity is a safety margin of 1.43 times MSLB pressure differential. From Figure 3-2 of EPRI report TR-100407, the BOC structural limit for 7/8 inch diameter tubing is 9.6 volts. Applying an allowance of 20% for NDE uncertainty and 50% for crack growth rate over an operating cycle results in a voltage repair limit of 5.6 volts. The proposed repair limit of 2 volts is very conservative when compared to the 5.6 volts taking into account the low average growth rates experienced at Kewaunee and the high tube burst pressures. Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, a plant specific calculation was performed to determine the maximum primary-to-secondary leakage during a postulated MSLB event. The evaluation considered both pre-accident and accident initiated iodine spikes. The results of the evaluation show that the accident spike yielded the limiting leak rate. This case was based on a 30 rem thyroid dose at the site boundary and initial primary and secondary coolant activity levels of 1.0 uCi/gm and 0.1 uCi/gm dose equivalent iodine-131, respectively. A leak rate of 34.0 gpm was determined to be the upper limit for allowable primary to secondary leakage in the SG in the faulted loop. The SG in the intact loop was assumed to leak at a rate of 0.1 gpm (150 gpd). Application of the voltage-based repair limit will be supplemented with a projected EOC MSLB leakage calculation and conditional burst probability assessment. The methodology for performing these calculations will be consistent with that discussed in the draft GL until final guidance is published. Should the projected MSLB leakage be exceeded indications will be repaired or removed from service until the projected leakage is less than or equal to 34.0 gpm. Application of the voltage-based repair limit will not adversely affect SG tube integrity. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Implementation of the proposed voltage-based repair limit will not reduce the overall safety or functional requirements of the SG tube bundles. The tube burst criteria will be satisfied during normal operating conditions by the presence of the TSPs. The RG 1.121 criteria that must be satisfied during accident loading conditions is 1.43 times MSLB differential pressure. Conservatively, the existing data base of burst testing shows that the tube burst margins can be satisfied with bobbin coil signal amplitudes of about 8.82 volts or less regardless of the depth of tube wall penetration. The proposed repair criteria will be supplemented with a reduced operating leakage requirement of 150 gpd average through either SG to preclude the potential for excessive leakage during operating conditions. The 150 gpd restriction will provide for timely leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. The operating leakage limit is based on leak-before break considerations, critical crack length and predicted leakage. The SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained through inservice inspections and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Application of the voltage-based repair criteria has been demonstrated to maintain tube integrity commensurate with the RG 1.121 criteria. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the staff for meeting GDCs 2, 14, 15, 31 and 32. This is accomplished by determining the limiting degradation of SG tubing as established by inservice inspection, beyond which tubes should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the repair criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSPs is not expected to lead to a SG tube rupture event during normal or faulted conditions. The most limiting event would be a potential increase in leakage during a MSLB event. Excessive leakage during a MSLB is precluded by verifying that the expected EOC crack distribution of ODSCC indications at TSP locations would result in an acceptably low primary-to-secondary leakage. Therefore, the radiological consequences from tubes remaining in service is a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 limits. The combined effects of a LOCA plus SSE on the SGs were assessed as required by GDC 2. This issue was addressed for the Kewaunee SGs through the application of leak-before-break (LBB) principles to the primary loop piping. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that the LBB is applicable to the Kewaunee primary loops and, thus, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural design basis of the plant. Excluding breaks in the primary loops, the LOCA loads from the large branch lines were also assessed and found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in SG tube collapse. Based on these analysis results, no tubes are expected to collapse or deform to the degree that secondary-to-primary in-leakage would be increased over currently expected levels. On this basis no tubes need to be excluded from the voltage-based repair criteria for reasons of deformation resulting from combined LOCA and SSE loadings. Addressing the RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria will include a 100% bobbin coil probe inspection of all TSP intersections with known ODSCC down to the lowest cold leg TSP identified. This will be supplemented by a reduced operating leakage limit, enhanced eddy current data analysis guidelines, MRPC inspection requirements and a projected EOC voltage distribution. It is concluded that the proposed change will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
