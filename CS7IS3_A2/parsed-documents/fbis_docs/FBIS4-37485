Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in a talk with correspondents al-Nashashibi said he would base the Palestinian budget and daily expenditures on the collection of taxes. In a few days he intends to establish the nucleus for the Palestinian Finance Ministry in Jericho, and later he will recruit employees and experts who will work in this ministry's offices in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent adds that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat leveled harsh criticism at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers in the Jericho area, saying the IDF still behaves like an occupying Army, blocking the town and barring tourists from entering, although it is clear that tourism is an important economic branch for the regional residents. According to 'Urayqat, one of the IDF officers said at the joint security committee that Jericho can be reoccupied within five minutes, and such a statement only proves the Israeli Army's aggressiveness.
