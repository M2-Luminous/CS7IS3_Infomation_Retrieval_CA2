At the same time, in the words of Vyacheslav Kostikov, the head of state's press secretary, the Russian president well realizes that "there is a question" about violation of human rights in the edict. That is why Boris Yeltsin 22 June sent a letter to Sergey Kovalev, the Russian federation's plenipotentiary for human rights, instructing him to supervise implementation of the edict on protecting the population from organized crime and promising his personal support in this. In turn, Sergey Filatov, head of the russian president's administration, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We do not intend to blindly follow the letter of the document, for it is not a dogma. If we see that citizens' rights are being flouted on the basis of the edict, we shall think about adjusting it."
