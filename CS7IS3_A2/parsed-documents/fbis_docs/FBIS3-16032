In an interview with Interfax on Friday, he declined to comment on the legal aspects of Tbilisi's decision but stressed that "it is for the people of Abkhazia rather than for the parliament of Georgia -- an aggressor country -- to decide on Abkhazia's future." Meanwhile, the Abkhazi lawmaker Yuriy Voronov has remarked in an interview with Interfax: "Georgia's parliament could just as well dismiss U.S. Congress or Russian parliament." The Abkhazi legislator Lev Damenia, for his part, argues that "the Georgian parliament's resolution reaffirms that republic's further reliance on force as a means to resolve the Abkhazi issue." Yet another Abkhazi lawmaker Vladimir Zantaria has suggested that "the decision was undoubtedly prompted by Georgia's desire to set up an international administration in Abkhazia, but that would be occupation already." Abkhazia's First Deputy Premier, lawmaker Leonid Lakerbaya, has declared that "any decision to deploy peace-keepers in Abkhazia would be possible only within the framework of the Geneva accords. The decision testifies to Georgia's rejection of constructive political dialogue," he said. An Interfax correspondent polled 53 Sukhumi residents on Friday. All respondents declared that the decision was illegal. 85 percent of them regard it as a step toward renewed fighting.
