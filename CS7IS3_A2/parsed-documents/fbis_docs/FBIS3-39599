In Austria, the Greens allegedly demanded a special session of parliament on this issue. Vranitzky indirectly referred to criticism by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus concerning Austrian efforts against Temelin, stating that it is true that the autonomous decision by the Czech Republic was in favor of nuclear power, but that there was great readiness for cooperation with Austria on this issue. Thus, Vranitzky mentioned the commission of experts that was established to examine the Bohunice power plant and the opportunity that Austria was given to look at documents of other nuclear power plants and to inspect them. In addition, Austria made financial contributions to a number of studies on energy policy and ecological aspects. Austria's offer to supply free electricity worth 3.5 billion schillings in the event of a shutdown of Bohunice was rejected by the Czech Republic for reasons of principle. [passage omitted]
