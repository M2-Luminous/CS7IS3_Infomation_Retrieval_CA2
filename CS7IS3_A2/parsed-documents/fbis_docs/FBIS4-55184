[Izetbegovic] The talks have been accompanied by many difficulties. The fact that they have already been going for four days shows that things are moving slowly. Anyway, this is not surprising if one knows how difficult the problems on the agenda are -- above all, the problem of the cantons. This is a very complex issue and, as you know, everyone was trying to avoid it, but it eventually had to be dealt with. There is also the problem of the future government of the federation -- that is, its structure and the allocation of cabinet posts. We also have to deal with the issue of free movement and free passage for our refugees. Finally, there is this issue of the presidency; who will be the first president? The two sides have differing views on this issue. [Saracevic] It seems that the issue of the presidency of the federation is the most disputed one. At least, that is the impression one gets from the media. [Izetbegovic] That seems to be the case from the Croatian point of view. They have been forcing this issue from the very beginning as the most important problem. That is why they came here on several occasions. I want to tell our public that from our point of view this is the least important issue when compared with the other problems I have just mentioned. We believe that it is much more important to draw up the correct maps of the cantons, to avoid any mistakes. Such mistakes would be permanent and incorrigible. We also have to open the roads and let the refugees return. Our refugees are facing great difficulties when travelling through Croatia. Croatia introduced visas several days ago. Some people get them, and some do not, even though the main wave of refugees is yet to come. Individuals are having problems at the Croatian border and they are forced to go back. This stops the process of their return. This issue is very important for us and we have placed it at the very top of the agenda. We have said: Let us solve the important issues -- the cantons, the fair allocation of government posts, roads, refugees. As far as the presidency issue is concerned we are even prepared to make a concession. This means that we will not insist on a Bosniak president. This will probably surprise our public, but we think that the other four issues are much more important. If the Croats are flexible over this we will be flexible over the fifth issue, all the more so because we have proposed a six-month mandate. According to the Constitution the mandate of the first president of the federation should last until the elections, which should be called within six months. However, if the elections were not held within six months there would be a rotating presidency. [Saracevic] In your view, can we expect any progress in Vienna? [Izetbegovic] I think that we can, although I was told a little while ago that difficulties still remained and that the Croats were in a hurry and wanted to finish the talks this evening. To tell you the truth, judging by the situation last night -- I have been in contact two or three times a day either with Ganic or with Silajdzic -- well, it cannot all be solved today. However, the Croats have indicated that they only have today to talk because of some other obligations tomorrow and that all should be finalized this evening. Whether this pressure of time will in some way help to make a breakthrough in the current stalemate over some of the issues, we will see. Probably as early as this evening we will know how things stand. My view is that they will probably extend the talks until late this evening and will finish this evening. I am an optimist, [word indistinct] problems must be resolved. Our view is that the Washington agreement must be implemented. I told our delegation that if they needed to talk for another three, four, or even five days -- we must be prepared to oblige to put all the problems behind us. However, the Croats do not seem to be prepared to extend the talks for another two or three days. [Saracevic] Will the proposals for appointments in the future federation be settled in Vienna? [Izetbegovic] If you mean names, I do not think that that should be tackled [in Vienna]. That is something that calls for consultations with all political parties and relevant assembly [parliamentary] commissions, to weigh everything. It was my view, at least it was my suggestion, that no names should be named in Vienna. [Saracevic] Who are the main personalities (you are counting on) in the future federation? [Izetbegovic] Well, these are first the three current vice presidents of the [Muslim] SDA [Party of Democratic Action]: Silajdzic, Ganic, and Bicakcic. Then come the government ministers who have passed their political tests: For instance, that man Bukvic [deputy prime minister], Faruk Smailbegovic, Munever Imamovic, Dr. Kreso, let me not go on listing any more names, well, there is also Hadzihasanovic, and so forth -- there is, in other words, a number of ministers who had an effect in the preceding period. This was all about the government. As for the soldiers, I should mention the corps commanders and no one else. In the case of the corps commander, an injustice has been done, which should be undone: [Words indistinct] generals and brigadiers and [word indistinct] generals, while our corps commanders are not generals, some of them have the rank of brigadier, they have worked hard to carry out their tasks. They have not had it easy. When it comes to the soldiers and army personnel, I want to single out the corps commanders. [Saracevic] You have been spending a great deal of time with soldiers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Mr President, there has been a lot of talk recently about the fund for invalids of the war and the families of the Islamic martyrs [sehidi]. [Izetbegovic] We shall form a state institution, which will probably be called the Ministry for War Veterans Affairs. It is high time that the question of soldiers was resolved in a systematic way. This issue has been completely neglected. We have been busy worrying about the war, worrying about things hanging over us, but unfortunately, cases of Islamic martyrs and their families, war invalids etc are also hanging over us. Although it cannot be said that they are not at all being cared for, there has been no systematic care. They cannot see any future prospects for themselves. The invalids do not know what will happen to them once the war is over. What will happen with the families of the Islamic martyrs when the war ends? There is often no justice. Soldiers, fighters are the focus of attention now, but they will not be during peace. People fear that perhaps profiteers will come then. Perhaps you remember a story, a novel which says: In the time of war you have first soldiers, then sergeants, low ranking officers, officers, generals, admirals, speculators etc, and in the time of peace it is the other way around -- first speculators, profiteers, etc. and fighters come at the end. Fighters, of course, have well-justified fear of this. So, this ministry is to be formed. I arrived at the idea, some two or three days ago, when Dr Velayati gave me a check for one $1 million. I asked him what it should be spent on. They said: This is up to you, you must see what is most urgent. It seems to me that the most urgent need is to provide for the invalids of war and the families of fighters. Then I thought a bit more about it, and concluded that perhaps we should set up a fund, independent of the government, which would become a permanent institution. This fund would, independently from the state, provide for these people. It would not be a bad idea if the two were linked, so that we also have a state institution, and permanent care provided, where citizens would also take part. It would provide for invalids financially and it would also initiate the adoption of appropriate regulations. We now want to pass a regulation which would state that in our diplomatic and consular missions abroad, invalids will have priority when applying for jobs. This means that healthy people would gradually be replaced, let them come back here and do something else. This fund could take care of these issues -- what could be done for our people who suffered most. These people are the biggest victims, apart from those who lost their lives. They and the families of the dead. I have thought about setting up this fund. I would like to be the head of the fund. I would like to form a committee, consisting of prominent people -- [writer] Alija Isakovic and some other ones. This would be a public institution which would be accountable to the public and would raise funds. I would help the war invalids to overcome their problems, to get artificial limbs, to get treatment, to get employment. [words indistinct] I am working on this and I would be happy to end my career as a man who cares and leave the burden to some younger people. That is a big burden for my age, and I would like to gradually pass it on to somebody younger. I would like to take care of these issues relating to the war invalids and the families of the Islamic martyrs. [Saracevic] Let me ask you finally, do you expect to see President Tudjman in Sarajevo soon? [Izetbegovic] I do not believe we will see each other soon. There was an initiative for me to visit Split. He allegedly has difficulties in coming to Sarajevo -- technical difficulties because UNPROFOR cannot guarantee his safety. Then he invited me to Split; I really would not mind this trip and talks in Split. However, as you can see, I have been left here in Bosnia to hold the fort because Silajdzic, Ganic, and many others are abroad. That is why I have to be in Sarajevo and I do not believe that we shall see each other soon. However, the invitation to Tudjman remains open and we expect his arrival. Well, I hope he will settle these problems with UNPROFOR. [Saracevic] Thank you for this interview, Mr. President.
