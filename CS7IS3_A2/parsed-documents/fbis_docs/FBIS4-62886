FBIS4-62886 "drsov097_m_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Tajikistan Opposition Groups Allowed to Discuss Constitution Opposition Groups Allowed to Discuss Constitution LD1805180394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1552 GMT 18 May 94 LD1805180394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] First Deputy Chairman of the Tajik Supreme Court Abdulmajid Dostiyev rejected in an INTERFAX interview the opposition's allegations that the discussion of a constitution draft was illegal because every fifth resident of the country had left it. He said that, according to the UN, there were 27,000 Tajik refugees in Afghanistan while 110,000 people moved to other CIS member nations but as few as 5000 of them were ethnic Tajiks while the others were Russian speakers who had returned to their old countries. Dostiyev said that the opposition had every opportunity to discuss the constitution draft in the country's mass media. He added that hundreds of copies of the draft had been sent to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Afghanistan. He doubted that alternative drafts were in existence. If they did, their publication would be useful. Dostiyev said that most responses to the draft were positive and there were no essential objections to or constructive criticism of the draft to speak of. He said he would insist that the Constitution be adopted by a referendum. If this does not work for any reason, it could be adopted in a congress at which all areas, towns and organizations are represented, he said. He expected the Supreme Soviet to make a decision on this early in July.
