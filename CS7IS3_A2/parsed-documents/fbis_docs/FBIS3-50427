Major Edith Vargas, spokesman for the Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE), asserted that the Guatemalan Armed Forces obtain their weapons "legally" and not clandestinely. Eduardo Linares, former guerrilla and now a political leader of the FMLN, accused, in statements to the Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE newspaper, the Guatemalan military institution of being primarily responsible for the gunrunning activities. According to Linares, on one occasion the FMLN had bought an arsenal from Guatemalan military personnel. However, Major Vargas asserted that the former guerrilla "is totally misinformed." The Guatemalan Army has charged the FMLN of gunrunning for the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). Furthermore, Deputy Government Minister Adolfo Reyes accused the FMLN of being involved in criminal activities in that Central American country and said "we have evidence" to this effect. Recently, Guatemalan Interior Minister Arnoldo Ortiz and Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said they suspected former FMLN members were involved in the abductions that are occurring in Guatemala to collect ransoms.
