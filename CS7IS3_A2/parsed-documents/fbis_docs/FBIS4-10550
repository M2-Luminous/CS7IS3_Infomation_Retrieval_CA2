[Ricupero] Nor adjustment tables, freeze, nor bank holidays. [FOLHA] Why not make an earlier announcement of the exact date for putting the real into circulation? [Ricupero] Because there is no such date. If possible, I will make the announcement earlier than 35 days in advance. I will try to report the date as early as possible. You know I never lie in my remarks to the press. I can say that it is absolutely sure that there is no such date. Sonia Mossri, a FOLHA reporter in Brasilia, has been reporting for weeks that the date is 1 June. I don't know how she reached that conclusion, because there is absolutely no date; no secret decision has been made. We have not picked any date because we are in a complex transition stage. For example, we have to look at the issue of utility rates. This week we will begin with mail rates, but we will need the entire month of April and part of May, because it is an immense universe. We are now drawing up the decree on public contracts. We should allow private contracts to adjust themselves. Negotiations between the industrial and commercial sectors are in some areas much slower than in others. In areas like that of meat, negotiations began earlier but are going more slowly. [FOLHA] In the negotiations between the wholesale and retail sectors, it is possible to see that there is more disagreement than accord. Isn't there the risk that this transition stage will last too long? Considering that the MP [Provisional Measure] provides for up to 360 days for adoption of the real, negotiations could continue for an indefinite period. [Ricupero] What I can say is even rather obvious: The real will be adopted neither too early nor too late. It must be adopted within a reasonable period, because we cannot wait too long, as we would then be running the risk that you mentioned. We want to feel the pulse of the market. Facts like the one you mentioned will be relevant in making a decision. Yet there are still things to be resolved, like monthly school fees, for which no guidelines have yet been issued. We will be doing it in the immediate future. Contrary to what has happened on other occasions, we are trying to have economic agents find the balance themselves. Yet people expect the government to make all the definitions. Society has sort of a vice, as it expects the government to define everything. [FOLHA] Taking into account this complexity, isn't there a risk that the need to adopt the real will make the government issue sort of an adjustment table, as not all contracts have been adjusted, that is, because the entire economy has not already adopted the URV [Real Value Unit]? [Ricupero] No. I have never heard anything about that. We are still confident that the adjustment will be made. In FOLHA DE SAO PAULO I read the opinions of Joao Sayad, Luiz Paulo Rosemberg, and others, noting that it is necessary to move faster. We must have definitions also in other areas, like currency, the backing of the currency, the adoption of an exchange rate index that can or cannot be fixed. We are trying to very carefully measure the pros and cons of those options. Yet the process, which is gradual, can become the target of such criticism. You have the traditional experience of the fight against inflation and hyperinflation, especially in Central Europe, which resolved the problem overnight on the basis of a fixed exchange rate. In the case of Austria, inflation collapsed within 48 hours, but at an astronomical price. [FOLHA] Despite the fact that the government advised that the inflation rate would drop only after adoption of the real, many people believed that adoption of the URV would produce a drop in inflation. However, exactly the opposite is happening. [Ricupero] I am aware of that. I have noticed that there is such a concern. In my opinion, this involves a communications problem. The best way to avoid this risk, which is real, is to make an additional effort at communication. One of the things I have felt during these first days of work is the need to give a better explanation of the meaning of the plan. Yet I would like to add that my concern does not focus only on the plan, in the short term. I am also concerned about structural matters for the medium and for the long term. I am sure that within the short term, the plan will yield very positive results. After adoption of the new currency, the inflation rate should significantly drop. Now, we have never concealed that stability is only a first stage for reactivating economic growth with new patterns. Economic growth should include both the social and the environmental cost, something that we did not do in the past. To this end it is essential to reform the structure, that is, the Constitution. It is necessary to resolve the problem of lack of coordination between the branches of government. I have said that if we had to identify the two main Brazilian problems, the Social Security system would be one of them. In my opinion, this subject will be the great distortion of the next few years. We might be the only country that has placed all Social Security regulations in the Constitution. There is also the federal system, the three levels, the conditioning of budget allocations, and the transfers. Everyone demands additional spending reductions, but when we deal with the budget, it is rigidly maintained. All revenues go to salaries, transfers, and conditioned allocations. Only a 7 to 8 percent parcel remains available. It is a situation in which the country cannot move. I have just read a paper by Professor Jose Pastore showing that the cost of creating a job in Brazil is much higher than in any European country. The only country that is close to the Brazilian cost is France. As the cost of creating a job is very high, entrepreneurs prefer not to create jobs. They resort to overtime work, or else shift their activities toward the informal economy or toward middlemen. Take the example of the minimum salary. I met with the congressional committee that is studying the provisional measure. They insist on their idea of raising it to $100. I also believe it is fair to set the minimum salary at $100, but to do this it is necessary to amend the Constitution, making the minimum salary no longer conditioned on the Social Security system, allowing for the adoption of minimum salaries in each region. [FOLHA] Yet hasn't the executive branch been slow as far as making proposals for the constitutional revision is concerned? Don't you think it is very naive to expect the constitutional revision to succeed? [Ricupero] I am doing my best, and I will continue to do so. The constitutional revision does not affect me, as I will remain in this position for only a few months. Even if the Constitution were amended in May, I would not get any benefit from it. The problem will be for the new president. I see no reason for not doing the revision right now. If this is not accomplished, it is necessary to make sure that after the government changeover the conditions will be appropriate for continuing the work. [FOLHA] Are you in favor of an exclusive constituent assembly? [Ricupero] My best friend since I was in school, Fabio Konder Comparato (a jurist), favors this idea. I have already told him that my doubts lie in how to elect the members of that assembly. If members are elected with the same distorted rules of representation, I do not see many differences with the current constituent congress. [FOLHA] The economic plan was made by a presidential candidate. Don't you think that most of the difficulties that you will have will stem from this fact? Don't you feel directly responsible for the victory or the defeat of Fernando Henrique Cardoso? [Ricupero] I will begin by answering the second question. I am not committed. I am a friend of Cardoso just as I am a friend of people in all parties, even in the PT [Workers Party]. I am a public servant, I have never been anything else, and I do not intend to be anything else, either. I am really independent. My commitment is to stabilization. We want a dynamic economy so that our country may recover from the heritage of four centuries of slavery. [FOLHA] In 1986 you worked with then President Jose Sarney, at the time of the cruzado, which was considered a major electoral fraud. Some people now say the same thing, that the economic plan was made to promote the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso... [Ricupero] I believe this interpretation is wrong for several reasons. The first is the premise that if the plan had not been made, it would have been possible to continue with a routine policy until the end of the year. I believe the pressure that has already accumulated over Brazil's inflation is so heavy that we would have had to face very serious situations that might have even jeopardized the atmosphere for elections in our country. We are in a complicated situation and, even with the plan, we have a difficult journey ahead of us. If the economic plan did not exist, I believe the problems that would have accumulated by the end of the year would not have allowed the maintenance of such routine policy. To speak the truth, there was no choice. If we did not have this plan, we would probably have brought forward the elections or adopted just as important a measure. Second, we are doing everything necessary to stabilize the economy. But everything does not depend on us alone. Many decisions depend on the legislative or judicial branches, or on the state or municipal governments, or on other institutions, like public companies, in which case the responsibility is ours. If the legislative branch does not approve these essential constitutional reforms we are suggesting, you cannot accuse me of committing an electoral fraud. Besides, I would like to hand over the Finance Ministry with a more solid budget situation. But in order to attain this we depend on structural reforms we cannot control. Incredibly, this economic plan is considered by [former Finance Minister] Mario Henrique Simonsen as the best ever made. That is the general opinion about it, here and abroad. This plan belongs to everybody. In an editorial, FOLHA DE SAO PAULO stated that I exaggerated in the speech I gave at my swearing-in ceremony. I said that every citizen must consider the economic plan his own, and an untransferable responsibility. But I confirm what I said. FOLHA DE SAO PAULO is wrong, because no plan in the world can be successful if the citizens do not engage in it personally. To think that the plan has an automatic effect is an illusion. If FOLHA DE SAO PAULO has a better idea it should suggest it, because I do not know it. As for the economic plan, it is mine now. Of course the plan cannot be separated from those who contributed to its preparation; this is the case over the entire world. A government is recognized by its success. That is the case of Menem in Argentina. He will be reelected because he did things well. Such is the logic of a political dispute. People vote according to the merit of the public lives of their politicians. I think the candidates themselves must prove they have better alternatives. [FOLHA] It is natural that President Franco should want someone from his own administration to succeed him. In order to attain this happy ending, he could perhaps resort to some kind of magical solution for the economy... [Ricupero] I am committed to defending the budget balance and the economic plan guidelines. That is why my dialogue with the members of the congressional committee that is examining the MP has been difficult. The changes they want to implement will distort the plan. The plan must be given at least a chance to be tested in practice. [FOLHA] Does this mean that the MP is not at all negotiable? [Ricupero] To accept negotiation over it implies that the plan is not perfect. So far, nobody has demonstrated its imperfections. For example: They spoke about salary losses. Salaries were converted into URV's based on the average exchange rate and, as Simonsen says, the average is at an equal distance from the floor and ceiling peaks. To convert the salaries based on the peak exchange rate is absurd. This is not an imperfection but a difference of opinion. If you defend salary conversion based on the peak rate, and I defend the conversion based on the average rate, we will disagree until the day of the final judgment. If you are stronger, you will defeat me, and I will go home, and then you can govern the country by converting salaries based on the peak rate. [FOLHA] But that second hypothesis does not exist. If Congress turns down the conversion of salaries based on the average rate, you can go home, but Congress will not govern... [Ricupero] That is the point. At some moment, I do not mean now, we will have to make the other government branches responsible for their actions. This situation in which you have power and not responsibility is one of the reasons for which we are the only country on the American continent that has not defeated inflation. Nowadays even Russia is curbing inflation. Why is this happening here? Is it because of some genetic degeneration, or is it because we have an institutional problem? I believe the media has a lot of responsibility in this; it is incoherent. I think some of these newspaper columns of short notes are regrettable. No newspaper in the world has three columns of short notes, each one serving a different intriguing interest. There are people who earn a living by inventing news in a column. [FOLHA] Going back to the economy, has the backing of the real currency been defined? [Ricupero] Partly. The reserves will back it partly, but we must define to what extent, and if any other kind of backing will be necessary. We are considering different options regarding the date the new currency will be put into circulation, the backing it will need, and the exchange policy. [FOLHA] Some economists defend the principle that in order to prevent the new currency from being born contaminated, a fixed exchange rate will be necessary for at least some time... [Ricupero] That is one of the ideas that is being analyzed. They all have advantages and disadvantages. It is not true that the historical background should point in that direction (the dollar/real parity). Chile, for example, has been very successful with the establishment of a fixed exchange rate. In my opinion Chile is the most evident case of successful economic adjustment in Latin America. I will not say Chile is an example for Brazil, because it represents only 10 percent of the Brazilian economy. But it is nonetheless an example of success, because it managed to stabilize without problems its balance of payments, maintaining a good export capacity without a fixed exchange rate. I am not establishing a position. In Latin America you can find successful experiences both with a fixed exchange rate, as in Argentina, and without a fixed exchange rate, as in Mexico and Chile. None of these solutions is transferable on its own. There is hardly any alternative. If there were, we would have announced it already.
