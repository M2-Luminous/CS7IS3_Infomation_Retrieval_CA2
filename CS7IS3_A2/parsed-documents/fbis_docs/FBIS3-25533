In spite of an ultimatum to renegade militias to hand in their weapons, many have set up their own checkpoints to extort money from travelers and last night, an armed attack is reported to have taken place on the residence of Somaliland's President Mohamed Egal. On the line to Hargeysa, Raggi Omar asked the president what actually happened. [Begin recording] [Egal] What happened.... [pauses] I will tell you exactly what happened. You know, this is Ramadan now. People usually stay up late at night, you know, and some young ex-militia who had had a very pleasant night and a lot to drink, much more than was good for them, were driving in this kind of car and, as they were passing the street before the president's house, you know, the residence, one of them fired a shot at the gate. The bullet went through the gate and grazed, just grazed, one of the guards who were standing next to the gate, and then they were chased and four of them were arrested and one of them was arrested next morning. [Omar] So what you are saying is that an attack took place, but it is not as serious as might seem to be the case. [Egal] They were just five young boys, you know, who had had too much to drink, and as they were passing.... They really did not come here to attack us. They were just passing along the road. One of them, as they were passing the gates of the Presidency, fired the shot. [Omar] But some people might interpret it as being very, very serious because, as you say, the five men were ex-militias. You have been launching a campaign to demobilize and decamp the militias which are still out on the streets of Hargeysa and other towns in Somaliland, and some of them have been very unhappy about these efforts by you. Could there not be serious sort of, you know, political undertones to the attack? [Egal] No, I am afraid that is exactly what it is not. You know, there were these young chaps who did not come here to attack. There was no concerted and planned attack on the Presidency. It was just these young boys passing along the street and as they were passing one of them fired that shot and then they ran away. Of course, we are in the middle of this demobilization and disarmament, but it is not being done against the will of anybody. We are doing it through persuasion, through dialogue, through peaceful means. There are people who describe themselves as opposition here. I do not know what they are opposing. We are now trying to knit together a very, very delicate fabric of a nation which has been completely destroyed. [Omar] So you will continue to demobilize these soldiers from mounting these custom posts and taking money off people at checkpoints and you will be sleeping very comfortably at the Presidency this evening without worry? [Egal] Yes, I had been sleeping last night and all the nights before that and I am going to sleep very comfortably tonight, too. People might call me a bloody bastard but they will not shoot at me.
