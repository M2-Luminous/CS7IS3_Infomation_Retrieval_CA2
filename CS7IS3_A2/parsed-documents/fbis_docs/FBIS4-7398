He briefed the head of state on the signing of the Uruguay Round in Marrakesh, Morroco recently. Budiharjo told journalists that the abolishment of MFA resulted in the wiping out of quota system which arranges categories of textile and textile products of certain countries. He added that the phasing out of quota systems until 2005 will in turn lead to stronger competition made by China, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. "The government gives full support to Indonesian exporters of textile and garment," he said. The elimination of MFA in stages for the last ten years has reduced quotas of certain categories of textile and textile products while increasing other categories of commodities, he noted. Reporting to the President on importing rice from certain countries, he said that Indonesia was forced to do so as the Uruguay Round required all countries to open their markets. However, he added Indonesia has a concession preventing excessive imported rice which may pose threats to local farmers' livelihood. Indonesia, therefore, may import rice in case of lower prices of imported rice compared to those offered by domestic market, he said. Indonesia, which is expected to import 70,000 tons of rice annually, will provide 90 percent of duty to the lower prices of imported rice. The government will keep on protecting local businessmen while fulfilling the requirement of the Uruguay Round, he assured journalists raising questions on the possibility of importing of rice from a certain country.
