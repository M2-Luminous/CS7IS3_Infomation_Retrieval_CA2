In a routine check at Sokolac heliport, it was found that in addition to a Muslim delegation, UNPROFOR was attempting to transport a large number of packages containing electronic equipment, uncleared documents, and a huge quantity of foreign currency from Sarajevo to Gorazde. When a control team of the army of the Srpska republic insisted on continuing a thorough search, a member of the Muslim delegation, Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina government, opposed it. He decided that the delegation should not continue its journey. The two UN helicopters then returned safely to Sarajevo. The general staff communique says that UNPROFOR had asked for permission from the general staff for the Muslim delegation and the chairman of the Srpska republic commission for POW exchange to be flown by helicopter to Gorazde. It was explained that this was a humanitarian mission that was necessary for the speedier resolution of the POW problem. The flight was not permitted at first for security reasons, and the UNPROFOR command was advised to recommend that the delegation travel by land. Permission was nevertheless granted after the UNPROFOR command had asked the president of the Srpska republic and after both the Muslim side and UNPROFOR had given firm guarantees about the safety of the flight over the separation lines. The general staff says that it had been precisely set out that the helicopters could only transport members of the delegation with their personal belongings and lists of POW's. When the helicopters arrived in Sokolac the chairman of the state commission of the Srpska republic was not to be found in either helicopter.
