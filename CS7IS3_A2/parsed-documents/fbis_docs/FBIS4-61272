Kozyrev, who is in Cairo in connection with the signing of the agreement between Israel and the PLO on interim Palestinian autonomy, answered a question posed to him by your TRUD correspondent about Russia's role in the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and in the Near East peace process as a whole: [Kozyrev] Russia and the United States are the sponsors of the peace process in the Near East, and are carrying out the role they have assumed through constant and I would even say daily contact with each other. The agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho is the first major step toward general, stable peace in the region; it constitutes a historic reconciliation between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors. I hope that it will act as an incentive for progress in other areas of the Near East settlement. In this connection it is important to note that both sides' leaders -- Chairman 'Arafat and Premier Rabin -- recently visited Moscow, which, to my mind, gave them additional possibilities for adopting the historic decision and helped them to withstand pressure from extremists on both sides and all those who do not understand the need for peace. Support from Russia, the United States, and Egypt, and our sincere desire to promote the peace process on the firm foundation of equal rights and fairness are promoting accord between the contracting parties. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement should be followed by its practical implementation. This is no less important a phase than the talks. Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European Community, and other countries will be involved, together with the Palestinians and the Israelis, in the process of the implementation of the agreements reached. I would say that this international solidarity will make it possible to move in the right direction. In short, if and when the need arises for help from us, we will not delay in coming to their assistance in the most positive spirit. As for the Russian "Madrid-2" initiative -- that is, our proposal to convene a new international conference on the Near East -- this idea remains in force. We put it forward (soon after the Hebron tragedy -- A.R.) for the purposes of long-term strategy. Our initiative was born at a time when enormous difficulties had arisen and the peace process had to be saved -- and the relevant impetus was required for this. But from the very outset it was clear that our immediate aim is to achieve agreements on Gaza and Jericho, and then to move forward to the implementation of the Declaration of Principles (signed by Israel and the PLO in September 1993 -- A.R.). And I believe that on the path toward peace in the Near East, "Madrid-2" may and will be seen as a means of lending new impetuses to the peace process in the new conditions, and that this idea will be implemented at a suitable moment.
