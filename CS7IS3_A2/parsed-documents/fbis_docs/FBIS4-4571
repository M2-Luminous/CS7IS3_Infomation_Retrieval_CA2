The long reign of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has come to an end, and the political regime of 1955 which made such reign a possible has collapsed, but battles are now being fought on the political front lines between a new group of parties that want to establish a new order and the LDP, which wants to return to power. The future of the political realignment is still not clear. We will examine various phases of the ongoing war in the political world. To find a breakthrough in the automobile issue, which symbolizes Japan-U.S. economic frictions, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa and other people are now conducting a top-secret operation. This is an operation targeting Detroit, the center of the U.S. auto industry. On 8 March, Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama, the Ministry of Transportation's [MOT] second-highest-ranking administrative official, was sent to Detroit for active talks with five senior executives of the "Big Three" such as Ford Motors Vice President Booker. Six days later, on 14 March, Ozawa, who had not been seen at public appearances since the beginning of the month and who had been absent from ruling party representatives meetings and regular news conferences, was at a Tokyo office--which he uses for secret meetings--with Toshihiro Nikai, parliamentary vice minister of transportation, where they were together waiting for Mukaiyama, who had returned home the day before. Mukaiyama reported on the results of the meeting with the Ford vice president and other executives, and said, "They wanted to obtain technical advice on how they can export without hitches more automobiles to Japan." The MOT had already decided to remove barriers on U.S.-made vehicles by carrying out vehicle inspections on them in the United States and by treating them as Japanese-made vehicles are treated--in response to the U.S. charge that Japan's vehicle inspection system is working as a barrier to exports to Japan. The ministry plans to permanently station inspectors at the Japanese Consulate General in Detroit beginning in April. In other words, with this due to happen soon, Councilor Mukaiyama was sent to Detroit to explain in detail to U.S. automakers Japan's efforts--in hopes of stemming that industry's pressure on Japan. Sending him was part of the operation. Ozawa, who came up with the idea, appeared to have been content with the results. Meanwhile, the "operation" proceeded in Japan as well. The MOT sent an unusual order to the Chrysler Japan Sales Company on 10 March, saying, "We need five Cherokees to be assigned to national offices." A senior ministry official said, "We eventually want to buy 100 of them altogether with the help of concerned organizations such as the Airport Corporation." For Ozawa, the purchase of U.S.-made Jeeps for a total of 300 million yen is part of the operation to "root out the trouble by spraying insecticide on the roots." Ozawa's strategy is based on the thinking that the only effective way of dampening the pressure from Washington is to shut the mouths of persons from U.S. industry. Last July, having played a major role in changing the possession of the government, Shinseito not only filled major cabinet posts but also sent its confidants to key parliamentary vice ministerial posts. And, under Vice Minister Nikai, who twice came to serve as parliamentary vice minister--something which does not often happen--the MOT continued changing into Ozawa's "base in Kasumigaseki." Around the end of 1992, there was the strife within the LDP Takeshita faction consisting of the "pro-Ozawa group versus the anti-Ozawa group" that started with former LDP Vice President Shin Kanemaru resigning over the scandal of taking 500 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Company. This strife culminated in the creation of the Hata faction. It was 27 December, the day before the Hata faction was to be launched at an inaugural meeting. In the office of the Transportation Policy Bureau director on the eighth floor of the MOT in Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, were gathered such high-ranking officials as Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo, and Kuniji Toda, director of the Marine Technology and Safety Bureau. The excuse for the gathering was to commemorate the ending of the extraordinary Diet session that closed on that day. The meeting started with the arrival of Nikai, former MOT parliamentary vice minister. Director-rank officials exchanged pleasantries and cracked jokes for about half an hour. Then House of Councilors member Nobuya Izumi, an old MOT man (former councilor of the ministry's Ports and Harbors Bureau), appeared and bowed to his former superiors, who were sitting around Nikai, and said, "Please continue your favors to me." Voices shouting "cheers" went up around Izumi. It was at this moment that the MOT witnessed Izumi joining the Hata faction. Izumi's joining the Hata faction while the strife was under way between the pro-Ozawa group and the anti-Ozawa group--which sent ripples even to Kasumigaseki--meant that the MOT clearly supported the Hata faction. A senior official of a different government office recalled, "The MOT was impressed by the political capabilities of Diet members Keiwa Okuda and Nikai, who took the initiative in resolving the controversial Narita Airport issue. The ministry wanted to strengthen its position by deciding to ride along with Ozawa, whom these two people supported." The MOT has under its control a broad industry which covers transportation services using automobiles, aircraft, and railways; warehousing services, shipbuilding, stevedoring, reclamation and dredging operations, and tourism. Winning the ministry over to its side meant having control over an organization with big pipelines to political funds, as well as the power to collect votes. In fact, political donations to the LDP amounted to more than 600 million yen a year, including about 360 million from 16 major private railway systems -- to mention only the portion of funds raised from the transportation industry (based on the 1992 political fund revenue and expenditure report). At the end of the three-month-long strife, of a total of 15 Takeshita faction members elected from the upper house proportional representation system who were backed by government ministries and agencies, only three, including two former Defense Agency officials, turned out to be supporters of Ozawa. It was a bitter defeat for Ozawa. This may be all the more reason for a senior Shinseito member's now insisting proudly, "there is no question that the MOT supports Shinseito." Ozawa previously had nothing to do with transportation zoku [Diet members lobbying for the interests of the transportation industry and transportation-related government offices]. There is no doubt that in the background of Ozawa's having decided to use the MOT as an advance unit of the attack forces in operations concerning the important issue of Japan-U.S. relations there lay this link between Shinseito, the MOT, and the transportation industry from the days of his group's splitting off [from the LDP Takeshita faction]. There are many industrial organizations which support the old LDP, which built up the politicians-bureaucrats-businessmen triangle by mobilizing its "zoku Diet members." Meanwhile, extremely bitter battles are being fought between Shinseito and the LDP. There is the concern: Is Shinseito merely a party which dresses differently [from the LDP] but which continues "zoku governance"? From the "offensive against Detroit" operation, one can see clearly the depths of Japanese politics, which appear unable to be rid of the triangular political system easily. The MOT was ruled by the LDP's unyuzoku [Diet members concerned with transportation] before. They had great authority over transportation, including busses and trucks. Traditionally, the LDP's Mitsuzuka faction was the most powerful. Former transportation ministers--including Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the Mitsuzuka faction and former chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council; Masajuro Shiokawa, and Akira Ono--and Mutsuki Kato, former chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council (who is a member of the Renewal and Reform League) and who controlled the transportation industries, were representative members of the Mitsuzuka faction. On the other hand, the Takeshita faction--which was at the top of the system, in which zoku Diet members ran government ministries and agencies--sought to have many upper house Diet members, who represented each industrial sector, become members of it. The faction did this by placing economic ministries and agencies--including the Ministry of Construction, the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, and the Agricultural, Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry--under its control. The Takeshita faction had 109 members immediately after the lower house elections held in July 1992. Of the 109, however, 41 were upper house members. It was a faction which attached too much importance to the upper house. The Takeshita faction sent Kenzo Muraoka, senior member of the faction, to the post of transportation minister during the Kaifu administration. Keiwa Okuda, one of the "seven important members" of the faction, became transportation minister during the Miyazawa administration. Shinya Izumi, who won a 1992 election for a proportional-representation seat by obtaining the support of the MOT, decided to run in the election while Okuda was secretary general of the Takeshita office. He has been strengthening steadily his control over the MOT. Following a split in the Takeshita faction, however, there was a fierce power struggle between Okuda, who supported Ichiro Ozawa, and Okamura and former Transportation Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who were anti-Ozawa. Izumi belonged to the Ozawa group. The LDP Policy Research Council underwent a personnel reshuffle after the split of the Takeshita faction, and Toshihiro Nikai, who supported Ozawa, became chairman of the council's transportation department. This created the impression that Ozawa supporters, who are also members of Shinseito, took over the main posts of the MOT. Various changes are taking place among zoku Diet members following the change of political power. While Shinseito and the LDP are having a fierce battle over the control of the different industries, the zoku Diet members are actively following the new [transportation] sectors. According to a rough calculation by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, a new 123 trillion yen multimedia market will be created by 2010. The ruling and opposition parties are very much interested in the information and communications sector. In October, Shinseito formed a Diet members league (chaired by Kozo Watanabe) for the promotion of information and communications industries. This league has the same name as does the LDP's counterpart. Moreover, the ruling coalition parties, including Shinseito, established a Diet members group for information and communications (representative caretaker: Mamoru Nakajima) on 23 March, as if this were not only coincident with the establishment of NTT's multimedia promotion team, which was formed in February. This coalition group is composed mainly of Social Democratic Party of Japan lawmakers who were former members of the Zendentsu, a labor union of NTT. Each coalition party was asked to send a few representatives to the group. This request was well received, and Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP] together sent 25 representatives. One of the group's members said: "It is a cheerleading squad for NTT. The multimedia is not only a field with a bright future, but the votes of Zendentsu members are attractive to us." As for education, some senior members of the National Federation of Private College Associations (representative: Shigeyoshi Tachibanadaka, Science University of Tokyo director) -- which was shaken by a rumor that the budget for subsidies to private colleges will be cut next fiscal year -- were confused by a report that "Shinseito is saying that `no help will be given at the time of budget allocations if the federation makes a plea to the LDP.'" The federation just could not betray the LDP. After all, representatives of the federation visited both the LDP and Shinseito to ask for help. A senior federation official said: "The LDP helped us a lot in the past. However, we did not want to upset the current ruling parties, either. It was difficult for us to do anything." Shinseito has already formed sectoral meeting groups, which are similar to those of the LDP, and it is trying to make these look like those of the LDP. As for the Diet members league, the party's is increasingly trying to rival that of the LDP. As for schools, Shinseito formed several Diet members leagues -- including a Diet members league for the promotion of private kindergartens (chairman: Tatsuo Ozawa) and a Diet members league for the promotion of vocational and other schools (chairman: Hajime Funada) -- from late last year to this January. Moreover, the same party also formed in February a "Diet members league for the promotion of affluent car companies" (chaired by Keiwa Okuda), and a comprehensive league designed to cover four automobile-related industrial sectors, including busses and taxis. This is an enlarged version of the LDP's Diet members league for car repair services.
