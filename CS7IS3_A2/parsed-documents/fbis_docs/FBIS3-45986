Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Finance Ministry's National Treasury Department said that before floating the bonds, his department will consult with the Central Bank of China to make sure the bonds will be issued on a loose capital market. A loose capital market ensures that the government bonds will not trigger inflation and can prevent excessive liquidity.
