The approval saved led Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa a deep political crisis -- the resignation of the entire cabinet or a dissolution of parliament for a snap election. [sentence as received] Hosokawa himself had indicated earlier he would quit if he failed to get the reform measures passed during the current parliamentary session which ended today. The package was a compromise version of the original reform bills. The deal was struck last night at a meeting between Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But no date is set for the implementation of the adopted bills. Under the compromise deal, the revision of these bills will be deliberated in the next regular Diet session which is scheduled to open Monday [31 January]. According to the new version of the package, members of the lower house will be elected through a combination of 300 single-seat districts and 200 seats of proportional representation based on 11 blocs across the country. The ruling coalition had proposed a 274-226 split. On anti-corruption measures, the compromise plan permits corporations or organizations to offer limited donations to local legislators instead of Diet members. The version also promises that such corporate donations will be completely banned in five years. The original bills stood for a blanket ban on such donations with immediate effect. The political reforms, which are aimed at eliminating "money politics" and enhancing political openness, have been debated in Japan for years. Unlike his predecessors, Hosokawa has promised to make the political reforms his top priority since he took office last August and hinted he would resign if reform legislation failed. His original reform bills received a nod from the lower house of the parliament last November, but was rejected by the upper house last week because of the rebellion of 20 deputies of the socialists, the biggest partner within the coalition government. The passage of the reform bills leaves the Hosokawa government free to concentrate on mapping out measures to pull the economy out of a persistent recession. Hosokawa also must turn his attention to working out the 1994 fiscal budget and solving the trade dispute with the United States. However, the government still faces the uphill task of pushing ahead with the reforms, as many socialist lawmakers have publicly said "no" to the part of the government plan which allows individual politicians to accept limited donations.
