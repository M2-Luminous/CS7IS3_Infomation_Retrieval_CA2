The left-wing majority, headed by communists, took 171 votes and immediately made it known who is the master in the parliament. Against this backdrop, the national-democrats' excuses--they voted for Durdynets, they said--sound absurd and ludicrous. Vasyl Vasilyovych spent his entire conscious life in the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] and the party's elected bodies, rooting out the weed of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism. And now our "nationalists" have not found anything better than to support their eternal opponent. The special way the democratic beginnings have been taking root in Ukraine is worthy of a separate research. Both tragic and amusingly comic twists intertwined here. The day after Oleksandr Moroz was elected, many papers published his carefully retouched portrait the size of nearly a half of a newspaper page, just like in the times of Shcherbitskyy and Brezhnev. But what has actually happened? A speaker was elected in the parliament--big deal; by the yardstick of a civilized democracy, this is an ordinary procedure. Not quite, though. In Ukraine, permeated to the bone by Bolshevik ideology, the post of the Supreme Soviet chairman meant a lot--this man automatically became entitled to all conceivable and inconceivable goodies, became a member of the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet's Presidium in Moscow. This is not just opening and closing sessions, watching compliance with procedure, and giving the floor. In the conditions of "wild" democracy, the speaker's job may bring unlimited power, as the events of October 1993 in Russia proved. Continuing the parallel with Russia, the election of Oleksandr Moroz, coming in the footsteps of Ivan Rybkin's election, shows, first, that the political pendulum has swung sharply to the left, and second, the desire, to put it mildly, of a certain part of the population to see the resurrection of the "one and indivisible" Union. Still, the role of O. Moroz, as well as that of the communists' nominal leader, P. Symonenko, appears to be transient. Having lit up brightly on the political horizon, they will fade out just as quickly, move into the shadows, giving way to either real directors of the spectacle being played out in front of us (Georgiy Kryuchkov, Kostyantyn Prodan, and other members of the "old guard"), or to other "proxies" like themselves should the "masters" decide that their time has not come yet. Oleksandr Moroz' tragedy also is in that, having come to the post of the speaker with the help of communist forces, he has now become their hostage and has lost political independence. There is no such thing as a free lunch. This elementary truth came to mind when Oleksandr Moroz attempted to propose Oleksandr Tkachenko--a veteran protege of the old Communist Party nomenklatura--as his first deputy. If before this episode the national-democrats, skillfully separated by experienced party apparatchiks into factions where they could slug it out, still had some illusions regarding their own influence on the situation, now they finally understood that for the umpteenth time they had been fooled. It became clear that the communists, for whom selection and placement of cadres had always been the "key point of the whole party work," will not surrender without a battle a single commission, job, chair, or an ounce of power. This manifested itself especially forcefully on 24 May, when the communists, like primitive rhinos, once again attempted to push through A. Tkachenko by "piggybacking" him on Durdynets as a "package deal." That would be some bouquet! Fortunately, the opposition has enough sense to block the vote. I dare to suggest that we are in for some impressive about-faces on the political scene. We have not heard the last word from Leonid Kravchuk, whose desire to declare Crimea a "hot spot" is quite understandable--the issue of presidential election would then be void naturally. One has to assume that Leonid Makarovych will now swing perceptibly to the left, or maybe even restore his membership in the Communist Party? Actually--and I have already advanced this idea in the past--perhaps he never left it, simply carrying out a special assignment: to discredit the idea of democracy and democratic freedoms in the eyes of the people? He did accomplish this brilliantly, as the results of the recent parliamentary elections attest. On the other hand, Leonid Makarovych's situation today is not enviable. I had the opportunity to see the list of the so-called "communist mutants" (traitors, turncoats), in which his name was among the top few. Eyewitnesses said that Leonid Makarovych got very upset: "Why me?" It really must hurt when one is not liked by either side.... I see the following way out of the current situation as most acceptable--to create a unified bloc of rightist forces, which will include all deputies of democratic orientation, and go into flat opposition, leaving it to the communists to form the government. Since they do not have their own economic program, in a year or two it will become clear that all they are capable of doing is leading the country into a dead end (by the way, the last three years it was also communist turncoats who were in power). This road, albeit unpopular, seems the only acceptable one. Nevertheless, I assume that the current democrats will not have enough guts to take it. Some have already been bought--by an apartment in the "king's preserve," a car, or an official position; some will be bought, since there is plenty of bait, just hurry and swallow the hook; some are afflicted by outsized ambitions; and some are simply naive--but all of them are split and scattered, so there will be no common strategy; nobody has any intention to be subordinate to someone else, each has its own scepter. On the other hand, the current communists--whom the populace for some reason calls "Khmer Rouge"--unlike loose democrats, distinguish themselves by a high degree of discipline and organization. They will have no trouble strangling their adversaries one by one in the pursuit of communist ideals. One can almost taste this idyll--communists in power and Kravchuk as president. That Leonid Makarovych will be reelected as president if the elections are moved to fall, I personally have no doubt. The new communist-Kravchuk alliance promises that life in Ukraine will not be boring.
