First, balancing alternative development with drug interdiction. Secondly, beginning in 1994, implementing the "zero option," that is, eliminating root and branch all "excess" plantings of coca leaves. He said: "What we did during this first phase of the meeting of the Consultative Group of the World Bank for Bolivia was to ask for resources to study the feasibility or lack of it of this alternative." In referring to the so-called "zero option" the minister indicated that this alternative has the objectives of completely eliminating excess plantings of coca leaves, seeking to industrialize the production areas, and promoting true centers of social and economic development in the Chapare and Yungas areas. Furthermore, it has the objective of providing an opportunity to productive peasant farmers "to choose the best alternative which suits their interests." He pointed out: "We brought this kind of proposal to the international community and we are only waiting for an answer, which we consider will be positive, to begin studying the ways and means which could be used for the proper functioning of this strategy for the integrated development of the Chapare and Yungas areas." According to Minister Quiroga, the total cost of the "zero option" will be about $1.2 billion. It has been provisionally estimated that its implementation, which is not a short- or medium-term matter, will take six years after the program is approved. He said: "The first stage will cover studies for project implementation, which will require the expenditure of $100 million to complete. The second phase is closely related to practical implementation of the program in the producing areas, with investments in the order of $900 million." He noted: "This new proposal was developed to deal with inconsistencies in alternative development programs in the Chapare area of the Department of Cochabamba and the meager, positive results from their implementation five years ago." As an example of the defects in these past programs he pointed out that in the Ivigarzama area a considerable number of plantings of coca leaves was eliminated. However, the programs and strategies of alternative development were not even "30 percent implemented."
