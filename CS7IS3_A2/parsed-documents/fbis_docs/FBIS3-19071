He stressed that the coordinator of the efforts is Cyrus Vance. The government spokesman also said that there is no possibility for a temporary lifting of the measures against Skopje and that Greece will lift the measures only when Skopje gives practical signs of goodwill, as demanded by the Greek side. A temporary suspension of the measures to allow a resumption of the dialogue is not in the government's plans, Venizelos said.
