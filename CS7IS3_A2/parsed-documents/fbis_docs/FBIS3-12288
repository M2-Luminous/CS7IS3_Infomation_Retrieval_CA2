The Fatah Central Committee would like to emphasize the following: 1. This new ugly Zionist crime clearly reveals the true nature of the racist Zionist grudge and the Zionist enemy's practices and massacres against our Palestinian and Arab people in Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibya, Nahhalin, Sabra, Shatila, South Lebanon, the Golan, 'Uyun Qara [Rishon LeZiyyon], and al-Aqsa Mosque. This ugly crime clearly confirms the role and function of the Zionist entity, which is weighing heavily on the land of Palestine and which is seeking through all hostile and racist means to uproot our people from their homeland as a prelude to Judaizing the land of Palestine and ending the national identity of our Palestinian people. 2. This criminal bloody massacre is the first fruit of the treasonous agreement 'Arafat and his Zionized team signed with the enemy. It is a natural result of capitulation, submission, and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The enemy practices against our people and nation have been further confirmed by its crime in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. This clearly proves that there could be no peace or reconciliation with this Zionist entity. 3. While we hold the Zionist enemy and its leadership and settlers fully responsible for this heinous crime, we hold 'Arafat and his Zionized team responsible for the blood of the Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs and wounded. O masses of our Palestinian people, O masses of our Arab nation: By this crime, the enemy sought to extinguish the spirit of revolution and valiant intifadah of our people in the occupied homeland, who reject the 'Arafatist treasonous agreements. It also sought to bring about the surrender of our struggling masses, which insist on maintaining confrontation with the enemy. The enemy targets, however, have foundered on the rock of the spirit of struggle and confrontation which manifested itself immediately after the early news of the Zionist crime. Popular anger swept through the entire Palestinian territory in the form of clashes with the Zionist enemy through which our struggling people emphasized that the spirit of struggle and resistance is always glowing and that their insistence on continuing their confrontation with the enemy and toppling the treasonous agreements and liquidatory plans cannot be stopped by the continuing Zionist massacres and repressive acts in the occupied homeland.
