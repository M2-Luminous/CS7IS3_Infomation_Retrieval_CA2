This is all part of the dirty war plan announced by the leader of that gang, the war criminal, the murderer of women, children, and the elderly; the supreme murderer of the armed forces, the terrorist 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his ill-fated 27 April war speech. Our armed forces continue their heroic resistance in the face of the forces of treachery and betrayal which moved a huge force and equipment toward the former border areas and especially towards Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish. Our armed forces managed yesterday and today not only to stop the advancing forces of the barbarous al-Ahmar gang in the directions of Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish but to force those forces to retreat and withdraw from their front line positions after inflicting heavy losses. We do not pride ourselves over victories or gloat over the losses of others by talking about the losses since the first and last losers in this war are the people and particularly the thousands pushed by the leader of the al-Ahmar gang like a herd of goats to the destructive slaughterhouse along the former dividing borders. However, we must commend the rare heroic spirit and the high morale of our armed and brave forces in al-Dali' and Karish. It is sufficient to say that an old veteran yesterday succeeded in destroying six hostile tanks in al-Dali' area. If this shows anything, it shows the high spirit of morale of our armed forces who are inspired by the justice of the cause they are defending as a sacred cause with regard to the Yemeni people. This is the cause of dignity and the honor of women which the adventurous al-Ahmar gang is attempting to trample on with its tanks. [passage omitted]
