The meeting's purpose was to reach an agreement on measures and draft a plan to combat sea pollution, especially that caused by oil slicks. Representatives from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil, Poland, the PRC, the ROK, Russia, and Ecuador who attended the meeting committed themselves to asking their respective governments to buy the standard antipollution material suggested by the Chilean Navy. They decided to draft a concerted action program at their next meeting. Commodore Urdangarin stated: "All the participants acknowledged that Chile is the only country that has the ways and means to combat pollution in the Antarctica in a systematic way. We have both the qualified people and the infrastructure in the vessels of the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol and the Prat Base and Fildes Port Garrison." He underscored that this initiative was materialized by Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, the Navy commander in chief, who had the foresight to plan for possible problems arising from the increase in sea traffic. On that occasion, the commanders of the bases and stations in the South Shetland Islands located in Antarctica, agreed to appoint the Chilean Navy's Antarctic Patrol as the operations coordinator in case of a possible environmental disaster in the area. At present, only the Chilean Navy has the necessary vessels, equipment, and staff to face an emergency such as this, as well as to undertake rescue operations with the Antarctic Patrol.
