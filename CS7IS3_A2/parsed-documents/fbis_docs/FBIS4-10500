It is now a conscientious action taken by all members of the Army and the National Police operating in that part of the Peruvian jungle. On 2 April in San Martin, an inhospitable area in the Tarapoto jungle, a Dinandro [National Antidrug Division] patrol supported by the Air Police detected a lab for processing cocaine base and acted by surprise. Not even the torrential rain or the thunderstorm stopped police, who arrested five people. After the operation, police seized 128 kg of cocaine base, many ingredients for making the drug, and a shotgun. Back at the Tarapoto airport the arrested were taken to the police station. The police then, without knowing reporters were present, gave the arrested soft drinks and their own food rations they used in their operations. None of the arrested showed signs of violence on their bodies when they were put under the jurisdiction of judicial officials. They also never complained about being mistreated by police. A police sergeant said: "We always respect the rights of the people we arrest, even under the most adverse circumstances after they use their weapons on us and we capture them." This National Police action, without the tempting presence of cameras and microphones, shows that human rights are indeed respected in Peru and that there is no need for "spokesmen" abroad to report alleged human rights violations. The real situation is in that remote region where perhaps one of those "spokesmen" never saw what happened.
