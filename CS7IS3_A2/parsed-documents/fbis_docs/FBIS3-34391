Military and political sources say that a trend of escalating terror attacks has persisted since the beginning of the dialogue with the PLO. In 1993, the number of terror attacks in Lebanon doubled, the number of infiltration attempts increased considerably, and the organizations opposed to the peace process have exhibited a higher motivation to infiltrate into Israel and carry out attacks. The sources say Syria will continue to use Hizballah, as it has in previous years, according to its political needs.
