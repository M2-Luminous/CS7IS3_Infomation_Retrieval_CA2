The deputies voiced concern at the fact that President Boris Yeltsin's edicts have dismissed all the deputy general prosecutors and would like to receive explanations of the reasons for this decision. At the proposal of Deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov, the State Duma instructed the parliamentary committee for security to study the question of the Russian president's dismissal of the three deputy general prosecutors. He was supported by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, a representative of the Communists' faction, and by the agrarian faction which has issued a statement today asserting that the president's edicts on the General Prosecutor's Office were adopted "counter to the Constitution." The agrarian faction believes that in this case Boris Yeltsin's actions "contradict the Social Accord Treaty and the commitment he has made to operate within the framework of the Constitution and on the basis of the law."
