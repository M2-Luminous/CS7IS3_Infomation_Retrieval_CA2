It said it was able to confirm that Yang, 87, was staying at the Shijingshan (Rockview Mountain) resort, where reporters found "a strong Public Security Bureau presence." There were also unconfirmed reports that Premier Li Peng was also in Zhuhai, ahead of this weekend's inauguration of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant northeast of Hong Kong, Lusa said. But Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda ducked questions from Macau reporters when asked to confirm if Li was in town. "As far as I know, Premier Li Peng has arrived in Guangdong, but it is unclear yet what actually his situation in Zhuhai is," Lusa quoted Liang as saying. Li last visited Zhuhai one year ago for three days. Earlier reports in Hong Kong newspapers, quoting Guangdong officials, have said paramount leader Deng Xiaoping will be in the economically thriving province for the Lunar New Year holidays, which begin February 10.
