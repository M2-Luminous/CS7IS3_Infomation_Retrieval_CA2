Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of March 21, 1994 (59 FR 13294), EPA proposed a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act to require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of refractory ceramic fiber (RCF) in any new product form not listed, or any new application of an existing product form not listed in the proposed rule. Written comments on the proposed rule were to be received on or before April 20, 1994. EPA received a request from a trade association seeking a 30&hyph;day extension of the public comment period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information on uses not listed in the proposal. EPA believes that providing an additional 30&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. EPA is therefore reopening the comment period 30 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written comments must be received on or before June 3, 1994.
