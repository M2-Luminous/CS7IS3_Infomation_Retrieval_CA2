In a public speech delivered this afternoon at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Bentsen said that one of the important missions on his trip to China is to co-chair the first meeting of the committee since 1987. He said that a revitalized committee could provide an opportunity for both governments to discuss economic issues and help narrow the differences between the two countries. The treasury secretary said that he was encouraged by China's recent efforts to reform the tax system, central bank and the financial system as well as the foreign exchange system. He said that the reforms would put in place the tools for more effective management of China's rapidly growing economy and an expanded role for the market, and will assist in China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). According to Chinese officials, the Joint Economic Committee will hold its eighth meeting tomorrow, at which the two sides will brief each other on the economic development in each country and exchange views on bilateral issues.
