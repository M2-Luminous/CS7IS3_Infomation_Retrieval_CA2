He told the Federation Council on Wednesday that during a conference on May 31, attended by Cabinet members, the State Duma leaders turned down a corresponding proposal by the State Duma's Committee for Economic Policies, chaired by Sergey Glazyev. To quote Shokhin, preference was given to the variant presented by the State Duma's Budget Committee, chaired by Mikhail Zadornov, which proposed that the federal budget be kept within the limits already approved: revenues amounting to 124 trillion rubles and spending - 194 trillion rubles. Shokhin noted, however, that the State Duma leaders had taken the decision to channel all of the additional revenues gained from the privatization of federal property to the defense industry. "I think such a decision creates favorable conditions for the approval of the budget at the second reading," said Shokhin.
