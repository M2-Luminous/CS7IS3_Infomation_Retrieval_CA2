Peace Now activists also met with Fatah leaders in Hebron for the first time since the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports: [Begin recording] [El'azar] Dozens of Fatah members from Hebron tensely waited for the Peace Now activists in Bayt Jala, south of Jerusalem. Contacts between Fatah's leadership in Hebron and the Israeli peace camp were ruptured in the aftermath of the massacre. However, Peace Now leaders arrived at the meeting location today with a message of dialogue. Mustafa al-Natshah, the former mayor of Hebron, told them: The desire for peace has survived the massacre. [Al-Natshah, in English] Nobody says I don't want peace. But, in order to have a just peace and a long-lasting one you need to have the ground paved for this peace. Settlements, settlers, and peace are contradictions. [El'azar translates the above and continues] Come back to the negotiating table and cooperate with the state commission of inquiry, Peace Now activists asked the Palestinians. Gavri Bar-Gil, Peace Now's secretary general, said the demand to eliminate the settlements was definitely justified. [passage omitted] The sides parted without reaching any agreement. Behind the scenes, however, Peace Now today scored an achievement. In a closed meeting held this morning in the PLO's offices in Gaza, Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, the PLO coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said that the Palestinians were prepared to return to the negotiating table. The Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip and Peace Now issued a joint statement proposing to bring forward the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. [end recording]
