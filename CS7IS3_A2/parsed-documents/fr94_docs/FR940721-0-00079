FR940721-0-00079 FR940721-0-00014 After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has reconsidered its view that section 210(f)(17) requires wholly owned suppliers to allied suppliers to be treated as outside suppliers. The basis for that view was that a wholly owned supplier to an allied supplier falls within the section 210(f)(17) definition of outside supplier. However, such a supplier also falls within the section 210(f)(15) definition of allied supplier. The agency agrees that it is appropriate to resolve this ambiguity in the regulation. The only significant difference between the statutory treatment of allied and outside suppliers is that allied suppliers must provide actual U.S./Canadian content information, while the roll-up, roll-down provision applies to outside suppliers. Thus, Congress decided that suppliers which are wholly owned by manufacturers should generally be held to a higher standard concerning the specificity of the U.S./Canadian content information that they provide. Given this difference, the agency agrees with Ford that an allied supplier should not be considered an outside supplier simply because it supplies equipment to an allied supplier. NHTSA also notes that if an allied supplier were to be treated as an outside supplier in such a context, manufacturers could obtain the benefits of the roll-up, roll-down provision for their allied suppliers, simply by having them ship their equipment through another allied supplier. This position is reflected in the definition of allied supplier set forth in the final rule. Toyota stated that the proposed regulation does not address the scope of the statutory term allied supplier. That manufacturer stated that because some issues have arisen concerning the statutory definition, it recommends that the regulation provide certain clarifications. Toyota stated that the determination of whether the allied supplier relationship exists within the statutory meaning does not depend on the number of levels of ownership but on the nature of ownership, i.e., whether it is complete ownership. That manufacturer stated that it should not matter whether ownership is direct or indirect. Honda stated that NHTSA proposed to treat as allied a supplier wholly owned by the same parent company that wholly owns the manufacturer. That company stated that NHTSA's analysis does not extend quite far enough to encompass Honda's corporate structure. According to that manufacturer, two parent companies within the Honda group together wholly own both the manufacturer and the supplier. No outside interests are represented. Honda requested clarification in the final rule. NHTSA agrees with these comments of Honda and Toyota, which the agency believes are consistent with the approach taken in the NPRM for suppliers owned by the parent company of the manufacturer. The definition of allied supplier in the final rule clarifies the meaning of that term with respect to the corporate relationships discussed by those commenters. 2. Definitions of Dealer and Ultimate Purchaser Section 210(f)(7) defines dealer to mean ``any person or resident located in the United States, including any territory of the United States, or the District of Columbia, engaged in the sale or the distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser.'' Section 210(f)(6) defines new passenger motor vehicle to mean ``a passenger motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred by a manufacturer, distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser.'' AIADA stated that in the case where a state or local jurisdiction has chosen to regulate the automobile industry and the conduct of the industry through franchise laws, it believes the definition of dealer in the state or local franchise law should apply to this Act. That organization stated that in promulgating regulations without clarifying the term dealer, NHTSA could inadvertently undermine state and local franchise laws. NHTSA notes that since the Labeling Act includes an express definition of the meaning of dealer, the agency cannot delegate to states or local jurisdictions the right to change the definition for purposes of the Labeling Act. The agency notes, however, that the Labeling Act and implementing regulation merely require persons engaged in the sale or distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser to maintain the content label. Neither the Act nor the regulation specifies any requirements concerning who is permitted to be a dealer. AIADA also stated that clarification is needed with respect to the meaning of ultimate purchaser. That organization stated that without such clarification, there could be confusion and unnecessary liability for dealers. AIADA stated that for vehicles in rental service, demonstrator service and executive service, the law is unclear as to who is the ultimate purchaser. That organization asked the agency to specify what transaction results in an individual or entity being an ultimate purchaser. NHTSA has decided to add the following definition of ultimate purchaser to the regulation: The term ultimate purchaser means with respect to any new passenger motor vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its capacity as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger motor vehicle for purposes other than resale. This definition is based on one used in the Automobile Information Disclosure Act (AIDA), 15 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1233, the Act which requires the Monroney label. NHTSA believes that it is appropriate to adopt this definition given that the Labeling Act's definitions of dealer and new passenger motor vehicle, which use the term ultimate purchaser, are also based on definitions included in the AIDA. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the regulation established by today's final rule, e.g., with respect to temporary removal of separate content labels for test drives, NHTSA plans to treat vehicles in rental service, demonstrator service and executive service the same for Labeling Act purposes as the Justice Department treats these vehicles for purposes of Monroney labels. NHTSA believes that this is appropriate, given the same general purposes of the labels, and the similarity of the relevant definitions in the statutes and, in the case of the Labeling Act, the implementing regulation. The agency is including in the docket a copy of a February 24, 1994 letter from the Justice Department which provides additional guidance in these areas. 3. Joint Ventures NHTSA stated in the NPRM that several commenters on the request for comments had noted that there are carlines manufactured jointly by two manufacturers, and requested that the agency permit the manufacturers to determine between themselves which would be responsible for tracking, record keeping and labeling. The agency tentatively agreed that this would be an appropriate approach and proposed requirements to permit multiple manufacturers to determine among themselves which of them is to be considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements. The agency also proposed to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, the carline ``shall be attributed to the single manufacturer that markets the carline.'' Nissan stated that it would not like to see language that specifies a procedure to determine the manufacturer of record. It stated that the selection of the manufacturer of record should be determined in accordance with the statutory language and agreement between the partners involved. Isuzu stated that it believes the final rule must specify that if no written article exists in a joint-venture agreement regarding manufacturer responsibility, carline responsibility is attributed to the manufacturer mentioned in certification label with respect to the safety standards.
