FR940830-1-00041 FR940830-1-00006 Regulatory Procedures Executive Order 12866 We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the procedures stated in these rules are already in effect without having caused a significant impact. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act These proposed rules contain reporting requirements in §§422.114 (e) and (f) and 422.120(a). We would normally seek approval of these requirements, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We are not doing so in this situation because we already have clearance from OMB to collect this information using forms SSA&hyph;L93, 95 and 97 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0432) and form SSA&hyph;2765 (OMB No. 0960&hyph;0694). There is also a reporting requirement in §422.122, which deals with information on deferred vested pension benefits. As required by section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), we will submit a copy to OMB for its review of this information collection requirement. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on these information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for HHS. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response. This includes the time it will take to understand what is needed, gather the necessary facts, and provide the information. If you have any comments or suggestions on this estimate, write to the Social Security Administration, ATTN: Reports Clearance Officer, 1&hyph;A&hyph;21 Operations Building, Baltimore, MD 21235, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0960&hyph; NEW ), Washington, DC 20503.
