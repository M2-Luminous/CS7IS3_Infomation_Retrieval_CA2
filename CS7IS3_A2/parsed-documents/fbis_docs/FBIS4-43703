Aizpeolea: "Socialists Rule Out Early Election"] [Text] The People's Party [PP] has defeated the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in nationwide elections for the first time and has succeeded in clearly breaking the absolute majority held by the Socialists in Andalusia since 1982. The Socialists yesterday acknowledged their defeat by the People's Party. This was made known by Socialist parliamentary group spokesman Joaquin Almunia, although he explained immediately afterward that domestic conclusions should not be drawn from these elections, and ruled out bringing forward the [general] election. PP Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy said that the Spanish political map had changed, but he initially remained cautious and did not call for a general election, while Abel Matutes demanded that the government hold a confidence vote. The European election results had a certain national color, manifested in an increase in the turnout compared to the previous elections of five years ago, although appreciably lower than that of the June 1993 legislative elections. In the light of the first figures provided by the polls, the main parties' representatives were already playing on both aspects in order to express their stances. Mariano Rajoy, on behalf of the People's Party, emphasized that "the Spanish political map has changed" since the 1993 general election, and hence his party "will work on the formulation of a national blueprint." The PP leader avoided calling for an early election, despite his party's clear victory in the European elections, and maintained a cautious stance. In his first assessment of the elections, PP list leader Abel Matutes maintained a tone similar to Rajoy's. In a moderate tone, he stated that these elections were a test of the government, and added that they are the "start of a political change." Matutes then added: "We will try to consolidate it by democratic means." Socialist parliamentary group spokesman Joaquin Almunia began by acknowledging his party's defeat by the PP, but he then asked that these elections' results not influence domestic politics, and ruled out an early election, although he acknowledged that "matters should be given due consideration." The Socialist leader argued this stance in this way: "These are elections to the European Parliament; the general election was a year ago, and there is great deal of the legislative term to go." Almunia argued that "the turnout was appreciably lower than in last year's general election. Moreover, there was a certain reluctance to vote in the constituencies where we Socialists receive most support." Economic Crisis For his part, PSOE Secretary for Organization Cipria Ciscar emphasized the need to distinguish this electoral process from that concerning a general election, and congratulated the PP on its first election victory. Foreign Minister Javier Solana yesterday congratulated the PP and attributed the punitive vote against the government to the economic crisis. Despite his party's defeat, the minister interpreted Convergence and Union's increase as a sign that the Spanish people want a stable government. The Catalan and Basque nationalists, who have improved their positions, were satisfied with the result yesterday, and have found that the policy of support for the government has not adversely affected them at the polls. The nationalists' result is the government's only consolation, insofar as its stability will not be attacked on that flank. Inaki Anasagasti, Basque Nationalist Party spokesman in the Congress [of Deputies], was clear yesterday, as soon as the first election results were known. He stated that these elections should not affect domestic politics. Jose Perez Moreno, the spokesman of Democratic Union of Catalonia, the party allied with Convergence, expressed his satisfaction at the Catalan nationalists' increase in votes and stressed that they had overtaken the Socialists in Catalonia, which did not happen in the general election. Isabelo Herreros, on behalf of United Left, was the only person to demand Felipe Gonzalez' resignation in light of the results. He emphasized the size of the turnout in comparison with the 1989 European elections, and called on Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to act accordingly. "Let him resign," Herreros said. But for the Socialists, the results of the Andalusian autonomous community elections are almost as bad as those of the European elections. In the Socialists' traditional fief, they have lost the absolute majority, with a considerable surge by the People's Party and United Left. Socialist Manuel Chaves, winner of the elections, will encounter difficulties in forming a government. The outcome prevents them from governing on their own, and their closest candidate with which to share the government -- United Left -- upholds stances very remote from the PSOE's.
