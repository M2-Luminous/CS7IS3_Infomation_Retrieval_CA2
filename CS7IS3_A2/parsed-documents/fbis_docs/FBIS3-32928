According to the Mexico City datelined dispatch, Miguel Angel Sandoval, one of the guerrilla spokespersons, accused the government and the Guatemalan Army of opposing the "Truth Commission," which is investigating crimes committed during the war-torn years in that Central American country. According to Sandoval, government negotiators will also block the international verification of the agreements to be signed by the parties on human rights, which is the first point of the negotiations, . CERIGUA also attributed statements to Defense Minister Mario Enriquez rejecting the creation of the Truth Commission. He thinks its purposes are "vengeful" and therefore, "instead of having a conciliatory nature, it tends to divide." According to the URNG, President Ramiro de Leon "lacks autonomy, and he limits himself to doing what the Army says," which is why his intent is to hinder the dialogue. In January the United Nations called on the government and the URNG to resume the peace talks, which had been suspended since May 1993 in the wake of discrepancies between the parties on points relating to human rights. The meeting will be held the second half of February on an as yet unspecified date. The Guatemalan Catholic Church, however, has expressed doubts regarding the seriousness of both of government and the guerrillas to begin this new phase of the process.
