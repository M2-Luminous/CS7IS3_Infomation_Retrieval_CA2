Petrella told the Argentine DYN news agency: "Oil is very important, but is not of paramount importance, as there is oil everywhere. This does not, however, mean that we are giving it away to the British." In Petrella's opinion, the possible oil activities in the islands "create problems, as there might exist jurisdiction issues harming the Argentine stance, and this is unacceptable." In this regard, the vice minister mentioned the High-Level Group of Argentine and British officials who will meet on 14 and 15 July in the city of Buenos Aires to discuss issues of bilateral interest, including oil. In Petrella's opinion, the formation of this group involved the establishment of an important link between the two countries, which have decided to work on the sovereignty issue and recognize the existence of a dispute.
