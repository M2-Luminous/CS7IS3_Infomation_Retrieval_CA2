Konyukhov, first deputy chairman of the Uzbekistan State Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, by N. Shulepina, under the "Man and Biosphere" rubric; place and date not given: "`The Aral Program'--For Five States"] [Text] At the Nukus meeting, the heads of five states approved a program of concrete actions aimed at the improvement of the ecological situation over the next three to five years in the Aral Sea basin. What are Uzbek ecologists to do within the framework of the program? Our interlocutor is V.G. Konyukhov, first deputy chairman of the Uzbekistan State Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, what is the program? [Konyukhov] The program considers the experience of ecologists and water management specialists of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Concrete tasks are laid out, concisely and in depth, in 10 blocks. We have already worked on many of them, and now we will concentrate our efforts. [Shulepina] What is the most important task? [Konyukhov] To work out a general strategy of water apportionment. There ought to be enough water for everyone. The Amudarya and Syrdarya interrepublican basin water management associations have been created and have given good account of themselves, but a general legal base is necessary, and it is planned to introduce a single system of calculating water resources and their use. We will know how many water resources we have, and we will be able to establish practicable usage norms in the production of agricultural and industrial output. The same goal may be served by a regional system of ecological monitoring. Hitherto, we have not had complete information on the condition of the natural environment. In Uzbekistan, the committees of the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Tashkent, the oblasts, and Karakalpakstan have been connected in a single electronic network. A project for the creation of a system of ecological monitoring in Fergana is ready. Such a system is being prepared for the industrial cities of Tashkent Oblast. The creation of monitoring in accordance with the program in Uzbekistan and in other republics is being accelerated. Basin water management associations and the observation points of hydrometeorological services will be supplied with technical equipment. [Shulepina] Monitoring is necessary, but it is already well known that the quality of the water is falling. How is this process to be stopped? [Konyukhov] That is one of the directions in which the five states have worked together on the contiguous territories. Thus, a year ago, Uzbekistan Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control Service posts noted significant discharges of harmful substances from the Osh cotton combine. We offered our neighbors effective technology from the Tashkent institute Vodgeo, which had been tested at the Namangansk silk combine. It will allow the volume of water used in Osh to be reduced by 70 percent, and losses of dye substances to be decreased. Such technologies are taking root at light industry enterprises of Andizhan and Bukhara Oblasts. In the program it is planned to take effective measures on the reduction, and in the future the complete cessation, of discharges of unpurified industrial and municipal drainage. For this, not a little has been done in Uzbekistan within the framework of the program of water conservation in industry. The Tashkent paper plant and the Yangiyul biological industrial complex have reduced their discharges, and the Novokokand chemical plant has been reprofiled. There were many complaints against the Tashkent Aviation Production Association imeni Chkalov--here preoperational testing of new and powerful cleansing installations has begun. The same are being proclaimed at Elektrokhimprom, in Chirchik.... We will continue our efforts toward reducing industry's negative influences. [Shulepina] A large problem is stopping runoffs into rivers and collector and drainage canals. "Relatively clean"--this is how their quality is described. Meanwhile, they contain pesticides, mineral salts, and drainage from livestock-raising complexes, which end up in Aral. What is to be done? [Konyukhov] In 1997 the construction of collector channels along the Amudarya and the Syrdarya will be completed. We will divert dirty discharges from the rivers. But a complete solution to the problem lies in treatment of the drainage water. Effective methods have been worked out at the ecology of water management center of the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. These methods are already being applied in the Aral region. In the region of Muynak Bay and the lakes Dzhiltyrbas, Sudochye, and Togiz-Tore, shallow reservoirs have been created, which have turned into rushy jungles. There are enough of them to feed a herd of 50,000 head. And the root system of the rushes, and the midges and plankton that arise in the process of biocenosis, clean the water. It can go both for the renovation of pastures in Kyzylkum and for intensive fish-farming. The program envisions in the Aral region the conduct of plant reclamation projects and the creation of artificially irrigated landscape systems. But the same technology could also be applied at rivers' headwaters. [Shulepina] In many rayons, a shortage of good-quality drinking water is being felt.... [Konyukhov] The provision to the population of the Central Asian states of high-quality drinking water is one of the main tasks. Pollution of underground lentils--a most important source of drinking water--and of subsoil waters has taken on massive scope. All sources of pollution must be brought to light and eliminated. In Uzbekistan, valuable experience in the conduct of such work has been accumulated. An impetus to this was the pollution of underground water near the Chkalovskaya metro station in Tashkent three or four years ago. The method used by the geo-ecologists from the Kyzyltepageologiya association ranks as a discovery. Directly from a car, with special equipment, they were able to see what was under the earth and discern the source of the pollution. They conducted analyses at the Fergana furan compound plant and the Kokand asphalt and cement plant, and compiled an atlas of pollution in Chimkent [Shimkent] and Tashkent Oblasts. Now analyses are being conducted of the underground waters in the large area of the Aral region and in the lands of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and our republic, and also in Tashlak and Tashkent. [Shulepina] How do pesticides influence the quality of underground water? [Konyukhov] The greatest danger is dozens of tonnes of pesticides, whose use is forbidden and which are located in Uzselkhozkhimiya [Uzbekistan Agricultural Chemical Association] warehouses in various rayons in the republic. We evaluate them as ecological bombs. The barrels are rusting; leakages will begin, and then everything will go into the soil. At the Atmosphere Institute, technology for the destruction of pesticides has been worked out. This method takes place at high temperatures and is harmless. The end product is a clean powder. We offered the pesticide-processing technology to the Ministry of Agriculture. This technology has regional significance. [Shulepina] The solution of any problem can be slowed down by a lack of funds. What mechanism is envisioned for the realization of the program of concrete measures for the Aral Sea basin? [Konyukhov] An international fund to save Aral has been created. Funds will be transferred into it, as was decided at the meeting in Nukus, after the currency quotation coordination by the governments of the states in the near future. In addition, we are also counting on assistance from the world community. As is known, the Aral problem is acknowledged as one of the most important. Experts of the World Bank have already been working in the region; an impediment to the rendering of assistance was a lack of unity in the understanding of help for Aral's problems among the states of the region. Literally in the very first days after the Nukus meeting, calls from international organizations and banks began, informing us of their readiness to begin real cooperation. And concrete leadership and supervision over the carrying out of the program will be implemented by the interstate council on the problems of the Aral Sea basin, the position on which was also adopted at the Nukus meeting, and its executive committee, for whose headquarters Tashkent was chosen. [Shulepina] Vladimir Grigoryevich, a minimum program has been adopted. Who determines, and when, what is to be done further? [Konyukhov] Ecologists and water management specialists of the five states are proceeding with the elaboration of a medium-term program, which is calculated for five to 10 years, and a long-term program, which will cover 10 years and more. At the same time, we will be working on a conception of improvement of the social and ecological situation in the Aral Sea basin; as yet, only its basic provisions have been coordinated. All water-management and ecological projects will pass through the most rigorous expert examination. After completion of preparatory work, the region's heads of state will determine, as was envisioned in Nukus, a long-term unified ecological policy.
