The initiative will raise money at home and abroad to provide shelter and schooling for the homeless street kids. A host of metropolitan and provincial half-way housing centres with primary school and practical education facilities are in the pipeline according to sources at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Some 200,000 homeless children between the ages of 4 and 11 have been thrown onto the streets by regional disasters, poverty, broken families and inadequate pastoral care. The full extent of the street urchins' plight was revealed in a recent major survey of over 1,000 street children. The investigation found that: 38 percent of them left home when their parents divorced, 23 percent ran away to escape being beaten up by relatives for failing to get good school marks, 23 percent succumbed to the lure of social evils, like gambling or stealing, 8 percent were abandoned for being mentally retarded and 5 percent were forced onto the streets by poverty. The remainder were made homeless when their parents were jailed, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and United Nations survey, which was conducted in Shanghai and Hunan, Guangdong and Anhui provinces. The kids survive by begging and sleep in the cities wharves and railway stations at night, according to investigation, which was financed to the tune of $100,000 by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). And child homelessness, which is on the up and up, is stretching government welfare resources. Local authority camps have been set up offering food, clothing and education in the last few years. But much more social support is needed to answer the children's needs. Mortality and disability rates among homeless kids are high and they are also prey to the temptations of crime, according to regional investigators. The Sino-UN investigation focused on how to keep kids off the streets. It also looked at education and protection of the at-risk street children. Similar investigations about street urchins lives have been conducted in cities and provinces across the country over the last four years or so. In northeastern Jiamusi City, about 600 street children, 20 percent of the city's total vagrant population, were picked up and sent back home by local metropolitan civil affairs agencies between 1989 and 1991. But within a year 500 kids below the age of 14 were back on the streets again. By the end of 1992 the city, which is in Heilongjiang Province, was having to cope with 40 percent more homeless kids than the previous year. Shanghai picked up more than 3,000 child vagrants in 1992. And 1,600 cases of juvenile homelessness, with the youngest victim only 4-years-old, were reported in Shenyang, the provincial capital of northeastern Liaoning. China has over 300 million children.
