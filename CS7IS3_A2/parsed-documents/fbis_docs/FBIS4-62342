He was received by Colonel General Petr Deynekin, commander in chief of the Russian Federation Air Force. The Chilean guest visited the Gagarin cosmonaut training center located in Zvezdnyy Gorodok. There he looked at the simulators used by cosmonauts preparing for their flight, and had a discussion with Lieutenant General Petr Klimuk, chief of the center. Gen. Gonzalo Miranda confirmed that the possibility of purchasing Russian-made war planes, which are to replace the obsolete British planes, is currently being studied. But the final solution of the question and setting aside of the required funds for purchasing is up to the Chilean Government. Gen. Gonzalo Miranda was rather optimistic about prospects for Chile-Russia cooperation in the sphere of outer space. He pointed out that in our day and age there are actual possibilities for developing joint projects and their implementation in the interests of both countries.
