Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated this at a meeting in Samara with managers and officers of the Volga Military District. Touching on the problems of Russia's Armed Forces, Pavel Grachev noted that the army draft was carried out in a reasonably organized fashion last year. Russia's Armed Forces currently have 60 percent of their full complement of staff. It is proposed that 70-75 percent of the posts in Russia's Armed Forces should be filled after this year's spring recruitment and 85-90 percent by the end of the year. In the minister's opinion, this will enable the Russian Army to carry out the tasks it is faced with in guaranteeing the state's security. The defense minister noted that he has prepared a directive on the reform of the system of educational work in the troops, the focus of which is to be moved to the localities. Touching on problems of housing Russian Army subunits withdrawn from abroad, Grachev noted that since 1992 270,000 servicemen, around 3,000 tanks, 6,000 armored vehicles, and around 1,500 aircraft have been withdrawn onto Russian territory. In connection with this, providing facilities for servicemen is one of the most important tasks facing the Russian Defense Ministry today. Speaking about the reduction in the overall numbers in the Russian Army, the minister stated that Russia's Armed Forces have to be reduced to 2 million by 1 January 1995. This, according to him, is the limit for troop reduction. At the present time Russia's Armed Forces number 2,341,000. Grachev also spoke of the planned transition to the territorial command principle. All arms of service on his territory should be subordinate to the district commander. In the minister's opinion, this should ensure that they are reliably controlled. Touching on the financial position of Russia's Armed Forces, Grachev noted that the government was in debt to the army to the tune of around 2.3 trillion rubles in 1993. This evening the Russian minister held a meeting with heads of the Samara Oblast and town administrations. Problems concerning social provision for the district's troops were discussed.
