FR941130-2-00018 FR941130-2-00009 4. Southern Natural Gas Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;83&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 16, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35202&hyph;2563, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;83&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon by sale 4.5 miles of pipeline to Geodyne Gas Company (Geodyne), abandon in place 4.8 miles of pipeline and abandon by removal two field compressors and a measuring and receiving station which was authorized in Docket Nos. CP82&hyph;102&hyph;000 and CP82&hyph;406&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Southern proposes to abandon by sale 4.5 miles of pipeline (the Black Warrior Pipeline), which extends from its interconnection with Geodyne's network of gathering facilities in Monroe County, Mississippi, to interconnecting facilities with Mississippi Valley Gas Company (MVG) in Monroe County, Mississippi. Southern also proposes to abandon in place 4.8 miles of pipeline (the Corinne Field Pipeline) which extends from Milepost 4.45 on the Black Warrior Pipeline to an interconnection with Southern's Muldon Pipeline in Monroe County, Mississippi. In addition, Southern proposes to abandon by removal a 600 horsepower compressor and a 360 horsepower compressor which comprise Southern's Corinne Compressor Station, as well as a measuring and receiving station located near Milepost 4.45 on the Black Warrior Pipeline. Southern states that the facilities it seeks to abandon were originally installed by the Black Warrior Pipeline Company (BWP). It is stated that the compressor units were leased by BWP. Southern further states that Southern liquidated BWP and acquired its assets in Docket No. CP82&hyph;102&hyph;000 and Southern acquired the rental compressor units under its blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;406&hyph;000 as a gas supply facility. Southern states that since it has acquired BWP, it has operated the facilities to receive gas supplies purchased by Southern from the Corinne Field, Monroe County, Mississippi. It is stated that these gas purchase contracts terminated on November 1, 1994. Southern states that since it has no gas purchase obligations or any firm transportation service obligations in Corinne Field, Southern has no need to continue to operate and maintain the facilities. Southern states that upon receipt of abandonment authorization, the Black Warrior Pipeline will be sold to Geodyne, the Corinne Field Pipeline will be abandoned in place and the compressor units and measuring and receiving station will be removed and either sold, scrapped or returned to inventory. Comment date: December 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F.
