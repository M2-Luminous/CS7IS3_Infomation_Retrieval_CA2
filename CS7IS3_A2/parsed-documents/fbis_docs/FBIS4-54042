Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Bill Clinton hailed the trade accord in a telephone call after negotiators clinched the deal after four days of intense talks which wound up shortly after 1 A.M. Tuesday. "Where there is a will there is a way," Hata was quoted as telling Clinton during the 40-minute phone chat. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who announced the accord at a White House news conference, said he also talked with foreign minister Koji Kakizawa over the phone Tuesday morning and the two agreed to meet in Paris early next month. Both Kantor and Kakizawa are scheduled to attend the ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development scheduled to be held in Paris on June 7-8. Clinton and Hata agreed that the accord "shows they can resolve issues and strengthen relations between the two countries, and it will boost confidence between the two countries," Kantor said. The heart of the controversy over the framework agreement concluded between the two countries in July last year centers on the so-called "objective criteria" for measuring imports into Japan. The framework talks collapsed in February when Tokyo rejected U.S. demands which Japanese officials criticized as "numerical targets" for market shares of U.S. products in the Japanese market. "The two sides agreed that the objective criteria do not mean numerical targets," said Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. Kantor, while confirming that the U.S. is not seeking "numerical targets," emphasized that any agreement with Japan must result in "increased access and sales" to the Japanese market. The U.S. will not accept "merely changing regulations and procedures" in Japan, Kantor said. The agreement announced Tuesday [24 May] calls for negotiations to work out the specific language on the objective criteria for three "priority" industry areas -- Japanese Government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. Hayashi, speaking at a separate news conference in Washington, said the two countries have agreed to use both "quantitative and qualitative" yardsticks to measure progress of imports into Japan. Negotiations on the three priority areas are expected to begin "as soon as possible," Hayashi said. Kantor said the two sides also plan to begin negotiations on financial services, another industry covered by the framework accord. Kantor said the U.S. also expects Japan to take aggressive fiscal measures to boost both domestic demand and imports. The deal came two weeks after Clinton agreed to work out a common "basis" for restarting the framework talks before the Group of Seven summit meeting scheduled for July 8-10 in Naples. The rupture of the framework negotiations at the summit meeting between Clinton and Hata's predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, badly soured bilateral trade relations and rocked global financial markets. The agreement to restart the framework talks "will help improve our mutual understanding and mutual trust," Hayashi said. Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu, a key Japanese negotiator in the framework talks, said the new accord should "wipe out" the concern of countries in Asia and Europe over the trade frictions between the world's two largest economies. The agreement announced Tuesday, however, marks only the first step toward anything like an equilibrium in trade between Japan and the U.S. Japan's vast trade surplus with the U.S. -- the primary cause behind last year's initiative for the framework talks -- remains huge and growing. Japan posted a record 59 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. last year. Trade figures released by the U.S. Commerce Department last week showed Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. jumped 25 percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars.
