However, some banks have not been conducting their business according to the rules. They are only declaring their investment capital, which remains outside the country, and lending customers' savings as loans to get interest. This will no longer be allowed as the National Bank plans to introduce four measures to strengthen commercial banks' legal operations. In early June there are about 30 private banks operating in Phnom Penh. The four measures are as follows: 1. Private banks are required to deposit 5 percent of their investment capital with the National Bank. 2. Each commercial bank's expenditure on immovable property, such as land for buildings and furniture, should not be more than 30 percent of its investment capital. 3. Each commercial bank should deposit 5 percent of its savings with the National Bank to prevent commercial banks from using the excuse of not having money when customers want their savings back. 4. Loans to individuals or to groups should not exceed 10 percent of the bank's investment capital and should not exceed 20 percent of the borrower's assets. A commercial bank that refuses to implement the four measures will not be closed but will have some of its activities curtailed.
