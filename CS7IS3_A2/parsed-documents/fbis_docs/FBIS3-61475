Khavanov, Yu.S. Sedov, S.I. Poloskov, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791.75.03-52] [Abstract] A combination of stringent requirements imposed on the welded joint quality, a wide range of welded materials and product types, and diverse welding condition in erection practices necessitated optimization of the types of semiautomatic welding machines and their unification. To this end, the association carried out a systemic analysis of domestic and foreign semiautomatic welding machines and a structural analysis of their principal functional systems. The study revealed that today's industry needs could be met by four types of semiautomatic welding machines for steel and aluminum sheet joints (using wires). A modified design of pipe welding heads on the basis of the ODA 46-72 base prototype, the SA-616 pipe welding head, the SA-577 automatic welding machine for welding pipes into tube plates, the Kama-1 chamber head for the SA-621 machine, and the self-propelled SA-615 welding head designed on the basis of modular components are described in detail. All designs employ the building block principle with the following components: welding wire feed mechanism for all standard sizes; three types of control equipment; and five types of wedding heads with four types of welding wire with a single central brake; in addition, replaceable and fast wearing parts, e.g., feed rollers, guides, current leads, etc., are also unified in the mechanisms and burners. It is noted that the possibilities of unifications have not been fully exhausted. Figures 5.
