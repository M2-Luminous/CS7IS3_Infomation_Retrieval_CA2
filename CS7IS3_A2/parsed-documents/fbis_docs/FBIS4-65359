He said so on Radio J, adding that in the current context, a party without a candidate finds it hard to exist. According to Mr. Monory, should the majority have two candidates, "there would have to be a gentleman's agreement between them." Asked whether he would himself stand in the election, Rene Monory said that he was "quite relaxed" about it. "What I am interested in," he added, "is for the debate in the presidential campaign to be based on truth." Mr. Monory would not want the future president of the Republic to be elected "on a fuzzy platform; otherwise, he would ultimately fail." Even though the French may not like it, there are a number of things that must be said. Furthermore, any reforms being envisioned "must be announced before the election. This is a matter of sincerity," he said. As for the European election, Mr. Monory does not want to delude himself. He believes that 35 percent of the vote will be a good result for the majority's list. He also advises [majority list leader and Toulouse Mayor] Dominique Baudis not to get "too big for his britches" if he does achieve a good result. This was Mr. Monory's answer to a question about Mr. Baudis' intentions, which might be to stand in the presidential election after the European one.
