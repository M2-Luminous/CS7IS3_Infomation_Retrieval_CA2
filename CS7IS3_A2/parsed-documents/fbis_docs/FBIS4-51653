The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is not participating in the new government, and therefore it is a minority government. We cannot help but say that the road ahead of the Hata government is rough. Immediately following his talks with SDPJ Chairman Murayama, which ended in failure, Prime Minister Hata formed his cabinet without the SDPJ's participation. He must have thought that it was essential to form the cabinet quickly, to avoid prolonging the interregnum. We think it was inevitable that he would form the cabinet in that way. There are a number of immediate, difficult problems confronting the Hata government, which already faces difficulties in managing the political situation. We urge not only Prime Minister Hata but also the new cabinet ministers to come to grips with those problems, keeping in mind the situation affecting Japan. "Because the new government has to tackle important tasks right away, I have given these people, including those of the younger generation, cabinet portfolios because they are competent in the affairs of the secretariats they will head," Hata said after naming his cabinet. The prime minister's comment reflects his determination to navigate the violent seas ahead with a cabinet that will take a practical approach in settling the critical problems facing the nation. The new cabinet clearly shows that Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the core member of the coalition, will have a bigger say in running the government. Although many analysts say that Hata's minority government will likely be short-lived, Shinseito members in the cabinet seem determined to serve Hata well in running the government by drawing on their experience as former members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. The post of chief cabinet secretary has been given to Shinseito member Hiroshi Kumagai, who served as minister of international trade and industry in the Hosokawa cabinet. Thus, Shinseito members are in the pivotal posts of prime minister and chief government spokesman. Unlike the Hosokawa cabinet's combination of a prime minister from the Japan New Party and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from Sakigake [Harbinger], Hata and Kumagai will be able to function more flexibly and swiftly in making decisions when different viewpoints must be ironed out. The Hata-Kumagai team should also be able to function well in times of crisis management. Settle Urgent Issues Quickly The top priority task given to the new cabinet is to pass the budget bill for fiscal year 1994. The bill must be adopted as soon as possible. Fortunately, the LDP and the SDPJ have made a commitment to cooperate in seeking the swift passage of the budget bill. Both the ruling and opposition camps should begin budget deliberations without delay. The early passage of the bill is indispensable to the government's efforts to get the economy--which is showing signs of a recovery--back on track. Along with the adoption of the budget bill, the government is required to urgently carry out a reform of the tax system and to break the impasse in Japan's economic relations with the United States. The government has to conclude the issue of tax system reform by the end of June while making efforts to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. To continue tax cuts into next year and beyond in order to boost domestic spending and to cope with the challenges of an aging society, the Hata cabinet must work for indirect tax hikes accompanied by effective administrative reform. Promoting deregulation as part of economic reform is also important. The appointment of the Hosokawa cabinet's finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, to the same post in the Hata cabinet shows that the prime minister takes a serious view of the job of revitalizing the economy by such means as expanding domestic demand, tax reform, and deregulation. Hata's decision to have Koshiro Ishida retain his post as Management and Coordination Agency director general means a turn to strong administrative reforms, which are crucial to the success of deregulation. We have no objection to the Hata cabinet assuming the economic and administrative reform lines set by the Hosokawa cabinet. We hope that the new cabinet will play a leading role in carrying out those reform while holding the bureaucrats' resistance in check. As for crisis management, Japan must keep its attention on the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program. How Japan will maintain and strengthen its cooperative relations with the United Nations as well as with the United States and South Korea is now being tested. Prime Minister Hata -- together with Foreign Minister Kakizawa and Defense Agency Director General Kanda, who have become cabinet members for the first time -- is required to hasten to study possible measures that can deal with any emergency situations in the future. It is obvious that the political base of the Hata administration is weak. Many in the political world anticipate that the cabinet will most likely be forced either to resign en masse or dissolve the House of Representatives and call a general election shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget is passed, thus creating a tense situation within the political arena again. LDP, SDPJ Must Act Responsibly Meanwhile, the cooperative ties that are apparently being forged between the LDP and the SDPJ are irresponsible. The tieup is outrageous if it is aimed at toppling the Hata cabinet and eventually nullifying the electoral reform plan--the introduction of single-seat constituencies combined with proportional representation--that was passed in January. If the LDP were in power now, it would have to deal responsibly, just as the Hata cabinet does, with such key issues as tax reform, trade friction, and the North Korean problem. It should be noted that a significantly large number of Liberal Democrats are able to concur with the policies advocated by the Hata administration on these questions. Nevertheless, it seems that most LDP members, apparently either in pursuit of partisan interests or animosity over being driven out of power, have taken a futile confrontational attitude toward the coalition government. The LDP should rise above partisan politics and join hands with the coalition and put the nation's interests first. Now is not the time for ruling and opposition camps to be pitted against each other over whether the cabinet should resign or whether a snap general election should be staged. In the SDPJ camp, there is also a group of legislators in favor of the reform policies of the Hata cabinet which is willing to find ways to cope realistically with impending issues facing the country. Prime Minister Hata, under the circumstances, should continue his efforts to muster all political forces sharing a common will in order to create a stable government.
