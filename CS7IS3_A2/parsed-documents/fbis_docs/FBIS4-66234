Shi Wanpeng believes that in 1993 the overall movement of the economy was in a good direction, and this was primarily manifested in the following: Industrial production grew rapidly. In 1993 for the country as a whole the village level and above village level total industrial output value was 3.5074 trillion yuan, an increase of 23.6 percent in comparison to the previous year, was greatest increase in the 15-year period since reform and opening. Of this total, the increase for state-owned industry was 8.9 percent, light industry increased 22.3 percent, and heavy industry was up 24.8 percent. In addition, there was a new increase in production of a set of major industrial products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Industrial product sales were brisk, and the production and marketing rate increased. For the year as a whole, the industrial product marketing rate reached 96.4 percent, an increase of 0.9 percent over the previous year. The industrial product marketing rate from November on showed a marked acceleration, and in December the production and marketing rate reached 109.86 percent. Urban and rural markets were thriving and active. For the year as a whole, the total retail value of commodities in the society increased by 23.6 percent, and in December the increase was 35.3 percent. Rural markets rose relatively quickly, and the difference in the expansion of rural and urban markets for the first half of the year of 10.4 percent dropped for the year as a whole to 6.4 percent. The situation involving a shortage of enterprise funds was ameliorated. From September 1993 on, the industrial operating funds and loans showed a marked increase. From September to December the total new increase in industrial operating funds and loans reached 97.5 billion yuan, while for the whole year the new increases in the industrial operating funds and loans reached 139.8 billion yuan. Grain market prices have basically been controlled. At the end of last year, a situation of price rises emerged in some areas in the grain market. The State Council in a timely manner took measures involving the utilization of state grain reserves to stabilize prices, and at present grain market prices have basically been controlled. In talking about the trends of current economic movement, Comrade Shi believes that due to some new conditions that have emerged since last November, the current economic environment is not hospitable. This is primarily manifested in: The market price situation is grim, though trends for reversing this are gaining strength. In 1993, the retail price inflation in the society as a whole from March on doubled, and for the year as a whole was predicted to increase roughly 13 percent. City and rural prices had the same level of increase, and the rural price expansion for the year as a whole was predicted to reached 12.5 percent; household living expense price expansion reached 14.5 percent, among which for 35 big cities the increase reached 19.6 percent. The scale of fixed capital investment was too large, and had an irrational structure. In 1993, fixed capital investment was able to reach 1.2 trillion yuan, of which state-owned units investment increased more than 60 percent; the total scale of investment involving projects under construction totalled 3.3 trillion yuan, a four fold increased over the previous year, and the proportion of closing year end unfinished projects reached 57.6 percent. The investment structure was not rational to a great extent, and the proportion of investment in basic industry dropped from the first half of the year, at 42.9 percent, down to 36.9 percent, while the proportion of extended investment increased from 34.1 percent to 38.6 percent, there was a high level of consumption, and a great number of leading consumption projects. Industrial production for December of last year increased at an above normal rate. That month, the national village and above village level industrial production from the high base level of 32.2 percent of the same month the previous year increased by 29.8 percent, or the second highest rate of growth after the 30.2 percent increase of June, while the monthly chain index increase reached 18.2 percent, a more than 10 percentage point increase over the normal annual increase. This above normal increase could give new life to the contradiction of the shortage of funds. Increases in mutual arrears among enterprises. According to Industrial Bank statistics for 40,000 enterprises, at the end of November 1993, debt owed funds were 341.2 billion yuan, an increase from earlier in the year of 178.7 billion yuan; while credit funds were 289.8 billion yuan, an increase of 70.5 billion yuan from early in the year. The import of some major commodities exceeds planning by a considerable degree. Among the most prominent of these are steel products, and petroleum products, while car imports also exceed planned targets by a substantial margin. Rail transport is still constrained. In 1993, the volume of goods transported by railroad was 1.567 billion tons, only a 2.9 increase from the previous year. In 1994, the shortage situation for the volume of goods transported by rail will not markedly improve, particularly due to the spring transport time delays, which will have a major impact on the transport of goods by rail. When it comes to the new situation currently emerging for the movement of the economy, Comrade Shi believes that it is necessary to treat controlling the scale of fixed capital investment and price increases as the major tasks to grapple with, and continue to strengthen and improve macro adjustment, while steadily realizing an increase in the people's economy in the process of readjustment. 1. Strengthen guidance towards citizens' psychological expectations and social consumption. It is necessary to gradually deepen dissemination of the contents of reforms dealing with foreign currency and the tax system, and strengthen guidance of the media, actively launch some directed propaganda, to increase the understanding of reform of enterprises and broad numbers of people, remove doubts, and avoid blind action. 2. Strict control and active guidance of fixed capital investments. When it comes to investment it is necessary to strictly achieve planning sufficient funding, and not leave gaps. First, there is strict control of new launching of construction projects; second, this involves not permitting the use of operating funds for loans to make investments; third, this involves the fact that new construction projects must plan for a sufficient cushion in operating funds, and those that are insufficient should not be permitted to start work; fourth, this involves the need to devise a way to fill the gap in funds for newly completed and operating projects in 1993-1994; fifth, this involves directing investment and effectively guiding it towards increasing the society's supply, and improving the production structure. This is the key to having the new macro regulation obtain new results. 3. In accordance with market conditions, at present it is necessary to increase the national special reserves of products such as grains, edible oils, meats, sugar, and cotton, and for existing reserve stores to conduct an inventory and checks to find out what resources are available, and make accounts of materials tally up. 4. Strengthen management of the import and export of primary commodities. It is necessary as rapidly as possible to investigate and promote measures for increasing product exports, and at the same time it is necessary to properly handle import regulations for major commodities and goods and materials, such as steel products, oil, and cars. 5. Serious financial policies and strengthening of financial management. When it comes to the issue of mutual debt between enterprises, it is recommended that some provinces and cities or industry be chosen for deepening of investigation and finding out about the situation, and researching methods for resolving issues, and preventing the recurrence of prolonged debt. Comrade Shi Wanpeng stressed that this year is a year when the degree of strength of the implementation of various reform measures will be comparatively large, and properly handling the immediate macro regulation, improving the production structure, and increasing the society's effective supply are the key to smoothly implementing the policy of "grasping opportunity, deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability," and should draw the sufficient attention of government at all levels and of responsible economic departments. At the conclusion of the interview, Comrade Shi expressed his hope that the "Economic Work Newsletter" would progressively develop its characteristics such as its broad readership, large volume of policy information, and its high level of authoritativeness, while properly handling its propaganda work in the economic field, truly becoming an intimate friend of enterprises and responsible economic departments at all levels.
