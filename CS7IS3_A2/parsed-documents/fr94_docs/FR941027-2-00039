FR941027-2-00039 FR941027-2-00027 FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION [Notice 1994&hyph;16] Privacy Act; Proposed Notice of New and/or Revised Systems of Records Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93&hyph;579, 5 U.S.C. 552(e)(11), the Federal Election Commission is publishing for comment new and revised systems of records that are maintained by the Commission. A new systems report was filed with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, the Chairman of the House Committee on Government Operations and the Office of Management and Budget on October 21, 1994. These systems have been revised or proposed as a result of a re-evaluation of the manner in which records are maintained by the Commission. The new system of records which has been added is the Inspector General Investigative Files (FEC 12). The authority under which this system is maintained is 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). See 11 CFR part 1.14. All other systems have been revised to incorporate administrative changes which have taken place since the last publication of FEC systems of records in 1984 and 1988. These new and revised systems should provide improved protection for the privacy and property rights of Commission employees, applicants for employment and those who deal with the Commission. The Commission is proposing to exempt new records system FEC 12 from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for this purpose is found elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. Comments must be in writing and addressed to: Tina VanBrakle, Privacy Act Officer, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463. Dated: October 24, 1994. Trevor Potter, Chairman.
