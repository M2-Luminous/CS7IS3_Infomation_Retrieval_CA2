The Bundeswehr general inspector, General Naumann, insists that this should not occur at the expense of the first task, the ability to defend, and in the case of "conflict management," the alliance should also be able to act alone, that is, independently of a UN mandate. He warns against abandoning the usual NATO organizational framework, that is cooperation under an integrated command structure, in the event of crisis management, and forming ad hoc coalitions between individual nations, which would encourage the reintroduction of national elements into European policy and reduce alliance cohesion. This would also apply to cooperation with the Americans. The relationship should not be called into question by the Europeans, nor should the Europeans do anything that would encourage the Americans to give in to tendencies to give up the idea of collective Western foreign and security policy. "Crisis management" also requires collective action. The general inspector recently set out his thoughts and concerns to the German-British Officers Association in Bad Neuenahar. He warned against pursuing collective crisis management, which has moved to the forefront of alliance policy since the Brussels NATO conference, at the expense of collective security. Both elements must be maintained. His observations not only clearly referred to tendencies toward an "ad hoc approach" in France, but also among other allies. "We must reorganize, but without splitting up the integrated command structure." He expressly warned against performing assignments under Article 4 of the NATO Treaty (crisis) using organizational forms other than the customary and proven ones of the integrated command structure for the event of Article 5 (the duty to provide support in defense cases). The failure of Western policy with regard to the war in the Balkans and in Somalia are the concrete background for these thoughts. Naumann's assessment has received the backing of the current NATO commander of the Northern Group of Forces, Sir Charles Guthrie, and of two of his predecessors, General Sir Peter Inge and Field Marshal Sir Nigel Bagnall, as well as the former commander of the NATO Central Europe Force, General von Sandrart. The Threat Axis Has Shifted South The general inspector used the opportunity to discuss new elements of German security policy. Following 1989, the NATO "threat axis" has shifted from the east to the "south." This has imposed considerably more work on the NATO Southern Europe Command (Naples). However, as before, the European central region, Germany, France, and the British and U.S. forces on the continent, remains the region that would be most involved in crisis management irrespective of where the crisis is. "The focus of NATO military policy will remain the central region, even if in future conflicts will tend to be in the south." The German general inspector and General Guthrie, who are in agreement on the matter, blamed the failure of the deployment of Western forces in both the conflicts in the Balkans and Somalia on ignoring Clausewitz's maxim that a political goal must be set before forces are deployed. Both generals fear that, in future, this will also be a problem for collective crisis management, especially as in the case of crisis management, differences of opinion stemming from national interests are more likely to come to the fore than in the event of collective defense against a direct attack. Soldiers need clear political goals, said Guthrie, sufficient resources to be certain of accomplishing their task, and instructions to make preparations as soon as possible, meaning that time was required to improve soldiers' training for special assignments in foreign environments. However, said Guthrie, politicians generally find it difficult to set the military a clear political assignment in good time, because politicians seek to keep options open for as long as possible and when action is finally taken, they then say that things can be done very quickly and simply without much expenditure. "Politicians seldom give us sufficient reserves for materiel, personnel, and mobilization. They believe that the job can be done with less." General Naumann pointed out that since the great changes that have occurred in the threat situation since 1989, it is true that objectively, the "warning time" for performing a defense role has risen to about a year, but militarily "effective warning time" only amounted to between three and six months, because political leaderships hesitate in identifying a dangerous situation and issuing the appropriate instructions to the military leadership. This particularly applies to identifying a "crisis." Today, crises are no longer a short transition period between peace and war, but a third state that might last longer and is marked by ambiguous signals and contradictory threats. That makes decisions on prevention and action instead of reaction more difficult. The contradictory nature of "signals" and the ups and downs in a crisis result in "free reign" being given to the situation, as was the case with former Yugoslavia. Naumann showed that crisis management entailing "peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" -- General Inge pointed out that the two were very close, the one might apply to one village and other to the next village, or they might rapidly alternate in the same place -- cannot be pursued at the expense of defense by citing a simple example. If the Bundeswehr must make 50,000 men available for deployment in a crisis, then it could either only send a small number of the men to another country, because others would have to remain for training and replacement purposes, or it would have to mobilize reservists, because otherwise the Bundeswehr's main task, the ability to provide collective defense, could not be fulfilled. Without a Mandate From the UN or the CSCE A British general pointed out that until now NATO had permitted individual nations to remove troops from NATO obligations to special emergency situations temporarily (for example, U.S. troops during the Vietnam War and British troops during the Falklands War). That was possible because other allies could fill the gaps. This is another reason why "crisis management" cannot be divorced from defense and both have to be pursued collectively as an alliance. There is no way in which one could have two sets of troops, one for defense and the other for "overseas crisis management." It would also be impossible to form two leadership structures. It is particularly important to strengthen those elements that "multiply" the armed forces, for example, resources for intelligence, leadership, and rapid (air and sea) transportation of forces. Without the Americans, there would be insufficient intelligence for the foreseeable future and without the alliance, there would be no experienced leadership for the command of the armed forces of several countries. He repeated once again that ad hoc cooperation was not enough. General Naumann said that if Germany wants to participate in solving an international crisis, then essentially one must be ready to deploy troops and one cannot hide behind supposed prohibitions based on German history or behind the German Constitution. It is also just as important that NATO should see such action as its own affair and not allow itself to be turned into the recipient of UN or CSCE mandates, because there will be situations in which neither the UN or the CSCE will be able to adopt decisions. The Federal Republic would never act alone, without its allies, in defense or in crisis management.
