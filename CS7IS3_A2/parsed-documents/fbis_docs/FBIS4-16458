You have recently warned that, as a result of the budget cuts, the army might get out of control. Is Russia -- in a time of peace -- threatened by a military and arms technological collapse? [Kokoshin] There is in practice never a hopeless situation, because a way out can always be found. In this case the way out is to restructure the budget. This applies mainly to the revenue side. My main criticism was directed against the fact that the spending was planned without a sufficient guarantee of revenue. This is why we are being affected by this budget, although not only the Defense Ministry but also in the spheres of culture, science, and social affairs. [Schmidt-Haeuer] Still, in this situation the army is a very special budget item. [Kokoshin] About 70 percent of our concrete military spending now goes on personnel costs and social benefits. This is why we are in the same boat as science and culture, with doctors and teachers. We do not stand on the other side of the riverbank. Another thing is, of course, that here we are talking of money to be spent on providing guarantees for people in uniform and with guns in their hand; and also for those who produce the arms. [Schmidt-Haeuer] Through military reform, President Yeltsin wants to facilitate the restructuring of the defense budget to the benefit of social support. Can one really combine the modernization of the army and social emergency supply? [Kokoshin] There are a number of concrete decisions, one of which is the president's decree on the stabilization of the situation in the arms industry. The president determines that at least 10 percent of defense spending has to be used for research and development. This is intended to guarantee the preservation of the scientific-technological potential. However, at the same time we are facing enormous social problems. Let us take housing construction, for example. It is now eating up more than 90 percent of the funds for our military construction program -- after all, we have to accommodate those members of the military who go into the reserves as a result of troop reductions. Here the situation has deteriorated even from last year. In the first three months of 1994 the financing of housing construction unfortunately reached less than 20 percent of the planned quota. The situation also looks very bad as far as paying for arms is concerned -- although state orders had been cut to the minimum even before. [Schmidt-Haeuer] What effects does this have in concrete terms? [Kokoshin] Now as then, many enterprises and entire cities are dependent on arms orders. Even though the share of arms and military technology has been reduced there in favor of civilian goods, the management continues to burden the total costs for the entire social infrastructure, that is to say kindergartens, polyclinics, schools, and frequently even technical colleges, only on the prices for arms products. And the city and communal administrative bodies hesitate to take over the social facilities because their revenue is still insufficient despite the new tax law. So far, they have only picked those complexes that they were able to lease out immediately for a profit. This is how part of defense spending is financing hidden unemployment.... [Schmidt-Haeuer] And to what extent has this spending been cut overall? [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, our orders for the arms industry were cut by 67 percent in 1992 alone. This is unparalleled in any other country. In 1992 we bought a total of 20 tanks from our industry -- in 1988 the number was still 2,800. And the considerably extended amount of civilian products did not find enough buyers either -- neither state nor private ones. [Schmidt-Haeuer] This means that the conversion of enterprises is not worthwhile? [Kokoshin] Many enterprises have considerably increased the range of their civilian products. The tank construction plant at Nishniy Tagil, for example, has been converted to the production of railroad tankers and loading machines [Lademaschinen] amid great fuss. Yet, now these tankers are crowding the storage yards. The Railroads Ministry does not have the money to buy them. Radio satellites cannot be bought by the Ministry for Telecommunications, nor can it afford to buy the rockets to launch them. [Schmidt-Haeuer] In order to pay the state's orders to the arms industry, the state would have to spend five times as much as planned in the 1994 draft budget. [Kokoshin] The figures presented by the Finance Ministry are unrealistic. However, now there is the proposal that government and the State Duma together draw up the 1994 budget again. After the extremely tough confrontations last year, there is thus the opportunity to work out a new budget in the spirit of national accord -- thus, in the spirit of the policy that President Yeltsin has now proclaimed and that is supported by the chairmen of both parliamentary chambers. [Schmidt-Haeuer] But former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy has just come out very harshly against Yeltsin's offer of reconciliation. And Rutskoy is also a military officer.... [Kokoshin] He is no longer a military officer. And such an attitude seems completely wrong to me. Now we really have an opportunity for national reconciliation. And we need it urgently. I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our people also want it. [Schmidt-Haeuer] A high-ranking representative of the interests of the arms industry has warned against a wave of strikes. He says that the miners just have a piece of coal in their hands, but the arms companies have poison or intermediate-range missiles, which almost any unqualified worker could launch from the factory's yard. How serious is the mood in reality? [Kokoshin] Unfortunately, we have come very close to strikes, even though the most disciplined people are working in the arms sectors. And they are also aware that they are in a situation that is a bit different from that of the miners, that other laws apply to them. However, in the factories there is indeed a mood that indicates strikes. Last autumn I had to settle several such conflicts. In September the staff of a large arms company went on strike. The women took the protest to the streets. We had to take a lot of money out of many other companies to pay them their wages and to pay support to them for another two months. Such situations are escalating again now, so I do not want to underestimate the danger of strikes. [Schmidt-Haeuer] How many arms companies have closed down because of bankruptcy, and for how many is this danger imminent? [Kokoshin] From the legal point of view, I do not think that a single one has been closed down, because the local administrations are doing everything to avert this danger. Since we lack social security and an unemployment benefit system and people are not mentally prepared for life without work, closing down companies and lay-offs feel like the apocalypse for the local authorities. However, I do not believe that the situation is hopeless. Even if they get only small financial infusions, many companies would certainly be able not only to start working again but to continue the policy of modernization and production conversion. If certain incentives are given by the government, we can expect that private businessmen and banks will also invest in the industry. However, without a strong incentive by the government to develop the infrastructure, that is, transportation, communications, and the energy sector, it will be very difficult to get out of the crisis. The invisible hand of the market still works very badly. [Schmidt-Haeuer] And the visible hand of the state does not work any better, either, at least for the time being.... [Kokoshin] The state is not fulfilling its obligations. We used to be the scapegoat for the people. Now they realize that it is not our Ministry's fault. [Schmidt-Haeuer] But that does not provide food. Anyone who can tries to earn his keep elsewhere. The fear of Russian scientists emigrating, and of the illegal export of uranium and highly developed weapons and technologies continues. [Kokoshin] Such dangers certainly exist. The hunt for experts continues. And there are people who cannot do anything other than build weapons. For their minds any kind of conversion is too late. Therefore, it is so important to preserve and finance an appropriate level of arms production to keep these experts in Russia -- in a Russia that continues along the path of democracy and market economy. [Schmidt-Haeuer] But you yourself, in an interview, have attributed yet another state assignment to the arms industry, namely to be the most important resource of competitiveness. [Kokoshin] However, I put the emphasis on something else on principle. There I made the establishment of a science-intensive high-tech civilian production a priority -- but on the basis of the resources of the defense complex. This is our main potential to assume a worthy place among the great powers, among the developed industrialized nations. For me this seems to be a more important aspect for the state's security in the broadest sense -- beyond military power and military technology.
