During the meeting, Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih greeted those attending and through them all the sons of the governorate. He referred to the daily concerns of the sons of our Yemeni people and their tribulations as a result of the crisis our country is experiencing at this stage of its history. He said that he has taken note of what many sons of the governorate have spoken about, and who have aired their concerns during this meeting. He said: I would like to thank my brothers, the sons of this governorate who have contributed to the success of the large popular gathering in the governorate through which they have emphasized their concern for the unity of the homeland and the cohesion of its sons, and blessed this gathering, which is a positive and effective sign and an example the other governorates should emulate to voice their views and air their concerns on the crisis the homeland and unity are experiencing in these circumstances. The brother president spoke about the causes of the current political crisis in the country. He said: We know very well who has fabricated this crisis that has greatly harmed our national economy and has created a rift in national unity. The brother president reviewed the efforts that were exerted to reunite the homeland, a strategic objective of the Yemeni revolution and the most cherished achievement recorded by the Yemeni people since 1981. He also noted the meetings and dialogue that followed until 22 May 1990, when these efforts were crowned with the declaration of the establishment of unity and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen by peaceful and brotherly means through which the one Yemeni family, which had been dispersed by colonialism and the imamate, was reunited. The brother president said: The Yemenis offered the most cherished sacrifices to regain this unity. The brother president thanked the sons of the Ta'izz Governorate for hosting the meeting of the Yemeni ulema, which is being held in the mosque of revered Prophet Muhammad's companion Ma'adh ibn-Jabal in the al-Janad area in accordance with the call that was addressed to me and to the brother vice president to meet in this historical mosque and in this heroic city to study the present crisis and find solutions that will save the masses of our people from the tribulation they suffer as a result of the economic crisis brought about by the political crisis and the great impact it has left on the daily life of the citizen. The brother president said: In these critical circumstances, I call on every citizen to say what he believes to be right and to confront what is wrong without fear. He added: We want every citizen to say to the person who committed a mistake that he has done so and to the benefactor that he has done right. We want the citizen to raise his sincere and resonant voice on what is taking place now, fearing God only. In his address, the brother president spoke about the causes of the crisis and its developments. He said: The crisis has been exacerbated since 19 August last year following the return of my comrade and colleague 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] secretary general, from his trip abroad for treatment. All the masses of our people are aware of this. We have endured many falsehoods, and suffered great harm, and the falsification of facts for the sake of the homeland and to safeguard unity. Everyone knows that the crisis began within the framework of our partner, the YSP, which later transferred it into a crisis between the president and his deputy, and then between the General People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP, and then between the GPC, the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. We must now clarify things and tell all the facts so that all the people will know who is responsible for the crisis and how it has been exacerbated. He said that the government under Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has not come forth with any state budget since 1993 and the state is now being run in 1994 without any budget. He explained that some forces and quarters are working to destroy the state's institutions, particularly the forces and quarters that stood against unity and seek to spread disorder, corruption, and sabotage in our society. The brother president said: We must shun all the experiences that were tried during the so-called fragmentation era and evaluate our experience in the economic, administrative, and development areas by economic, sharia, law, and administration scientists and experts so that we may choose the best. We are not biased toward any single experience. What we want is to build our homeland on sound bases, away from oneupmanship and empty slogans. He indicated that there are those who seek to exacerbate the citizens' sufferings through price hikes to instigate and foment anger and prompt citizens to engage in riots, sabotage, and plunder, as happened on 9-10 December 1992. He noted that he had accepted all the points the YSP has raised since the eruption of the crisis, beginning with the three points regarding the proposed amendments to the drafting of the articles enshrined in the constitutional amendment bills pertaining to local government, the Advisory Council, and the form of presidency, and ending with the 18 points, the acceptance of which was set as a condition for the attainment of a solution, not to mention its demands for the enactment of a presidential elections bill, of which a similar bill has already been passed. The parties to the coalition government concluded an agreement on the aforementioned amendments. We have also accepted the decisions and recommendations made by the masses' gatherings in the provinces, the last of which were the decisions made by the masses' gathering of the Ta'izz Province and the initiative of their eminences the ulema. The brother president added: We have accepted all this to spare Yemen any possible dangers. I have come to Ta'izz to resolve the crisis. In the past, I went several times to Aden to achieve unity. Why then doesn't the Ta'izz meeting materialize to preserve and safeguard unity, spare our people seditions, and relieve them of this immense suffering, which is caused by the crisis? The brother president touched on several current issues, including the issue of local government. He noted that he is for easing the centralization of authority and the introduction of administrative decentralization. He added: We have instructed the government to achieve this objective. We also asked it to draft new legislation stipulating that local councils must create their own revenues, which must be used to implement development and services projects in the provinces. The brother president called upon the residents of the Ta'izz Governorate, and all of our people's masses, to demonstrate vigilance and awareness so they may be able to confront misleading propaganda and the misrepresentation of facts being promoted by some in order to thwart the efforts of those who are attempting to make our country take steps backward or push it into the abyss. The meeting was opened by a recitation of Koranic verses. Then, Shaykh Muhammad Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik delivered a speech on behalf of the province's population. He began by welcoming the brother president. On behalf of the province's population, he thanked the brother president for the favorable response he showed to the ulema's call for a meeting between him and his brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid at al-Janad Mosque. He hoped that this initiative will be well received by all in the interest of Yemen and its stability. He added: Our people's masses are looking forward to this meeting, which we hope will crown all efforts with success, so that our people may cope with their problems and meet the challenges facing their unity. For, this is a must if they are to achieve progress and prosperity under unity, the people's fate. Then, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah al-Dali'i delivered a speech on behalf of the coordination council of political organizations and parties. He began by welcoming the visit of the brother president to the province on this spiritual occasion, which is dear to our Yemeni people. He explained the political organizations' positions on the political crisis being experienced by our country, which is jeopardizing its unity. He added: The Yemeni masses, who have made dear sacrifices to promote the Yemeni revolution and achieve unity, will not hesitate to make additional sacrifices to safeguard unity and entrench it. Afterward, an open discussion was held. Several brother members of the expanded masses' gathering of the Ta'izz Province took part in this discussion. In this discussion, they affirmed their concern for safeguarding and defending the unity of the homeland, and asked that a serious and responsible dialogue be used as a vehicle for defusing the crisis. They also underscored the need for the two brothers, the Presidential Council chairman and the Presidential Council vice chairman, to meet at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in response to the Yemeni ulema's appeal to reach solutions that will resolve the crisis and halt the sufferings and calamities it is causing to citizens. The meeting was attended by several brother state officials.
