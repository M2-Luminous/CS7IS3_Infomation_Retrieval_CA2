Kohl said Wednesday [29 June] on SAT-1 television that, first of all, one has to ask each country whether there is a possibility of agreeing on the candidacy of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. "Then we have to see," the chancellor said. He stated, however, that it is completely absurd to speak of a lasting and profound crisis in the EU because of this issue. At the EU summit in Corfu last weekend, Dehaene's nomination failed because of Britain's veto.
