On the other hand, the EU has been conducting investigations into alleged dumping-margin sales of Korean products in EU member nations. According to a dispatch from the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation (KOTRA) branch in Brussels, the EU executive committee said in a report on the bloc's automobile industry that European car manufacturers have found it difficult to export their products to Korea due to the high tariffs and excise tax plus the frugality campaign aimed at curbing imports of luxurious foreign cars. The committee claimed that Korean makers sold 90,000 cars in Europe compared to 532 units sold by European manufacturers in Korea last year. To retaliate against the alleged import restrictions, the EU is considering revoking the GSP for Korean cars from July, the KOTRA dispatch said. An Association of European Automakers (ACEA) also revealed last week in a Belgium newspaper that they are considering investigating dumping margin sales of Korean car exporters, the Korea Foreign Trade Association said. A Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry official said the major reason why European car sales are poor here is their high prices amounting to 70 million won or more a unit. He cited an increase of 40 percent in sales of U.S. cars last year, adding that Ford Sables are attractive to Korean customers thanks to their reasonable price of some 20 million won. Aware of the EU's complaints about alleged frequent tax probes into owners of foreign cars because of the frugality drive, the official said, the tax administration chief in February made it clear that tax investigations would not be made for the reason of owning a foreign car to wipe out such suspicion. He also said, "It's nonsense to revoke the GSP favor on autos for that reason." The official also noted that Korean automakers will not be hurt by the withdrawal of the GSP as they have already completed their exports to the EU under it. The EU is also considering withdrawing the GSP favor on exports of Korean textiles from July in retaliation for the increase in tariffs on imports of European furs from eight percent to 19 percent for this year. Leon Brittan, vice EC commissioner for external trade, claimed at talks with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in Seoul last November that the hike of tariffs violates the principle of the GATT and UR [Uruguay Round] accords which ban any increase in tariffs from the current level. The EU has informally notified the Korean government that it will withdraw the GSP favor on Korea's textile products for six months, starting July 1, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said. The damages from such action are estimated at $30-50 million, he said, adding that the EU is expected to make a formal decision by the end of this month. The EU in principle claimed that Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea should graduate from its GSP favors as they have outgrown their developing nation status, the official said, adding that the hike in tariffs on fur products cannot be used as a reason for scrapping the GSP favor on Korean textiles. But in a medium-term view, Korea is ready to graduate from the tariff benefits as it plans to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1996, he explained. The EU has recently announced it will impose a 70.6 percent tariff on large-sized aluminum-made batteries being exported by Daewoo Electronics and five other Korean firms on grounds that they have sold their products at below local market prices. The EU launched anti-dumping investigations into them last March. "European excavator makers are expected to file a suit against alleged dumping-margin sales of Korean products this month," said Na Chan-yop in charge of European trade information at KOTRA. Korea is the third largest anti-dumping sufferer with 16 cases under investigation or anti-dumping rulings, following Japan and China, Na said quoting EU statistics disclosed last year. Na pointed out that domestic manufacturers should closely watch import trends in the bloc and Korea's market share to avoid anti-dumping rulings on their products in Europe. He said, "Korea has followed Japan which showered its exports on Europe at cheap prices. China now follows Korea. As a result, the three countries face a large number of anti-dumping investigations and rulings in Europe."
