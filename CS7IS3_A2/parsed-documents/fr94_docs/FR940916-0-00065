ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule adopts new and revised airworthiness standards by incorporating optional one-engine-inoperative (OEI) power ratings for multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft. These amendments result from a petition for rulemaking from Aerospace Industries Association of America (AIA) and the recognition by both government and industry that additional OEI power rating standards are needed. These amendments enhance rotorcraft safety after an engine failure or precautionary shutdown by providing higher OEI power, when necessary. These amendments also assure that the drive system will maintain its structural integrity and allow continued safe flight while operating at the new OEI power ratings with the operable engine(s). EFFECTIVE DATE: October 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Scott Horn, Rotorcraft Standards Staff, FAA, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0112, telephone number (817) 222&hyph;5125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background By letter dated September 20, 1984, the AIA petitioned for rulemaking by requesting amendments to Parts 1, 27, 29, and 33 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to establish new 30-second, 2-minute, and continuous OEI power ratings. In the process of drafting the amendments, numerous meetings were held with the industry groups and airworthiness authorities of other countries in an attempt to identify and address all of the issues. As set forth in the AIA's petition, only multiengine rotorcraft, with turbine-powered engines, would be eligible for these new OEI power ratings which would be applicable to the remaining engine(s) only after an in-flight failure or precautionary engine shutdown. The rated 30-second OEI power would be limited to periods of not more than 30 seconds at any one time and would enhance the OEI performance of the rotorcraft during the transient phase of the takeoff and landing maneuvers. The rated 2-minute OEI power would be limited to periods of not more than 2 minutes at any one time and would achieve initial stabilized climb of at least 100 feet per minute following takeoff or balked landing flight with one engine inoperative. These ratings could be used instead of the existing 21/2-minute OEI power rating or normal takeoff power. The continuous OEI power rating and all aspects of its definition, eligibility, qualification, and performance credit were adopted in Amendments 1&hyph;34, 27&hyph;23, 29&hyph;26, and 33&hyph;12, Rotorcraft Regulatory Review Program Amendment No. 3 (53 FR 34198, September 2, 1988).
