Talking to a gathering in Kamalia today, the minister said the people's government has internationalized the Kashmir issue and tabled the resolution at two international forums. If India will not honor its words, Pakistan will agitate the issue again at international forums with more vigor and force. Commenting on the press statement of Indian authorities in which they contradicted their earlier statement about the visit of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] ambassadors to the held valley, the minister said Pakistan deferred voting on the resolution at Geneva at the request and assurance of Iran which should now take up this issue with India. Mr. Khalid Ahmad Kharal regretted that the opposition is ignoring the national interests by criticizing the government on vitally important national issues like Kashmir. He said despite the opposition's disinformation cell activities and propaganda, the present government would complete its five-year term and continue to serve the masses. He said the People's Party government will implement a series of development projects to improve the socioeconomic status of farmers and bring the backward rural areas at par with the developed ones.
