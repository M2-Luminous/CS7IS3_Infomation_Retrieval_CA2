FR940817-0-00053 FR940817-0-00017 Sections 287.5(a)(1) and 287.8(b)_Power to Interrogate and Detain The commenters suggested that the concept of a ``show of authority'' to restrain the freedom of an individual to walk away under §287.8(b)(1) be expanded to specifically include verbal or psychological abuse. The term ``show of authority'' in the proposed rule was intended to emphasize the intimidating gestures are prohibited during pre-detention questioning. However, the Service has decided to eliminate the term ``show of authority'' as well as the language ``by means of physical force'' in the final rule, thereby clarifying that any action taken by an immigration officer during pre-detention questioning must not lead the person being questioned to believe that he or she is not free to leave the presence of the officer. The Service's training program will ensure that all immigration officers have a thorough understanding of proper procedures for conducting pre-detention questioning. The commenters also suggested that §287.8(b)(2) be substantially amended to include current judicial precedent defining ``reasonable suspicion'' and the general authority to interrogate and detain. Binding judicial precedent such as Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387 (1977), is subject to revision in the ongoing process of litigation, and would not be appropriate to codify. Sections 287.5(c) and 287.8(c)_Power and Authority to Arrest The commenters generally stated that the provisions in §§287.5(c) and 287.8(c) do not incorporate the ``standard with respect to enforcement'' mandated by section 503 of IMMACT. The commenters suggested that the regulations be amended to incorporate the judicial construction of ``reason to believe,'' and to require compliance with outstanding court orders regarding arrest and post-arrest procedures. As stated previously, judicial precedent and other policy standards are subject to revision and are not appropriate to codify. The Service is clearly bound by such interpretations, including those set forth in Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975). Furthermore, the Service is bound to comply with outstanding court orders, and a regulatory provision to that effect is unnecessary. The commenters also suggested that the specific provisions of a temporary settlement agreement in Lopez v. INS, No. CV 78&hyph;1912&hyph;WMB (C.D. Cal. August 24, 1992), be incorporated into the final rule. The Service declines this suggestion for the previously stated reasons, as well as for the fact that nothing in the Lopez case has required the Service to promulgate regulations on this subject. One commenter criticized these sections for permitting individuals who have not fulfilled the statutory training requirement for enhanced arrest authority to be designated as service officers with arrest authority. However, all officers who are designated to have such authority must receive the appropriate training pursuant to §§287.5(c)(4) (iii)&hyph;(iv). The commenter also stated that §287.5(c)(5), in specifying the authority for arrests under section 274 of the Act, failed to distinguish adequately between arrests with and without a warrant. However, this section of the rule incorporates the enforcement standard regarding arrests set forth in §287.8(c), which includes a rule requiring officers whenever possible to obtain a warrant prior to arrest. In criminal cases, pursuant to §287.5(c) (2) and (3), the issuance of such a warrant is reviewed by an Assistant United States Attorney and a Magistrate Judge before an arrest is effected. Sections 242.2(c)(1) and 287.5(e)(2)_Arrest Warrants The commenters stated that §242.2(c)(1) should be amended to provide that an arrest warrant must be obtained unless there is a likelihood of the alien escaping before a warrant can be obtained. This suggestion calls for codification of the judicial precedents concerning exigent circumstances. For the reasons stated previously, the Department does not deem it appropriate to amend this rule to reflect evolving judicial standards. Such standards are incorporated into Service training programs, enforcement guidelines, and manuals. The commenters also suggested that the rule should specify which factors Service officers should use to determine the likelihood of escape. This is the type of discretionary detail that is appropriate in a training course and manual, but not in a regulation. Finally, the commenters suggested that evidence obtained in violation of rules requiring warrants should be suppressed in civil deportation hearings. The Department declines to extend by regulation into civil proceedings the exclusionary rule, which has heretofore been applied exclusively in criminal proceedings. Sections 287.5(d)&hyph;(e) and 287.9(a)_Searches The commenters stated that the rule should provide specific standards governing searches of persons and property at or inside the border; strip and body cavity searches; vehicle stops and searches of persons and vehicles at or inside the border; and searches of private dwellings and lands. Section 503 of IMMACT does not require such specificity in enforcement regulations. Moreover, for that reasons set forth above, such standards will be appropriately addressed in Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals.
