SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes: On the day after the expiration of the NATO ultimatum, the United Nations and NATO must admit they are still at the beginning. The threat of the use of force was only the first step and not the finale. NATO and the United Nations must not decrease their efforts. Direct pressure on all parties to the war must continue to exist until the fight against the siege of Sarajevo is finally over. If NATO and the United Nations achieve in the long run [a situation in which] shots are no longer fired in Sarajevo, this would bring great relief. However, the town can only survive if peace is restored in other areas, too. Public attention has mainly focused on the Bosnian capital in this war. However, it was overlooked that the fiercest fighting took place in other regions, and that Sarajevo was not so important for the Serbs. NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG points out: Despite the modest hope that is budding in view of developments in Sarajevo, the rest of Bosnia must not be forgotten. Fighting is still going on in many places. The community of states must show the same determination with which it supported a cease-fire in the capital in other focal points, too -- in Tuzla, for example, where the Serbs launched new attacks during the weekend, or in Gorazde, Srebrenica, or Mostar. Otherwise the chances for peace that were created in Sarajevo will again be wasted. LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG stresses another aspect. The NATO ultimatum for Sarajevo does not only mean a decision for the Serbs over war or peace with NATO, but it is part of the historic changes that are currently taking place. Bosnia is not a NATO member, and no NATO state has been attacked. Still, NATO prepared itself for military strikes -- for the first time under such preconditions since its founding in 1949. Thus, NATO has abandoned the principles valid during the East-West confrontation and has broken new ground the outline of which is not yet clearly discernible. The assessment of this step will probably only be possible after the next few decades, when new global structures are developed. DIE WELT states: Russia's return to the policy vis-a-vis the Balkans is of particular significance. With the deployment of Russian soldiers in the Bosnian theater of war, Moscow has adopted a leading position allowing it to codetermine or block any political solution. Blocking NATO was one of Moscow's goals from the very beginning. Because of increased consideration for Russia's interests, the consequences will become visible in Athens, Ankara, and everywhere else in southeastern Europe. Russia is behaving like a major European power, and it will again find political customers via Belgrade, particularly because the internal cohesion of NATO has been critically weakened at its southern flank. Not only the situation around Sarajevo has changed but the European situation, too.
