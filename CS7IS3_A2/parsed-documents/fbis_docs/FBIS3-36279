For the first time in the history of motor vehicle sport there was a display of military motor vehicles and technical servicing facilities, mobile workshops, and heavy traction vehicles with which the Russian Army is being equipped. Alongside the well-known two-, three-, and four-axled Mustang-class KamAZ trucks which won prizes in the 1992 Paris-Dakar Rally, new vehicles were also on display. They included high all-terrain capability wheeled and tracked GAZ-47 and GAZ-47-04 vehicles designed to carry personnel and light arms. It is planned to equip the mobile forces which are currently being formed with these vehicles. Heavy traction vehicles also demonstrated their capabilities. They can easily haul a tank or a strategic missile complex from a battlefield, or out of crater, ravine, or bog. The pride of our military motor vehicle industry is of course the Vityaz range of double-unit tracked vehicles with a loading capacity of 10, 20, or 30 tonnes. Marshes, bogs, and quicksands are no threat to them. They easily cope with muddy roads in spring and fall and snowdrifts in winter, and are able to float across rivers and lakes. [N.A. Zazulin, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry Main Motor Vehicle Directorate] I can claim with utmost confidence that the Vityaz, which comes in the 10-, 20-, and 30-tonne version, is unparalleled in the world. Swedes, Canadians, and others have shown great interest in this equipment. Honestly, these machines are unique.
