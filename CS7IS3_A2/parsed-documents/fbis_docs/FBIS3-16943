The duration of the voting is determined by Article 33 of the regulations on elections to the legislative bodies of power in regions, territories, cities with federal status, autonomous regions and autonomous territories approved by a presidential decree of October 27, 1993. The mayor has no right to change the duration of voting, a statement issued by the public prosecutor said. Ten out of 16 registered electoral associations adopted a joint declaration on Monday denouncing Sobchak's decision as a "wrong move" and suggesting holding new elections on April 17 with the same list of candidates. A Russian central Electoral Commission official said earlier today that Sobchak's decision is a "case which requires juridical examination." Yuriy Orlov, head of the legal department of the Central Electoral Commission, said that there is no direct ban on such extension in the standing legislation. But this is the first such case and it "creates a precedent" which must be studied by the Central Electoral Commission. Under the Russian Constitution, St. Petersburg is a subject of the federation that has the right to establish its own voting procedures and rules which, however, should not run counter to the regulations approved by the president, Orlov explained. He said that his department is now working out a draft law on basic franchise guarantees in the Russian Federation. It will include proposals made by regional electoral commissions, political parties and associations aimed at improving the electoral law. In it "we will try to provide for such cases and other unexpected situations which may arise during the election campaign," Orlov said.
