The Constitutional Court believes that this decision is not in accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as -- in an unconstitutional way -- it represents an attempt to create on a part of the state territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina a new form of social-political community with the basic symbols of a state and legal entity. This violates in the strongest of ways the constitutional organization, the sovereignty, the unity, and the inviolability of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an internationally recognized country. This is issued in a statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitutional Court.
