ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final rule [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24498] published on October 18, 1994 (59 FR 52640). The published list of items to be included in the kit inadvertently listed an item that previously had been deleted. This document corrects that error and one editorial omission. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel V. Meier, Jr., Regulatory Branch (AFS&hyph;240), Air Transportation Division, Flight Standards Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;3749. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the regulations that list the items required in the first aid kits carried on board aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations (59 FR 52640). In the list published in the final rule, the item ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy'' appeared in the listing under §§125.207 and 135.177. The inclusion of burn compound was in error. Burn compound was removed by an earlier amendment (59 FR 1780, January 12, 1994). Further, in the amendment to §121.309, a period was omitted at the end of paragraph (d)(1). Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on October 18, 1994 of the final rule that was the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;24498 is corrected as follows: §121.309 [Corrected] 1. On page 52642, in the third column, in §121.309, in paragraph (d)(1), in the last line, add a period after the words ``of this part''. §125.207 [Corrected] 2. On page 52643, in the first column, in §125.207, in the table in paragraph (a)(1)(iii), in the column titled ``Contents'' remove the entry that reads ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy''; in the column titled ``Quantity'' remove the entry ``6'' that corresponds to the burn compound entry. §135.177 [Corrected] 3. On page 52643, in the third column, in §135.177, in the table in paragraph (a)(1)(iii), in the column titled ``Contents'' remove the entry that reads ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy''; in the column titled ``Quantity'' remove the entry ``6'' that corresponds to the burn compound entry.
