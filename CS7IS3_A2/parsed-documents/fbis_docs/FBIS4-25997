After today's closed-door meeting, a spokeman of the Cambodian Royal Government and the National Assembly told reporters that the meeting is over without any result. However, he did not want to say "the meeting has failed." The spokesman said today's meeting discussed the cease-fire issue only and did not deal with the minimun political platform proposed by the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP). The government side insisted on reaching an agreement on the timetable of the cease-fire first, but the DKP wanted to discuss details of setting up a cease-fire committee. The government side noted that there is no need to meet again as the two round-table talks ended fruitlessly while the DKP suggested continuation of the talks. Nhiek Tioulong, representative of King Norodom Sihanouk, said he will report to the king about the talks and Sihanouk would decide whether or not to continue the talks.
