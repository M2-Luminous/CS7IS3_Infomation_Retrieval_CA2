Almonte's proposal came in the wake of Hanoi's move to reassert its claim over the disputed islands on the grounds that it was the first to discover them in the 17th century. Speaking at a recent security conference among ASEAN think tanks, Almonte said "a multinational agreement to develop and exploit together the oil deposits in the Spratlys transcends the conflicting claims there." The Spratlys is being contested by China, Taiwan, Vietnam and by the three members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. "My own government believes there is no substitute for consultations that produce a consensus among the claimant countries," he said, warning that a conflict in the area "could be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community." Almonte's proposal was similar to the "economic growth triangles" being established by ASEAN-member countries in the various sub-regions, like the East ASEAN growth among East Indonesia, East Malaysia, Brunei and Mindanao in the Philippines. Almonte, who is also a retired army general, believed that such economic arrangements can help bridge political differences among neighboring countries as well as "make their bilateral problems irrelevant." As an example, he cited efforts by Manila and Kuala Lumpur to use the East ASEAN growth area to foster closer bilateral political and economic relations despite their differences over Sabah and overlapping fishing grounds in the South China Sea.
