The main signatories of the General Peace Accord, the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], are engaged in a hot dispute. The government is accused of having "hidden" 14,480 troops who were supposed to be confined in assemby areas. The government is being asked to reveal where it has hidden these men. In defense, the government says these are soldiers who "do not exist". It is a problem of arithmetic. The UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] agrees that "there are serious discrepancies in early figures presented to the Unomoz Technical Unit by the government." Manfredo di Cameranca, Italian ambassador to Mozambique and CSC member, says that the issue is not serious and that it is only a misunderstanding resulting from the fact that the initial figures presented by the government in 1992 were just estimated. The ambassador said: "They made wrong calculations. You cannot hide 14,000 soldiers without being discovered." He advised people not to dramatize the situation. Aldo Ajello examined the peace process at a CSC meeting held on 22 April this year. He pointed out the existing problems and recommended solutions. Cease-Fire Commission Chairman Colonel Pier Segala from Italy also read his report at the meeting. He presented the latest figures on troop confinement and demobilization. He said the government had confined 55 percent of its troops, that is 34,145 troops out of a total of 61,638 initially declared. Segala said the government used 56 percent of its capacity in assembly areas and demobilized 22.3 percent of its 13,745 men. [figure as published] Noting that all troops joining the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] must be confined first, Segala revealed that a total of 1,875 government troops have already been selected to join the FADM forces. Segala said that, according to the Unomoz Technical Unit figures, Renamo has already confined 81 percent of its forces, that is 15,517 troops, out of a total of 19,140. In centers for nonconfined troops, Renamo has 4,000 men and it has used 119 percent of assembly areas' capacity. With regard to demobilization, Renamo has already demobilized 561 men and selected 1,891 men to join the new army. The Unomoz official said in comparative terms "the government is behind in troop confinement," while "Renamo is behind in troop demobilization". Segala was the first official to bring to light the issue of discrepancies in the number of government troops initially declared. The history is complicated, but he said that all figures produced by the Unomoz Technical Unit were based on the assumption that the government would confine and register 61,638 troops in assembly areas and register 14,767 troops in centers for nonconfined . "The new figures supplied by the government show only 49,630 troops are to be confined in assembly centers instead of 61,638." 14,480 troops are to be registered in centers for nonconfined troops. Thus, according to the new figures, the government has a total number of 64,110 troops instead of 76,405. Segala says in its report: "These new figures need a political scrutiny and the old percentages must be calculated again." With regard to Renamo, Segala said the situation is different because it did not present all the information on centers for nonconfined troops. Col. Pier Segala said that by 21 April, a total of 22,106 weapons had been collected from paramilitary troops, out of an expected 49,806. He said weapons collection are behind schedule in Nampula and Tete and have not yet begun in Inhambane. In the north of the country, only 8,646 weapons had been collected, out of an expected 14,801. In the center of the country, only 8,873 weapons have been collected, out of an expected 15,634. In the south, 4,587 weapons have been collected out of an expected 19,371. The weapons collection are also under way in assembly areas. A total of 48,818 weapons has been collected in all the 49 assembly areas by 21 April this year. Of this number, 35,599 weapons were collected in government areas, while 13,219 were collected from Renamo areas. Of this number, 36,993 weapons have already been transported to regional depots. Col. Segala also said that obsolete weapons are being destroyed. Funds resulting from the sale of melted obsolete military equipment will go to FADM forces, according to a mutual agreement between the parties involved in the peace process. Col. Segala also referred to problems and incidents in assembly areas. He said the causes for these incidents are mainly the long period troops remain assembly areas (five months in some cases). On the government side, incidents were observed in Massinga, Namialo, Marrupa, Lichinga and Rio Save; while on Renamo's side, incidents were observed in Chiramba, Mohia, Magunde, Mavago and Lurio. In some areas there is a shortage of water and in other areas a shortage of food. Segala spoke of the need to respect the timetable of the peace process until elections are held. He said "the process is now irreversible" and added: "There is no more time to waste in examining and speaking about the situation. There has been enough time for that. Now is the time to act and implement the agreements." CSC Chairman Aldo Ajello confirmed the figures contained in the report, notably the figures under dispute. He also briefed the meeting on a number of issues, including the existing relationship between the Unomoz Police and the Police of the Republic of Mozambique, an issue which has been referred to on many occasions, FADM's formation, and other issues. It is a Question of Arithmetic, not a Political Issue Apparently, the government delegation did not view kindly the stand adopted by Ajello and Segala at the 22 April meeting, particularly the astonishing assessment of the peace process. After several foiled attempts to hold a meeting, the CSC finally met on 5 May to examine Ajello's report. Teodato Hunguana, head of the government delegation, in the absence of Armando Guebuza, read a document disproving the issues raised by Ajello at the previous meeting. Hunguana said: "It is our firm conviction that there will henceforth be a fundamental difference between the method of "briefings" or news conferences and the method followed at CSC sessions". Examining point by point the issues raised in the report presented by Ajello and Segala, Teodato Hunguana referred to the main issue of troop confinement and demobilization, notably the "alleged discrepancies between figures so far produced by the Unomoz Technical Unit and the figures produced by the government. The government says 49,638 its troops are to be confined in 29 assembly areas, not 61,638. It also says that it has 14,480 troops in centers for nonconfined troops. Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana said the discrepancy results from the fact that the Unomoz Technical Unit based its work on the "assumption" that the government had to confine and register 61,638 troops in 29 assembly areas and register 14,480 in centers for nonconfined troops. "It was just an assumption," Hunguana said. The head of the government delegation recalled that after the signing of the peace accord, there was a need to urgently present to Unomoz a list of troops to be confined. In view of this urgency, the two sides presentation of lists was made on the assumption that they contained estimated figures that could be corrected as the process went on. The adjustments are provided for in Protocol VI of the General Peace Accord. Hunguana said on 9 November 1992 the government delegation informed the CSC that the government would confine 61,638 troops in its 29 areas. It also said that it would inform the CSC about troops' figures in centers for nonconfined troops. The figure of 61,638 was used by the government in various meetings of the Cease-Fire Commission and it was this same figure that was presented at the donors' conference in Rome in December 1992. Teodato Hunguana said the government has carried out work aimed at presenting the correct number of its troops. He said this work was complex, characterized by organizational difficulties, because of the war. After the work was carried out, the government supplied the figure of 64,118 as being the most up to date figure of government troops. It also gave the figure of 14,480 as the number of its troops in centers for nonconfined troops. Hunguana said the figure of 14,480 is part of the 64,118 government troops. He said the CSC thought it was an additional figure and added it to the figure of 61,638 presented by the government in 1992, thus concluding that there was a shortage of 12,000 troops. [figure as published] Teodato Hunguana said: "It is just a question of clear discrepancy of figures which does not correspond to reality. Thus, there is no political problem which requires a political scrutiny. It is just a question of arithmetic." The minister also spoke about the proposals to reduce FADM forces by 50 percent. The labor minister said: "If 30,000 troops for FADM was already a ridiculous figure... their reduction by 50 percent is tantamount to saying that this country does not need or deserve an effective Armed Forces, but just a make-believe force." Government's Explanation Does Not Convince Renamo Raul Domingos, head of Renamo's delegation to the CSC, says the government explanation about the alleged discrepancy in figures "neither convinces nor mollifies. It is a matter of 14,000 people that cannot be accounted for and there can be no error in estimating such a large number. It is an army that is in hiding and the government will have to tell us where those men are whose names have disappeared from the lists all of a sudden." Like Hunguana at the CSC meeting, Domingos read a document commenting on Ajello's report. Basically he agrees with Segala's report that Renamo has confined more men (81 percent of all its personnel) and says the slow demobilization of his movement's troops is due to technical problems. (He also told SAVANA that Renamo still had to confine 19,140 troops. Of these, 15,000 are for the new army and 4,140 will be demobilized. Right now, Unomoz has a list of 2,900 men to be demobilized -- that is, more than half.) Renamo has doubts about the discrepancy in the government's figures. It feels there are political problems and not merely an "underestimation of figures." Raul Domingos added: After all, for a long time now, "we have been complaining that the government was transferring soldiers to the police and has taken many men from Snasp [People's National Security Service] to the police. The police have been creating instability." According to Domingos, the number "the government now says refers to its troops differs from the figure of 26,480 soldiers the CCF submitted to Unomoz." Renamo thinks that between 14,480 and 10,480 soldiers could have been "put aside" for the formation of a private army. Commenting on the disbanding of paramilitary forces, Renamo noted that a deadline had been set for December 1993. In line with the timetable, that would have coincided with the start of the confinement of troops from both sides. The Renamo document says logistical reasons prevented it from supplying in due time the figures about centers that would harbor troops not earmarked for confinement. Those reasons include lack of transportation, communications, and office equipment. Let Us Not Dramatize Things -- Manfredo di Camerana Manfredo di Camerana, Italian ambassador to Mozambique, who has for a long time now been linked to the peace process, says the "numerical discrepancy" has been looked into in an exaggerated manner. He said: "We are coming under pressure as October approaches, and the psychological factor is very important." According to Di Camerana, all sides have great expectations about the conclusion of the process. "There is a great deal of pressure in terms of time and that does not permit a clear and calm assessment of situations." He pointed out to SAVANA that a precise number of government and Renamo troops was never discussed in Rome. "We have always asked for an estimate, and the final figure was clearly 30,000 for the single army." The ambassador said the mediators and the observers had always realized that the sides would have difficulties in making estimates and that the real figures would come up as the confinement and demobilization of troops began. In fact, everybody started counting as of the start of those processes. He recalled that the initial figure given by the government was 61,638 troops that would report to assembly areas, and 14,480 that did not need to be confined to assembly areas. That was in 1992. Since then until 20 April 1994, the figures have been checked and updated. The ambassador commented: "I do not think there has been any government attempt to hide such a large number of soldiers." He added: "It was indeed an underestimation. It is ridiculous to think there are troops hidden from both sides." Di Camerana advised people to be calm and carefully consider things. "We cannot dramatize things. Let us not create a controversy about it because that could cause irreparable damage to the country." The Italian diplomat has always said he thought the process would be difficult and demand patience from all of us. That is why we "have always said disputes cannot be settled outside the mechanisms provided for by the accord. No unilateral decisions ought to be taken." The government's attitude in suspending the demobilization of troops has been criticized by both di Camerana and the CSC. The ambassador, who is represented at the CSC, commented: "That does not help the process in the least, and then... it is the government that will have extra work to do with its troops." He said that during his last visit to Rome, Dhlakama was advised that it served no purpose to dramatize the issue of "numerical discrepancy." "We asked for moderation because there could be errors in the Defense Ministry's financial or bureaucratic sectors, but not 14,000 men in hiding." By criticizing Renamo for dramatizing things, and the government for making unilateral decisions, Di Camerana said there is a danger of the whole process coming to a halt if calm does not prevail over radical positions. The biggest difficulties he foresees, and which he feels should be of concern to all, are of a technical and logistical nature, regarding the formation of the FADM and the elections. "The barracks are not up to standards and troops cannot agree to go to a training center to eat badly, to sleep on the floor or on a floor mat." Likewise, there is still a lot to do about the electoral process. Di Camerana has other worries: How to make the giants of Mozambican politics (government and Renamo) embark on politics and on a campaign without talking about the past, without accusing each other about past problems, but by only debating the programs for the country's future? He asked: "Where are their programs and why do they not trade accusations about them?"
