ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would establish uniform procedures under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act) for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to decertify persons who have been designated as MSHA-approved instructors and those individuals certified or qualified to perform certain mining related tasks under the applicable training, safety and health regulations. These proposed decertification procedures would also apply to those persons who are deemed certified by MSHA as a result of their certification through State programs recognized by the agency. The proposal would provide notice of potential decertification by MSHA and would provide procedural due process, including a notice of proposed action, an informational meeting with the district manager, notice of the district manager's decision, appeal rights to the appropriate administrator, and a de novo post-decertification evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge of the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition, the proposal would provide a new paragraph to replace the decertification of diesel mechanics previously proposed. DATES: Written comments must be submitted by January 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send comments to the Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA, Room 631, Ballston Tower # 3, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule contains no information collection requirements. II. Background In order to maintain safe and healthful working conditions in mines, MSHA recognizes that certain tasks and duties must be performed by individuals with the proper knowledge and expertise. MSHA has promulgated regulations in Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR), parts 48, 70, 71, 75, 77, and 90, that require particular activities to be performed by persons who have demonstrated their expertise or proficiency to the agency or to a State mining agency, who have been recognized as competent through training, testing or experience, and who have been formally ``approved,'' ``certified,'' or ``qualified'' by MSHA or a State to perform these activities.
