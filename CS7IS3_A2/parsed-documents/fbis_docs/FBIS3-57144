Three times he gave an assurance that the new Cabinet of Ministers would "not retreat from the adopted programs and will make no changes to the reform policy." But did the premier actually have a clear and consistent reform policy in the past that would justify his talking of continuing that policy? No, radical economic reform was linked above all with the name of Yegor Gaydar, who shouldered the full burden of responsibility for implementing government policy but who had of late essentially had no opportunity to seriously influence that policy. The social fulmination about "shock therapy" bypassed the premier and was aimed directly at Gaydar as the father of reform and in whose shadow Oleg Soskovets, Oleg Lobov, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, and other industrial, financial, and agrarian lobbyists -- who had been appointed by Chernomyrdin to key posts -- flourished. Without concealing their aspirations with market rhetoric, many of them (Lobov, for instance) openly talked of the need to return to a centralized economy and to revive planning and state regulation. But the presence in the government of Yegor Gaydar and people in his team allowed the premier, while distancing himself from the radical reformers and their activity, to talk, as now, about the existence of a firm and consistent policy of fundamentally transforming the economy. But if there are no deviations from this policy, as the premier assures us, then what does he mean by fighting inflation -- as he has announced -- "not with monetary means but with other means"? What should we read into the intention to distribute state subsidies "more effectively" and to repay all the debts of the military-industrial complex, the agricultural complex, and the budgetary sector? And will there really be no "soft loans handed out right and left" if the premier is nonetheless planning to issue them "selectively"? Judging by the composition of the new government, which reflects an evident and seemingly difficult compromise between the premier and the president, the "period of market romanticism," as Viktor Chernomyrdin put it, is indeed over. Exactly what is meant by the market "realism" to which the premier is clearly more inclined will become clear in the next few months. But, one way or another, the head of the government will now have to assume full responsibility for the fate of reform. If this new stage in building the market economy ends in hyperinflation and a Russia-wide political strike prompted by it, then the prime minister will have to be held responsible. Him above all.
