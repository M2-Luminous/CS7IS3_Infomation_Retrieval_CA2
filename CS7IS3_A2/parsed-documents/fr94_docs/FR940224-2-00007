On September 30, 1993, following its agreement to plead guilty to one count of a 10-count superseding indictment, Sofep Petrole et Derives (hereinafter referred to as Sofep) was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas of violating the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app. §§2401&hyph;2420 (1991, Supp. 1993, and Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;10, March 27, 1993)) (the EAA), by exporting U.S.-origin aviation oil from the United States to Cuba without obtaining the required export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Section 11(h) of the EAA provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce. 1 no person convicted of a violation of the EAA, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA or the Export Administration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR parts 768&hyph;799 (1993)) (the Regulations), for a period of up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the EAA in which such a person had any interest at the time of his conviction may be revoked. 1 Pursuant to appropriate delegations of authority that are reflected in the Regulations, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, exercises the authority granted to the Secretary by section 11(h) of the EAA. Pursuant to §§770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted of violating the EAA, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Sofep's conviction for violating the EAA, and following consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Sofep permission to apply for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations, for a period of 10 years from the date of its conviction. The 10-year period ends on September 30, 2003. I have also decided to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the EAA in which Sofep had an interest at the time of its conviction.
