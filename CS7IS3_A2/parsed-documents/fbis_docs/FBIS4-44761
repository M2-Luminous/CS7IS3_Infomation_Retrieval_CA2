Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed much of the network, calls this developmental field "special networks." The company's know-how is now beginning to pay off. Such special networks are becoming an export hit for the Stuttgart enterprise. John Doe is not the only person who likes to chat on the telephone. Military personnel and railway workers also have frequent recourse to the telephone. This occurs in the course of their normal duties, but with a significant difference. While Mister Average Citizen, providing he or she is not telephoning via a private D2 mobile system, as a customer of the DBP (German Federal Post Office) Telekom, uses the postal service's line system, the military and the railway employees enjoy a privilege. In addition to the power companies (EVU) and the former Federal Railway System, the armed forces are also exempted from DBP Telekom's telephone service monopoly. These three user groups can operate their own systems for internal communications traffic, i.e., the railways, the Bundeswehr and the power companies have their own communications systems. Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed most of these systems, calls them "special networks." "Special networks," as Wolfgang Dietze, the director of the special network systems, defines them, "serve all of us, although they do not belong to the Telekom's public communications system." The German military is especially ambitious. In order to be independent of the public infrastructure, the Bundeswehr decided to build its own communications system. Alcatel-SEL had proposed a single system for the military, but the Luftwaffe, the Navy, and the Army could not agree on a common system. Each branch of service wanted its own. Consequently, in 1989 SEL installed a nationwide system with 6,500 connections for the Bundeswehr and another nationwide special network with 40 large exchange centers specifically for the Luftwaffe. The eccentric Navy chose a wireless system. At taxpayer's expense, Fleet Command ordered its own directional radio system from the Stuttgart company. The know-how gained by the Stuttgart workers in developing these systems is now becoming an export hit. The technology underlying the special networks is the Alcatel 1000 S12 System, which had been developed for public communications use and which is used in Germany and in many other countries of the world by DBP Telekom. To date, Alcatel-SEL has built special networks for the armies of Thailand and Saudi Arabia, and last year the Swiss Railways received a modern integrated service digital network (ISDN) with 480 exchange centers. The modernization of the Chilean railways system with 30,000 connections promises to be a most impressive contract. An actual contract is the new nationwide ISDN-network for the German Federal Railways--the former State-run Bundesbahn and Reichsbahn. This project has been underway since July 1993 with Alcatel-SEL as the consortial leader. Alcatel-SEL delivers the lion's share of the entire switching technology, while the group consisting of Siemens, ANT, and Alcatel-SEL delivers most of the transmission technology. As compared with public systems, special networks are small. The most common definition, advanced by Wolfgang Dietze, puts the number at up to 200,000 connections. The technology may be seen in the example of the German Railways system. The performance features--complete ISDN capability--are not limited to local exchanges, but are available throughout the network, mostly for subscribers with digital and analog connections. Thus, for example, at any location in the rail system a nationwide conference call capability (add-on third parties) with ten subscribers can be established. Other performance features are preset transfers in the case of a busy connection, automatic recall, multiple numbers, secret numbers, and the setting up of closed user groups. In addition, digital subscribers receive other performance features like telephone number indicators, call units indicators, or equipment selection with select terminal number. The compatibility of the special networks with analog and digital technology is one of their strongest performance features. All kinds of switching technologies can be used in an exchange center. Connections can be made with digital and analog technology, even the public exchange technology can be hooked up. The modular construction permits the system to be expanded gradually, so that the network, as originally planned, can be extended to several subscribers if necessary. In future, the German Railways system could become of interest to the telephone companies. The telephone monopoly in the countries of the European Union ends in 1998 and, according to the Wolfgang Boetsch, the German Minister of the Postal Service, the network monopoly will no longer be able to be maintained. For the German Railways, this will mean that its nationwide communications system could be opened up to private customers. At any rate, Dietze emphasizes, it would become technically possible to do so. Thus, for example, a customer in Duesseldorf could select the railways exchange via his local Telekom system, be switched to Hamburg through the railways system, and speak to the other party on the Alster on the local Telekom system there. Since Alcatel-SEL has selected the internationally standardized Nr. 7 signalling procedure for the special network, the transition to the public system would easily be possible. "Technically," Dietze asserts, "everything is in place." The 34 Mbit/s transmission capacity of the fiber glass cables excludes the possibility of any bottlenecks developing, while the exchange facilties can be expanded on a modular basis. The German Railways' new extensive system is entirely comparable to the Telekom system as far as extensive interconnections are concerned. But it is smaller, having been initially designed for only 120,000 subscribers, while about 42 million now subscribe to Telekom's system. In the first phase of its system expansion, the Railways is installing network nodal centers, which are comparable to small regional networks, at 44 sites. In turn, about 100 terminal exchanges are attached to them. Even the expansion process is similar to that of the postal system. The Railways system consists of both fiber glass lines and directional radio. In general, the fiber glass cables run underground along the left and right sides of the track for a total of over 30,000 km.
