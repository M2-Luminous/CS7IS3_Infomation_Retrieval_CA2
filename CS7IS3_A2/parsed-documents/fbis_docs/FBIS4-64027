The Republic Is Ready To Resist the Expansion of the State of Emergency Zone in Ingushetia"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Federation Council Deputy Valeriy Fateyev, who recently visited the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, stated that the draft edict on extending the state of emergency in its present shape must not be signed under any circumstances. According to the deputy, it is important to "neutralize" the influence of politicians who "draft such edicts" and furthermore understand why they do this, he stressed. Mr. Fateyev said that such an approach contradicts the interests of the peoples of Russia and the North Caucasus because it will undoubtedly evoke a negative reaction from Chechnya and Ingushetia, which will aggravate the situation even more. The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has already responded to the proposed option for stabilizing the situation in the emergency zone. Groznyy's official statement disseminated yesterday says that "the attempt to spread the emergency regime in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict to these areas will be seen by Chechnya as an act of open armed aggression." "The Chechen Foreign Ministry regards this as interference in the republic's internal affairs and in the event that Russian troops are positioned here, will view this as armed aggression," Chechnya's Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef stated in an interview with INTERFAX. According to him, in this event the republic will reserve the right to curb invasion of its territory by a foreign army. [passage omitted]
