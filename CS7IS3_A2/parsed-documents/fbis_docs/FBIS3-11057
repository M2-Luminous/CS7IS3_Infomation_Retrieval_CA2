He thoroughly praised the "gradual, sustained transit" to democracy and development, adding that he is confident these countries will in the short term establish strong ties with Pacific Basin and Asian nations. During his visit to Congress, Azuma talked with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in perfect Spanish which, he said, he learned years ago during his stay in Mexico. After meeting with Florencio Acenolaza, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, and with national Senators Juan Aguirre Lanari and Luis Leon in the Senate reading room, Azuma delivered a lecture on "Japanese policy in Latin America." The Japanese diplomat said he "loved" Latin America. He said Argentina holds "the capital that is known as the most beautiful in Latin America, with good wine, good food, and the nicest and most sophisticated people." During the day Azuma also met with President Carlos Menem, about whom he said that "we had a good talk; he met with us despite the fact that he was very busy." He said he is confident that after the Argentine president's visit to Japan in December 1993 "political and economic relations between Japan and Argentina will be intensified." Azuma gave particular praise to "the efforts to achieve democratization and to consolidate democracy under the excellent leadership of President Menem, and the results of political stability and the economic policy." "I would also like to express our deepest respect for the attitude with which Argentina undertook the peacekeeping missions and a policy of nuclear non-proliferation," he added. Azuma declined to give specific details of the commercial exchange with Argentina or of the support that his country has extended to Argentina in any area. However, he did so with respect to other Latin American nations in referring to the period of "the lost decade of the 1980's to the resurrection of the 1990's." In his analysis, he emphasized the modifications made in the international arena with the end of the cold war and the East-West conflict. Upon referring to the Latin American and Caribbean nations, he said that in the current decade "they are engaged in dynamic movements like democratization, economic reforms, and the adoption of realistic diplomacies." He said that in keeping with the new situation in Latin America, Japan hopes to "assure long-term stability, consolidate democracy and the market economy, and maintain and foment the international coordination system." Azuma cleverly said that to attain such objectives Japan had adopted "policies that focus on the double `D' -- democracy and development -- supporting and promoting democracy in the region and cooperating with economic reforms based on the principles of the market economy." Concerning Japanese cooperation with Latin American nations, Azuma said it is "substantial" in El Salvador, to which more than $200 million was given for the national reconstruction plan and for the democratization program which will end with the elections on 20 March. He also said his country is supporting the Nicaraguan Government of Violeta Chamorro, which up to the end of 1992 has received economic and technical cooperation worth approximately $112 million. In the case of Peru, he admitted that with the suspension of the Constitution by President Fujimori on 5 April 1992, the double "D" diplomatic policy "faced a dilemma," but "the reforms on which the Peruvian Government was working had decisive political and economic significance in the history of Peru, and gave extraordinary results, resolving many unprecedented difficulties." While advocating the rapid return to democracy, Japan "did not miss the opportunity of cooperating in the fair and regular elections in November," Azuma said, adding that computers and a $1 million contribution were donated and observers sent as part of OAS delegations. He praised the results of the Peruvian economic plan, and said that it has successfully reached a growth rate of 6.5 percent, "which is the highest figure in Latin America." Azuma admitted that in June 1993 the Japanese Government "temporarily" froze economic cooperation with Guatemala "until democracy was restored 10 days later under international pressure." In Haiti, Japan enforced economic sanctions and demanded the return of democracy, and in April 1993 it gave $2.5 million to the United Nations to support the activities of the international mission of observers. Japan has also announced that if democracy returns to Haiti it will provide a $10 million financial contribution for refinancing the foreign debt. Azuma finally expressed his desire that Latin American countries in the short term promote commercial and political ties with Asian and Pacific Basin countries.
