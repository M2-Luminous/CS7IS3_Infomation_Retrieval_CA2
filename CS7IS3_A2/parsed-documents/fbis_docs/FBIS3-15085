The participants analyzed the situation in the world economy, noting the positive changes in it, and discussed problems of stabilizing the Japanese yen and proposals for lowering the bank credit rate in the FRG. But great attention was devoted to questions connected with giving financial aid to Russia. A. Shokhin, Russian minister of the economy; S. Dubinin, leader of the Ministry of Finance; and V. Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank, were invited to the meeting in Kronberg. Assessing the results of the meeting, at which the Western participants linked economic aid to the achievement of financial stability in Russia and to progress in implementing reforms, Shokhin declared, in particular: "The majority of the Western ministers said that the reforms in Russia must be carried out with due regard for the need to create a system of social protection for the population. Of course, no one in the West is prepared to allocate money to us for the unemployed and pensioners. But the West is showing readiness to elaborate a joint scheme of cooperation in the sphere of social protection." "It seems to me," Shokhin went on to point out, "that we succeeded in convincing the finance ministers and the banks' leaders of `the seven' that it is necessary not only to promote the Russian reforms but also to seek new mechanisms of more intensive financial support also for the CIS countries, which on this basis will be able to build equitable relations with Russia more successfully. We recommended that the finance ministers `hurry up,' if I may use these words, and grant the first credit lines to the CIS countries (Russia has already received $1.5 billion). This would strengthen the CIS countries' financial position and help them to pay off their debts to Russia." Dubinin voiced confidence that "it will now be possible to attract to Russia the financial resources of `the seven' in the form of not just state but also private investments."
