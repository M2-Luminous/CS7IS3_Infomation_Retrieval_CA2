FBIS4-27373 "dreas105_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea Russia, DPRK To Allow DPRK Loggers Passports Russia, DPRK To Allow DPRK Loggers Passports SK0106044594 Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean 1 June 94 p 2 SK0106044594 Seoul TONG-A ILBO Korean BFN [By Mun Myong-ho from Moscow] [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said on 31 May that Russia and North Korea had agreed to allow North Korean workers working at timber logging camps in Siberia, Russia, to separately and freely carry their passports in the future. In a regular briefing held that day, Spokesman Karasin said that during the third Russia-North Korea negotiations to revise an agreement on the forestry cooperation held in Pyongyang from 14 to 24 May, working-level delegates from both Russia and North Korea had agreed to allow the North Korean loggers to carry their passports in Russia so that they can immediately show them to Russian officials when they are asked to show identification. This indicates that the North Korean loggers can freely travel throughout Russia, as well as go outside of Russia if they want. It can be, therefore, regarded as important progress for their human rights. The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that all foreigners, who legally stay in Russia with proper documents, can freely travel to third countries if they have done nothing contrary to the law, such as committing criminal acts in Russia. North Korean authorities who have managed the timber camps in Siberia thusfar, have kept their loggers' passports all together and instead issued certificates that can only be used within the camps. This has served as an important factor in keeping them from travelling freely. Spokesman Karasin also said that the delegates from the two countries agreed to include a special regulation which specifies that the North Korean workers shall work according to the Russian law and its working-hour system in their new agreement on forestry cooperation.
