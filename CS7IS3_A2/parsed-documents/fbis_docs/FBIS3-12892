In its editorial today, the paper notes the periodic report sent by the U.S. President on 3 March to Congress. The report was primarily targeted against Iraq. It employed a long series of deliberate false arguments, disregarded facts, and was blindly carried away by Zionist desires. The paper says the Clinton administration is entertaining a great illusion and falling into the abyss of cheap lies and blatant deception if it thinks that it can succeed through its octopus and diabolical media machine. This machine excels in telling lies and fabricating accusations to influence world public opinion in favor of U.S. stupidities when the question of lifting the embargo is discussed. AL-'IRAQ further argues that the position of the Clinton administration, reflected in its spiteful report to Congress, reveals to the whole world the extent of the involvement of the U.S. President and his Zionist advisers, such as Tony Lake and Martin Indyk, in a plot to turn the Security Council and the international family against Iraq. They are doing this in the hope of maintaining the savage embargo, after it has lost all its justifications. The paper asserts that by continuing to antagonize the unyielding Iraqi people, going to extremes to have more unjust resolutions issued, and relentlessly seeking to maintain current resolutions against Iraq, the Clinton administration will only reap failure, humiliation, and hatred. The paper adds: The criminal Bush wagered on starving the Iraqi people and defeating it eventually through the economic blockade. However, Bush ended up in the trash can of history. The Iraqi people have maintained their steadfastness, worked miracles, and pursued their reconstruction drive. Bush only reaped disgrace, shame, and eternal damnation. Clinton will reap the same fruits if he continues his losing wager on the Iraqis' endurance and steadfastness.
