Japan made the call during bilateral talks in Tokyo on nuclear nonproliferation, the second of their kind between the two nations, the officials said. Japan is greatly concerned about India's nuclear development problem in view of its guidelines on implementing official development assistance (ODA), they said. The guidelines require Japan to take into account, when extending ODA, the recipient nation's military expenditure and development, production, import and export of weapons, missiles and mass- destruction weapons. Japan also called on India to accept inspections of certain nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to improve the transparency of its nuclear development plans, the officials said. The Indian delegation, pointing out that India's basic policy is the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide, called on nuclear power nations to make commitments to abolish nuclear weapons by presenting specific schedules, they said. India also told Japan it basically supports the nuclear test ban treaty and a treaty to ban production of fissionable materials, they said. India will be able to meet Japan's demand to improve transparency of its nuclear plans if the treaty to ban production of fissionable materials takes effect, the Indian delegation was quoted as saying. Also in the talks, Japan pointed out the importance of holding multilateral talks to discuss security in Southwest Asia, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles. India told Japan that if such talks are held, it is necessary to invite all nations that could influence security in Southwest Asia and ensure that all nations shoulder equal obligations, the officials said. Touching on India's relations with Pakistan, the Indian delegation explained that the ties are still tense despite talks between vice foreign ministers of both countries, they said. Japan and India held their first bilateral meeting on nuclear nonproliferation last March in Delhi. The Japanese and Indian delegations agreed to hold a third round of talks this year, the officials said.
