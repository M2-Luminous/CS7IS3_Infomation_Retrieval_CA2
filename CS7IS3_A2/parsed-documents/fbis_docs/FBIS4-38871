When analyzing the situation more profoundly it is necessary to take due account of the fact that Russia has confirmed its intention to hold talks with Chechnya at the very highest level, even though this aroused the discontent of forces opposed to Dudayev. And, last but by no means least: Former Supreme Soviet Speaker R. Khasbulatov through his actions is declaring ever more ardently that he is a true politician, ready to involve himself in Chechen politics. Traces of Former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Chairman R. Khasbulatov's stay in Groznyy are hard to find. It was back in mid-April that I spotted the most recent mention of him in the leading republic newspaper ICHKERIYA. His trips around the republic, his visit to the mosques, the restraint of his speeches, and meanderings regarding his intention to stand back from the dirty business of politics and move into science, clearly placated Dudayev's team, usually extremely politicized and wary in respect of opponents. M. Udugov, chief of the republic Department of Information and the Press, on the day prior to the 25 May publication in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of an interview with the former speaker of the Russian Parliament on his return to Moscow, assured me that Khasbulatov still remains in Chechnya. While another of Dudayev's close comrades in arms resolutely consigned his famous compatriot to political oblivion. Obviously he was a little premature. Breaking the vow of silence, the erstwhile prisoner of Lefortovo gave the current regime in Groznyy an unequivocal indication that he will outlive it. [passage omitted] To the Political Olympus -- In a Roundabout Way The emerging prospects for Khasbulatov's return to power cannot fail to alarm the Russian president too. There is an awareness in the Kremlin that a second coming to the political Olympus by the speaker of the former Supreme Soviet is most likely to come via a roundabout route. The post of legitimate leader of Chechnya constitutes a sturdy launch pad for a return to top-level Russian politics. Experts suggest that, once on this platform, Khasbulatov will be able to convince his Chechen entourage of the need to sign a treaty with Russia, that he will be able to stage elections in the republic for the Russian Federation State Duma and Federation Council, present his candidacy for the Federation Council, and become a member of it. For B. Yeltsin this would mean an inevitable strengthening of confrontation in the federal organs of power. The rise of national-patriotic sentiment, notably in the deputies' corps, makes the prospect of Khasbulatov's being elected Russian Federation president or head of the Russian Government unlikely in the immediate post-Yeltsin period. But his failure to countenance modern-day presidential authority in Moscow, which is reliant, to use his expression, "solely on the boys in uniform," will probably be exploited by the opposition in order to secure victory over Yeltsin and his supporters in future elections. Such a prospect, in the opinion of a number of analysts, has provided additional impetus for the Kremlin's active quest for ways to settle the protracted conflict with Chechnya. The "Khasbulatov factor" reinforces preconditions for elaborating a mutually acceptable decision at the meeting between the two presidents. Experts assert that the Kremlin will probably propose several versions of a Russian-Chechen treaty. At the same time the Russian-Tatar agreement, which from Dudayev's viewpoint is unacceptable to Chechnya, may be seen merely as an example to be imitated in the most general sense -- that is, as an example of a weighty solution to an insoluble dispute by bringing into circulation new political-judicial symbols and concepts, allowing the sides to get around discrepancies in their positions "without losing face." In particular, national politicians consider it possible for Chechnya to devise some kind of status or level of soverienty unique in contemporary Russian practice (like the Portuguese "free affiliated state"), which, while preserving the external attributes of the Republic of Chechnya's state independence (with all the concomitant symbols, as is partly taking place even in respect of "regular" republics within the Russian Federation), would at the same time guarantee the most propitious opportunities for Chechnya's reintegration into the Russian political and economic area. The implementation of this version, however, presupposes the achievement of prior agreement on this question between the two branches of power in Moscow, without which the presidential side may find itself subject to harsh criticism in the State Duma and the Federation Council for "capitulating" and "flouting the Constitution." The formation of favorable public opinion both in Chechnya and in Russia as regards concluding a compromise agreement could be aided by the establishment of close cooperation between the internal affairs bodies of the Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation in the fight against organized crime. The joint arrest of the terrorists who took a bus and its passengers hostage in Mineralnyye Vody could be considered a good start to this process. Even prior to the conclusion of a treaty, the aim could be furthered by a guarantee of the safety of rail and road traffic on Chechen territory, either by the Chechen authorities on their own or jointly with the Russian internal troops, as well as mutual guarantees of the safety and equality of the Russian-speaking population in Chechnya and the Chechen communities in Russia.
