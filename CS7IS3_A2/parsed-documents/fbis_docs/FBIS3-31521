Is there any connection with the ultimatum that NATO has given to the Bosnian Serbs? [Zhelev] There is no connection of such a kind, although certain mass media, especially some newspapers, politicians, and representatives of various institutions, have permitted themselves to find such a connection. No such connection exists. The simple truth is that the decision to sign the initiative was made much earlier, prior to the ultimatum. The coincidence in time is purely accidental. [Panorama] Since only 24 hours now remain before the ultimatum expires, I would nonetheless like to clear up one point. Has there been any change in Bulgaria's position regarding the air strikes, and do any differences exist between the main institutions of state on this issue? [Zhelev] I will permit myself here to reiterate extremely concisely the main points of our position, because it is very often distorted and misrepresented in an incorrect light. Bulgaria was one of the first countries in the Balkans to formulate its position clearly and precisely regarding the disintegrating Federation of Yugoslavia. As you will remember, we were the first to recognize the four former Yugoslav republics; we were the first to declare that Bulgaria will under no circumstances exploit the difficulties that the former Yugoslavia was facing; and we were the first to declare that Bulgaria will under no circumstances participate militarily or allow military intervention on its part in the events in Yugoslavia, that we will send neither troops nor weapons, nor embark on any form of military path. I consider that we have preserved this position until the present day. At the same time, we asked the other Balkan states and neighbors of the former Yugoslavia to adopt the same position of renouncing military intervention in the conflicts in Yugoslavia, because such an act, even if undertaken for the most noble motives, may prove to be a direct way to drag the country in question into a new Balkan war, a war in which all the other neighbor countries of former Yugoslavia will find themselves involved. Of course, we have to adjust, to correct our position to take account of the new situation that has arisen, but there will be no fundamental changes in our position, which remains one of active neutrality. We regard the NATO ultimatum as one of the last peaceful means, a peace effort by the European structures to settle, [pause] to contribute to solving the conflict in Bosnia and in Sarajevo, in particular. One has to draw a distinction between the ultimatum itself and the actual use of weapons. These are two quite different things. The ultimatum is purely and simply a warning, designed to compel the warring parties to sit down at the table and hold serious negotiations, first and foremost on halting the conflict and then on gradually settling the points at dispute, about which they are fighting. [Panorama] Have you heard whether the ultimatum is producing any results regarding the disputes? [Zhelev] Yes, you are right. So far, the ultimatum has produced very good results. According to the information that I have been receiving at least, the Serbs are withdrawing their heavy artillery at a fast rate, while the Muslims are fulfilling other actions that are required under the ultimatum. [Panorama] Do you consider that the Greek Government decision to impose a unilateral de facto embargo against Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] complicates the situation in the Balkans? [Zhelev] Naturally, Greece is a sovereign state and is entitled to decide its own moves, its own steps in the Balkans, but I consider that to make this move precisely at this moment does not contribute to reducing the tension in the Balkans. [Panorama] Mr. President, in conclusion, in view of the development of events around Bosnia, does any real military threat exist for Bulgaria? [Zhelev] No, I can state quite categorically that no such threat exists for Bulgaria.
