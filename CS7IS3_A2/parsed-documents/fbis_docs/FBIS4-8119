He signed a protocol there on trade and economic relations for 1994. Today, in Bratislava, he talked to journalists in greater detail about his negotiations in the Russian Federation, about whose markets a view prevails here that they are insolvent. Economy Minister Peter Magvasi was interviewed by our editor Ivan Bielko. [Begin recording] [Bielko] Our trade balance with Russia has been negative in the past few years. Is it going to improve after your negotiations in Moscow? [Magvasi] The protocol that I signed with Oleg Davydov, the Russian foreign economic relations minister, will open up some new opportunities for our enterprises to penetrate Russian markets. [Bielko] For example? [Magvasi] Above all, there is a chance for enterprises to open their own accounts in selected banks of the Russian Federation and in the Slovak Republic. [Bielko] A view prevails here that the Russian market is insolvent. What about it? [Magvasi] I think this is an opinion that prevailed from 1990-91, when it was true that the disintegration of the whole system in Russia did lead to the insolvency of some partners. On the other hand, today the position is clear. There are partners in Russia who are highly solvent. In view of the fact that the ruble is convertible and there is an opportunity for our Slovak businessmen to open their own accounts, there is far better payment security in trade with Russia than there is today within Slovakia--with insolvency there--and in trade with the Czech Republic. I consider this to be a decisive window of opportunity that our businessmen should exploit very intensively and immediately. [Bielko] You held talks at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy relating to supplies of nuclear fuel and to Russian participation in the reconstruction of Jaslovske Bohunice [nuclear energy plant in central Slovakia], as well as to some other issues. [Magvasi] The Russian Federation confirmed its continuing interest in supplying nuclear fuel. Second, we reassessed the state of readiness of the intergovernmental agreement on nuclear energy that should be ready to be signed by the end of April or the beginning of May. Third, I think it is very important that the Russian Federation is eminently interested in participating in the construction at Mochovce [nuclear plant in southern Slovakia].
