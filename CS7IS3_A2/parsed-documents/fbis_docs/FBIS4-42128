Replying to a question on the issue during his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that the security aid constitutes an important dimension of the Turkish-U.S. security cooperation relations. He said: It is natural that we seriously assess any negative development that might emerge in this field in all its aspects. Turkey has always opposed the linking of U.S. aid -- which is supplied as a requisite of mutual defense and cooperation within the framework of the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement -- to outside factors. Turkey, which has been faced with terrorism for years, does not deem it appropriate to link aid to certain conditions for unrealistic reasons and pretexts. Ataman stressed: The suspension of 25 percent of the security aid by the House of Representatives as a result of allegations of human rights violations is an issue that must be assessed within this framework. Ataman concluded by saying: We hope that a more responsible attitude will be adopted to eliminate this injustice in the future stages of the foreign aid bill as it goes through the U.S. Congress.
