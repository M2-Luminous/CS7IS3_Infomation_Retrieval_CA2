This is life. It is difficult in terms of its changes and circumstances. It is exactly like two pictures of two meetings. The first was when the Iranians occupied al-Faw and the second is now. We might add a third meeting that came after al-Faw liberation. When we view life in terms of these three pictures, we will clearly see the meaning of the results, based on difficult circumstances, or the difficult changes in the difficult march. The history of individuals is the same. In their history, people may rise, fall, or succeed, based on basic factors, the most important of which are will and wisdom. What choice will his resolve and what he thinks is right lead him to? Which of the choices drawn in the sands, in military terms, is suitable or is required by the results that are based, or should be based on it? This is the situation. Peoples and nations pass through periods of forgetfulness or weakness due to this forgetfulness. Thus, opportunities pass before them in the figurative, or theoretical sense, but they do not come to grips with these opportunities. Naturally, such a situation will not enable them to create opportunities. If opportunities are passing in front of them and they do not grab them, then it would be more appropriate to say that they are unable to create opportunities. Other peoples, in other circumstances, for other reasons, in other conditions, create opportunities, come to grips with them, and develop them to their end results [ma'alah]. This also applies to life, the life of man in times of war, and even during peace time. But, of course, the war times are more difficult. Let us take the two pictures: The news received that the enemy had occupied al-Faw, and the picture of summoning the commanders and discussing al-Faw's liberation, whether in the bilateral meeting with the commanders of the III and VII Army Corps, or in the General Command meeting after the comrades had arrived from the north at the time -- the late General 'Adnan Khayrallah and his comrades. If we take these three pictures, or two pictures, and ask each one about his impressions of the first, second, and third pictures, we will be able to draw correct conclusions about the correct stand at difficult circumstances, about correct inferences in difficult times, about the ability to remain levelheaded at difficult times. The difficult circumstances are relative and they come at war time. They affect different individuals in different ways; there are degrees. We find them also at times of peace. However, they manifest themselves in a relative manner in what an individual regards as pressure on his powers and resources, his will, or his ability to crystallize a stand at a given time. Al-Faw's lessons are numerous. In every angle, we have more than one lesson. We have seen in people pictures inspired in us by the three meetings we mentioned about al-Faw. Some said al-Faw was lost and would never return, but some were convinced that it would return. The enemies were eager to emphasize a factor that is not characteristic of Arabs, but was forced upon them, namely, that territory taken from the Arabs does not return, that Arab armies have no spirit for counterattack or for returning to attack in better circumstances to liberate territory. Zionism was working in this direction in all its activities and with all its resources and influence, not only inside the occupied territory in beloved Palestine but wherever Zionism existed in the world as well. You are also aware of the skepticism, circumstances, and obstacles that attempted to hinder the will of the Arab combat troops as they launched their offensive against the occupying Zionist entity on the Golan and Suez fronts. Therefore, there is no absolute framework for what is possible and what is not possible. In all cases, when factors of direct impact are taken into account, we must consider willpower to be of paramount importance. Let us first determine what is it that you deem possible or not possible. Do you just view things as possible or not possible? What have you done to make the impossible possible? I am not referring to what you should do just technically, but also to what you should do spiritually, mentally, and humanly in your relations with your own selves and with others. When we come into live interaction with all those factors, then the impossible becomes a question of relativity, either awaiting other factors to ripen as a result of a programmed, intentional action, or the emergence of other factors that are unavailable at that particular point of time. However, with effort and willpower, other factors can be made available. Then, the impossible can become possible. When we recall the liberation of al-Faw, which is rightly described as the land of sacrifice and the gate of the great victory, then you will be able to associate every example we have cited with your memories of that battle: The psychological situation under certain circumstances, and how it turned under a different situation, different circumstances, and in view of other possibilities. For the first time, an Arab territory was restored from foreign troops, except for the battles of liberation against the past traditional colonialists. Those liberation battles were different. But, the liberation of al-Faw was the first time in modern Arab history that an Arab state liberated its usurped territory from another state without political bargains and without half-way measures. Was the mastermind of the al-Faw liberation deluded, as some said? Did you hire foreign armies? Did you hire or seek the assistance of foreign brains? The answer to all those questions is clear. Hence, we can say that no army, in a long war, can claim that the opposite army, under all circumstances, is unable to achieve successes on certain fronts. This is because it is always possible for an army's superiority to be affected by other factors. Such factors, under certain difficult circumstances and perhaps lack of alertness, can revert to the interest of the enemy. Therefore, under difficult circumstances, commanders should not belittle any field action, combat front, or move, no matter how small. This is because it is possible that these small moves and steps will add up to the final result. However, all these factors must not make the commander forget that the final and strategic result must be in his interest. This should be the basis for dealing with all details on the front. In this sense, the front does not have to be exclusively understood as a military front. It can be extended to include other domains of life, such as politics, economics, and social and security affairs. However, this applies more to the front in the military sense of the word. What matters is the final result. Commanders may win a certain battle, but their final goal should be to win the war. The other lesson is that it is unfair to say that Arabs are unable to restore their territory. They are capable of doing so -- mentally, emotionally, and psychologically. More aptly, this applies to the Iraqis, both Arabs and non-Arabs, for they have deep roots in the Arab nation's ancient cultural heritage and history. The Arab nation is deep-rooted, and so are the Iraqi people. I don't mean deep-rooted in the sense of being ancient. I am speaking about virtuous traits being handed down from one generation to the next. It is natural that Iraq's patriotism be as deep as its history is long. I am not saying it is deeper than others' patriotism, because I am not into drawing comparisons here, except if others claim their patriotism is deeper than that of the Iraqis. To these we would say no. As is known, and as we always say, in human terms, each Iraqi is equal to any other human being. An Iraqi is equal to an Asian, African, European, American, or Australian. However, if anyone should say that an individual of his country equals two Iraqis, we would say no to him. For us, an Iraqi is equal to 10. If he should say that his country's area is greater than that of Iraq and so claim the right of attacking us, we would say no to him. Iraq is four times the size of your country, and our 20 million people are superior to your people. I am not talking about people in the abstract sense of the word, because we do not differentiate between peoples. What I mean to say is that Iraqis are above drawing such comparisons. Even if one belonging to a nation of 1 billion people were to boast about it, we would tell him that our people number that many. However, in view of our judging things from a principled standpoint, we view the human value of an Iraqi as being equal to that of, say, a Ugandan. One is judged better or worse by action and thought. Iraqis and Arabs have been judged unfairly when it was said that once they lost territory they were unable to retrieve it. However, al-Faw marked the beginning -- the resounding and undoubted start. There was a contest of wills there; one of them prevailed and the result was the liberation of a city without politics or any outside factors coming into play. Victories then followed in rapid succession. The goal was to take back every inch of territory that had been captured by aggressors. Eventually all lost territory was taken back and the will of aggression was crushed. The aggressors admitted in a written message that they had been vanquished and wished they would not have been alive to witness that moment on the front. That is how things turned out. I am not being boastful or arrogant. God forbid. I am saying this to underline the inherited positive traits of the Iraqi people -- traits that react to the deep-rootedness of the Arabs in spiritual and civilized terms. In Iraqi folklore, it is said that a true horseman will not lose his camel. The al-Faw story is now well known to all Iraqis. The Iraqis experienced al-Faw when it was taken away from them and then when it was restored. They picture the commanders who joined the battle to liberate it. Some of you witnessed the occupation and the liberation of al-Faw. Others in this great army and your comrades in arms went through the same experience. The entire picture may not have been shown on television screens as clearly as you experienced it firsthand. A fighter may encounter circumstances in which he laughs and broods alternately. At times, he may be utterly depressed; at other times, he may feel on top of the world. These two states of mind may be experienced in the span of just of one hour, half an hour, a quarter of an hour, or even 10 or five minutes, marking the interval between a telephone call and another from the command to his position. However, the time between the telephone call which he viewed as upsetting and the one which he viewed as comforting is measured by his capacity to grasp the reasons why the first call was upsetting and the second cheering. The length of the telephone conversation should be measured by the extent of his determination to turn the annoying state into a comforting one. One cannot instill faith in others unless one is faithful oneself, and a commander cannot possibly influence his companions unless he can influence himself first. What I mean to say is that to the extent that one is self-assured, one can effect a breakthrough, achieve victory, bring about a good outcome, and ward off evil with sheer willpower. Therefore, if we look at the al-Faw battle from a military perspective, we can learn several lessons. We can also go in depth into the political, social, and psychological aspects of this. When we talk about prosperity, I note that all people want to become prosperous. History, however, does not deal with the manifestations of prosperity sought by weak people, but deals with prosperous work in a certain era. Work, in accordance with the Arab and Islamic concept, means jihad. They do not say how many discotheques were built in Baghdad at a certain time, and nobody says how many dresses Zubaydah, wife of Harun al-Rashid [caliph of Baghdad between 786-809], had. However, they all proudly remember how she warned Harun al-Rashid against al-Baramikah [an influential family which sought to overthrow Harun al-Rashid]. The storehouses of the Muslims in the early age were not full of rice or vegetable oil, but they are still remembered with longing for that time. The are still remembered by all people -- rich and poor, full and starving. The humanity of the satiated is dead while the stomach of the starving is dead. The man with a dead stomach, however, is better than a man without humanity. When we say that wellbeing is coming we first mean wellbeing of the soul. We believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe and know that our comrades and brothers in responsibility believe that wellbeing is coming. We believe and know that the leadership in Iraq is capable of effecting changes in the overall situation if the pressure increases and the situation becomes vulnerable. If such a thing were to happen, the leadership would also be capable of introducing new factors into the picture, factors that could absorb any additional elements that might be brought into play by the enemy. Therefore, wellbeing is coming. Wellbeing is coming not because the evil ones intend to lift the evil, but because we know that the fist that seizes the sword by its blade will be forced to ease the grip when the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully. The enemies of Iraq are like a man seizing the sword with its blade and when the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the adversary will find himself compelled to either release his grip around the sword or risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have to release the sword. We created a scandal for the enemies of mankind, the likes of which have never been seen before. We exposed their lies, deception, and weakness. Their weakness dominates their power because their weakness is ethical, spiritual, and human while their strength is based on technology. You saw what technology did three days ago? Is this not technological superiority -- AWACS planes flying all the time, and fixed radars with two planes on their monitors? What did they do? Two of their fighter planes hit these two aircraft. You saw the premeditated goal. Some suspect radio stations and press statements immediately claimed that Iraqi fighter planes had downed the two U.S. helicopters. It is likely that if it were not for the fact that there were other nationals besides the Americans on the planes and the fear that the joint inquiry would bring out the facts, they would have taken the media allegations as grounds to level charges against Iraq as they have done in the past and continue to do now. I heard young people around me saying that they hope something evil will happen to the aggressors. I say to them that whatever you expect or imagine, you cannot concoct what Almighty God concocts for the evil ones and infidels. Almighty God has something planned that will teach a lesson to all mankind, not just the two parties directly involved in this thing. After I heard about this incident, I was briefed on a memorandum from the Foreign Ministry. They summoned our ambassador there in New York. He was summoned by the three countries that are in charge of the so-called safehaven in the Autonomous Region. They summoned our ambassador and told him: We hope there will be no confrontation and we do not intend a confrontation or provocation. He asked: What is the subject of this meeting then? They said: We want to deploy patrols or a patrol from the coordination committee. But what is this coordination committee? It was a temporary committee formed at their request when their armies deployed in northern Iraq in order to avoid confrontation. They said: We will deploy a patrol on Zakho-Fa'idah highway. He asked: What is the purpose of this patrol? What was in the two planes? Who were inside the two planes? What are they going to do? When I read the cable, I then reviewed the incident, and I noted that they summoned the ambassador on 14 April and the two planes were downed on 14 April. Therefore, the ambassadors summoned our ambassador pursuant to the instructions of their governments to time an evil act or behavior which we will find out. What is the relationship of this with those who were on board the planes? These are their practices. They carry out small actions, but Iraq is greater than these practices. They still do not understand what Iraq is because they understand the language of figures. They know how many tanks, planes, and fighters are left in Iraq, and how Iraq's economy is doing. In 1968, Iraq's treasury was almost empty, and there was extreme poverty, but there was a deep-rooted army with a deep-rooted history. But, when we came to power in 1968, this army was small and consisted of only five divisions. How many division did we have after the Iran-Iraq war ended in a great victory? We had 87 divisions. It is man's will that builds divisions and operates the economy. Had not we the same oil which we have now? Yes, but the Iraqis were then starving. We hear now that some Iraqis speak about lacking certain items, but I say that the conditions of 90 percent of the Iraqis now under the siege is much better than their previous conditions, which they talk of now, except for meat and some vegetables. Most of those who are talking the most, particularly those who became weak in face of the will of foreigners, are the ones who made a fortune in those extraordinary circumstances--circumstances of siege and war after the revolution of 1968. These people are not doing so under the revolution's protection. However, we see that these people, whose number is not large, are impatient. What is needed is that their neighbors should ask them to be patient as much as they have reaped profits. They should remind them of the damaged furniture they had when they moved from their previous place and settled near them. They should remind them of the good furniture they have now. They should urge them to be patient and to have a good solid attitude, much same as the furniture they have in their houses. They should remember their poverty and be patient, and remember that the revolution was what brought them the lifestyle they have enjoyed. These people are few, and it is our responsibility to advise them because we want them good, we do not hate anyone and we should not hate anyone. We should feel sympathy even for the ones who are executed under the law. This does not mean that we should pardon them to continue their evil deeds, but it means that if this Iraqi citizen been good, it would have been better for us, for his country, and his people. Their neighbors should talk to these few people and urge them to be patient. I am saying that the ones who have endured the most are those who have a limited income; namely, the genuine citizens of Baghdad. I am commending them because they deserve to be commended. But the ones who came from outside Baghdad and became wealthy after they had been poor will have little patience. On the contrary, we see that the patience of a genuine citizen of Baghdad -- who lives adjacent to these people and who used to cook meat four times a week--is greater than that of some of these formerly poor men, who may have once been so poor that they only ate meat when their father died. Sometimes, these formerly poor men could only afford to recite the opening verses of the Koran when their father died if their neighbors helped them. This is not a shame. A shame, however, is when the formerly poor man does not recall this, thus losing his national memory. This is because such a man will lose his ethics if he does not realize that he is duty-bound to recall the past, so that he can talk to his children and teach them. The children of those whom I am taking about now regard themselves as if they were the children of al- Jalabi [a famous wealthy Iraqi]. Thus, they grumble, do not like anything, do not eat simple meals, and are not ready to put on simple clothes. Therefore, they need tough advice. You should laud both the genuine citizens of Baghdad and their position because their situation is very hard. I know these people. Their position, however, is more pure and genuine than that of all the people who came to Baghdad from other governorates. Did you see the woman from al-Kazimiyah on television recently? She said she has three sons who fought in the Iran-Iraq war. Did you notice that she proudly talked about her sons' history? Did you notice how she is living with her old husband in a small house, with an area of 75 square meters, along with two married sons, their children, and her third son? Did you notice that her words stemmed from conviction, and how they made eight soaps out of one soap after adding some sugar and water, and that they all eat from the same cooking pot, and how they are living. She talked in a way that suggested honesty and sincerity to the viewer. The viewer felt that this woman was telling the truth. She invited a television photographer, who was on her way to work, to drink tea in her home, and that is why she talked to you on television. God willing, after a decisive and final victory is achieved--and victory is being achieved now, God willing--these ones will take pride in every detail of their position. We do not want to deprive any Iraqi of proudly recalling his circumstances under the blockade and explaining them to his children and later to his grandchildren. Do you not recall al-Faw in 1986? That's alright. Do you not recall al-Faw in 1988? Are they not two contradictory pictures? We are now inheriting all the glories and positions of the martyrs of al-Faw in 1986 and 1988 and with the same pride. Did you not feel agonized when you recall our martyrs in al-Faw? Here, I am saying that agony still exists in its principled, spiritual, and humanitarian sense. In other words, we wish we had not shed a single drop of Iraqi blood. This, however, is a law which is as old as the times of Adam. This law means that anything of value requires a corresponding sacrifice. However, when we recall the martyrs now we also recall all the noble meanings of liberation. All our martyrs contributed to liberation, whether those who fell in 1986 or 1988. May God have much mercy on them, God willing. We also take pride in the martyrs' families and in their positions. We thank the state, the homeland, and the enduring families of martyrs. May God salute the men, the martyrs, your army, your families, and you.
