The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] was advised of a possible visit by U.S. Democratic Party congressmen to Bie on 4 and 5 January. Through UN channels, we were subsequently informed that the U.S. team would no longer be visiting Bie. We received that message in the afternoon of 4 January. It said nothing else. How could the UNITA [word indistinct] guess that the U.S. team's itinerary had been changed and that it would go to Malange instead? 2. Between 11 December and today, 5 January, the government carried out three attacks against Bie. A. The commission sent by UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye established beyond doubt that the MPLA-Labor Party air force had in fact dropped bombs on Bie [words indistinct] the Americans [words indistinct] while peace was being negotiated in Lusaka, (?in accordance with) Luanda's orders. B. On the eve of the arrival of the team of U.S. congressmen in Angola, the MPLA General Staff issued a communique reporting that UNITA forces had carried out an attack on the oil-rich area of Malongo, in Cabinda Province [words indistinct] afterward. The MPLA General Staff had lied in a bid to impress the team of U.S. congressmen. C. Now, the MPLA government is taking the same U.S. team to Malange to make an impression at any cost, even that of human lives [words indistinct] the government [words indistinct] on 28 December of last year [words indistinct] the various comments [words indistinct] that the enemies of peace for Angola are not to be found inside the MPLA alone. They can also be found abroad [words indistinct] in Lusaka, where we have a team [words indistinct] what the MPLA government is capable of doing.
