Their sole aim, they would have us believe, is to comfort a persecuted humanity and extract its rights from the claws of tyrants and despots. They make such claims undeterred by the fact that in several cases the opposite has been proved; namely, that those defenders of human rights tend to lose interest in their cause once their motives disappear. U.S. President Bill Clinton has every right to declare himself the best known, staunchest, and mightiest of all human rights defenders. Bill Clinton's story with human rights goes back a long way. It began with his decision to run in the U.S. presidential elections, challenging the incumbent President George Bush who was running for a second term. At the time, Bush was still basking in the Gulf war victory, a battle which he planned and directed from A to Z, a triumph that brought happiness to the U.S. people and went a long way toward healing the Vietnam trauma. Clinton, aware that Bush anchored his election campaign on his foreign policy accomplishments, based his own strategy on exaggerating Bush's failures in domestic policy. Aiming a swipe at Bush's foreign policy, he denounced Bush's dealings with dictatorial regimes that persecute their people and govern them with iron and fire. Throughout his campaign, Clinton bemoaned the pitiful human rights situation in many countries, vowing that, if he were to become president, he would end U.S. cooperation with dictatorial governments regardless of how important their countries may be for U.S. interests. Clinton accused Bush openly of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses and of supporting dictatorial regimes and providing them with assistance. More specifically, Clinton mentioned China by name and pointed out that President Bush ignored the massacre of Chinese students at the hands of the government forces when they demonstrated for freedom and human rights on 3 June 1989. Clinton said that Bush extended a hand of cooperation to the Chinese Government and conferred upon it the most-favored nation [MFN] status instead of imposing economic sanctions on it until it upholds freedoms and human rights. Then Clinton won the White House's Oval Office from George Bush. Some days after he became President, it was time to renew or abolish China's MFN status. Clinton could not back down on his human rights slogan but at the same time could not ignore U.S. interests which would suffer if the relationship with China deteriorated. As a compromise, he issued a decision linking China's continued enjoyment of its MFN status with improvement in its human rights record. He gave it until June 1994. Clinton was hoping that a change would occur in Beijing to give the impression that democracy had begun to knock on China's Great Wall. In this way he would fulfill his promise to the U.S. voters with regard to imposing respect for human rights worldwide, particularly in the People's Republic of China. Unfortunately for Clinton, the Chinese Government denounced the U.S. administration's statements and maintained that any discussion of so-called human rights inside China would be seen as interference in its domestic affairs. More seriously, the Chinese Government announced that it would not accept threats and is not really concerned if the United States continues granting it MFN status if Clinton's administration links this status with the right to interfere in matters that do not concern it. Clinton could not pick up the gauntlet thrown down by China. More strangely, the U.S. President felt compelled to announce that it was in the interest of the American people to seek rapprochement between the two countries. And so... realism overcame principle and economic ties between Washington and Beijing grew closer in a way that astonished everyone who expected them to deteriorate because China insisted on clinging to its own method of ruling more than 1.5 billion people. Last year U.S. exports to China amounted to nearly $8 billion. This was necessary to provide jobs for approximately 150,000 people who would otherwise have been unemployed, particularly in California and Florida, two states of great importance in U.S. presidential elections. To be fair one must point out that many men and women in the U.S. administration were shocked by the triumph of money over principle, including adviser Anthony Lake and the U.S. representative at the United Nations Madeleine Albright. They declared their rejection of any economic cooperation with China unless its government showed respect for human rights. These objections, however, were soon dissipated before the slogan (U.S. interests first) raised by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The immense Chinese market is capable of enriching any industrial country and, according to the commerce and treasury secretaries, it would not be fair to the U.S. people to lose this market to the European nations or Japan. The desire to secure the Chinese market for the United States was not the only reason that President Clinton was persuaded to ignore the issue of the lack of human rights in China. There was the additional worry about North Korea's reported nuclear capability which might threaten that region's security and stability. The U.S. administration believes that only China can persuade North Korea to accept what the free world wants from it. This confidence in China's abilities carries a high price for Clinton. Beijing's government does not object to calming down North Korea on condition that all talk about events inside China and all accusations that it violates human rights end. This has actually happened, represented by the flow of U.S. investments to this most favored country. I am not exaggerating when I point out the similarity--with some differences--between respect for human rights U.S.-style and the same slogans raised by many human rights organizations that are established every day in various parts of the world. We have heard of a human rights organization established by several people who all their lives have been known as inveterate enemies of humanity! Not long ago they had high government posts and no one can forget how they used to suppress liberties, torture the citizens, and humiliate the innocent while raising the brazen slogan: Freedom is for the people but there is no freedom for the people's enemies. The term "people" in the slogan referred to those who supported and defended the dictatorship and the "people's enemies" were millions of wretched citizens who opposed oppression, injustice, and tyranny and as a result were deprived of their rights and liberties. It is laughable to the point of making us want to weep that the individuals who raised this slogan that divided the public into freemen and slaves are the same ones who have now renounced the slogan and have become, after losing their power and influence, defenders of liberty and martyrs of human rights. We have likewise heard about the establishment of another human rights society which is not perturbed by the terrorist acts of the past few years, designed to undermine Egypt's security and stability, in which dozens of children, women, old men, and police officers died. To this society it would appear that those who died in these terrorist acts had no rights that must be defended. More appallingly, this same society raises an outcry whenever it hears that a terrorist has been seized while committing a crime against the entire Egyptian people. It issues statements, holds meetings, makes threats and accuses our government of violating human rights. It asserts--as if it were an eyewitness--that the arrested terrorist was whipped, tortured with fire, and subjected to electric shocks to extract untrue confessions from him! How astonishing is this distinction between the rights of a terrorist and the rights of an entire nation. The society in question believes that the terrorist must be defended and exonerated regardless of his crime and evidence proving his guilt and regardless of the innocence of the police of the charge of torturing him. At the same time, this society believes that the nation has no right to ask for protection from the terrorists' grenades, the murderers' assaults, their knife attacks, their metal chains, and nail-filled bombs. The members of the society for the defense of the rights of criminal terrorists believe that because the people do not want to entrust their future to the princes of terror, the propagators of religious ignorance, and professional criminals, they therefore deserve what is happening to them.
