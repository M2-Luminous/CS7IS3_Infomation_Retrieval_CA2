Recently, the official PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an article to say that charity is no longer a forbidden word, indicating an immediate development of charities in the country. Shanghai, the country's biggest metropolis, established its charity foundation earlier this week, following the first non-governmental charity organization, which was set up in northeast China's Liaoning Province. The focus of attention even in its preparatory period, the foundation received six million yuan in donations through various channels in a week prior to its founding. Two brothers from east China's Anhui Province have contributed 3,700 yuan to the foundation, which they were awarded for responding courageously to save drowning people. Charity campaigns have swung through the country since last year. When a helping-the-orphans event was initiated in Hangzhou City in east China's Zhejiang Province, over 7,000 people swung into action, donating a million yuan and adopting more than 50 homeless children. In the capital Beijing, hospitals sponsored a "love and health" activity, giving free treatment and operations to 24 orphans. This year, Shanghai has launched several projects to extend a warm hand to the disabled, residents in poverty and homeless children. Now, there are about 32,000 such people under social care. Many people consider charities to be noble endeavors which mark civilized society, especially in China, a country with the largest population of 1.2 billion and one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
