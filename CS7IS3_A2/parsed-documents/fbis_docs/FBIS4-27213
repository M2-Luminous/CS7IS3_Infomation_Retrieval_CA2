Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an advisory forum to the prime minister, also stressed again that the ministry's estimates are just "mechanical calculations" for the panel to scrap and paste the conditions for its own models of tax reform, including permanent tax cuts and a consumption tax hike. But panel members were inclined to accept the 10-year maturity presented by the ministry in its estimates last Friday for stopgap bonds slated to be floated to fund the planned three-year time lag between tax cuts and hikes, Kato told a news conference after a panel meeting. "There are arguments the longest maturity (stipulated in law) is 60 years, but many members described the 10-year redemption as a responsible stance for the financial authorities," he said. Kato said the ministry agreed to compile estimates for a tax hike of 4 percent to 6 percent at the next meeting, but he noted the 4-6 percent tax hikes do not comply with requests made to the panel by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata's requests called for a net revenue increase through tax reform to fund an expected heavier burden on social welfare because of Japan's aging society. The ministry report, submitted last Friday upon request to the panel and the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000 after the 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts are extended and the current 3 percent consumption tax is raised to 7 percent to 10 percent in April 1997. But the ministry faced criticism over the estimates, which failed to include a tax hike to below 7 percent, a "natural" tax revenue increase, and possible effects from fiscal and administrative overhauls. It also met criticism by setting conditions of redeeming stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing the expected increase in welfare spending entirely with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and the hike. Kato said the panel also discussed the possibility of including estimates for boosting public works spending, squeezing the government burden on welfare spending, including a "natural" tax revenue increase and the effects of fiscal and administrative reforms. But the panel found too many uncertainties to decide on anything yet, he said. On administrative reform, Kato said he will meet Hata on Friday to confirm the government's policy. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said at an earlier news conference that the estimates had no "policy implications" by the ministry, particularly in guiding decisions on a tax hike to 7 percent at least. Fujii said the estimates omitted all items that require policy decisions. The panel chairman said the Friday meeting also covered the issue of regional tax revenue sources with members agreeing on the need for independent taxes by local governments. But with the panel citing technical problems in adopting regional consumption, Kato said some "political decision" is necessary. Under the current consumption tax system, the central government levies the entire 3 percent tax and distributes 39.2 percent of the revenue to local governments. The Ministry of Home Affairs submitted to the panel and the ruling parties its revenue estimates for local governments, featuring a revenue deficit of 5.4 trillion yen to 12.5 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 when funding heavier welfare spending under the current tax system. The same estimates compiled by the Finance Ministry last Tuesday for the central government showed a deficit of 8.9 trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen. The estimates do not include the planned tax reform.
