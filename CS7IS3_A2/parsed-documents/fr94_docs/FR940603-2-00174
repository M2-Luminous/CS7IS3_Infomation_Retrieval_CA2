ACTION: Notice of affirmative preliminary determination of circumvention of antidumping duty order. SUMMARY: On May 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce received an allegation of circumvention of the antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico. Pursuant to that allegation, the Department of Commerce initiated a circumvention inquiry on September 17, 1993, which was published in the Federal Register on September 27, 1993 (58 FR 50349). The Department of Commerce has conducted that inquiry and preliminarily determines that imports into the United States of steel wire strand from Mexico, which are assembled in the United States into steel wire rope for sale in the United States, are circumventing the antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico within the meaning of section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and 19 CFR 353.29(e). Interested parties are invited to comment on this preliminary determination. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 3, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a petition filed by the Committee of Domestic Steel Wire Rope and Specialty Cable Manufacturers (the Committee) requesting an investigation to determine whether imports of steel wire strand (also known as stranded wire or strand) are circumventing the antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico (58 FR 16173, March 25, 1993) within the meaning of section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Subsequent submissions from the Committee, addressing deficiencies in the original request, were received on August 13, August 18, and August 20, 1993. On April 11, 1994, the Committee submitted copies of the Census Bureau data that it had summarized in earlier submissions. On September 27, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register a Notice of Initiation of Anticircumvention Inquiry; Steel Wire Rope from Mexico (58 FR 50349). The inquiry covers the period from October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1993. On November 19, 1993, the Department issued a questionnaire to Grupo Camesa S.A. de C.V. (Grupo Camesa) and its United States affiliate, Camesa Inc. (collectively, Camesa). Camesa responded to the questionnaire on December 20, 1993. The Department determined that this submission was deficient and issued a supplemental questionnaire on January 31, 1994. The Department received a response to the supplemental questionnaire on February 16, 1994. On March 15, 1994, the Committee submitted comments with respect to Camesa's responses. Scope of Antidumping Duty Order The product covered by the order is steel wire rope, which is defined in the Department's antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico as: ``ropes, cables, and cordage of iron or carbon steel, other than stranded wire, not fitted with fittings or made up into articles, and not made up of plated wire.'' During the period of this inquiry (POI), such merchandise was classifiable under subheadings 7312.10.9030, 7312.10.9060, and 7312.10.9090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The Department's written description of the scope of the order remains dispositive.
