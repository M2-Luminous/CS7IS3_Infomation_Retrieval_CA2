Students of the people's schools, kindergartens, and nursery schools and their parents, who received gifts of love, cried, because they were greatly touched by the party's benevolence of showing care equally to the students in remote islands, as well as to the students on the land. Upholding the great leader's [suryong] noble intent of getting the greatest happiness in loving and caring for the future generation -- flower of the class, flower of the nation, and flower of mankind -- and under our party's benevolence of showing all love and consideration for the future of fatherland and revolution, helicopters have delivered gifts to approximately 80 islands a year for 10 years in February. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il established, without sparing money, a school on an island where only one or two children live, who should go to the people's school; sent modern transport ships there; and provided a helicopter in winter when the ship cannot operate. This proud reality is not only the great appearance created by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's human-loving politics, but also a clear demonstration of the superiority of the socialism of our country centered on the popular masses.
