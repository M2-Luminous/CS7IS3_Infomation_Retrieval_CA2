The enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the Cilreco held in Paris charged that the United States was carrying the tensions on the Korean peninsula to extremes with provocative acts, while refusing to improve relations with the DPRK and calling for "sanctions" against it, noted the statement, and continued: "The United States has suspended DPRK-U.S. negotiation and is zealously pursuing a policy of pressure on and threat to the DPRK under the unreasonable pretext that the DPRK is refusing to accept the high-handed demand of the Internatiomal Atomic Energy Agemcy for inspection. "The hypocritic attitude of the United States is so dangerous that it may lead the situation to a hopeless phase. "The United States must immediately stop its reckless attempt at isolating and stifling the DPRK and come out without delay to the DPRK-U.S. negotiation for a final solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. "The Cilreco calls on world public to watch the U.S. attitude with vigilance and put a strong pressure on [words indistinct] so that it may look straight at the trend of the times and act with discretion."
