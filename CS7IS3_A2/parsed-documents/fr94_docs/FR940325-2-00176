FR940325-2-00176 FR940325-2-00084 [Docket No. 50&hyph;333] Power Authority of the State of New York; James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant Exemption I The Power Authority of the State of New York (PASNY or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;59, which authorizes operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (the facility or FitzPatrick). The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Oswego County, New York. II Section III of Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 requires the development of a program to conduct periodic leak testing of the primary reactor containment and related systems and components, and components penetrating the primary containment pressure boundary. The interval between local leak rate tests for containment isolation valves (Type C tests) is specified by section III.D.3 to be no greater than 2 years. III By letter dated January 11, 1994, the licensee requested a schedular exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a) from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, section III.D.3. Specifically, the licensee requested one-time relief from the requirement to perform Type C tests (local leak rate tests) at intervals of no greater than 2 years for the shutdown cooling isolation valves (10MOV&hyph;17 and 10MOV&hyph;18). This one-time only delay, until the next refueling outage currently scheduled to begin in November 1994, was requested for the performance of these leakage tests. The licensee's request was necessitated by the extended 1991&hyph;1993 refueling outage and the length of the current operating cycle. The shutdown cooling valves were previously tested during the last refueling outage (Reload 10/Cycle 11). This was an extended outage that began in November 1991 and ended in January 1993. The Type C tests on the subject valves were performed on May 30, 1992, for the outboard isolation valve 10MOV&hyph;17, and June 5, 1992, for the inboard isolation valve 10MOV&hyph;18. Subsequent delays in the outage resulted in these tests being performed significantly in advance of the start of the operating cycle (more than 7 months prior to the end of the outage). As a result, the 2 year test interval will be reached for these valves (May 30, 1994/June 5, 1994) 6 to 7 months prior to the next scheduled refueling outage. The exemption would permit a deferral in the performance of the Type C test of the shutdown cooling isolation valves beyond the 2-year limiting interval to the next refueling outage.
