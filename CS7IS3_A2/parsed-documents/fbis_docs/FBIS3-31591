But we are not here to comment on them in the literal sense, although their progress has disturbed citizens to a certain degree. There now exists only the possibility of a referendum, since the government and deputies have failed to have their proposals passed on shortening the term of office. Mr. Prime Minister, what are your next steps in this direction? [Meciar] Today, nobody doubts anymore that there is a parliamentary crisis here. We must do everything we can to avoid this developing into a government crisis. This parliamentary crisis can be resolved in two ways. I consider it fundamental for citizens to support a referendum through the petition documents. Of course, there is a chance that the opposition will propose a petition, by means of a decree by the republic's president, that would also support a referendum, but with a different content and as late as possible. Between these two proposals--that of the government and that of the opposition--it seems on the surface that it is only a period of a few months. No, it is a question of one year of economic and social life. If the country and political life are not speedily stabilized, the loans will be delayed, they will be made conditional on still further compromises, there will be a slowdown and an end to foreign help and investment, we will become untrustworthy in the context of privatization, and we might find ourselves in a situation where the economy and stability of prices and other things is split to such a degree that the citizen would have to pay. The citizen has the right and duty to avoid this development. [passage omitted] [Bartisek] Mr. Prime Minister, you put forward a proposal to dismiss Roman Kovac, saying that his post would not be filled again. Does this mean that the complex of issues he is responsible for will be spread among others, or does it mean that four deputy prime ministers are really a sufficient number now? [Meciar] My proposal views the solution as one of personal attitude toward the program and the movement. It is obvious that Cabinet members who join a conspiracy to prepare a new Cabinet cannot stay on in this Cabinet. I am waiting for the president's reaction, I have not heard from him yet. The fact that for the time being I will not appoint anybody to the post of deputy prime minister does not affect the number of posts; it is a matter of political anticipation. I am aware of the fact that I have to reach an accord with somebody. However, those I will reach an accord with will ask for an appropriate representation in the Cabinet. This means I am keeping the door open for future talks and for future decisions. I think we will not have to wait long for such talks, for such decisions. I am concerned about the possibility that the opposition will engage in piecemeal tactics in parliament, dismissing one Cabinet member after another. This would lead to further instability and might lead to a crisis within the Cabinet, were Cabinet members to stop being flexible [zatali by sa] and not prepared to continue their work under such conditions. I cannot fail to see that the president is also hinting at something that does not necessarily seem to be going in the direction that he outlined on 1 January 1994. The development should be normal, it should lead to the stabilization of our state, and it should finally allow us to concentrate on positive work instead of fighting each other. Fighting for what? For a failure? For the failure of our state? That would be the failure of all of us. Thus, I am inclined to expect from the opposition a change of attitude and statesmanlike wisdom. [Bartisek] Have you not revealed too many of your cards now? [Meciar] I have revealed only some, but without having something more in reserve I would not tell you this. [Bartisek] At its meeting yesterday the National Council passed the heavily debated bill amending the present law on the privatization of big enterprises. Some parliamentary deputies have described it as being consistent since it combines positive aspects of the government's draft with positive aspects submitted by the opposition. This amendment should be close to being perfect. This is why it would be interesting to know whether you will sign the bill. [Meciar] We shall first examine the bill. It is 99 percent certain that the government will return it to the National Council by way of the president. The duty to sign the bill will arise only after it has been debated once again. The bill contains certain matters that have not been thought through properly, and we, therefore, regard it as correct that the National Council should again discuss comments the government will make. I expect that these discussions will lead to me being able shortly to introduce to the public the new minister for privatization, since in the original version of the bill there was not going to be a Ministry for Privatization at all. This is why it was logical for us to expect that after the final standpoint was clarified an appointment might be made. There is no longer any doubt at present that the opposition too is interested in maintaining the ministry, and one fundamental obstacle to an appointment has, therefore, been removed. My hands shall, therefore, be somewhat freed for political work.
