Zhu, who arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a nine-day visit to Japan, made the request during morning talks with BOJ Governor Yasushi Mieno at a Tokyo hotel. The chief economic planner of China as head of the central bank briefed Mieno on Beijing's efforts to shift to a "socialist market economy," the officials said. The officials did not reveal the details of the Mieno-Zhu talks, but Zhu is believed to have clarified his bank's policy of keeping a tight grip on credit, at least for the time being, to calm an overheating Chinese economy. Mieno reportedly told Zhu the Japanese central bank will continue to support China's attempt to shift to a market-driven economy.
