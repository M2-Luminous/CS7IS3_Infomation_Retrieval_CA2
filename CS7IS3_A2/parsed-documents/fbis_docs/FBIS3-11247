The ranking officer said, "I would like to banish the topic altogether, although it may be debated in the future." Enriquez Morales, who is accompanying the president on a visit to Mexico, said that, despite the imminent signing of an overall agreement on human rights, the question of creating a truth commission is dubious because it would depend on what is to be decided in the next round of negotiations. The Army's position remains unchanged; it cannot accept the creation of the truth commission for reasons already explained. According to the defense minister, the accord on human rights is wide-ranging and is not limited to this issue. In addition, General Enriquez Morales announced Guatemalan troops were deployed along the border with Belize to protect 20 families that are reportedly being harassed by Belizean soldiers trying to expel them from the area. The 20 families live in an area known as "Rio Blanco," and they claim they are under pressure to evacuate the area. He added that in addition to protecting them, the Army's mission also seeks to determine whether the area they occupy is considered a nature preserve. He concluded his remarks by noting that during his stay in Mexico he will be meeting with his Mexican counterpart, and he ruled out he will offer support in combating the Zapatist guerrillas.
