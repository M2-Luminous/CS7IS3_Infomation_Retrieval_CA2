Shandong's grim job prospects for 1994 can be seen mainly in: 1) The numbers of urban unemployed are growing. By the end of 1993, Shandong had 236,000 urban unemployed due to structural conversion, up 54,000 from 1992 which, in addition to the normal increase in unemployment in 1994, will push our 1994 unemployment above that of previous years. 2) The numbers of unemployed employees are up. Along with market changes and industrial structural adjustment, certain enterprises will go bankrupt or shut down, sharply increasing the numbers of unemployed employees in 1994. Meanwhile, the unemployed will be older and less able to find new jobs. 3) As reform intensifies, the urban-rural and regional limitations on labor mobility will be breached which, in addition to certain enterprises wanting to employ the rural workforce, will decrease the job opportunities for the urban unemployed. 4) Along with property rights system reform, industrial structural adjustment, and technological upgrading, the number of workers recruited by enterprises from society will be down from previous years. Our unemployment problem will be solved mainly through economic growth. The sustained, rapid, and sound growth of Shandong's economy will create many favorable job prospects. While tertiary industries, township enterprises, and FIEs are growing particularly fast, all providing certain job opportunities, we will still have to rely mainly on jobseekers facing up to their situation, by correctly understanding our national employment policy, acting in line with market demand, and improving their own skills and increasing their competitive awareness to find jobs in line with their own qualifications.
