In dealing with the realignment of political parties, Hata said: "It is out of the question (that the coalition parties) should act as if they were five horses heading in different directions while pulling the same carriage. Efforts must be made to unite the coalition parties in one way or another because political dynamism now lies in competition with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]." In this way, Hata reiterated his intention to promote the plan for forming a new party and coordinate the selection of coalition-supported candidates for the next House of Representatives' election.
