FR940630-0-00018 FR940630-0-00007 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;44] Establishment of Class E Airspace: Bentonville, AR, and Rogers, AR AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Bentonville, AR, and Rogers, AR. In order to enhance safety while increasing services, Class E airspace to the surface is necessary. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E Airspace to the surface for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operators executing established standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP) and standard instrument departure (SID) procedures at these airports. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gregory L. Juro, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone 817&hyph;222&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On November 24, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E Airspace at Rogers, AR, and Bentonville, AR, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 62058). Numerous users had requested additional services such as SID's and Siap's at these airports. Therefore, in order to provide for these additional services, controlled airspace extending upward from the surface of these airports that are without an operating control tower, is needed for IFR operations. The proposal was to establish Class E airspace, extending upward from the surface, for IFR operations at Rogers, AR, and Bentonville, AR. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. The latitude and longitude coordinates have been updated to reflect current data. Therefore, other than the changes just discussed and editorial changes, this amendment is adopted as proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace area designated as a surface area for an airport are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace located at Rogers, AR, and Bentonville, AR, to provide controlled airspace upward from the surface to contain IFR operations at these airports. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
