Our reporter on the scene, Nan Roux, has been in the thick of things in Mmabatho today and witnessed a great deal of what you saw earlier. She is on the line to us from the Mmabatho Sun Hotel. Nan, give us an update on the situation at the moment, please. [Roux] Well, the situation in the town Megacity, where most of the action took place earlier this evening, is quiet, There is a Bophuthatswana Defense Force presence, but apparently the looting has stopped and the people have left the area. However a news team came in from the Zeerust road and noticed approximately 30 cars. They said they looked like right-wing cars, farmers' vehicles, bakkies [pickup trucks]. Apparently 30 of these cars turned off onto the Jagersfontein road. The two reporters trailed them for about 10 km. They spotted men on the back of one of the bakkies. They thought they had balaclavas on. The cars turned round and the men returned. So there is a massing of some kind outside town. We've just not had confirmation of who exactly it is. Then we've also had reports of problems in several prisons. A prison warden from a prison just outside Mmabatho phoned to say that apparently they have seven casualties. They have been attacked by Bophuthatswana police and Bophuthatswana Defense Force. This hasn't been confirmed yet, but there are problems in prisons across the country. But in Mmabatho it's quiet, and yes, we'll keep you updated. [Steed] Nan, thank you very much. Good night, and take great care. [Roux] I will. Thank you.
