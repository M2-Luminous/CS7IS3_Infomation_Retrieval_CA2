Already comments from both sides have paved the way for agreement -- at least as far as the insurance sector is concerned. One senior Japanese Finance Ministry official has said the United States has acknowledged that setting yardsticks to measure Japan's market access is not appropriate. And a U.S. diplomatic official in Tokyo has named the insurance business in saying problems exist in adopting objective criteria to measure market shares in areas full of regulations, which he distiguished from the free-hand automobile sector. In fact, negotiators from both sides had suggested insurance talks were approaching consensus before the overall talks hit a snag due to sharp differences on two of the three priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. If their comments hold true and negotiations are wrapped up, the future of the still unclear agreement reached by the two nations last week for reopening bilateral trade talks may become more certain. The breakthrough during exploratory talks came after a four-day marathon in Washington, with the two sides agreeing to set both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks instead of numerical targets for each of the negotiation sectors. The framework talks started in July last year under an accord by then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Tokyo with the goal of setting a new framework for the two nations' trade relations. But they were ruptured in February when then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach a common ground over their definition of "objective criteria" during a summit in Washington. The insurance talks will reopen the stalled framework negotiations Wednesday in Tokyo. Talks on other priority areas will follow. Automobiles and auto parts are scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Washington, and government procurement of telecommunications equipment in Tokyo on Friday and Saturday, and medical equipment in Tokyo next Tuesday and Wednesday. Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated that Japan will not offer any new commitments on the insurance negotiations, which are in the hands of his ministry. "We will put our upmost efforts into realizing the voluntary measures" that are included in the March market-opening package, he said in a recent news meeting. Indeed, the measures encompass the majority of U.S demands, including deregulation, simpler licensing and adoption of a brokering system. The remaining key issues are the unclear "keiretsu," mutual stockholding relationships between insurers and sales agents, and a third area such as policies for cancer and nursing care. The last area appears to hold the clue for the direction of the insurance talks, with the U.S. calling on Japan to keep its restriction on Japanese insurers. As a form of special treatment, Japan only allows foreign insurers to engage in the area. Japan is expected to lift the ban in about two years, with the insurance council, an advisory panel to the finance minister, now preparing a report on legal revisions. The package to reform insurance-related laws for the first time in 50 years is scheduled for submission to the Diet next year. The U.S. is asking Japan to wait for five years at least. A U.S. Government source said earlier this week that planned revision in the third area would hamper new entries by foreign insurers. Meanwhile, Japanese officials are bewildered over the U.S. demand, which they say contradicts deregulatory steps. On the "keiretsu" practice, Japan is expected to seek support for its compromise of adopting a brokering system. A ministry negotiator said the government cannot intervene in the "keiretsu" system, which is a private-sector dealing, and noted that such unfair practices toward foreign insurers also prevail in the U.S. He cited the brokering system that is restricted in many states and the liability reserves some U.S. states oblige foreign insurers to build up. Indeed, the negotiator said one major dispute has been over Japan's demand for "two-way negotiations" to discuss such unfair practices in the U.S. Japanese industry leaders said they just do not understand why the insurance business was included in the framework talks. Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association, said Japan in fact has a trade deficit with the U.S. in the insurance field. "I haven't heard of any complaints from U.S. insurers already present in Japan, and many of them have been successful here," he said. In conceding there is a lack of communication, Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and Fire Insurance Association, said his industry plans to set up a forum to exchange views with U.S. industry leaders. A ministry source said, "all we needed was a bit of U.S. compromise" on numerical targets by splitting the insurance area from other fields.
