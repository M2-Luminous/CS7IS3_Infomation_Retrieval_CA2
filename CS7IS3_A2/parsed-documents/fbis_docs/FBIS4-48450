Mr. Nzo said in a statement in Pretoria that the reports were based partially on incomplete information on South Africa's possible reaction to steps that could be taken by the UN to end the conflict in Rwanda. He said although South Africa was extremely concerned about the slaughter in Rwanda, the government would have to consult with other African countries and the UN before taking a decision on any peace initiatives.
