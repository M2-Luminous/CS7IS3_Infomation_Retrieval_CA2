But This Is Better Than Standing Still"] [Text] During his visit to Tatarstan, President Yeltsin drew the conclusion that he had been right in the first place to offer republics within the Russian Federation as much sovereignty as "they could swallow." The basis for this conclusion is a bilateral treaty recently signed between Russia and the Republic of Tatarstan, which determines the volume of republic powers on the one hand and federal powers on the other hand. As Boris Yeltsin noted, the treaty has enshrined the real volume of powers which the republic is in a position to digest. However, judging by the worried face of Mintimer Shaymiyev, the process of "digestion" is proceeding with difficulty, and he briefly outlined the reason for this in his reply: "Mechanisms are needed..." Following on from this by association, what this means is that anything can be swallowed, but in order to avoid indigestion, sovereignty must be "chewed" properly. That is, totally specific organizational mechanisms of interaction between the center and the component of the Federation must be thought out and elaborated. As usual, this is difficult. And as extremely long discussions went on at one time about the mechanism of the implementation of the Federation Treaty, which was not elaborated in the end anyway, so now there is -- evidently on Tatarstan's part, first and foremost -- strong concern about ensuring that the bilateral treaty does not remain a political declaration only. The meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Mintimer Shaymiyev should be a guarantee of the fact that steps to regulate economic problems will follow on from the political achievements of the treaty (and these are real: Elections to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly have been held in Tatarstan). The economic problems are no less real and alarming: Mutual tax relations have not been established, which is worrying the federal government first and foremost, as it is not receiving the full complement of taxes from Tatarstan; the republic, for its part, is not satisfied with the fact that the center has so far done nothing to ensure that the demarcation of powers has moved from "paper" to practical deeds. Admittedly, the creation of a bilateral commission to monitor the implementation of the treaty has been announced. But no commission in our country has ever been a guarantee that things will get moving. In a specific case, perhaps only direct support to a given problem on the part of Russian Government Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray, who, as we know, promoted the treaty on the center's side, may serve as a guarantee. The Russian Federation president expressed the hope that the outline for mutual relations between Moscow and Kazan will constitute the basis for settling problems between the center and other components of the Federation which are aspiring to autonomy. He has Chechnya primarily in mind. But today, Bashkiria, Tuva, and a number of "self-sufficient" krays and oblasts are aspiring to the Tatarstan model. Evidently, the process of formulating bilateral treaties will be widened, although it has a lot of opponents, according to whom this will mean a transition from a constitutional federation to a treaty-based one. This problem has not been solved on a theoretical level, and will most likely not be solved in the near future. The construction of the federation, like a lot of other things, is proceeding by the method of "feeling your way." "The digestion of sovereignty" by the republics is proceeding in an uncontrolled way, with a multitude of negative side-effects which no one is analyzing properly at state level. Krays and oblasts, which have recently been pinning more and more hopes on regional unification within historically established economic areas, are moving along the experimental path toward greater independence. What this will turn into, no one can say today. The only thing that is clear is that the more the federal powers, both executive and legislative, delay in settling regional problems, the fewer the chances are that the construction of the federation will proceed along a normal, constructive path, without any nasty surprises for Moscow.
