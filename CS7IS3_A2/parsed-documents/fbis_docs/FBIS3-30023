VAC economy, which is known in Vietnam by three initials, V for orchard or garden, A for fish pond and C for live-stock breeding, appeared in the country where there remained agricultural cooperatives. The income of families from VAC economy then only made up 5-7 per cent of their total income. Over the past recent 10 years, VAC economy developed rapidly with the move towards a market economy. According to Mr Nguyen Ngoc Triu, special envoy of the prime minster and president of the Vietnam Gardeners' Association (Vacvina), more than 60 per cent of the farmer households' income is from VAC economy. He estimated this was worth about 10 million VND [Vietnam dong] per year each. The total income of 10 million households engaged in VAC economy throughout the country is about USD [U.S. dollars] 10 billion per year. With the present development, VAC is a major part of the agriculture-forestry economy of Vietnam, contributing to the diversification of agricultural produce, creating a new strategy for agricultural and rural development. Many households are doing farming, gardening or afforestation on tens or even hundreds of hectares of land. Those who are engaged in aquaculture have broadened their business to lakes, channels and even rivers, covering tens or hundreds of hectares. Others have set up snake farms, chicken farms, deer, cattle or pig farms. Vacvina has taken part in a national programme of reclaiming 10 million hectares of waste land and bare hills to incrsease arable lands and create more jobs. Under an agriculture promotion programme, the state and vacvina are helping households engaged in VAC economy in providing capital, technology, and products processing and marketing. Many households have sucessfully developed VAC economy. Fifty thousand households in the Mekong River delta, for instance, have become rich thanks to VAC economy. Some of them are Vietnamese `billionaires'. In Tien Giang Province, people work on 40,000 ha of gardens (or 20 percent of the province's cultivated land). Their VAC output value accounts more than 20 per cent of the province's total crop production. They have earned annually hundreds of billions of VND from selling plants and fruits. In the coastal districts of Tien Hai and Thai Thuy, Thai Binh Province, people have invested big capital in reclaiming coastal marshes for production and earned hundreds of billion VND a year. They invested hundreds of billion VND in aquaculture, yielding from 100-150 million VND a year. In the northern mountain province of Son La, about 2,600 households are engaged in fruit tree planting. Their income from fruits is a dozen times over rice and maize cultivation. Particularly, more than 4,000 households of war veterans in central province of Quang Tri, the most impoverished land in the country, the farmers have earned between 15-40 million VND from VAC economy. As VAC economy had helped in providing daily nutritious foods for aged people and children, UNICEF had decided to surport and provide vacvina with material assistance.
