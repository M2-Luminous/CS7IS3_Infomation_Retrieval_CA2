In connection with the "fabrication of facts" in TV Asahi's special news program "The Scoop," in an interview on 24 April, the Chinese coordinator, Mr. A, 25--who obtained videotapes on public executions from the PRC authorities--testified to SANKEI SHIMBUN that the authorities had investigated his family members, friends, and acquaintances; his mother, who actually borrowed the videotapes; and, that a number of others who helped in filming the news program had been arrested. Regarding his fleeing to South America, Mr. A said: "I will be a dead man if I am arrested." "I do not know what I am going to do from now on." Mr. A came to Japan on an educational visa in autumn 1991. While studying at a Japanese language school in Tokyo, he took advantage of his experience and connections to work as coordinator for media coverage in China. He returned to his hometown Fuzhou city temporarily to assist in filming the program in question. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In Japan, they say you testified that you wore the uniform of an armed policeman and acted as one in the program. [A] That is true. I said that. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Where did the video footage on the public executions come from? And how did you obtain them? [A] I asked assistance from my mother, who is a public security cadre, and she borrowed them from a certain official of the judiciary. I dubbed them at home and handed the tapes over to Kasahara [Tadao Kasahara, president of the subcontractor production outfit which actually produced the news program]. He later told me: "What I brought home was unacceptable," so I again borrowed other tapes, dubbed them, and brought them back to Japan personally. These were the ones used in the program. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How much money did you get for this job? [A] All in all, around 2 million yen. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When and how did you leave Fuzhou? [A] I left Fuzhou on 25 September 1993. A friend of mine who works for the authorities had called and told me "you are in danger." I immediately took a taxi to Shenzhen. From there, I went to Hong Kong, and returned to Japan on 27 September. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How did you keep yourself informed? [A] I have some old friends still working for the authorities. My elder brother, who is in hiding in China, sometimes telephones me. After I returned to Japan, I stayed with members of the TV program production staff and other Chinese friends. I was also in contact with my elder brother and friends, through trusted friends. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When did you leave Japan? [A] On 24 December. I was told that five men had been sent to Japan to arrest me. I was frightened so I went to see Kasahara and the TV Asahi people, but none of them wanted to see me. The video footage on public executions is a state secret. If I get caught, I will be sentenced to death. [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How will you make a living from now on? [A] I still do not know what to do. I have three fake passports, but I think I will have to buy an authentic one.
