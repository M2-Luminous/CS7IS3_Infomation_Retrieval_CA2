Government officials say they are "cautiously optimistic" that the World Bank forum can produce pledges of new funding to plug a US40 million to US50 million dollar projected financing gap in 1994. The World Bank said nearly 50 countries and international organisations are expected to be represented at the meeting which will focus on Guyana's economic recovery effort. Together with Guyana's major creditor nations and several newly industrialised countries, attendance at the meeting will include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Finance Corporation, the Internationsl Fund for Agricultural Development, the Kuwait Fund, and the International Moetary Fund. CGCED, meeting here for the first time, is a World Bank forum which helps coordinate external aid to Caribbean states. Guyana's president, Dr. cheddi Jagan, is scheduled to address the delegates January 27, and a financing plan and the donors' programme for Guyana will be examined on January 28. On Jan. 28, also, the Guyana Government will host a discussion on its development programme. Former US President Jimmy Carter, who spearheaded international participation in Guyana's October 1992 elections, widely heralded as marking the country's return to democracy, is also to participate in the forum. Carter, representing the Altanta-based Carter centre of Emory University, is expected in Guyana January 25 for the conference. Dr Uma Lele, an official of centre [as received] visiting here this week, said the former President's role at the coming meeting will be to understand the constraints faced by nations like Guyana and the demands that donors make, and to identify how he could help.
