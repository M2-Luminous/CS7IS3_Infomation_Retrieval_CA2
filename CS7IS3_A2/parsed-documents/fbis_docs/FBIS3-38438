It is a picture that shows clearly the cloudy state of uncertainty into which the country has fallen. If anyone wants to understand why it is so difficult for agreements to be struck between [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni and [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi, between [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, between [Italian Republican Party (PRI) Secretary] La Malfa and [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto, between [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco and [PSI deputy] Intini, and between [Communist Renewal leader] Cossutta and [Democratic Allaince leader] Adornato, they should simply take a look at the figures published by Directa, CIRM, or Diakron -- to name but a few of the polling institutions that are exhibiting their wares in the newspapers these days. What emerges is the image of an Italy that is split into three, more or less equal-sized slices. There are differences between individual polls, but in general the three Italies are a reality, if only a virtual one. For example, the triple poll taken by CIRM in January provides a rather interesting batch of new information. The progressive alliance stands at around 36 percent. Within the alliance, the PDS is the hegemonic force with 20 percent: At the beginning of the month, Occhetto's party was given 23 percent, in the second poll it stood at 22 percent, and today it has probably lost another two points. The Communist Renewal should have 6 percent, remaining more or less stable since early January. The Rete and the Greens, taken together, were on 5 percent after having reached 6 percent in the first poll. The nondenominationalist group of the Democratic Alliance remained steady on 5 percent. The progressive front as a whole now appears to have four points less than the 40 percent achieved in the first days of January. The right, on the other hand, would appear to be on the way up. The first poll gave it 34 percent, but in the second it had 38 percent. In the most recent poll, published a few days ago, the right had 40 percent. If we look inside the coalition (which, moreover, is not yet an official one) we can see that the main group at the moment appears to be Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, which has shot up from 6 percent to 13 percent in less than a month. The Northern League, on the other hand, has taken the opposite trend: Leading the way with 16 percent at the start of the month, it then dropped to 13 percent before further shrinking back to 12 percent. Gianfranco Fini's National Alliance remains completely stable on 10 percent (note that this figure, taken at the national level, would give the Alliance a considerable success concentrated in the south). Lastly, the CIRM poll recorded an increase for the former Christian Democratic [DC] and nondenominationalist centrists, up from 2 to 5 percent. The split in the DC has clearly given a slight boost to the Casini-D'Onofrio-Mastella group chasing the moderate voters. The third Italy that we should keep an eye on is that of [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli and Mario Segni. The agreement concluded between the Popular Party and the Pact for Italy remains stable in the polls at 23 percent. From a political point of view, this would prove Martinazzoli right in choosing to defend stubbornly his party's identity as the center-left heir to the DC. As [Senate Speaker] Spadolini said in an interview with LA STAMPA, "the alliance of the left as it stands is best confronted from the center. Martinazzoli and Segni have understood this. A new type of dialogue is being imposed between nondenominationalists and Catholics." However, this 23 percent does not guarantee either Martinazzoli or Segni sufficient representation in a future parliament: The rules of the majority system are strict, and those finishing third can get little or nothing. Augusta Barbera explained this well in an interview with CORRIERE DELLA SERA, even if we should add that the Italian-style majority system does award a considerable consolation prize with a 25 percent proportional drawback. In any case, the map of the three Italies must not be seen just from an electoral point of view. The political message it gives is that the country has not come to terms with bipolarism and that public opinion, for the moment, prefers a three-legged system. This is a sign that the clear-cut alternative between left and right does not appear convincing yet and that people want to let at least a third runner into the race. After 27 March this could also lead to that "great coalition" alluded to by the speaker of the Senate. The other clear message is that the left has not yet won, and thus its forces do not appear to be superior to those of the right. Occhetto's advantage is that the progressive coalition is already a reality, despite contradictions and a paradoxical situation. On the other hand, the right will continue to be the side of Agramante, as described by [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli. The new factor in the equation, however, is that Bossi has asked Berlusconi to act as a "mediator" between north and south -- in effect to act as the cement for an agreement that does not yet exist and which should bind together the League, Forza Italia, and the MSI-National Alliance. Bossi's initiative, however, is also the sign of Berlusconi's growing sway among the moderates. It simply remains to be said that things are not settled either in the Martinazzoli-Segni group with regard to possible preelection alliances. While the Popular Party members of the left are in favor of going it alone, many in the Pact think otherwise. There is a border area between the two, consisting mostly of nondenominationalists, that still believe in the idea of a technical agreement with the ranks of the right to save the majority constituencies. Mario Segni, after having decided to back the agreement with Martinazzoli, now has every reason to hold on to a degree of autonomy.
