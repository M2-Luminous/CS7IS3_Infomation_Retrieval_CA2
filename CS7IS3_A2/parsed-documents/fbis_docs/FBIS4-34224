He made this statement at a joint news conference in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where the G-3 countries are meeting and where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is taking place. [Begin Caldera recording] Bolivar fluctuations will not affect the G-3 free trade agreement, because there will always be ways to prevent any eventuality from obstructing the basic element: trade among sister nations. [end recording] Meanwhile, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has said the trade agreement will come into effect soon due to the rules previously stipulated in the treaty signed by Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico. The first reaction to this treaty will come from investors of the three countries. [Begin Gaviria recording] Although an immediate deregulation was included in the agreement, the G-3 free trade agreement is of utmost importance for a number of products. We must bear in mind the lifting of customs duties will take 10 years; this is why free trade will be progressive. I believe, however, the same thing that happened when Mexico signed a free trade agreement with Chile will happen again: the doubling in trade within a year, because the expectations and clear-cut rules have made businessmen aware that there were regulations that would control trade and make trade grow. We hope the agreement among Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico will yield very significant results soon. [end recording] Meanwhile, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said the prospects of this agreement regarding larger markets and production are compelling mechanisms with which to defeat poverty. The Aztec head of state was questioned about the G-3's contribution to help fight poverty. [Begin Salinas recording] We in Mexico are convinced the only way to permanently defeat poverty is to recover sustained economic growth, because without well-paying jobs there are no possibilities of permanently eradicating poverty.
