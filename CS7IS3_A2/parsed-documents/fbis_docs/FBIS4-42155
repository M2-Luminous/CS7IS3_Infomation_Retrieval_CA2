A Saarbruecken police spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that the operation had been conducted on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by the Federal Court of Justice magistrate against a suspected member of the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). Officers from the Criminal Investigation Office, the Federal Border Guard, and the Saarland police were involved in the operation. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe is responsible for conducting the investigations. The executive committee of the "Old Fire Station" association, responsible for funding the Old Fire Station where the Kurdish cultural group, among others, is based, drew up a resolution protesting the police operation. A statement released by the association says that approximately 100 masked officers forced their way into the building wearing combat gear and with weapons drawn. They searched all rooms and detained all the approximately 50 Kurds present and took them away in handcuffs. At least one person was seriously hurt in the process. The Germans present were temporarily detained, but were released once their personal information had been taken and they had been filmed on video.
