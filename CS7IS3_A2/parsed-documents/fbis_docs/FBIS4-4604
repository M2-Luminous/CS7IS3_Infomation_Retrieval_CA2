That day, formations of overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical take off and landing] assault planes of the U.S. Marines frenziedly staged surprise attack exercises on strategic objects in the Northern half of the Republic in coordination with airplanes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the puppet Air Force, thus instigating an atmosphere of war. This frenzied playing with fire, staged for a long in the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang, Oeyon islet and Chongju, was designed to examine coordination striking capabilities of various types of military aircraft of the U.S. Marines and airplanes of the U.S. Air Force and the puppet Air Force against the North. Meanwhile, tank groups of the puppet Army, which were mobilized and deployed in Kumpari, Paju County, fired scores of tank guns at areas in Hapo-ri on the other side of Imjin River, and armed hooligans of the puppet Army who occupied combat positions in Pangmong-ri fired hundreds of large-caliber machine gun bullets while advancing toward the Military Demarcation Line. This shows that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are recklessly rushing ahead toward a war against the North.
