FR941206-1-00070 FR941206-1-00007 Regarding the third drawback cited above (fully pigmented finishing materials), although the lb HAP/lb solids format overestimates the actual emissions reductions from pigmented finishing materials, the Work Group agreed that this was not a significant problem because these materials represent a small amount of total finishing material usage. Industry estimated that these finishing materials account for less than 5 percent of total usage, and data collected by the EPA support this estimate. As a result of the above discussions, the format of today's proposed rule for coating operations is a lb VHAP/lb solids emission limit (kg VHAP/kg solids). While this format has been evaluated and is considered appropriate for this source category due to the similarities in the densities of the solids used in the coatings, the Agency recommends that before using this format for setting emission limits for other source categories a thorough evaluation of its appropriateness for that source category be conducted. 2. Gluing Operations The Agency and the Glue Work Group, which was involved in the initial discussions concerning the development of emission standards for adhesives, considered several formats in developing the proposed standards for gluing operations. The potential formats for contact adhesives evaluated by the EPA included a limit on the HAP content of the adhesive expressed as a pound of HAP per gal and a HAP content based on a lb HAP/lb solids. For the reasons cited for finishing operations, a format expressed as a lb HAP/gal is not adequate for determining emission reduction. Likewise, for the same reasons discussed for finishing, a HAP limit in terms of lb VHAP/lb solids (kg VHAP/kg solids) was selected as the format for the proposed standards. This format was agreed upon by the Agency and the Glue Work Group. E. Selection of Work Practice Standards The proposed rule contains many work practices that the Committee believed are pollution prevention approaches that limit emissions from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations. Section 112(h) of the Act gives the EPA the authority to promulgate design, equipment, work practice, or operational standards, or a combination thereof. Such standards are necessary in cases where physically measuring emissions from a source is impossible or at least impracticable. The work practices that were selected as part of the proposed standards are practices that the Committee agreed are feasible but for which emission limits could not be assigned. For this source category, work practices were also considered necessary for another reason. Whereas the emission limits required by the standards will control only HAP emissions from wood furniture manufacturing operations, the work practices will limit both HAP and VOC emissions. Several Committee members were concerned that to comply with the proposed rule, sources would replace HAP compounds in finishing materials with equally hazardous non-HAP VOC's. By implementing work practices, all pollutants will be controlled to some extent. 1. Work Practices Selected for the Proposed Standards a. Finishing, Gluing, Cleaning, and Washoff Operations. The Committee recognized that by implementing work practice standards, HAP emissions from finishing and gluing operations could be further reduced. To determine the work practices that would be technically feasible for the source category, the Committee established a Work Practice Work Group. The Work Practice Work Group comprised the EPA and State regulators, a State office involved with waste reduction, finishing material suppliers, manufacturers, and an environmental group representative. The Work Practice Work Group identified two areas in which HAP emissions from finishing, gluing, cleaning, and washoff operations could be reduced through work practices: HAP storage and HAP transfer; and two more areas in which HAP emissions could be reduced from finishing operations: finishing material application and selection of finishing materials. The work practices proposed by the Work Practice Work Group were discussed with the Committee, and a consensus was reached that the recommended work practices should be included in the proposed rule.
