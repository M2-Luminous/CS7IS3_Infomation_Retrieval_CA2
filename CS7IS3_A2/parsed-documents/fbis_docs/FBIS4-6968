It might be tough, but if we fail to overcome this hardship, we will not be able to meet the people's expectations. [House of Councillors member Hajime Fukada] I think we have the overwhelming support of the local chapters. Those who have been distressed by the problems of the coalition in one way or another have finally come to the end of their patience. I think [SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi] Murayama's decision is in line with the sentiments of our local activists. [House of Representatives member Masao Sakon] I think it is a matter of course that Mr. Murayama should express such indignation. What he did is good as an impulsive reaction to the immediate situation, but we have to take the future outlook into consideration and act carefully from now on. [end recording] Here is a live relay from the Diet building on the SDPJ's reaction: [NHK political reporter Mikihiko Inoue] The SDPJ held an emergency meeting of its Central Executive Committee for nearly one hour at the Diet building from 0930 [0030 GMT] this morning. As a result, the committee unanimously endorsed the decision by Chairman Murayama and two other top party executives early this morning to leave the coalition. It also reconfirmed the SDPJ's policy of not participating in any policymaking or decisionmaking meetings of the coalition government. Therefore, both Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo did not attend the party leaders' meeting going on right now at the prime minister's official residence, which was convened by the heads of the other ruling coalition parties which formed the new parliamentary group "Kaishin" yesterday. Murayama returned to SDPJ headquarters after the emergency Central Executive Committee meeting ended to talk with officials of labor unions supporting the SDPJ. This morning, the biggest right wing faction in the SDPJ, the "Democrats" also held a general meeting. During the meeting, the participants expressed the following opinions: The high-handed political methods of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the other parties are unacceptable; the SDPJ cannot possibly return to the existing coalition framework; and the party must seek new ways to win political power. Thus, the "Democrats" group has also affirmed its support of the party leadership's decision. The SDPJ is scheduled to hold a general meeting of its members of the lower and upper house at 1300 today to reconfirm the party leadership's decision to leave the coalition. The party leadership is also planning to hold a national meeting as soon as possible to obtain the local chapters' support of its decision. As of now, there is no possibility for the SDPJ to revise its decision to leave the coalition. This ends the report from the Diet building.
