FR941110-0-00324 FR941110-0-00019 (ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: (A) The discounted purchase price; (B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and (C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. (2) At the option of the IHA, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more than 20 percent. This does not require an IHA's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence. (3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the IHA shall (by an appropriate form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the IHA, to be based solely on the IHA's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result in payment to the IHA, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction, if provided for by the homeownership plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the IHA shall be obligated to approve the resale. (4) The IHA may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in favor of an additional lien granted by the purchaser as security for a loan for home improvements or other purposes approved by the IHA. (c) Limited equity method. As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement, restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: (1) The seller's paid-in equity; (2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during homeownership tenure; and (3) An allowance for a portion of the property's appreciation in value during homeownership tenure, calculated by a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership plan ( e.g. , according to a price index factor or other measure). (d) Third option. The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section.
