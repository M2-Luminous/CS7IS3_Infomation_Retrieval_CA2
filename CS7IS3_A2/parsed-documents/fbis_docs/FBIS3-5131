Han, meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Laney, complained that such references create the impression that South Korea has human rights problems despite its democratic progress, Foreign Ministry officials said. Laney, handing over a written statement of explanation, apologized for U.S. officials' having unintentionally hurt the feelings of South Koreans with their remarks. Laney's statement said Washington is fully aware of Seoul's great strides in democracy and human rights, and "unequivocally recognizes the fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the Kim Yong-sam administration towards human rights," as acknowledged by the 1993 human rights report. The controversy started when U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Tom Hubbard told a seminar last week that Washington wants to see Seoul repeal its national security law. The comment sparked immediate protests that it was undue interference in South Korea's internal affairs, while raising suspicions that the issue had been discussed with North Korea since Hubbard was chief U.S. working-level nuclear negotiator with Pyongyang. Indeed, Hubbard was in the middle of last-minute bargaining with North Korean officials when he made the remark last week. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Thursday that the United States hopes the "Korean Government and the Korean people might find it appropriate to no longer have that law in effect" because it is "subject to abuse and a reflection of an earlier time." Laney said the U.S. officials' comments should be seen "as remarks of close friends and democratic peers." "I have unqualified confidence in (South Korea's) human rights practices and its respect for the rule of law," said Laney in his statement. Han, while calling the remarks ill-timed, said he personally believed they came out "accidentally." "The security law is now revised but at the U.S. working-level, images of the past apparently remain and that tends to show up in high officials' speeches and press briefings," he said after meeting Laney. "We think the comments were accidental, but we still needed to drive home a strong message to prevent a repetition of similar remarks that could be made due to lack of understanding of the current security law," he said.
