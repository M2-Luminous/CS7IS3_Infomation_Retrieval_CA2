His hour-and-a-half long speech to the members of the deputy group, "New Regional Policy," about which only this group had been given confidential notification, was presented behind closed doors, without "outside" deputies or journalists. Perhaps that is for the best. Skokov's evaluations of the other Duma factions and the lower chamber as a whole were rather unflattering. The State Duma is as yet "not a parliament, but a party club," a mechanical conglomerate of party factions which "are not accountable to anyone." On the contrary, the NRP ["New Regional Policy"] group, in Skokov's interpretation, is the bulwark and hope not only for parliament, but to a certain degree for all of Russia. Reminding them that he "took an active part in the stage of formulation of the group," Skokov called it the "nucleus, the beginnings of the structure of representative power in the entire country." Such complementary interpretations ran through Yuriy Vladimirovich's entire political philosophy and program of action. The fact is that he has a rather low opinion of the party system of current-day Russia in general. In his opinion, parties do not have serious programs and principles. They are created "under surnames" for the purpose of realizing the political ambitions of these "surnames." Therefore, there is no sense for Skokov, as any rational and responsible politician, to build yet another party on the basis, for example, of the Federation of Goods Producers. Rather, it is necessary to create a "system of interaction" between deputies who share a single mandate and who have ties in the regions, with the representative and executive powers of the territories, the regional unions of the Federation of Goods Producers, and with the local intellectual and professional elite. This is the "non-governmental, non-state" technocratic--in opposition to the party--system, which can organize the country's emergence from its historic dead end. In the name of its development, Yuriy Skokov offered the deputies his cooperation "in any form," specially stipulating that it should not be limited to the field of lawmaking. Having understood the sense of the proposed deal, the parliamentarians stopped to think. Despite the attractiveness of the proposal, despite the respect which they had for the name of the speaker, the "regionalists" were clearly concerned by the problem: What does Skokov actually represent in the political plane? Yuriy Vladimirovich, who previously expressed his readiness to run for president, this time avoided responding to the question of whether he sees himself as a future leader of the country. Then at least they would like to know what his "hosts and home fronts" are! Skokov gave a rather detailed listing of the collective members of the Federation of Goods Producers which he heads up, noting that he includes in this category "all persons at the local sites who create material wealth." However, in response to the specific question of whether he has a group of persons capable of working with the NRP on the formation of a socio-political movement, he gave an expansive answer from which it followed that, in general, he does not have such a group. "Only individual persons are emerging." On the whole, however, the cadre problem is the most complex, and that is why he has appealed to the "regionalist" deputies. It seems that after the "secret meeting," the parliamentarians understood what was wanted of them, but never did understand who stands behind Skokov. Is it only his legendary humility which explains the fact that he stubbornly stays in the shadows? Did he not rush to the deputy group as his last hope? Or, in fact, is this a leader who only needs some link, some Archimedes key, to turn Russia upside down? In any case, it is obvious that Skokov has seen in the "New Regional Policy" more than simply a duma faction. Perhaps he has seen a sort of "micro-soviet of the Federation" in the State Duma, a channel of power for emergence into the regions which he lost when he left the post of head of the Security Council and did not find in the Federation of Goods Producers, which he currently heads up. And so he decided to make use of the actual and imagined potentials of the deputy group. There are varying opinions about these potentials. Some believe that the NRP is a "union of unattached persons." Others believe it to be a powerful government lobby in parliament. If the latter is true, then Yuriy Vladimirovich has presented his listeners with a serious choice. It is not overly disposed to the current government and its head, and critizes it not only for its failures in the economy, but also "from personal positions." The Federation of Goods Producers long ago proposed that Chernomyrdin sign the "agreement on interaction," and even the president had a "rather positive" attitude toward this. However, the "government is silent." Therefore, Skokov, for his part, does not want to sign the Agreement on Civil Accord. Thus, it has been suggested in cautious form that the Duma "regionalists" define themselves. It is hard to say how difficult this choice is for them in the ideological plane, since in any case it is not a choice in favor of "classic democracy." Because while Viktor Stepanovich embodies the power of the "director-privatizers" in the eyes of many, the outline presented by Yuriy Vladimirovich is a second variant of the "nomenklatura renaissance," which casts off as being unneeded the inalienable attribute of democracy--the leading role of the party in the political process. And finally. Is it by chance that Yuriy Skokov's blitz-visit to the Duma coincided in time with the news of the resignation of Sergey Shakhray, a long-time rival of Yuriy Vladimirovich in the field of regional policy? Among the "regionalists" in the Duma, Shakhray enjoyed the authority of being a practical man who helped to solve specific questions of the territories. "With Shakhray one could discuss the problem of the 'norths.' Now Shakhray is gone. Do you know this problem?", one of the deputies asked Skokov. "I know it very well," he accepted the challenge.
