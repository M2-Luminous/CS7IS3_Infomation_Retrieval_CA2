On 5 April, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict according to which approval is given to the proposal by the Russian Ministry of Defense to set up Russian military bases on the territories of CIS countries and Latvia for testing new weapons and military equipment. Lithuania supports in every possible way Latvia's desire to have the Russian troops withdrawn from her territory and declares that only the Republic of Latvia has the right to decide the military basis of what state can be deployed on her territory, the statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry reads.
