FR940610-2-00114 FR940610-2-00067 (1) An independent fiduciary of each Plan must specifically authorize each cross-trade transaction in accordance with the following procedure: (a) No more than three business days prior to the execution of any cross-trade transaction, Fidelity must inform an independent fiduciary of each Plan involved in the cross-trade transaction that Fidelity proposes to buy or sell specified securities in a cross-trade transaction if an appropriate opportunity is available, the current trading price for such securities, and the total number of shares to be acquired or sold by each such Plan. (b) Prior to each cross-trade transaction, the transaction must be authorized either orally or in writing by the independent fiduciary of each Plan involved in the cross-trade transaction; (c) If a cross-trade transaction is authorized orally by an independent fiduciary, Fidelity will provide written confirmation of such authorization in a manner reasonably calculated to be received by such independent fiduciary within one business day from the date of such authorization; (d) The authorization referred to in this Part II(B) will be effective for a period of three business days; and (e) No more than ten days after the completion of a cross-trade transaction, the independent fiduciary authorizing the cross-trade transaction must be provided a written confirmation of the transaction and the price at which the transaction was executed; (2) A cross-trade transaction will be effected only where the transaction involves less than five percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume for the securities involved in the transaction for the week immediately preceding the authorization of the transaction. A cross-trade transaction may exceed this limit only by express authorization of independent fiduciaries on behalf of Plans affected by the transaction; and (3) The cross-trade transaction is effected at a price which is within ten percent of the closing price of the security on the day before the date on which Fidelity receives authorization by the independent Plan fiduciary to engage in the cross-trade transaction. Part III_Definitions (A) ``Account'' means an account holding assets of one or more employee benefit plans which are subject to the Act (the Plans), for which Fidelity or an affiliate of Fidelity acts as a fiduciary; (B) ``Affiliate'' means any person, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Fidelity; (C) ``Cross-trade transaction'' means a purchase and sale of securities between ERISA Accounts or between an ERISA Account and a non-ERISA account for which Fidelity or an affiliate of Fidelity acts as a trustee or investment manager; (D) ``Index Account'' means an Account for which Fidelity and the Plan sponsor or other named fiduciary have agreed that the investment of the assets in question will be designed to replicate the capitalization-weighted composition of a stock or bond index; and (E) ``Managed Account'' means an Account for which Fidelity and the Plan sponsor or other named fiduciary have agreed that the investment of the assets in question will be managed actively at the discretion of Fidelity, pursuant to written guidelines as to which types of securities to buy or sell for the Account. Written Comments: The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The comment was submitted by the applicant, Fidelity Management Trust Company. The applicant addresses two matters which are summarized as follows: (1) The applicant notes a typographical error in Part III of the proposed exemption: Within the definition of ``Cross-trade transaction'', the word ``account'' should not be capitalized. The applicant represents that, as described elsewhere in the Notice of Proposed Exemption, cross-trade transactions covered by the proposed exemption may occur between an account holding assets of one or more employee benefit plans which are subject to the Act (``Account'') and a non-ERISA account managed by the applicant or an affiliate (``account''). (2) The applicant wishes to supplement the summary of facts and representations of the notice of proposed exemption (the Summary), by clarifying and revising its explanation of the manner in which opportunities for cross-trading transactions are allocated among accounts under its management, which is found in section 10 of the Summary. The applicant represents that subsequent to the publication of the Summary, it determined that its cross-trading program will be effected pursuant to a non-discretionary pro-rata allocation system. For example, in the event that the number of shares of a particular security which an Account proposes to sell on a given day is less than the number of shares of such security which other Fidelity-advised accounts propose to buy on that date, the direct cross-trade opportunity will be allocated among potential buyers on a pro-rata basis. A similar procedure would apply where the number of shares of a particular security to be sold by Fidelity-advised accounts is less than the number of such shares which an Account and one or more other Fidelity-advised accounts proposes to buy on that date. Thus, the Accounts participating in Fidelity's cross-trade program will have opportunities to participate on a proportional basis in all cross-trade transactions during the operation of the cross-trade program. The applicant represents that this aspect of Fidelity's cross-trading program is among the information which will be disclosed in writing to the fiduciaries of the pension plans which invest in the Accounts. After careful consideration of the entire record, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as supplemented by the applicant's comment. For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on December 10, 1993 at 58 FR 64978.
