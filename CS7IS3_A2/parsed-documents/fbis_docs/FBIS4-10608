Pluspetrol executives said a well drilled in the Ramos area of Salta Province has yielded a record production of 1.5 million cubic meters per day. This is one of the most productive wells in the continent. With five wells in operation, the gas field already produces 6 million cubic meters per day, about 8 percent of the country's total gas production. The drilling required a $10 million investment. The Ramos gas field's proven reserves total 100 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8) The discovery of a large gas field by Total, a French oil company, in the Southern Basin might increase the national gas production rate 20 to 25 percent. The drilling of two wells into the Carina offshore structure, 70 km off shore Tierra del Fuego Province, has been successful, yielding between 470,000 and 485,000 cubic meters of gas per day. After the new discovery, the basin's probable reserves might range between 120 and 150 billion cubic meters. (Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 8) With the goal of curbing public spending and improving the honest and efficient use of state funds, the executive branch limited, through Decree No. 502, the ministers' powers to allocate and implement their respective appropriations. This was reported by Budget Under Secretary Marcos Makon, who explained that the decree signed by President Menem on 8 April establishes, among other measures, that the budget cannot be increased, even if there is more income, and there cannot be any reallocations unless there is a specific national executive branch decree.
