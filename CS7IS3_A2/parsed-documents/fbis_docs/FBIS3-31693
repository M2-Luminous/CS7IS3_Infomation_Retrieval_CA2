At the same time, the Council of Ministers emphasized that the draft budget, which is soon to be approved by the Sejm, cannot be changed. A complete freeze on energy price rises is also impossible. [Reporter Marek Kupis] Industry Minister Marek Pol said the government agreed with Solidarity's basic demand for an increase in real pay. He added that the strike in the mining and steel industries, announced by Solidarity, could weaken the economic position of these enterprises. [Marek Pol] "This could very strongly affect the weak economy of the mining sector. That is apart from the issue of energy security of the state. We all depend on energy; we all depend on coal. This could very strongly affect the entire Polish industry and what all employees at all enterprises are going to feel." [Kupis] Labor Minister Leszek Miller has called on the trade unionists to hold talks and halt strike actions. [Labor Minister Leszek Miller] "If the Solidarity trade unionists decide to discuss the housing reform program, social benefits, problems of unemployment, or other issues that are vital for thousands of Polish families, I can confirm again that there is an open place at the negotiating table." [Kupis] According to Public Opinion Research Center research, in September one Pole in four thought that the situation in the country was going in the right direction. In November, there were 20 percent more optimists. But in February the level of optimism fell below that of September. [Miller] "Well, the honeymoon is slowly coming to an end. I am thinking of good relations with the government and an influx of public expectations. This, as far as I remember, applies to every government team. And now the dull daily life begins." [Kupis] Ministers maintain that the government will now have to prove that the election slogans about an economic policy with a human face were not merely empty promises.
