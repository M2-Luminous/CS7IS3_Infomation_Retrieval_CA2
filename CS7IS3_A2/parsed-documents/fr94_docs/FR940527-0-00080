FR940527-0-00080 FR940527-0-00024 31. Alascom's claim that the Board must identify ``relevant, material changes of fact'' before it can ``justify radical restructuring of the Alaska telecommunications market structure, including the termination of the JSA'' is unsupported. It is well settled that an agency may take such action, ```either with or without a change in circumstances,''' 43 as long as it supplies a ```reasoned analysis' of its decision.'' 44 The Joint Board has supplied a ``reasoned analysis'' for its proposal and we adopt it as our own. Moreover, we disagree that circumstances have not changed in Alaska. This entire proceeding is a result of changes in the Alaska market: In 1972, the rate integration policy was adopted for Alaska, in 1980, Alascom and AT&T entered into the JSA, and in 1982, the Alaska market was opened to competition. Indeed, the Joint Board was formed for the express purpose of addressing the harmonization of competition in Alaska with rate integration, and the proposals it makes are consistent with that task. Thus, contrary to Alascom's claim, significant changes have occurred in the Alaska market, and Alascom's objection is without merit. 43 Center for Science v. Dept. of Treasury, 797 F.2d 995, 999 (D.C. Cir. 1986), quoting Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assoc. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). 44 Id. 32. Alascom contends that the proposed market structure ``eliminates the foundation for the frozen allocator, destroying any reasonable prospect to preserve revenue requirement neutrality.'' 45 We disagree with Alascom's arguments. First, the Board recommended retaining the frozen allocator specifically to prevent potential intrastate cost shifts that Alascom reported in its proposed implementation plan, and which Alascom estimates are worth approximately $30 million annually. Second, contrary to Alascom's claim that it will not have interstate business, after termination of the JSA, Alascom will remain free to provide interstate services independently and to supply interstate common carrier services to all other IXCs. In addition to retaining the frozen allocator, the Board recommended the continuation of the JSA during the first phase of the transition period, a $150 million payment by AT&T to Alascom to reduce Alascom's plant accounts and the AT&T must-purchase requirement to preserve revenue requirement neutrality. We are convinced that these recommendations as part of the Board's comprehensive solution will preserve revenue requirement neutrality. 45 Alascom Application for Review at 5. 33. In addition, we note that the Part 36 frozen allocator procedures apply to other IXCs, AT&T, and UUI, not just Alascom. The Docket 80&hyph;286 Joint Board retained a distance sensitive allocator for the IXCs to recognize the extent of distance sensitive circuit equipment in service for those carriers, and to avoid the substantial adverse revenue requirement impact associated with the adoption of a nondistance sensitive allocator. 46 In its Report and Order, the Commission agreed with the Docket 80&hyph;286 Joint Board's recommendation that a distance sensitive allocator, frozen at 1985 levels, be retained for use by the IXCs. 47 In addition to our concern for intrastate cost shifts, we support this Board's recommendation to leave the frozen allocator intact recognizing the broader considerations which caused it to be retained for Alascom and other IXCs in 1987 by another Joint Board. 46 Recommended Decision and Order, 2 FCC Rcd 2562&hyph;2565 (Joint Board 1987). 47 Report and Order, 2 FCC Rcd, 2639 (1987). 34. Alascom argues that universal service in the Bush is more tenuous under the Final Recommended Decision because the Board cannot assume that AT&T would be responsible for satellite service to the Bush. Alascom further contends that universal service in the Bush will be undermined because Alascom, not AT&T, is the only carrier that has constructed, launched, and operated a satellite for Alaska service. 48 Alascom's concern about AT&T's provision of service to the Bush appears disingenuous since this service is now, and remains, Alascom's responsibility. 49 The Board's recommendations do not address or otherwise reduce Alascom's current obligation to provide satellite service on a monopoly basis nor do the Board's recommendations lift the Commission prohibition against construction of earth station facilities in the Bush by companies other than Alascom. Alascom may not ignore, evade, or transfer its responsibility to provide rural Alaska satellite service without first obtaining Commission approval under Section 214 of the Communications Act to discontinue service. To approve a Section 214 request by Alascom to discontinue service, the Commission would have to find that ``neither the present or future public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected.'' Both AT&T and GCI have offered to provide service to the Bush if Alascom no longer desires to serve as the monopoly provider to the Bush. 50 However, if no other carrier was willing to assume Alascom's responsibilities to serve the Bush voluntarily, the Commission would, pursuant to Sections 1, 201, 205, and 214 of the Communications Act, require another carrier, such as AT&T, to provide service by satellite or other appropriate technology. 48 Alascom Application for Review at 9&hyph;15. 49 The Commission prohibits carriers other than Alascom from building facilities to the Bush.

The common carrier tariff rates charged by Alascom for service to the Bush must be just and reasonable and enable Alascom to recover the costs of replacing and maintaining the satellite and other equipment necessary to meet its interstate service obligation to the Bush. 50 AT&T Reply Comments, July 12, 1993, at 7; GCI Petition, RM&hyph;7246.
