The sources said senior Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), told a delegation from the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) on Friday that, "though the military had to step in for a national emergency, the military should not stay in power for a long time." "It is only natural that power be transferred to the civilian government. The SLORC is preparing democratic foundations before power transfer so that no more military intervention would be necessary in the future," Than Shwe was quoted by the sources as saying. The 46-member delegation led by Kazuo Haruna, chairman of Marubeni Corp., arrived in Yangon on Wednesday for a four-day mission to explore investment possibilities in Myanmar. SLORC Secretary Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, National Planning and Economic Development Minister Brig. Gen. David Abel and Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw separately briefed the delegation Thursday on Myanmar's political, economic and foreign relations situations. The delegation will be briefed by other ministers on various sectors of economy in the country later in the day, and it will visit industrial sites and a new port site near Yangon on Saturday before returning to Tokyo the same evening. Myanmar's military seized power in a coup in September 1988 and established the SLORC. In May 1990 national elections the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory, but the military junta has refused to hand over power. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been under house arrest in Yangon since July 1989.
