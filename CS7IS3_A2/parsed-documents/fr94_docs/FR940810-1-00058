FR940810-1-00058 FR940810-1-00010 (4) The Department of Mineral Resources has jurisdiction over the mining of minerals, and oil and gas under Title 27 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. One of the functions of that Department is the prevention and elimination of hazardous dust conditions. A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;128. Violation of orders of state mine inspectors respecting dust prevention and control is a misdemeanor. (5) Roads leading into waste dump areas and tailing areas from inhabited or public areas are required to be blocked off and warning signs posted on the perimeter of such areas. A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;317. (6) The primary responsibility for the control and abatement of air pollution rests with the Arizona Department of Health Services and its Hearing Board. The Department is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of air pollution emission standards and ambient air quality standards as a part of a comprehensive air quality plan for Arizona. A.R.S. Title 49. (7) The Arizona Department of Water Resources has jurisdiction over State water, including ``surface waters.'' ``Surface waters'' means ``the waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels, or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, flood, waste or surplus water, and of lakes, ponds, and springs on the surface. For the purposes of administering this title surface water is deemed to include Central Arizona Project water.'' A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;101. It is a misdemeanor to knowingly use the water of another, or divert water from a stream, waste water or obstruct water flowing into a water work. A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;112. Possession of water lawfully denied to the possessor is prima facie evidence of one's guilt. A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;112. If water is to be used for mining purposes, the water rights may be severed from the land rights and transferred separately. The separation and transference of water rights are subject to numerous limitations, A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;172. (8) Dams are defined as ``any artificial barrier, including appurtenenant works for the impounding or diversion of water except those barriers for the purpose of controlling liquid borne material, twenty-five or more in height or the storage capacity of which will be more than fifty acre feet, but does not include any such barrier which is or will be less than six feet in height, regardless of storage capacity, or which has or will have a storage capacity not in excess of fifteen acre feet, regardless of height.'' A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;701. The construction, operation, repair or alteration of any dam without the prior approval of the Director of Water Resources is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section 45&hyph;702 to Section 45&hyph;716. In accordance with 30 CFR Part 736, OSM has tentatively identified the following statutes and regulations as which, in certain circumstances, interfere with achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and the Federal program. Accordingly, OSM proposes to preempt them to the extent they relate to surface coal mining and reclamation operations subject to regulation under SMCRA. Section 903.700(f) of the proposed Federal program for Arizona lists the Arizona statutes and regulations which OSM has tentatively identified as interfering with the achievement of the purposes of SMCRA. The list set forth below is based on the list published on October 6, 1982 (47 FR 44194), and may need to be updated in a final rule adopting an Arizona Federal program. Those less stringent Arizona statutes and regulations are: (1) Arizona Open Pits Mining Statute, A.R.S. Section 27&hyph;421 to Section 27&hyph;425. (2) Arizona Administrative Code Rules 11&hyph;1&hyph;1301 through 11&hyph;1&hyph;1315. Thus, OSM proposes that the Arizona statutes and regulations described above be followed only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the regulation of coal exploration, surface coal mining operations, or the reclamation of surface coal mined lands in the State of Arizona pursuant to the proposed Federal regulations. Comment is invited on whether the Arizona laws identified in Section 903.700(e) of the proposed Federal Program accurately reflect more stringent Arizona environmental controls which adequately modify the permanent program for application to Arizona so as to take into consideration the nature of the State's relevant physical conditions. Comment is similarly invited on whether the Arizona laws identified in Section 903.700(f) of the proposed Federal Program would interfere in certain circumstances with achievement of the purposes of SMCRA and the Federal program. Comment is also invited concerning any other Arizona laws and regulations which establish more stringent or less stringent land use and environmental controls than SMCRA, which may not be included in this proposed rule, or which may have been revised or adopted since 1982.
