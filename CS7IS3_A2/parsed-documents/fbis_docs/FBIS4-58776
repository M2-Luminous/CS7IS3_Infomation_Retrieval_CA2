But permanent delegates at the Cairo-based organisation called on its secretary general, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to pursue efforts to end the conflict which erupted on Thursday. A diplomatic source said the League decided to abstain on the Egyptian proposal after it had been turned down by the north. Senior southern leader 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali had said earlier the south could favour Egyptian proposals to send a peacekeeping force. He said the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) led by Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid "supported all measures by the Arab League," after meeting with 'Abd-al-Majid. And he added that if the "situation is necessary and if it is imperative in order to stop the fighting" then the YSP was in favour of sending a peacekeeping force "even if northern leaders reject it." Foreign Minister Muhammad Salih Basindwa earlier opposed the emergency meeting in Cairo, insisting the three days of intense fighting in Yemen was an "internal affair." 'Abd-al-Majid told journalists after the meeting behind closed doors that the Arab countries had charged him with "continuing efforts to stop the fighting immediately." They also repeated their support for Yemen, where fighting erupted Thursday between rival forces from the former North and South Yemen which were unified in May 1990. The proposal put forward by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa needed the backing of both the Arab League and Yemen.
