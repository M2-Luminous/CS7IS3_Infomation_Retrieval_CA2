The ROSSIISKIE VESTI Newspaper features a commentary on these speeches headlined "to find reasonable correlation between speed of reforms and real social price for it." "Let us put it bluntly: the government does not suggest any backtrack from the previous policy," the newspaper stresses. "The strategic course for creating an effective market economy must be preserved, but the task of cutting social price for reforms moves to the foreground at this stage." At the same time, the newspaper criticises the federal budget of the Finance Ministry, which was approved, in principle, by a meeting of the government, expressing doubts at "feasibility" of some of its indicators for 1994. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes in the same vein, noting that the budget was adopted with "a black hole." The newspaper's commentary claims that "the pumping of worthless money into the economy will not check the slump (of production). It will only destroy the consumer market which has just emerged. Then, there will be the only way out -- a state of emergency. This way of developments is not the worst one." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries a summary of the above speeches under the headline "President's State of the Nation Message to Russian Parliament is Platform for Accord." It singles out Yeltsin's words that, following the message, "long-awaited outlines of a general approach to tackling economic problems" start emerging and that consequences of the political amnesty adopted by the lower chamber of parliament on ringleaders of abortive coups in August 1991 and October 1993 are fraught with the danger of new confrontation. A commentary on the amnesty written by A. Golts and published by the same newspaper claims that the release of the Lefortovo prison inmates "is no threat to political stability." Giving a summary of the president's and premier's speeches, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper stresses that "Viktor Chernomyrdin's report absorbed the best economic goals." But it is not quite clear, the newspaper adds, whether the present government can realise them. A series of extracts from Yeltsin's speech published by the newspaper starts with the following words: "I fully understand how contraversial the decision (on political amnesty) taken by the lower house is and how hastily it was carried out." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA (opposition newspaper) gives a digest of +the report on social and economic situation in Russia compiled by the Russian Statistics Committee, which was circulated in the Kremlin among participants in the enlarged meeting of the government. Its data on the continued slump of the Gross Domestic Product in Russia are described with one word "evalanche." The PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnian Serbs and vice-president of the Union of Serb Writers. Russia's initiative to settle the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, he says, "helped to overcome confrontation with NATO, and Russia, I believe, entered, thanks to this, the world political arena as an independent force which should be reckoned with." "We experience an unusual inthusiasm and gratitude for what Russia has done for Serbia," he added. The trud newspaper features the last part of the memoirs by former commander of the Soviet Navy Nikolai Kuznetsov who personally knew Stalin, under the headline "Stalin's Death." The PRAVDA newspaper prints a photograph from the front cover of the West German Magazine SPIEGEL with the inscription "Stalin's Second Death," depicting him together with Vladimir Lenin inside the mausoleum (magazine's correspondent used a hidden photo camera to take a snapshot). KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Deputy Prosecutor- General Vladimir Kravtsov, saying that he "has no doubts about guilt of Khasbulatov, Rutskoy and their aides." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA devotes an article to the world's first cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin who would have turned 60 on March 9.
