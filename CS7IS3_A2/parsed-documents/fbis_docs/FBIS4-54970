Here he, among others, singled out the Law on Compensation of Injustices, whose financial consequences will amount to several tens of millions of German marks. This law has been put into parliamentary procedure by the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS]. For this reason our reporter Marjan Rogelj asked Janez Podobnik from the SLS for an explanation, while he asked Janez Kopac how the funds would be secured if the law, which has already been passed in the first reading, will also be implemented: [Begin recording] [Podobnik] The Law on Compensation of Injustices should have been passed already. It is incredible that Slovenia is finally getting this law after four years of diplomacy. As regards the procedure, I think that if the law is passed before the parliamentary summer recess, a special government working commission will be formed on the basis of the law and by the time it is activated and receives its first claims, I am convinced that even if the law is passed this year, it will in no way burden the 1994 budget. I would like to stress once again that we have already compiled a thorough calculation. Namely, during the first reading the State Chamber ordered us that we must specify the exact total amount of the funds and the sources of these funds by the second hearing. [Kopac] Well, the options are either to cut all other budgetary obligations for this amount, increase the budget deficit, or impose new taxes. There simply is no other way. I would add here that I find the reduction of other budgetary obligations for this amount unrealistic, as we suffer an acute budget crisis anyway. Any increase in debts would be bad for all of us and introduction of new taxes is not terribly popular either. [end recording]
