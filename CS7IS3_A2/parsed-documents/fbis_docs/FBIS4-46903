The conference was opened and chaired by President M.Sh. Shaymiyev. F.R. Gazizullin, deputy prime minister and chairman of the Committee for State Property, noted in his presentation that the Russian program of mass check-based privatization is nearing completion. Out of 3.840 million Russian vouchers distributed to the population of our republic, about 2.5 million have been used. During the time remaining until 30 June, it is necessary to gather from the population the remaining vouchers to be canceled and turned in to the National Bank. With a view to accelerating the emergence of a market economy and ensuring the extensive and involved participation of citizens in the process, it is necessary to vigorously use check investment funds, ensure the exchange of vouchers into the shares of privatized enterprises, and put the chain of stock outlets to extensive use. We should also hold auctions to sell real estate for tender, including Russian vouchers, speed up the conduct of subscriptions to the stock of highly profitable enterprises for citizens who do not take part in production activities, and issue stock in the process of converting enterprises, including municipal, into joint-stock companies. Touching on the distribution of unclaimed vouchers, F.R. Gazizullin proposed to distribute them among the least protected categories of the population--orphaned children, Categories I and II handicapped, and families with many children. Special attention was paid in the presentation to the registered privatization deposits (IPV) of the republic. In keeping with a presidential edict, on the whole, the IPV's will be distributed on a priority basis to the least protected strata of the population--handicapped war veterans, Categories I and II handicapped, the families of servicemen who perished, families with many children, and retirees over 65 years old. Issuing them the stock of the most prestigious enterprises has already begun. The task was set to complete this work before 1 June. Between 1 June and 1 September, the IPV's should be traded in for the shares of prestigious enterprises by all retirees. Between 1 September and 1 December, the IPV's for organizations financed from the budget should be used, and, from 1 December on, the remaining shares will be sold at the nominal price to all categories of the population. In the process, the members of labor collectives shall use their IPV's in keeping with privatization plans and regardless of the above deadlines. Moving on to the problems of small-scale privatization, F.R. Gazizullin noted that registered deposits may be used for up to 90 percent of the sale price of a facility in the case of trade sector, public catering, and consumer service enterprises. By now, 430 such enterprises have been privatized. In a number of rayons (Bavlinskiy, Zainskiy, Zelenodolskiy, and Leninogorskiy), the level of small-scale privatization comes to between 70 and 90 percent. However, in many rayons, this important state endeavor has been left to its own devices, or worse yet is restricted, especially by trade administrations and associations. Unfortunately, the heads of administrations of individual cities and rayons and chiefs of ministries and departments have taken a wait-and-see attitude. With a view to laying a strong foundation for the completion of small-scale privatization in 1994, it is necessary to immediately break up and eliminate the existing trade administrations, trusts, and associations. It is important to sell facilities through competitions (especially investment competitions), to keep the selection of products, their assortment, physical volume, sales, and so on, and tap as much as possible the "hot" money held by entrepreneurial structures, that is, implement privatization at a fee. In keeping with the State Program of Privatization, enterprises of the trade sector, consumer services, and public catering located in the downtown and other prestigious zones of cities must be sold primarily at auctions. F.R. Gazizullin noted that, with a view to avoiding violations of the law, upholding the legality of privatization, and protecting the interests of citizens and the labor collectives, all privatization documents must be drawn up in keeping with established rules, signed by the chairman of the city or rayon committee for the management of municipal property, and verified by the Committee for the Management of State Property, with a relevant certificate being issued and the act of purchase and sale being recorded in the state register of Tatarstan. The conference heard a report by Minister of Finance D.N. Nagumanov about the status and priority measures to stabilize the financial situation in the republic. He said that all our troubles are associated with the nonpayment crisis that has broken out in the entire Russian Federation. Our main sector--the oil sector--is going through a difficult time. Oil-refining enterprises of Russia owe the Tatneft more than R400 billion. The financial situation is being exacerbated by the continuing slump in production. However, even under such circumstances, a lot depends on the standard of organizational efforts, inquiry, and overcoming stereotypical thinking. There are, after all, enterprises that have good economic indicators. These are the associations Teplokontrol, Elekon, and Tatkhimfarmpreparaty. D.N. Nagumanov stressed that, in the environment of transition to a market economy, the state should support enterprises that manufacture easily salable and tax-intensive products, which are in demand on the market. At present, these are mostly the goods produced by the light and food industries. The extensive implementation of the circulation of bills of exchange and guaranteed backing for the bills are another important problem. Sharp criticism was leveled in the presentation against the managers of a number of enterprises and heads of administrations who have substantially increased the administrative and management staff, are carried away by the acquisition of high-priced equipment and passenger cars, and overstate wages and various forms of financial remuneration. The chiefs of housing and municipal facilities, health care, and the association Tatenergo drew criticism in conjunction with this. The minister has called for the strictest possible economies and thrift. Strict accounting and monitoring of the expenditure of funds and material resources should be organized. Dwelling on the issues of mutual budgetary relations with Russia, D.N. Nagumanov said that they have been completely settled at all levels and now there are no obstacles to engaging in independent financial and credit activities. Everything depends on the involvement of the republic heads of ministries, departments, enterprises, and organizations. Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs F.S. Sibagatullin devoted his presentation to the state of affairs in the republic agroindustrial complex and the tasks of its future development. He outlined the results of the work of cattle breeders during the [first] four months and dwelled on the task of an organized transition to the summer pasture management of public-sector cattle. The wintering of cattle was not easy. A slump in the procurement of animal husbandry products was allowed to occur on some republic farms despite an adequate supply of fodder, perhaps because of the poor quality of fodder. Added to these were organizational shortcomings, and, in some places,. the irresponsibility of the chiefs of farms and specialists. The herd of cattle is diminishing because of the less intensive efforts to reproduce it. It is necessary to restore the herd, to reduce the intrafarm consumption of animal husbandry products, and to increase meat and milk procurement from the population. Planting in the republic is coming to an end at an optimal time; the quality of planting is good. However, in view of the fact that less mineral fertilizer has now been applied, as compared to last year, a considerable volume of crop cultivation work has yet to be done, and a set of measures has to be taken to protect the plants against pests, disease, and weeds. F.S. Sibagatullin proceeded to touch on the issues of procuring cattle fodder and repairing fodder and grain-harvesting machinery. It is necessary to reduce the scrapping of machinery to a minimum. As far as reforms in agricultural production are concerned, the Edict of the President "On Procedures for the Transformation of Kolkhozes and Sovkhozes and Privatization of State Enterprises and Organizations of the Agroindustrial Complex of the Republic of Tatarstan" is the legal foundation in this matter. Collective enterprises, partnerships, joint-stock companies, agricultural cooperatives, and peasant farms and associations that have already appeared in our republic have convincingly proved, through the results of their work, their advantages over the obsolete forms of economic operations. By now, 200 kolkhozes and sovkhozes have already been transformed, and 300 farms have been prepared for this. Further on, the presenter dwelled on the issues of providing credit and monetary support to rural areas, putting the use of the bills of exchange in order, granting relief to the rural producers of goods, regulating procurement prices for the products of crop farming and animal husbandry, and reforming the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs and its local subdivisions. Chairman of the National Bank Ye.B. Bogachev covered the status of the republic banking and finance-and-credit systems and priority tasks in stabilizing the situation in this area. In summing up the results of the conference, President M.Sh. Shaymiyev described the republic sociopolitical situation. The leadership of Tatarstan and local government organs operate harmoniously and jointly; there is complete understanding between them, stressed M.Sh. Shaymiyev. Referring to the historic significance of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan, the president noted that the conviction that it was signed at the proper time grows with every passing day. A recent meeting with the president of Chuvashia who stated that the path traveled by Tatarstan is correct and commands great respect also testifies to this. Dwelling on economic problems, M.Sh. Shaymiyev noted that the economic and cadre potential in our republic makes it possible to overcome the hardships of the period of transition rapidly. The republic leadership is working on a detailed program for further socioeconomic development. In conjunction with this, he called on participants in the conference to approach the fulfillment of the state privatization program with a full measure of responsibility. Among priority tasks, the president mentioned the acceleration of settlements with kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and enterprises of the agroindustrial complex for delivered products, stabilization of remunerations payments to employees of institutions and organizations financed from the budget, hiring of individuals for management positions on a contractual basis, changes in the taxation system, and restoration of order in the operation of off-budget funds. Touching on the issue of herds of cattle kept on the personal lots of rural residents, M.Sh. Shaymiyev stressed that their reduction cannot be allowed to occur under any circumstances. It is necessary to provide all possible incentives for the growth of the herd of cattle and procure milk and meat from the population at fixed rates. In his presentation, the president paid much attention to the issues of renewal in local self-government. The 50th anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet people over fascism is drawing closer, said M.Sh. Shaymiyev in summation. This is an unforgettable date, which is particularly dear to all of us. It is necessary to begin preparations for the 50th anniversary right away, without delay, so that every resident of Tatarstan, whether young or old, may feel the greatness of this victory with his soul and heart and develop respect for those who protected the honor and independence of their Motherland at the price of incredible efforts, self-sacrificing labor, and life itself. Chairman of the Supreme Soviet F.Kh. Mukhametshin, Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov, and Vice President V.N. Likhachev took part in the conference proceedings.
