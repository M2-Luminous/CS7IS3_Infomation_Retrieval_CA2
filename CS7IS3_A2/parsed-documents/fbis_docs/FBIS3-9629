[passage omitted] The government discussed and approved a draft amendment to the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] law on the organization of ministries and other central bodies of state administration of the Slovak Republic. As Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko told a news conference after the government meeting, the law addresses the issue of ending the provisional arrangement and legal vacuum that arose after the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic. The government will submit the draft amendment to the current meeting of parliament. Under the amendment, the government can determine in justified cases that two state secretaries will operate at a ministry. The minister will determine in which order they will stand in for him. The Government Office of the Slovak Republic is being deleted from the system of other central bodies of state administration [under the amendment] because it will only fulfill tasks for the government's needs. The Labor Safety Office of the Slovak Republic, on the other hand, is being added to the central bodies of state administration. The government yesterday appointed Jan Filko, LL.D., to head the Government Office. Until now, Filko has been deputy chairman of the Slovak Government's Legislative Council. [passage omitted] The government took note of a report on basic trends in the development of the national economy of the Slovak Republic in 1993 and their forecast for the first half of 1994. The report notes that state budget expenditures went up as a result of the establishment of the new state and in connection with safeguarding its operation. The higher expenditures have been reflected in an increase of the budget deficit to 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] [in 1993]. It is expected that, in the first half of 1994, a trend of recovery will start making itself felt in the material-production branches. The volume of gross domestic product in steady prices is therefore expected to drop by only 0.6 percent. The rate of unemployment will increase to 16.5 percent, which means 420,000 registered unemployed. The rate of inflation will reach 17.4 percent, and average monthly wages will go up to Sk5,700, which would be a 15.2-percent increase over the first half of 1993 but a 1.9-percent decline in real terms. [passage omitted] Yesterday the government appointed Pavol Nunuk, LL.D., to the post of chief border commissioner of the Slovak Republic and Colonel Miroslav Hyres, LL.D., and Colonel Mikulas Salak, LL.D., to the posts of deputy chief border commissioners of the Slovak Republic. Furthermore, it approved the following proposals for the appointment as state secretaries: Ministry of Justice--Sergej Kohut, LL.D.; Ministry of Culture--Marina Jurickova, M.A.; Ministry of Environment--Lubomira Zimanova, LL.D.; Ministry for the Administration and Privatization of National Property--Gabriel Palacka, doctor of natural sciences; and Ministry of Agriculture--Engineer Stefan Palacka. It also approved proposals for the appointment of heads of ministerial offices: Ministry of Defense--Colonel of the General Staff Engineer Rudolf Zidek; Ministry of Transportation, Communications, and Public Works--Engineer Peter Klucka; Ministry of Economy--Engineer Jaroslav Kubecka; Ministry of Environment--Engineer Magdalena Vodzinska; and Ministry of Agriculture--Engineer Jan Straka. The government approved the proposal to appoint Marian Jusko vice governor of the Slovak National Bank. It will submit this proposal to the NRSR chairman for further constitutional discussion. Yesterday's news conference was moderated by Lubomir Lintner, who has been newly appointed as director of the Slovak Government Office's Press and Information Department.
