He said that if the case is confirmed, it will be the duty of the persons concerned to give explanations. [Begin recording] [Chuan] According to the information received on past events, the issue is connected with what happened several years ago. An American was arrested on a charge of narcotics trafficking. The suspect confessed and said that he bought the drugs from Thais. [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean he referred to Thais? [Chuan] He referred to Thais. The U.S. narcotics suppression authorities requested our Office of Narcotics Control Board [ONCB] to check the assets of those Thais. Therefore, I assume this issue would be in consequence with the said incident. Now, we have to wait for additional information or report that the United States will provide for us. As of now, nothing has been confirmed nor denied. [Reporter] Did the American suspect give the names? [Chuan] Yes, he gave the names. [Reporter] One name or many? [Chuan] Thai names were stated. I think more than one, but I am not sure how many. The suspect also said the operations had been carried out for many years. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Chuan] Nothing. No charges have been clearly stated yet. It is the event in the United States, and no clear details have been sent to us. We have only known from news reports. [Reporter] But now the Thai Parliament [words indistinct]. [Chuan] We must follow up on it. If it involves individuals or there is any confirmation, then it will be the duty of those persons involved to give explanations. [Reporter] What has the ONCB been authorized to do, because this matter also affectes the image of Thailand? [Chuan] The ONCB is following up on it to get more information. Right now we cannot give any more details than what we have received. [end recording]
