Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko heard out the first question as a guest. But nowadays he gets up onto the platform as governor of that huge and "remote region, which is nevertheless our own" and proposes removing the question of a "separate" republic from the agenda. Now, and forever more! Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko begins our conversation in an unexpectedly abrupt manner. [Nazdratenko] I am categorically against splintering Russia into tiny principalities. And you know, I am not a stray "commie." It is painful to stand by and watch as people pilfer Russia bit by bit, instead of living in a united country, a single economic area, under one authority and one president. The idea of sovereignties may well be high-minded, tempting, and sweet, but there is nothing behind it once you begin to consider not your own ambitions but the people who have entrusted you with power. So what exactly is today's Maritime Kray? Is it Russia's eastern gate, its outpost on the Pacific coast, as it is commonly described? No, it is first and foremost an enormous territory lorded over for many long years by government departments; and now we are being forced to disentangle the results of their specific style of management. The first of these results is plain for all to see: in our region, a loaf of bread costs 1,000 rubles [R]. The average wage in the kray is R80,000. Don't look so surprised: Living standards in the Far East have always been lower than the average for the country. And now we are divided by a veritable abyss. The same loaf of bread costs R100 in Altay. Because they have their own grain there, whereas our environmental conditions are completely different. We have to import everything. As long as we have to import, for instance, grain, it is becoming so expensive that, but for subsidies, a loaf of bread would cost around R7,000 in the stores. This is the most serious question which we are trying to resolve today. I can see how this can be done, but I hear warnings from all sides: Whatever you do, do not get it into your head to buy grain abroad! By doing that you will destroy national grain producers! I agree that it is essential to support our own producers. And when we were getting grain for R250,000 a tonne, we did just that. But "our boys" do not think about us! Railroad companies are again increasing charges for freight shipment, and the price of a tonne of grain has soared right up to R400,000! So it was that we decided to construct a terminal at one of the ports and take delivery of Canadian hard wheat -- 6 million tonnes per year. Right away we were able to breathe more easily, because the imported wheat is a quarter of the cost. Moreover it is better quality than ours. The scraps from the grain milling industry can be used to make mixed feed to support livestock in the region. We have to survive. Unfortunately, the interests of the state are often at odds with the interests of the region. [Rostarchuk] Maritime Kray has sufficient nuclear reserves to last 20-25 years. Five-meter high thickets of rushes are growing in waste water tanks. What does this indicate? Abnormal radiation levels, and a polluted environment. There are villages along the coast where it is no longer possible to live. For humanitarian reasons alone, people have to be removed from there and given a chance to settle elsewhere. But where? Where is that coveted paradise where people can expect work and lodgings? There is no such place in Maritime Kray. [Nazdratenko] And it is in precisely this horrific ecological situation that people are starting to talk about a nuclear power station. I want none of it! Every fiber of my being opposes it. On the other hand, how can we extricate ourselves from the power crisis which erupted this winter across the entire Far East? In Magadan Oblast an entire city was iced up. We saw that tragedy with our own eyes: The Far East Shipping Company had to evacuate the inhabitants. We ourselves missed the worst of it, thank God, although we came close to the brink. Everything went into providing heat -- all budget funds went into this. Coal was brought into the region at any cost. Its price hit R115,000 a tonne. Just imagine how much went up in smoke, in the literal sense of the word: We burned money. Money which should have gone to the people, in the form of wages or to develop the budget-financed sphere. In order to resolve the question of power supplies in Maritime Kray, it is essential to complete the construction of the Ussuriysk TETs [heat and electric power station]. To feed it we will expand the Rettikhovka, Pavlovka, and Luchegorsk coalfields. But it will take 20 years to do all the work. Of course, it will be completely impossible to manage without state help. And it is not very nice, believe me, to have to go cap in hand to somebody. But you know, we are only trying to "finagle" what is Maritime Kray's due. The abundance of energy generated by the Siberian GES [hydroelectric power station] cascade -- built, incidentally, by the whole country -- should cost R9 per kilowatt-hour. But they take R230 from Kamchatka. And a little less from Sakhalin -- R170. We have long tried to draw the government's attention to this problem, and at last we have forged a decree on stabilizing the kray economy. We now pay R40 per kilowatt-hour.... But this is not the solution. I believe that average rates for the whole of the Russian Federation territory should be adopted. [Rostarchuk] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, there is a nuance here.... Is it really the case that your ports process cargoes for Maritime Kray as such? No, these are cargoes for the whole of Russia. Maritime Kray comprises the major warehouse center for all Russia's regions. Is that not so? Some people are suggesting that you exploit the fact by levying a quit rent on anybody who uses your "gateway" and your land and use it to top up the local budget. [Nazdratenko] But they must understand how this "local initiative" will turn out for other regions! In my view, it is better to impose order through civilized methods. And such methods do exist. Only, it is essential for the "upper echelons" to understand that the Far East has its own specifics and that what suits others does not necessarily suit it. You have to cross 12,000 km by rail to reach us, and this landscape is by no means the same type of landscape as that between Moscow and Ryazan. It is vital to realize that, when airlines inflate ticket prices to R400,000 one-way, they are cutting Maritime Kray off from Russia. You try flying west to see your relatives or sending an expert there on a business trip! An intercity telephone link is an unthinkable luxury even for an enterprise, never mind an elderly grandmother stranded in Maritime Kray with no relatives! All these things seem minor, but it is these things which shape an individual's life, and they affect his mood and his well-being. My fellow countrymen are feeling increasingly alienated from the main part of Russia, and that was not the case before. But when I start talking about uniform rates for electricity, about preferential prices for air tickets and freight carriage, people instantly begin suspecting me of anti-market inclinations. But you know, many people are aware that at the end of the 1980's I fought for flotation, I was one of the first to set up an enterprise with a non-state form of ownership -- a mining enterprise in Dalnegorsk. I am not against reform. But who needs to float a "dead" industry? If subscribing for shares entails a 30- or 40-percent cut in the workforce, and people in that particular one-horse village or city have nowhere else to work, then, tell me, why bother floating it? [Rostarchuk] Obviously, the heart of an industrialist still beats within you, and you are looking at Maritime Kray as a huge economic structure.... [Nazdratenko] Of course, I am concerned about production and I am trying in every possible way to maintain it.... The Law on Bankruptcy is completely incomprehensible to me. Take the "Zvezda" Plant -- a candidate for "mothballing".... The aviation plant in Arsenyev is barely breathing. They work for the Ministry of Defense; they fulfill its orders. But nobody is in any hurry to cover their production costs or the pay for people's labor. The same picture can be found at many enterprises. They operate at a loss purely because they are owed enormous sums of money. So pay them! Then they in turn can pay all their taxes, settle outstanding debts for electricity, and everything will take its course. The only way out of all this turmoil of ours is authority within the country. It is wrong to expect the economy itself to "impose order"; production units are grinding to a halt one after the other. I make no secret of my liking for Chernomyrdin, as it seems to me that he is the only person capable of leading the government now. There is no point in our being afraid of a regulated economy. It may well be worth fixing prices for energy sources, at any rate. This is not a return to old ways, but a necessity of the transition period. [Rostarchuk] Nevertheless, Maritime Kray is unlikely to sit back and wait for charity from Moscow.... [Nazdratenko] ...and "scramble out of the mess" ourselves? Right. We have started to work out a concept for the status and the development of the Maritime Kray. I am sure that this will be a "practicable" document. Experts from the Far East Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences are working on it. Whatever we devise, this is how we will live. The buck will not be passed to anybody else -- were we to embark on the wrong road, that is. Our region has many problems in common with Kamchatka, Magadan Oblast, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk. The Russian czar knew what he was doing when he unified these territories. And we have to unite. We must integrate, otherwise we will "end our days" having sold off our resources for a song just to put food on our tables. [Rostarchuk] But is it really such a bad thing that foreign investments are now actively heading for the Far East? [Nazdratenko] Not at all! I am very much in favor of developing cooperation. Nevertheless I prefer to do this on a legal basis, and the juridical side of this matter has still to be elaborated even now.... In this sense we have a lot of work to do and we have a lot of potential. For all that, it seems to me that what is important now is that we turn not so much toward the east as toward the west. We yearn for Moscow, and we yearn to share the life of our country. And the fact that 76 percent of Maritime Kray inhabitants voted for the Russian Constitution proves that they are putting up with the current problems patiently, remaining loyal to their country and hoping that things will change for the better.
