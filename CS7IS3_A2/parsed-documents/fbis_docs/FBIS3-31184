In its statement given to CTK today, the ministry reiterated its opinion that any external military intervention alone could not produce settlement of the situation unless all the three feuding parties display will and ability to reach agreement. The ministry said it believed that the warring parties would withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo's surroundings within the 10-day deadline given them by the NATO Council, and that they would show real political will not only to introduce an effective cease- fire, but to find an acceptable way out of the crisis as well. The ministry said it believed that the previous resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council provided a sufficient legal basis for aerial attacks under conditions set by the United Nations earlier.
