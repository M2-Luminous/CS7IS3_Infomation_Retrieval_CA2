They said the assailants opened fire with automatic weapons on Officer Mahmud Ahmad as he left a mosque, adding that three civilians who were also leaving the building were hit as well. Police launched a search of the area but the gunmen managed to flee. The Asyut region, located 900 kilometers (600 miles) south of Cairo, has been the scene of frequent confrontations between security forces and Moslem militants seeking to overthrow the secular government of President Husni Mubarak. According to an unofficial toll compiled by AFP from police sources, 297 people have been killed in the clashes -- including 108 policemen and 95 fundamentalists -- since the unrest erupted in March 1992.
