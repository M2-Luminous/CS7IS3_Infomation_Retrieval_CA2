FR941026-0-00020 FR941026-0-00007 4. In most cases, work will be allowed to proceed on the basis of verbal approval and a commitment for written follow-up. 5. The Division of Reclamation has developed, and is using, an emergency reclamation contracting system that expedites the securing of abatement work. e. The accounting system to be used by the Division of Reclamation for the emergency program projects will be the same as currently utilized for all other AML reclamation projects. Emergency program accounting will be on a project basis. All emergency project obligations, payments and drawdowns will be tracked individually and separately and will be done in accord with Federal requirements. f. The Division of Reclamation has expertise in the disciplines necessary to implement the emergency program. Staff engineers have a great deal of experience in reclamation designs for all types of problems anticipated to be encountered in the emergency program. These may include, but are not limited to: filling and/or sealing mine openings or subsidence, monitoring, grouting under or stabilizing ground affected by area subsidence or slides, refuse fires, roadway failures, and flooding due to clogged streams. The Emergency Program Coordinator will specialize in correction of emergency events and will be the lead staff person with support from the expertise of other Division of Reclamation specialists. Technical consultation will be available to staff from OSM, U.S. Bureau of Mines, consultants, and the Indiana Division of Engineering among others. Technical capability to supervise emergency work is the same as the Division of Reclamation's project managers currently use to perform on-site supervision and inspection of other AML projects. Procedures for field supervision will evolve as Indiana's experience in emergency reclamation grows. However, the existing field operations manual provides an excellent starting point of all emergency reclamation supervision. 5. A general description, derived from available data, of emergency reclamation activities to be conducted, including known or suspected geographical areas within the State, including: a. The OSM has been conducting emergency reclamation for almost twelve years in the State of Indiana. There have been approximately 190 emergency investigations, with 85 declared or given emergency status. The majority of all emergency projects have been related to subsidence (71), while shaft openings (9), slides (4), and refuse fires (1) account for the balance of declared emergencies. The distribution by county of both emergency projects and investigations has been documented. b. Emergencies related to subsidence have been primarily the result of small pit type subsidence. This subsidence is customarily associated with shallow underground mining. The potential for future emergency reclamation due to subsidence is very large and widespread in the Indiana coal fields. 6. Narrative description which supports the State's position that the procedures, personnel and other proposed aspects of its program give evidence of its abilities to promptly and effectively mitigate the full range of anticipated emergency conditions: The objectives of the Indiana abandoned mine land program are to fulfill the general reclamation objectives set out in Section 403 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. The highest priorities of the program are the protection of public health, safety and general welfare from dangers resulting from the adverse effects of past coal mining. The emergency response program described in this document provides an additional means whereby the State of Indiana will be able to protect its citizens from these adverse effects consistent with the intent of Section 410 of P.L. 95&hyph;87. Indiana has the procedures, personnel, and administrative functions within the Department of Natural Resources to capably and effectively manage the emergency program as described in the previous sections, and is willing and able to work with OSM to insure its success. An additional objective of the State of Indiana in assuming the administration of the emergency program from OSM is to provide continued protection to the citizens of this state. The State of Indiana must secure cooperation from OSM in providing prompt emergency declaration as well as complete and adequate grant funding to carry out the work. In accordance with section 405 of SMCRA, OSM finds that Indiana submitted an amendment to its AMLR plan, subsequently revised and clarified, and it has been determined, pursuant to 30 CFR 884.15, that:
