Alain Juppe met Bill Clinton this afternoon, and will be in Geneva tomorrow for the meeting between the American, Russian, and European foreign ministers. Having said yesterday that the French UN soldiers would not spend another winter in Bosnia, Juppe today said that he believed dialogue could still overcome the violence. He was speaking to our Washington correspondent, Philippe Reltien: [Begin Juppe recording] I hope that for the first time, the great powers concerned with finding a solution to the crisis in Bosnia will be able to speak with one voice. Which voice will that be? It is still too early to say at present, but it appears that an agreement is being drawn out along the following lines: an urgent appeal to the warring parties for a cease-fire, and a general and immediate cessation of hostilities across the whole of Bosnia for several months. Secondly, it must be repeated that Bosnia is an independent state within its borders, and it is a member of the United Nations. Thirdly, it must be noted that within Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are several communities which want to have the power to administer themselves, and in fact the Croat-Muslim accord is proof of this. Finally, we would like to have certain indications as to the distribution of territories between these different communities. I have the impression when I read the correspondence we have received on this subject from both the Russians and the Americans that the limits set out in the European Union action plan -- that is 51 percent for the Croats and the Muslims on one side, and 49 percent for the Serbs - could form the basis of an accord. I certainly hope so. [end recording]
