"I've never heard that before," a senior mainland cadre involved with Hong Kong affairs said. Another left-winger who was involved in the 1967 riots said he had been told "internally" that "we must stop the military confrontation with the British colonial authorities". "We understand that the order came from Chairman Mao Zedong and premier Zhou Enlai at that time. But I don't think that has been mentioned in official media," he recalled. Mr. Lu said in his speech yesterday: "Back in 1967, it was Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'Gang of Four' sending troops to Hong Kong."
