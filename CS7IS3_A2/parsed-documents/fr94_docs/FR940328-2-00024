FR940328-2-00024 FR940328-2-00013 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement to National Academy of Sciences AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(6), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) and 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) under Cooperative Agreement number DE&hyph;FC01&hyph;94EW54069. The Department of Energy will provide the $14,291,140 total estimated funding necessary for the cooperative agreement. This funding will allow the NAS to continue, as well as expand, its current research program focused on environmental restoration and waste management. The major thrust of this project will be to apply the best available science to nuclear waste issues, in an effort to promote reasoned and reasonable strategies for nuclear waste handling the disposal. This approach will also enable the nation to entertain a healthy and constructive debate on nuclear waste issues by broadening the debate to include the general public, rather than just specific polarized special interest groups. The NAS has the facilities and human resources that will be required to support the successful completion of this project. The NAS is a unique, not-for-profit organization chartered by the United States Congress to provide scientifically valid and objective reviews and critical assessments of major domestic and international problems and issues. The anticipated period of performance is 5 years form the effective date of award. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, Attn: Gracie L.
