Then, eight minutes later, came the terse reply from the president's office -- a few very sharp words conveyed in a note from the press office. And so, around 2130 hours [1930 GMT], the very day when Berlusconi's approach to the government experienced a dangerous step into the unknown, saw the explosion of a dispute that had remained concealed for some weeks -- that of the European Community with respect to the Italian Government that is about to be formed. The controversy stems from two anxieties -- concerning the presence of neofascist ministers in Berlusconi's cabinet and the possibility that the new government majority will adopt substantially anti-Community stances in foreign policy. Socialists' Motion These are the facts, as they happened, in rapid succession. In Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament [EP], a session was devoted to the European Council meeting scheduled for 24-25 June in Corfu. The Socialist group -- after a series of meetings that morning among representatives of the various countries' socialist parties -- put the following motion to the vote: "The European Parliament demands that the members of the European Union make it known very clearly to the president of the Italian Republic that his government must be loyal to the fundamental principles that presided over the foundation of the Community, after the horrors of fascism and Nazism." In the afternoon vote, the motion received 189 for and 188 against. The AGI press agency did not report the news until 2129 [1929 GMT], however, but a mere eight minutes later the president's office issued its reply (so the reply must have been ready for some time). The four lines expressed resentment and disdain: "Italy's loyalty to the values and principles that lie at the root of the European constitution is a clear and undisputed fact that requires no reminders or teachers." This was already a sufficiently sharp response, but the chief of state's aides went further, verbally: "Such a motion should not even have been put to the vote," they explained. "It is an unacceptable interference in another country's internal affairs. And its tone is also unacceptable -- with regard to the president of the Italian Republic, of course, but also with regard to the member countries of the Community, to which the Parliament has never been seen to address such verbs as `to demand....'" But in fact there was something else that has never been seen before last night, and that is such a sharp and direct dispute between the European Parliament -- Europe, let us say -- and the chief of state of a member country of the Community.... But so it was.... And it had been planned for a couple of weeks, basically proving the fact that the return of neofascist ministers to the government has perhaps prompted more fear abroad than it has between Palermo and Milan. In an evening that suddenly grew very heated, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was not the only one drafting replies. Carlo Scognamiglio, the new speaker of the Senate and a Berlusconi supporter, also issued a protest. He wrote to Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament. And he did not pull his punches: "While respecting the prerogatives of the European Parliament, I believe that the prerogatives of national parliaments deserve equal respect.... I express my opposition to a position that seems to reflect an intention to ignore the expression of the Italian people's will and the exercise of national sovereignty.... The Italian people and their democratically elected legislative assemblies are, and will remain, the only judges of matters concerning national sovereignty." Berlusconi: No Comment What about Berlusconi? What did the prime minister-designate have to say about the "war" declared on him by the European Parliament? "No comment. I want to read the text of the motion first," he whispered as he entered the umpteenth (and inconclusive) majority meeting. And of course, he knew nothing about the other "reprisals" planned by the European Socialist group: They will vote against any decisions by the Council of Ministers to which the "neofascists" may contribute and will expel "any member of the group that supported Forza Italia in the general election or that supports Berlusconi's or his allies' lists in the coming European elections...." This is all-out war....
