President Kim made the statement in answer to a question on what message he wants to send to North Korea through his June 1-4 visit to Russia at a press conference with Russian correspondents here Monday. Kim was known to have welcomed Moscow's proposal on holding an international conference attended by South and North Korea, Russia, China, Japan, the United States, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an expression of its intention to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem. He added, however, that it will take a little longer for these parties to determine whether such a conference would efficiently help settle the nuclear dispute. Noting that he believes Russia is firmly opposed to North Korea's production of nuclear weapons, Kim said he will study ways to cooperate in the nuclear issue at summit meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
