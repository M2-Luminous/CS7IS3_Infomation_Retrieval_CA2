FR940922-1-00040 FR940922-1-00008 •STAPPA/ALAPCO Compilations of VOC and NO X Control Measures EPA, together with STAPPA/ALAPCO, prepared two important compilations of potential measures available to states in the OTR to address ozone air quality problems. 41 The STAPPA/ALAPCO compilations provide fairly comprehensive lists of VOC and NO X control measures that augment traditional controls. The VOC document includes programs to obtain reductions from degreasers, vehicle refueling (Stage II vapor recovery), aerospace manufacturing and rework, bakeries, offset lithography, wood furniture coatings, and automobile assembly, among others. EPA has, however, already included most of the VOC measures from the STAPPA/ALAPCO compilation in the analysis of Clean Air Act mandated measures, described above, while others affect only a small portion of the VOC inventory. 41 See Meeting the 15-Percent Rate-of-Progress Requirement Under the Clean Air Act: A Menu of Options, STAPPA/ALAPCO (Sept. 1993); Controlling Nitrogen Oxides Under the Clean Air Act: A Menu of Options, STAPPA/ALAPCO (July 1994). The STAPPA/ALAPCO compilation of NO X control measures identifies seventeen NO X source categories. Most of the source categories listed are included in the 0.15 lbs/MMBtu NO X standard that EPA considered. The only source categories included in the compilation, but not in the 0.15 standard, are NO X emissions from open burning and residential space and water heaters. However, emissions from these source categories identified in the document are extremely small compared to other source categories. With the exception of coal-fired boilers, the STAPPA/ALAPCO document recommends emission levels more stringent than the 0.15 NO X standard that EPA modeled through application of beyond-RACT measures. Emissions from coal-fired boilers dominate the stationary source emission inventory. That is, the additional NO X reductions from those other source categories are a relatively small portion of the emission inventory compared to the contribution from coal-fired boilers (and an even smaller portion of the overall 35% stationary source contribution to the total inventory). •Transportation Control Measures EPA also considered transportation control measures (TCMs) as potentially reasonable and practicable measures available for the OTR. There are a wide range of TCMs that have been proposed, but EPA believes that many of them, such as gasoline rationing, are unreasonable and impracticable here. Two options that EPA considers potentially reasonable and practicable are the extension of the Employee Commute Option (ECO) program region-wide and implementation of a comprehensive system of congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees. Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Act mandates that the severe areas in the OTR adopt employee trip reduction programs (also known as ECO programs). Under these programs, each employer with more than one hundred employees must offer incentives and encouragement for employees to travel to work by means other than single-occupant vehicles. The eventual goal of the program is to achieve a 25% increase in vehicle occupancy for morning commuting trips. This is equivalent to one out of five employees using a mode of commuting, other than driving. EPA's best case estimate of the benefits of extending the ECO program region-wide is a three percent reduction in vehicle miles travelled (VMT) in the OTR. This reduction in VMT would correspond to approximately a two percent reduction in NO X and VOC emissions from light-duty vehicles in the OTR, and to a 0.6% reduction in overall NO X emissions and a 0.4% reduction in overall VOC emissions from the 2005 baseline. The incremental amount of reductions is limited because the program would only affect the limited number of large employers outside the severe areas and because commuting trips are only a fraction of overall trips and VMT. A second TCM option is a comprehensive system of fees and incentives designed to affect driving habits and vehicle usage. These controls, including congestion pricing, employee parking pricing, and emissions-based registration fees, are described in the Cameron Report. 42 These measures could possibly achieve a 12% reduction in car and light-truck VMT in the OTR. This would correspond to a 12% reduction in NO X and VOC emissions from light-duty vehicles, a 2% reduction in overall VOC emissions and a 3% reduction in overall NO X emissions from the 2005 baseline. 42 See ``Transportation Efficiency: Tackling Southern California's Air Pollution and Congestion'', Michael Cameron, EDF and Regional Institute of Southern California (March 1991). •California Reformulated Gasoline The use of California reformulated gasoline in the OTR is another option that has been mentioned. This program would generate limited additional emissions reductions in the OTR. California reformulated gasoline achieves greater emissions reductions than Federal reformulated gasoline, due to the different specifications for the California fuel, such as a lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP). EPA estimates that the implementation of California reformulated gasoline in the OTR could provide an approximate six to seven percent reduction in NO X and VOC emissions from gasoline vehicles. This corresponds to reductions from the overall 2005 baseline of 1.7% for NO X and 1.5% for VOC. This issue was addressed in a study done for the State of Maryland 43 and a study prepared for the group of northeast states. 44 Both of these studies corroborate EPA's conclusion that California reformulated gasoline would achieve limited reductions in the OTR. 43 See Ellis, H., ``An Analysis of Ozone Control Strategies for Maryland,'' Johns Hopkins University (Jan. 17, 1994). 44 See Screening Study of Mobile-Source Strategies for the Northeast,'' Acurex Environmental Corporation (Oct. 1992). •California Federal Implementation Plans Measures
