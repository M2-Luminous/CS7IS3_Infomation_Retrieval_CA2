Guo Chengdong, Zhang Guozhong, Wang Jingsan and Yin Jin left Taiwan more than one year after thy escaped persecution on the mainland and sneaked into Taiwan in 1992. "They are the first group of mainland dissidents who have been granted political asylum by a Western Government after escaping to Taiwan," the association said. The four, all in their early 30's, have been wanted by mainland authorities for their roles in the student-led Tiananmen demonstrations which ended after a bloody crackdown on June 4, 1989. They sneaked into Taiwan in September 1992 and were first detained at a special reception center in Hsinchu, Northern Taiwan along with other illegal mainland immigrants. After repeated petitions, they finally convinced the Republic of China [ROC] government that they were political dissidents and should not be repatriated to the mainland. With the assistance of human rights organizations in Taiwan and New York, the four applied for "political refugee" status with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Swedish Government recently agreed to accept the four as "political refugees." The ROC Government gave each of them US$1,000 pocket money and other gifts before their departure. The government will also provide them with one-year grants for Swedish language study and other living expenses. Taiwan is reluctant to let them stay in consideration of relations with the mainland, some observers said.
