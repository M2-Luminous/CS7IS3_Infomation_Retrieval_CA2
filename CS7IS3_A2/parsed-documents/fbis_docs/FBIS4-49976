On April 13, the committee issued a report related to the relations between Britain and China before and after 1997. The report openly advocates the adoption of a further confrontation policy toward China and interfering in China's internal affairs. We express strong indignation and regret over this. The report admits the British side's change of policy regarding Hong Kong and its support of Governor Chris Patten's practices in Hong Kong, proceeding from its inaccurate assessment of the current situation and prospects in China. While continuing to adopt a policy of confrontation with China, the report even advocates seeking international support over the Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by such a report at a time when the British side has repeatedly stated that it would cooperate with China on other issues now that the truth of the disputes over Hong Kong's political system has been made clear to the public. The report claims that China will not change the three-level political framework established by the Hong Kong governor in violation of the Sino-British Declaration, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the bilateral understandings already reached by the two sides. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that, in order to guard the sanctity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Legislative Council and district organizations established according to Patten's program can only exist till June 30, 1997. After that date the government, the legislative council and district organizations of Hong Kong will be reorganized in accordance with the Basic Law. We firmly support the stand of the Chinese government. The report even openly attacks some articles, such as Articles 18 and 158, in the Basic Law which state that the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) has the right to announce a state of emergency in Hong Kong when necessary and that the right to explain the Basic Law lies with the NPC Standing Committee. These provisions are to ensure the restoration of China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong after July 1, 1997. However, the report claims the articles are a potential serious threat to the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong, thus revealing the true motive of the British side to attempt to prolong its control and influence over Hong Kong. The promotion of democracy and the safeguarding of human rights in Hong Kong as advocated in the report has revealed the hypocrisy of the British side. The essence of the disputes over Hong Kong's political system is not whether or not to develop democracy, but whether or not to abide by international commitments and to ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong in line with the Basic Law. The Chinese government put forward the policy of "one country, two systems" and advocated the exercising of a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. The Basic Law has provided adequate and specific provisions on the development of democracy in Hong Kong after the Special Administrative Region is established. There have been no democracy or human rights to speak of over the past century or more while the British codes for colonies governed Hong Kong. To make much fanfare about democracy and human rights just a few years before the ending of its rule over Hong Kong is aimed at simply creating confusion. The report also suggests that a human rights committee and human rights supervision agency be established in Hong Kong. The purpose is to create new barriers for the smooth transition of power in Hong Kong. The Chinese side will not recognize British unilateral decisions made on major affairs that extend beyond 1997. The report, in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, advocates self-determination of Tibet. It is known to all that since ancient times, Tibet has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Before 1959, a system of feudal serfdom was practiced in Tibet, which was darker and crueler than that of the Middle Ages in Europe. The old Tibet was one of the regions in the world which suffered most seriously from violations of human rights. After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march down the road of national unity and economic development, and people began living in peace and contentment. This is a reform of historical significance that moves to safeguard human rights and promote social progress. But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind of change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners as "guards of human rights," a statement which in itself pokes great fun at human rights. The making of such claims is in fact an attempt to sabotage China's unification and national unity. We advise them to take a cautious attitude toward the issue of Tibet in light of what part Britain has played in history. The Chinese government and its people, including compatriots of the Tibetan nationality, are firmly opposed to any attempts to use the so-called Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal affairs. These attempts will never be realized. The British House of Commons also suggests strengthening the ties between the British parliament and Taiwan's "legislative yuan," calling on the British government to ease its restrictions on Taiwan. There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China, a fact recognized by the world community. The point of view on the issue of Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons runs counter to the principles concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Britain. Its real aim is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," a move firmly opposed by the entire Chinese populace, including the people of Taiwan. The report also has an ulterior motive in advocating the "China threat," which is simply slated to undermine the relations between China and,its neighboring countries. It is known to all that China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world peace and stability. So talk of a "China threat" is totally groundless and to no avail. The NPC Foreign Affairs Committee attaches great importance to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons. The Chinese side does not do anything to harm Britain, the British parliament or Sino-British ties. But some members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons have recently repeatedly harmed Sino-British relations while stressing the maintenance and development of Sino-British relations. We should ask their motives and where they will lead to in terms of bilateral relations. It is certain that the anti-Chinese views that the report has raised will bring harm not only to Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term interests of Britain. We believe that those who really care for and want to safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral relations do not want to see that happen.
