FR940920-2-00008 FR940920-2-00006 The Department also instructed four of the respondents (Agrorosas S.A.; Flores Mocari S.A.; Grupo Andes; and Rosex LTDA) to report CV as the basis for FMV as the volume of sales in neither the home market nor third countries was adequate. On June 29, 1994, one of the four respondents in the second category above, Grupo Sagaro, submitted an amendment to its questionnaire response. In that amendment, Grupo Sagaro stated that, based on further review, it did have a viable home market. After reviewing the new sales information, the Department agreed and on July 8, 1994, we instructed Grupo Sagaro to base its FMV on home market sales. Respondents submitted responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in May and July 1994. The Department issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June, July, August and September 1994. Respondents submitted their responses to these deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in June and August 1994. Agricola Benilda submitted a comprehensive revision of its sales and cost information on September 8, 1994. Agrorosas S.A. submitted minor pre-verification corrections on September 9, 1994. On July 5, 1994, petitioner requested that the Department reject home market sales as a basis for FMV for nine of the respondents for which the home market was viable. Petitioner stated that these sales were not in the ordinary course of trade. On July 11, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to determine if the sales reported were in the ordinary course of trade. On July 25, 1994, the respondents provided their responses to these supplemental questionnaires. On July 28, 1994, petitioner alleged that the nine respondents which had viable home markets sold roses in the home market at prices below their cost of production (COP). Petitioner also alleged that Grupo Tropicales sold roses in one of its two third country markets, Argentina, at prices below its COP. On August 22, 1994, the Department instructed Rosex to file a consolidated response with Rosas Sausalito and Induflora. This response is due on September 12, 1994. For our preliminary determination we based our analysis on only Rosex's data. On September 8, 1994, the Department initiated COP investigations against the nine respondents with viable home markets and against Argentine sales for Grupo Tropicales ( See the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). Based on information obtained from the respondents which had viable home markets, the Department determined on September 9, 1994, that home market sales were in the ordinary course of trade and, therefore, could be used in the Department's analysis ( See the September 9, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). On September 12, 1994, the Department decided to base FMV for Grupo Clavecol, Grupo Sabana and Grupo Tropicales on third country sales ( See the September 12, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford). For a further discussion, see the ``Third Country Sales'' section of this notice. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are fresh cut roses, including sweethearts or miniatures, intermediates, and hybrid teas, whether imported as individual blooms (stems) or in bouquets or bunches. Roses are classifiable under subheadings 0603.10.6010 and 0603.10.6090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ( HTSUS ). The HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Period of Investigation The Department initiated this investigation using our standard six-month POI from September 1, 1993, to February 28, 1994. On March 30 and April 11, respondents submitted comments on the POI. On April 5, 1994, petitioner also submitted comments on the POI. On April 14, 1994, the Department altered the POI to calendar year 1993 because of the seasonal nature of sales and production in the rose industry ( See the April 14, 1994, memorandum from the team to Richard W. Moreland). In addition, for purposes of price-to-price comparisons, we are basing FMV on two six-month periods: January 1, 1993, through June 30, 1993; and July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993. For a further discussion of these periods, see the September 12, 1994, concurrence memorandum. Best Information Available We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA) is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise by the following respondents: (1) Agricola Benilda; (2) Grupo Intercontinental; (3) Grupo Prisma and (4) Grupo Andes. In assigning BIA, the Department applies a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of respondent's cooperation. In the first tier, the Department normally assigns higher margins ( i.e., margins based on more adverse assumptions) for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation or which otherwise impeded the proceeding. If a respondent is deemed non-cooperative, the Department bases the preliminary margin for the relevant class or kind of merchandise on the higher of: (1) The highest margin in the petition or (2) the highest calculated margin of any respondent within that country that supplied adequate responses for the relevant class or kind of merchandise. In the second tier, the Department assigns lower margins to those respondents who substantially cooperate in an investigation. These margins are based on the higher of: (1) The highest calculated margin for any respondent within the country that supplied adequate information for the relevant class or kind of merchandise or (2) the average margin of the margins in the petition ( See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, (54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989)).
