FR941003-2-00040 FR941003-2-00031 In order to adjust this national average for regional variations, we concluded that the most reliable means available was the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) established for the Medicare physician fee schedule. The GPCI is an index developed by a joint effort of the Urban Institute (UI) and the Center for Health Economics Research (CHER) to measure the differences in resource cost among localities compared to the national average in the three components of the relative value units_physician work, practice expenses, excluding malpractice, and malpractice. These three components are weighted 54.2 percent, 40.2 percent, and 5.6 percent, respectively. The resource inputs and their weights were obtained from the American Medical Association's (AMA) Socioeconomic Characteristics of Medical Practice. The weights for the current GPCIs are from the AMA's l989 Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) Survey. If there is more than one GPCI for a State, we used the GPCI with the highest values to derive the maximum charge in order to assure that the administration charge for providers in high cost areas would fall within our established maximum. The GPCIs are grouped by State and substate areas. For purposes of developing the regional maximum charges, we interpreted the term ``regional'' used in the statute to mean ``State'' because of the specific grouping of the data using the GPCIs. While the GPCI is grouped by State and substate areas, we decided to use the State grouping only. The geographic area of a State is clearly identifiable by boundary lines recognized nationwide, as opposed to a substate area. In other words, substate areas do not necessarily represent counties, which would be an easily identifiable geographic area. Therefore, we believe using substate geographic areas would be confusing to both States and providers. We derived the amounts specified in the chart under section II.C. of this notice as the maximum charges that may be charged for the administration of qualified pediatric vaccines for each State on the basis of the following formula: National charge data × total weighted GPCI = maximum charge. Following is an example of application of the formula for Hawaii: Average national administration ␣charge = $15.09 Work expense = 1.003 Practice expense = 1.094 Malpractice expense = 1.025 Using Medicare weights to weigh components of_ Work expense = 54.2 percent Practice expense = 40.2 percent Malpractice expense = 5.6 percent ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ Calculation: Work expense 1.003 × 54.2 percent = .5436 Practice expense 1.094 × 40.2 percent = .4398 Malpractice expense 1.025 × 5.6 percent = .0574 n,n,s ␣ l 1.0408 Hawaii's maximum charge for administration of the vaccine is: $15.09 × 1.0408 = $15.71 Given the circumstances discussed in the beginning of section II.B. of this notice, the maximum charge will be based on charge data and will be applicable until we are able to obtain cost data. Our goal is to obtain information that can be used in setting maximum charges in the future. We will revise the regional maximum charges as we determine it is necessary, or in response to public comments.
