She said: In view of the collapse of the Eastern communist blocs, the United States and its Western allies must pay greater attention to the regulations controlling exports of military and other advanced equipment to "rebellious" countries including Iran! Who is disrupting world security? Which are the "rebellious" countries? These are the questions which plague the minds of people around the world. The answer is clear. The United States and the domineering powers of the world have drawn specific boundaries for the purpose of pillaging the countries of the world. Then they declare that whoever does not officially recognize these boundaries is disrupting world security and is an rebel! Following the demise of the Soviet Union, with the changed political geography, these people congregated at the COCOM session in order to identify the rebels and those who disrupt world security! It is natural for those who have been constantly seeking to gorge themselves for the past century to introduce distinctive terminology into the political lexicon. They think that whatever they believe in will be officially recognized by all the people of the world. The people of the world wish to know: Fifty years ago, a handful of terrorists came to what is now occupied Palestine, killed the people, made them homeless, and established a black-hearted dictatorial government. If they were not rebels, what were they?! The people of the world ask: In an African country such as Algeria, when a democratic government based on the will of the people is formed, why does a sinister coup d'etat have the support of international despots, while the leaders of the people are thrown into dungeons? The people of the world ask: When Muslims are victorious in Turkish municipal elections, why is a crisis desk set up in Washington? The people of the world ask: Why do we see in the heartland of Europe the most shameful violations of human rights? And the Serbs are still continuing their aggression under the auspices of the Western powers, so why does no one label them as rebels or say they are disrupting world security? The people of the world want to know: When a number of oppressed people are offering their morning prayers in the auspicious month of Ramadan in the al-Khalil mosque and they are gunned down with impunity, who is the rebel and who is disrupting world security? If, according to the U.S. under secretary for arms control and international security affairs, the volume of advanced military equipment is the criterion, and its production and exports should be controlled, then the United States, Britain, France, and others who have the largest nuclear arsenals should be declared the greatest threat to world security and the most notorious of international rebels.
