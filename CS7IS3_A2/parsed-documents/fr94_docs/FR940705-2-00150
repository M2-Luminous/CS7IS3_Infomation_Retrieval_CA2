FR940705-2-00150 FR940705-2-00090 The containment levels required for research involving recombinant DNA associated with or in animals is based on classification of experiments in Section III. For the purpose of animal research, four levels of containment are established. These are referred to as BL1&hyph;Animals (N), BL2&hyph;N, BL3&hyph;N, and BL4&hyph;N and are described in the following sections of Appendix Q. The descriptions include: (i) standard practices for physical and biological containment, and (ii) animal facilities. Appendix Q-I-B. Disposal of Animals (BL1&hyph;N through BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-I-B&hyph;1. When an animal covered by Appendix Q containing recombinant DNA or a recombinant DNA-derived organism is euthanized or dies, the carcass shall be disposed of to avoid its use as food for human beings or animals unless food use is specifically authorized by an appropriate Federal agency. Appendix Q-I-B&hyph;2. A permanent record shall be maintained of the experimental use and disposal of each animal or group of animals. Appendix Q-II. Physical and Biological Containment Levels Appendix Q-II-A. Biosafety Level 1 - Animals (BL1&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL1&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-a. Animal Facility Access (BL1&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-a-(1). The containment area shall be locked. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-a-(2). Access to the containment area shall be limited or restricted when experimental animals are being held. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-a-(3). The containment area shall be patrolled or monitored at frequent intervals. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-b. Other (BL1&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-b-(1). All genetically engineered neonates shall be permanently marked within 72 hours after birth, if their size permits. If their size does not permit marking, their containers should be marked. In addition, transgenic animals should contain distinct and biochemically assayable DNA sequences that allow identification of transgenic animals from among non- transgenic animals. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-b-(2) A double barrier shall be provided to separate male and female animals unless reproductive studies are part of the experiment or other measures are taken to avoid reproductive transmission. Reproductive incapacitation may be used. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;1-b-(3). The containment area shall be in accordance with state and Federal laws and animal care requirements. Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;2. Animal Facilities (BL1&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-A&hyph;2-(a). Animals shall be confined to securely fenced areas or be in enclosed structures (animal rooms) to minimize the possibility of theft or unintentional release. Appendix Q-II-B. Biosafety Level 2 - Animals (BL2&hyph;N) (see Appendix Q-III-A) Appendix Q-II-B&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL2&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-B&hyph;1-a. Animal Facility Access (BL2&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-B&hyph;1-a-(1). The containment area shall be locked. Appendix Q-II-B&hyph;1-a-(2). The containment area shall be patrolled or monitored at frequent intervals.
