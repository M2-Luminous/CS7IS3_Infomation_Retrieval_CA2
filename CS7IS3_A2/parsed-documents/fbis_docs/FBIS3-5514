Presiding Judge Koji Maki said "business deals former executives made in the name of Marubeni are valid," fully supporting claims by the trustees of Iida Sangyo Co., based in Fukuoka, who demanded for payment of the outstanding sum by Marubeni. Iida Sangyo executives made no mistake in accepting orders sealed and placed by Marubeni officials, as "according to the commercial code the former (Marubeni) executives were acting as trade employees with the powers of representation," the ruling said. Marubeni, Iida Sangyo and Kyowa Co., a now-defunct steel-frame producer, signed a sales contract for steel frames in March 1986. From that time, Marubeni placed orders with Kyowa through Iida Sangyo, which also advanced the money for the deals. Marubeni refused to refund Iida Sangyo a total of 3.65 billion yen for six orders placed between April to September 1990, claiming it had not placed any new orders with the company after August 1988. Due to the outstanding 3.6 billion yen owed by Marubeni and further claims amounting to 2.2 billion yen against Kyowa, Iida Sangyo had to file for bankruptcy. The Fukuoka District Court eventually declared the company insolvent in February 1991.
