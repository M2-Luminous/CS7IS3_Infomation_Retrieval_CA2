[Peres] I hope so. We still have to clarify a few things. [Raz] Where do the contacts with the PLO stand? Is there any chance of concluding matters in the present round of talks? [Peres] Israel has prepared a complete agreement. Now we have to also reach agreement with the PLO. [Raz] Will 'Arafat arrive tomorrow? [Peres] I cannot answer for him. [Raz] Mr. Peres, where do the major obstacles lie? [Peres] In the complexity of the situation on the ground, in the various scenarios, concerns, fears, and aspirations. Whoever thinks we are negotiating over where a policeman should stand or not is simply deluding himself. These negotiations are about the crux of the matter, about peoples' emotions, fears, and hopes. The fact that this is expressed in arguments about the stationing of this or that policeman merely serves to highlight the difficulties in bridging the existing gaps between the Palestinian and Israeli positions. [Raz] Mr. Peres, do you really think that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is throwing a monkey wrench into the works, as one newspaper headline stated? [Peres] No one ever heard me make such a statement or use such a remark in the course of the past week. Many of the things attributed to me are mere assumptions based on groundless psychological analyses. [Raz] Do you have any reservations with the IDF's degree of involvement in the current stage of the process? [Peres] I think it is important that the IDF be involved. The negotiations definitely have their security and military aspects and I have no complaints about the IDF's involvement. [Raz] Thank you Mr. Peres.
