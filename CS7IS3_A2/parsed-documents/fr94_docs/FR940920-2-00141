FR940920-2-00141 FR940920-2-00083 Substitute Return Format Standardization for Individual Returns Filed on Paper AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Announcement_Notice of intent to standardize substitute return format for individual returns filed on paper. SUMMARY: The IRS is in the process of modernizing its computer systems and in keeping with this premise, those forms and schedules that are not filed electronically will be scanned and machine-read. This technology will expedite processing, increase customer service, and maximize the use of resources. The changes will become effective as the new computer systems of the IRS become operational and notice will be posted in the Internal Revenue Bulletin and disseminated through other media. IRS will then request that the following methods be used to file individual income tax returns: 1. Electronically-filed returns; 2. Computer-generated summary sheets (Form 1040PC); 3. IRS-published Forms 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ and their respective forms and schedules (or machine readable substitutes, as defined in Revenue Procedure 94&hyph;51). Publication 1167, Substitute Printed, Computer-Prepared, and Computer-Generated Tax Forms and Schedules, has been revised to reflect these preferences. There are several reasons for this initiative. The IRS receives more than 115 million individual tax returns and the volume increases annually. Form 1040PC and electronic filing provide better quality input. They also reduce the need for document storage. IRS wishes to limit the submission of traditional returns to IRS-produced paper forms in keeping with the Tax System Modernization (TSM) initiatives to scan all forms. However, IRS recognizes that many practitioners and individual taxpayers utilize software packages to produce computer generated returns and that this software is considered by the public to reduce the burden in the filing of tax returns. Therefore, IRS seeks a balance between its need to maintain strict control and the convenience the taxpaying public enjoys through the use of tax preparation software. The goal is to scan all returns received. IRS will hold a ``Town Meeting'' to discuss this intent with the public. Note: Last minute changes to the date or location of the meeting are possible and could prevent advance notice. DATES: The ``Town Meeting'' is scheduled to be held on October 5, 1994, at 9 a.m. The meeting will be open to the public. ADDRESSES: The ``Town Meeting'' will be held at the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 1331 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC. Notification of intent to attend the meeting is requested in order to have a sufficient number of handouts/agendas printed. Please contact Freda George at 202&hyph;283&hyph;0578 (not a toll-free number), to confirm attendance or for additional information. If you wish to communicate by FAX, the number is 202&hyph;283&hyph;0137, to the attention of Freda George. A copy of the ``Town Meeting Minutes'' will be sent to all persons who mail-in comments or who call to express an interest in receiving them. The address to send your comments to is: Internal Revenue Service, Attn: Forms Standardization Project Office T:I:F, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20224. Dated: September 12, 1994. Approved: Jim Smith, National Director, Submission Processing. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23146 Filed 9&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4830&hyph;01&hyph;U ‚ê£
