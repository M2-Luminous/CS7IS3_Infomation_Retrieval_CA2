Russia Could Join the Council of Europe in Early 1995"] [Text] Strasbourg, Paris -- The spring session of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, which has ended in Strasbourg, turned out to be stormy and memorable. Perhaps for the first time, mention was made of a more or less concrete schedule for Russia's admission to this organization, as yet the only pan-European organization to unite countries from both the Eastern and Western parts of the continent. Although an exact entry date was not officially stated, in the corridors "reliable sources" were very specific: 30 January 1995. The Council of Europe leadership, and Vladimir Shumeyko, who was on an official visit to Strasbourg at the time, and the members of the permanent Russian parliamentary delegation were, as behoves them, more diplomatic, unanimously placing the final decision on Russia's admission in the first quarter of next year -- are there not plenty of things that could happen?! Nonetheless, even compared with the January session of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, a change of position with regard to Russia was clearly perceptible. And this is not because of the replacement of the secretary general, a post for which elections were held at this session. France's Catherine Lalumiere, who has done much to boost the prestige of the Council of Europe, until recently a little-known organization, hoped to be elected for a second consecutive term and was, to this end, counting on the representatives of Eastern Europe, most of which she brought into the Council of Europe in her five-year term. Russia's admission was another trump card in Lalumiere's hands, but she was stabbed in the back -- by her own French deputies, who were settling old scores of their own. It was by their two or three votes that the now former secretary general fell short. The Swede Daniel Tarschys, who unexpectedly overtook Lalumiere, played the "Russian card" even more. Not only does he speak Russian, but his "track record" as a professor includes analytical works on the former USSR and Russia, on the downfall of totalitarianism, and on other related topics which he studied, in part, in Leningrad, where he did a six-month course in the eighties. For Tarschys, Russia's admission to the Council of Europe is topic number one, since this could be the first and biggest result of his term in the post of secretary general. In fact, he made no secret of this in an interview with your correspondent. Of course, Tarschys expressed all the necessary reservations. True, the adoption of a new Constitution and free parliamentary elections -- this is the first and most important condition of admission to the European family, and it has already been fulfilled. But the Council of Europe and its commissions and experts must in the coming months make a more scrupulous study of Russian laws, the effectiveness of the judiciary, and the situation regarding human rights and national minorities. Only after that will there be a final decision on Russia's compliance with European standards. Are these standards uniform? Vladimir Lukin, head of our delegation, asked himself that question repeatedly during the session, and answered in the negative. In the opinion of the chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, Russia should, of course, join the Council of Europe, but it is unacceptable for special demands to be made on it which are by no means always observed by the existing members of the Council of Europe. This applies, in particular, to the position of national minorities (in the Baltic countries, for instance), the presence of troops on other states' territory, etc. Vladimir Lukin insisted on an even-handed approach, especially since the Council of Europe needs Russia as much as Russia needs the Council of Europe. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who is now a member of the official Russian delegation to the Council of Europe, sought to fan the flames in all the debates. Admittedly this, his first visit to Strasbourg, will apparently also be his last, if we are to believe the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader's statement prior to his departure. Taking the "national patriotic" line to absurd extremes, as always, Zhirinovskiy informed the public that Russia does not belong in the Council of Europe or the NATO Partnership for Peace, or even, moreover, in...the United Nations, which, he said, it should immediately quit. What upset the "liberal democrat" most of all, however, was the theft of his cap during an official reception with Daniel Tarschys (incidentally, the Swede is also a liberal democrat, but without the quotation marks). Stating that "the price of my headgear at auction will soon go up, of course," Zhirinovskiy then left Strasbourg, which he found inhospitable and where, among other things, he was involved in a clash with demonstrators who had gone to the Russian Consulate building to protest the LDP leader's presence in France. As for his headgear, our delegation was immediately reminded of the old joke: "The October Revolution is canceled -- the leader's cap has been stolen!" According to that logic, fascism will not win the day in Russia.... So, forceful passions seethed at the session, but now, after the stormy debates, everything shoould fall into a calm, workaday routine. Calm is required on both sides -- in the Council of Europe and in Russia. And then, probably, all the dates cited for Russia's entry will become real.
