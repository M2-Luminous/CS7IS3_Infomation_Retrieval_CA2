Launching his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party campaign in English before an audience of about 40 people late Wednesday, he said he wanted to promote national unity. Observers said this could mean bringing Indians into his cabinet if he emerged the winner in the upcoming election. "On the promotion of national unity, we will build on the very successful start we have made on inviting the participation of the Parliamentary Opposition in the work of the Cabinet sub-committee on the review of the constitution," he said. He promised a future Rabuka government would extend this to the Agriculture Land and Tenant Act (ALTA) which makes decisions about Fijian-owned land leased to predominantly Indian canegrowers. One of the demands of the Indian opposition groups is for scrapping the racially-based 1990 constitution which gives indigenous Fijians a permanent majority of 37 in the 70-seat House of Representatives. Rabuka told an SVT political rally here Monday that he would not form a coalition with an Indian party if the SVT won a majority the Fijian seats. However, he reportedly told local reporters Tuesday he would keep the door open to alliances with other political parties to keep alive his concept of a government of national unity proposed in November 1992. The ALTA, established in 1966, is a sensitive issue here. Fijians want it abolished so they can get their land back when leases expires, but Indians favour it because it protects their rights to the land. The land issue has become a political football because Indian cane farmers do not own their own land but have to lease it from indigenous Fijians who own 83 percent of the land. Sugar is the backbone of the economy earning about 260 million Fijian dollars (170 million US) annually in foreign exchange. It is exceeded only by tourism which brings in more than 328 million Fijian dollars. Rabuka said he would work with the opposition to establish parliamentary select committees to look into problems faced by the Indians, outlining an eight-point plan which he said a Rabuka government would implement. Among other measures, cabinet ministers would not be appointed on a provincial basis but on merit, the government would proceed with a promised review of valued added tax (VAT). It would also weigh the relative advantages of deregulation to consumers of free and open importation with the need to protect local producers and manufacturers.
