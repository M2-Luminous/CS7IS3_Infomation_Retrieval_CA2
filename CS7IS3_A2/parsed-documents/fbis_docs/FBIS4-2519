It was recently compiled by the General Study Group of the Party Literature Research Office under the CPC Central Committee and published by the Shaanxi People's Publishing House. This book collected 92 important documents totalling 650,000 characters on the party's history. They were written from 1926 to 1991, a time span of 65 years, by 31 older generations of revolutionaries including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun. The book is divided into four parts. The first discusses the significance of studying party history; the second is about the scientific attitude and method of studying party history; the third deals with the basic process, characteristics, experiences, and lessons of party history; and the last reviews major events in party history. Experts are of the view that the book is an important collection of the works of the older generation of revolutionaries who analyzed party history from Marxist standpoints, views, and methods; is a guide for studying party history and doing research on party history under the new historical conditions; and will greatly help party members, cadres, and youth understand and study party history, better understand China's past, cope with future problems, and enhance self-awareness and a sense of historical responsibility for building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
