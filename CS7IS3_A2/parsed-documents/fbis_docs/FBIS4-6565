A man whose life was saved by Thai soldiers during the Khmer Rouge offensive at Choam border pass near Surin Province is Prince Ranariddh, who is now a co-prime minister of Cambodia. Had the Thai artillery unit failed to rescue him from danger at Choam battlefield, the prince would not have become the prime minister nor would he have had the chance to behave so arrogantly as he is doing today. As Prince Ranariddh and certain ministers of the Cambodian Government are making numerous slanderous accusations against Thailand to discredit our country in the eyes of the international community, we are pleased with the actions taken by our prime minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Armed Forces in the defense of our nation's image and prestige. We hail their tremendous tolerance and patience, otherwise we would have fallen into the trap set by the Cambodians. Considering the situation, we can see that Prince Ranarridh is no different from the Bosnian Serbs who believe in national reunification through war with the intention of keeping other factions under their thumb and detesting national reconciliation. As a matter of fact, if the Cambodians want to prolong their genocidal war, that is their business, not ours. In reality, things turn out differently. Thailand has been accused of supporting the Khmer Rouge. It believes that Prince Ranariddh wants to use Thailand as the target of criticism to divert the attention of the Cambodian people away from other domestic difficulties. Our government and Armed Forces must be patient in dealing with this problem. We know well that the Cambodian Government is now very weak. Soldiers and policemen have not received their salaries for several months and are living in agony. They can rise up against the government at any time. The longer the war drags on, the weaker the government will be due to depleting financial resources. Hence, the same old trick is employed to divert the people's attention to something outside the country so that they will not be aware of internal shortcomings. From another point of view, Prince Ranariddh and several countries now investing in Cambodia are not happy with Thailand's growing economic and cultural influence in Cambodia. At the instruction of former colonialists, Prince Ranariddh deems it necessary to do something to eliminate the Thai clamp on Cambodia in exchange for military and economic assistance from other countries. Prince Ranariddh and his colleagues might be misled by old information and pictures provided by intelligence units of certain countries and blindly use them to substantiate his charges against Thailand. The repetition of groundless accusations against Thailand is causing many countries to wonder about the truth of such allegations. Moreover, Cambodia reacts indifferently to Thailand's protests in this regard. Optimistically speaking, the Cambodians might now come to realize that they have made a mistake. Therefore, we must act wisely in order to assert our maturity. Let them continue killing one another as they wish.
