Iranian Scheme To Partition Iraq. The Iranian Intelligence Services Prepare Terrorist Cells From the Iraqi Opposition, Distribute Them Among European States;'' date not given--all names as transliterated] [Excerpts] Three years after Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's future is still ``at a precarious position.'' Some observers expect that Saddam Husayn will remain the head of a country that is militarily destroyed, politically isolated, and economically besieged. Meanwhile, others await the toppling of Saddam through a military coup or a popular revolution. A surprising analysis, however, comes from Tehran, where the mullahs expect serious changes in the next few months that will partition Iraq. Hence, Iran is preparing to gain the ``lion's share'' of ``Saddam's heritage.'' Iran has prepared a comprehensive scheme to exploit the new situation by adopting, supporting, and entrusting opposition Shiite factions with military and terrorist missions in and outside Iraq. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reveals the details of the Iranian scheme designed to use Iraq's Shiites in the partition scenario, which includes Baghdad, Beirut, and European capitals. [passage omitted] Informed Iranian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that the higher authorities in Tehran have for a while been acting as if Iraq is heading toward partitioning. The sources add that the Iranians want to take a lion's share from the changes that may occur in Iraq. Toward this end, they are strengthening their relations with the Shiite majority, especially after Iran managed to move the Shiite religious authority from al-Najaf to Qom. [passage omitted] For weeks, there have been disclosures about Iranian practices, activities, and intensive contacts with fundamental opposition factions, some of which have been briefed on the situation. Reports affirm that Iranian Ambassador in Damascus Shaykh Ahmad 'Ali Akhtari recently met with Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, head of the Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and told him explicitly that important changes will happen in Iraq within the next few months. He told him that the international changes will eventually arrive in Iraq, which will be divided in accordance with a confederation system after international troops are sent into it. He also told him that many regions in Iraq will become autonomous. Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI from very reliable sources in Tehran says that officials from the ``Liberation Movements Bureau,'' which is headed by Iranian 'Ali A'qal Mohammadi, head of the Iraq Affairs Center, began to prepare plans for bolstering the position of the Iraqi opposition, especially the fundamental opposition, both inside and outside Iraq. According to this plan, action cells will set up in Iraq, and they will be ready to intervene when the zero hour arrives. As for foreign action, Iraqi opposition elements will be recruited. They will be linked with the terrorist cells affiliated with the Liberation Movements Bureau and foreign intelligence. They will work to strike at Iraqi interests, embassies, and institutions in a number of European countries. They will also carry out assassinations. The plan calls for seeking the help of a large number of Iraqi opposition elements residing in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and some Arab countries. They will be urged to travel to Sweden, Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Cyprus, and other countries. Iranian embassies in these countries will get in touch with Iraqi opposition groups and terrorist cells and organize their activities and plans and establish their objectives. It was learned that the Iranian embassies will issue Iraqis with forged passports and equipment suited to their operations. These embassies will provide information and details about movements of Iraqi diplomats and mission staff. It seems the Iranian authorities are anxious not to raise suspicion that they are directing these operations. It was noticed that their activities and contacts with the fundamentalist Iraqi opposition have, for some weeks, focused on Lebanon. In fact, the Lebanese security agencies have been surprised by the strength of the Iraqi fundamentalist presence on Lebanese territory and the increased activity of Iraqi fundamentalists. Some reports speak of intensive meetings by Iraqi fundamentalists in the central al-Biqa' region chaired by an Iraqi called Abu-Haydar. According to information obtained from security sources, the al-Biqa' meetings are preparatory. They represent one of a series of intensive, secret sessions that take place in the Iraqi opposition office in the southern suburb of Beirut, chaired by Abu-Maysam, the Da'wah Party representative in Lebanon. The reports mention the name of another Iraqi called Fakhir, who was charged with providing forged Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini passports for a large number of the Iraqi opposition members, some of whom actually began travelling to a number of European nations. It was learned that this official holds meetings for Iraqis in Bi'r al-'Abd in the southern suburb of Beirut. The information indicates that the external Iranian intelligence services began cementing their links with elements of the Iraqi opposition some time ago. For instance, in the German city of Aachen, Iraqi opposition elements have joined hands with Iranian intelligence presonnel to launch an Arab language daily under the name of AL-JIHAD for distribution among Iraqi, other Arab, and Islamic communities in Germany. A version of the paper printed in Tehran arrives in Lebanon where it is distributed among Muslim and revolutionary extremists. Lebanese security agencies recently noticed that Hizballah has been tightening its ties with Iraqi fundamentalists, sponsoring their operations. It has been learned that financial remittances have been transferred in the past few weeks from Iran to a number of Iraqi opposition members stationed in Syria and Lebanon to finance their activities and moves. According to some reports, the Iraqi Affairs Bureau in Tehran has requested additional funds from the Iranian Foreign Ministry's intelligence section to meet potentially increasing foreign operations. The Iranian project to organize opposition Iraqi factions calls for merging the Iraqi organizations and fundamentalist parties in an expanded front led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The front is supposed to have a secretariat, committees, general secretariat, and a central shura council. It was learned that the front would incorporate some Iraqi Kurdish factions. These are some of the Islamic forces that could join the expanded front: 1. SAIRI, which is headed by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim. 2. The Iraqi Islamic Movement, represented by Shaykh 'Ali 'Abd- al-'Aziz. 3. The Iraqi Islamic Grouping, represented by Hojjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Bahr al-'Ulum. 4. The Islamic al-Da'wah Party, represented by 'Abd-al-Hamid Kashani. 5. The Islamic Action Organization, headed by Hojjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Taqi Mudaressi. Ayatollah Taghi will represent the organization. 6. The Imam Soldiers Movement led by Sami al-Badri. 7. The Islamic Movement in Iraq led by Shaykh Jawad al-Khalis. The Islamic Scholars Organization in Iraq, represented by Hojjjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Baqir al-Naseri. The following are some of Kurdish organizations that could join the expanded front: 1. The Kurdistan People's Democratic Party, led by Sami 'Abd-al- Rahman. 2. The Kurdistan Socialist Party, led by Rasul Mamand.
