A significant change has taken place in the main Western countries, due certainly to last Saturday's [5 February] massacre in Sarajevo, but also to the increasing realization that the diplomatic and humanitarian effort has so far been ineffective. This ineffectiveness has led more than one to consider purely and simply withdrawing the UN troops in shame. No matter what developments we will see in the coming days, it is now clear that the Western world, under Franco-U.S. leadership, has not opted for an immediate withdrawal from the Bosnian theatre, but on the contrary decided to take risks there. The White House, which has tried to ignore the problem as long as possible, has apparently come to the conclusion that the political price of inaction could finally be higher than that of limited engagement. Public opinion and Congress are indeed starting to rouse themselves and ask questions about the abilities and leadership of President Clinton. The U.S. decision is a double one. On the one hand it concerns an operation with military implications to free Sarajevo from its murderous stranglehold. On the other hand it concerns the involvement of the United States in the peace process. For some time the Europeans have considered U.S. involvement of this kind in the negotiations indispensable, both to impress the Serbs and reassure the Muslims, who do not believe in a peace without U.S. guarantees. This additional pressure from Washington is especially important, at a time when the new Muslim offensive could lead to new formidable developments in the war. But not everything has been settled. Certainly unprecedented pressure is being put on the warring parties, and as soon as it is operational, the model adopted for Sarajevo could soon be applied to Tuzla and other safe areas defined by the United Nations. But it is not certain that the Serbs will yield. They could play the game of resistance, reprisals, escalation and cause the situation to become blocked. Then the question could be raised soon of the solidity of the U.S. commitment. The Somali and Haitian examples have showed the very relative determination of the current administration in this type of conflict. It also remains to be seen if the Europeans and Americans will agree on the nature of the peace plan to be proposed to the three warring parties. The European Union says it is ready to amend its plan, but it is known that Washington is very reticent regarding a carve-up which it considers as rewarding aggression. Finally there is the Russian problem. Moscow opposes air strikes against the Serbs and more generally against any NATO intervention in this region that falls within its former sphere of influence. Russia in contrast could be a useful if not indispensable ally in reaching a peace agreement. The Europeans have shown their wish to gain its partnership, and Washington has just sent an envoy there but, with the current rise in ultranationalism and Pan-Slavism, it is certainly not the easiest aspect of the issue to deal with.
