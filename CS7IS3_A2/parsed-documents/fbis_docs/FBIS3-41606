Subject of the interview is the newly operating agency of the Russian Council on Security] [Text] Life without danger is practically impossible. However, mankind must reduce the ecological risk to a minimum if it does not want to perish. Correspondent: Aleksey Vladimirovich, what are the basic tasks and functions of the MVK--the Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Security of the Russian Council on Security? Yablokov: The statute on the commission, ratified by the Presidential Edict of 13 July of this year, defines its three main tasks: Appraisal of the ecological threats and sources of ecological security for the individual, society and the state; Analysis of the information on functioning of systems of ecological security provision and aid in coordinating the activity of the federal agencies in this sphere, and preparation of predictions on the status of the ecological security of Russia. Based on its analytical work, the MVK must prepare proposals for review by the Council on Security, as well as drafts of its appropriate decisions and drafts of normative statutes on ecological security. And it must also submit materials for the ``White Book''--the annual report on national security presented by the President of Russia. Of course, as relates to questions of ecological security. The principles for a normative base are present: The Russian Federation law, ``On Security,'' a number of decrees by the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, edicts by the president, decrees and orders by the Russian government, and the recommendational legislative statute, ``On Principles of Ecological Security in the Commonwealth States.'' Currently in the stage of review are draft laws on ecological security, on the protection of the population against natural disasters, on the transport of special cargo, on especially dangerous toxic substances, on the protection of the territory of Russia against the import and spread of especially dangerous infections and toxic substances, and an entire series of others. There are several special federal structures which are directly related to the provision of ecological security. Among them are Minpriroda [Ministry on Nature] (with an administration on ecological security), the State Committee on Emergency Situations (GKChS), Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight], Gosatomnadzor [State Committee on Nuclear Oversight], Gostekhnadzor [State Committee on Technical Oversight], KOPRON [not further identified] and the Committee on Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons--specialized federal structures which are also associated with ecological security. The powerful structures which maintain and ensure the informational block of ecological security are: Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control], Roskomzem [Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management], Roskomvod [Russian Federation Committee on Water Resources and Water Management], GoskomChernobyl [Russian Federation State Committee on Social Protection of Civilians and Rehabilitation of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other Radiation Catastrophes], GoskomSever [RF Committee on the Socioeconomic Development of the North], and Goskomnats [RF Committee on Nationalities]. The Foreign Intelligence Service and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in recent times also the Ministry of Defense, have given serious attention to questions of ecological security. And within the government there are several specialized commissions operating which are associated with questions of ecological security. Correspondent: And so, there is a branched system of state structures associated with the resolution of problems of ecological security. An extensive normative base has been created, yet the problems of the country's ecological security are multiplying... How can we explain this? Yablokov: By three main reasons. First of all--by the transitional character of our society, with its political, and this means also its administrative, instability. Secondly--by the economic chaos. These reasons determine the inadequate attention to the problem of ecological security. And thirdly--by the inadequate development of the theoretical and applied aspects of the problem of ecological security in Russia. About 10 years ago, the President of the Academy of Sciences could, for example, publicly announce the absolute safety of nuclear power production, and even offer to build a Chernobyl-type reactor in Red Square... Within the memory of our generation, great ecological catastrophes of a global scale were consciously planned (!) in our country. One of them--the destruction of the Aral Sea--was almost fully implemented. Others, like the famous turning of the northern and Siberian rivers, were blocked, fortunately. Ignoring the problems of ecological security led to the creation and accumulation of nuclear missile and chemical weapons without development of plans for their utilization, as well as to the creation of gigantic nuclear power plants without development of plans for their operational de-commission, despite the fact that the service life of an AES [nuclear power plant] is rather short--30-40 years. All this testifies to the fact that in the very recent past the country had no conception of ecological security. Correspondent: Evidently today, after the Chernobyl catastrophe, theoretical and practical developments in the sphere of ecological security are being conducted intensively and principally in Russia? Yablokov: They are in the stages of inception as compared with what has been done abroad over the last 15-20 years. The pivotal point of the conception of ecological security in the world has been recognized to be the theory of ecological risk, and its applied part--determination of the level of acceptable risk. This risk, naturally, is largely defined by the effects on human health. Take a look at this figure (Fig. 1), which presents the results of one such development for the USA. And take note: Nothing of the sort has yet been done for the conditions in Russia! And the sooner we attain the world level of theoretical and practical developments in this sphere, the more successful we will be in solving the problem of ensuring the country's national ecological security. Only in November of 1991, within the framework of the State Council of Russia, were the basic conceptions of ecological security developed in our country, and a year later the Minpriroda of Russia developed the basics for a conception of a federal program, ``Ecological Security of Russia.'' Only at the beginning of the current year was the ``Conception for Ecological Security of Russia'' reviewed and adopted. In March, the Russian Federation Council on Security reviewed the question of the state of health of Russia's population, including also in connection with the country's ecological status. Huge losses in the vital and labor potential of the population became apparent, primarily a reduction of the life expectancy, conditioned by ecological dangers. There is currently a growing understanding of the importance of including the components of ecological security in the structure of national security. A confirmation of this fact is the activity of the State Committee on Emergency Situations, of federal inspections, of a number of other federal agencies of executive power, as well as of the Supreme Soviet. Graphically, the variant of isolating the component of ecological security within the overall structure of security of the individual, society and the state appears as follows, as you see in this figure (Fig. 2). Correspondent: Thus, the ecological security of the country is not ensured to the proper degree? Then--your arguments. Yablokov: The zones of ecological disaster and unfavorability are expanding. Today they occupy around 15 percent of the entire territory of Russia. The decline in the average life expectancy is continuing. The illness rate associated with the effect of ecological factors is increasing. Biological diversity is decreasing, the soil covering is deteriorating, and the quality of surface and underground waters is declining. Technologically caused accidents and catastrophes which have negative ecological consequences are becoming more frequent. And this is far from the complete picture of negative tendencies in the state of health of the population and the quality of the environment in many regions of Russia. Correspondent: The most varied ministries and departments must submit their proposals to the MVK on problems of ecological security. So, will it deal with everything at once? That is unrealistic... What problems does the MVK intend to review first of all? Yablokov: The emphasis must be placed on solving two continuous problems. On a comparative evaluation of all (in the country as a whole as well as for the major economic-geographical regions) significant ecological risks, and on a definition of the mechanism of management of each specific ecological risk for the purpose of its reduction to an acceptable level. Correspondent: Which of the problems of ecological security are most promising for review in your commission? Yablokov: The ecological risk of industrial accidents and catastrophes and the development of traditional, nuclear and other forms of power production. The risk in the basic sectors of industry, in transport and in agriculture. This is the ecological risk associated with radioactive contamination of the environment--including from RAO [not further identified] and AES [nuclear power plants]; With the formation, transport and burial of various waste products, including hazardous industrial waste; With the pollution of drinking water, the surface and underground waters; With conversion of the defense Figure 1. Figure 2. Structure of National Security sectors of industry and military activity--including also with the destruction of chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles, as well as the destruction of a significant portion of the almost 2 million tonnes of conventional ammunition, some of which has been stored since the time of World War I; With the adoption of large-scale projects of natural resource utilization--for example, the assimilation of new oil and gas deposits on land and sea; With large-scale transport construction, including of the major seaport in Luzhskaya Inlet and a high-speed train from Moscow to Siberia. And finally, this is a question of reducing the level of ecological danger in the zones of ecological disaster and unfavorability. Aside from these ecological dangers which are mentioned and discussed with relative frequency, it is very important for us to evaluate also an entire series of other, nontraditional, ones. Among them are: The ecological risk of depletion and plunder of plant and animal natural resources; The loss of wetlands, including swamps, and the effect of super-low doses of pollutants. Moreover, we must also evaluate the ecological risks associated with the large-scale development of space, foreign economic activity, privatization and the development of nonstate forms of ownership, the loss of soil fertility, the decline in recrational capacity of the territories, etc. Correspondent: The MVK deals primarily with our, Russian, problems. Yet ecological catastrophes know no boundaries... Yablokov: We are also entering onto the global level. We need an objective evaluation of the ecological risk to Russia associated with the global change in climate, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the loss of biological diversity. Correspondent: Tell us about the MVK's plans of work for the near future... You said that you would like to and are planning to review one major problematic and one more specific question at monthly meetings of the MVK... Yablokov: Since the review of major problems requires serious preparation, at the first regular meeting we are proposing to introduce the question of ecological consequences of accidents and catastrophes, which has already been worked out in detail. Many of the commission members participated in the review of this question by the Council on Ecological Policy under the President of Russia. At that time, after analysis of numerous departmental materials, it was decided that this question deserves review by the Council on Security. There are also plans to review in the MVK such major problems as the threat to national security posed by radioactive contamination of Russia and the threat to national security associated with the loss of soil fertility, which is catastrophic in its scope. Correspondent: Who will prepare these questions for discussion in the MVK? Yablokov: The second of these two questions will be prepared by Roskomzem. The foundation for serious review of the first has long ago been laid by the draft of the State Program for Radioactive Waste Management. Before the end of the year, the MVK intends to analyze the situation with the sunken nuclear submarine ``Komsomolets''--based on data collected in August by a special expedition. And also to review the course of preparation of the section on ecological security in the report on national security presented by the President of Russia. Correspondent: The MVK is in a period of formulation, and, like any new formation, it probably has its difficulties. What are they? Or is the MVK an exception to the rule in today's Russian reality, since both extra-class specialists and those who previously worked together on many problems have gathered here? Yablokov: There are, of course, several organizational problems which demand urgent solution. And the first of these is obtaining current day-to-day and analytical information on ecological security. This problem may be solved with the aid of the available systems of information existing within the State Committee on Emergency Situations, Rosgidromet, Gossanepidnadzor, Gosgortekhnadzor [Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight], Gosatomnadzor and a number of other departments and ministries. The GKChS already today presents daily summaries to the agencies of state administration, while Rosgidromet issues monthly and quarterly reports. And if all the inspections and Rosgidromet began presenting brief ecological summaries to the MVK on a weekly basis, Minpriroda and the MBR [Russian Federation Ministry of Security]--on a monthly basis, and the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] and the territorial administrations--on a quarterly basis, then using these materials and an analysis of the reports of the mass media, the MVK associates could present brief monthly reports to the Council on Security Secretariat and to all the members of the MVK. And they could also formulate a section on ecological security for the president's annual report on national security. With the organizational help of the Council on Security Secretariat, it will be possible to obtain a thorough analysis of the reports issued by the mass media. Perhaps we should make use of the appropriate experience of analytical services in the USA--and ask the CIA about this directly... Correspondent: It is very important to inform the community in a timely manner about the work of your commission. According to the law, all ecological information must be accessible to the public. Yablokov: But, on the other hand, this situation enters into some contradiction with certain limitations stemming from the demands of work by the Council on Security, as well as of national security in general. Perhaps the discussion of some questions will be open, and of some--closed. In any case, we will strive to give the press the maximum amount of information. Of course, it is necessary for the mass media workers themselves to understand the vital importance of ecological questions. Unfortunately, for the time being, with rare exceptions, this topic is put in last place. As for internal organizational problems, they do exist, but we are effectively resolving them. In general, we would like the MVK to work with maximal productivity, so that as a result of each meeting, drafts of Council on Security decisions, edicts and directives of the President of Russia, and recommendations to the federal and regional agencies of state administration would emerge.
