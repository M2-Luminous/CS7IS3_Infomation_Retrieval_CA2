Washington's new direction was decided Monday at the first U.S. administration meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue chaired by the chief negotiator at high-level talks with Pyongyang, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, a senior U.S. official told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN. Attendants of the meeting included officials above the assistant- secretarial level from the State and Defense Departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Officials from most agencies except for the State Department agreed that action against North Korea was inevitable, the U.S. official said. It was agreed at the meeting that Washington will prepare action and follow-up measures if North Korea shows no willingness to compromise by early next week, the official said. Time is running out for North Korea as the mood in Washington has hardened since the communist regime's obstruction of checks by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and as a hard-line stance is prevailing in Congress, the official told MAINICHI.
