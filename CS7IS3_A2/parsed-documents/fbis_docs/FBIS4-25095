Some persons even rushed through the roadblocks put up by the police to the sealed-off area. At 2230 [1530 GMT], 13 members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Democratic Patriotic Movement in China, the Alliance of Employees Trade Unions, the 5 April Action, and the Chinese Liberal Democratic Party arrived at the spot. Again and again they scuffled with the policemen in an attempt to climb over the roadblocks to reach the sealed-off area. During the scuffle, seeing such a situation, the driver of a passing taxi was quite dissatisfied with the troublemakers's doings and loudly shouted at them, accusing them of being "troublemakers." Hearing the accusation, a member of the Chinese Liberal Democratic Party, whose surname was Cheng, fiercely rushed out to the street and hurled an umbrella at the taxi. Consequently, the police arrested the troublemaker.
