Some Japanese banks, including the Ashikaga Bank, which are said to have been handling direct remittances to North Korea by ethnic Koreans in Japan, appear to be increasingly concerned about UN moves to impose economic sanctions against North Korea. According to a financial source, 18 Japanese banks, including city banks, have concluded correspondence agreements with the Korea Trade Bank and other North Korean banks. North Korea had delayed payments since 1975, and a Western consortium declared North Korea insolvent in 1987, prompting a majority of the Japanese banks with correspondence agreements with North Korean banks to halt financial transactions. The Japanese banks have since entrusted the Ashikaga Bank to handle remittance requests from their customers. The Ashikaga Bank is a joint-venture bank that was established by North Korea and [pro-North Korea] ethnic Koreans residing in Japan and the bank with a long history of banking transactions with North Korea still maintains its correspondence agreement with North Korean banks. The bank, however, has suspended the handling of dollar-denominated remittance requests from other Japanese banks to North Korea since last April. According to the same financial source, "the bank has handled almost no dollar-denominated remittances to North Korea and the bank's decision to suspend dollar-denominated remittances to North Korea has had little impact on the total remittances by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea." If all the remittances by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North Korea are halted, however, its impact would be more extensive, and the ethnic Koreans residing in Japan are expected to react against the halt.
