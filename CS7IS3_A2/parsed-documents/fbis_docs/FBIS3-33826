In an article today, the paper notes a statement by a Zionist Energy Ministry spokeswoman that her government has received offers from some Gulf regimes to supply it with natural gas in line with cooperation agreements between the Zionist entity and Gulf regimes, including the Saudi regime and the rulers imposed on Kuwait. The paper adds: The devils are eager to supply the enemies of the nation with all the means of strength and existence, even before they sign a single item of the settlement accords. The parties to the settlement process are making more concessions so the Zionists will agree to sign these accords. The paper goes on: Iraq wanted those people to hold their heads high and to be loyal to their peoples, religion, heritage, and history. However, they chose treason and plunged their poisoned daggers into the backs of those who sought to protect them and who sacrificed the blood of their sons to protect them and save their dignity and glory. The Mother of Battles shall remain a major turning point in the history of humanity and in the struggle for man's glory and dignity.
