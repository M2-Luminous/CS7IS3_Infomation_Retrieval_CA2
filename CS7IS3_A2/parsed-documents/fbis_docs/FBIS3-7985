Kata Peli Nagy reports on the joint declaration by the two parties. [Nagy] The Fidesz and SZDSZ are ready to continue negotiations about the media law, but they do not want to sacrifice principles serving the impartiality of the media. So far, the two parties have been participating in the coordination of the media bill on two conditions: One, the government is to remedy the unfortunate situation reigning in the public media immediately and two: The future media law is to guarantee the impartiality of public service television in order that neither the present, nor any future government should be able to use it for party political purposes. However, the two parties' impressions regarding the talks are that the government is reluctant to be represented at the coordination, and Prime Minister Peter Boross has refused talks about the media situation. Here is Gabor Kuncze, leader of the SZDSZ election list: [Begin Kuncze recording] Mindful of the fact that only the government has any opportunity to intervene in the extremely bad situation that has evolved, we think that this is an indication that the present situation in the Hungarian television and radio suits the government only too well. It intends to maintain the situation until the elections, and it does not want to negotiate with the opposition about these issues. Therefore, if the necessary measures are not carried out, the Fidesz and the SZDSZ will leave the negotiating table. It is the government's turn to make a move. [end recording] [Nagy] The two parties evaluated the internal situation that has developed in the television and the radio as follows, I quote: MTV continuously violates the ethical code of election, it openly incites and slanders in several of its programs. MTV openly belongs to the government and in the radio an open political showdown, disguised as professional reorganization, is being prepared.
