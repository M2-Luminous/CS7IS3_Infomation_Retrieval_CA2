At the end of the ministerial seminar, eight measures for economic recovery and against unemployment have hit France. There was a breath of optimism as well. Are you confident? Is our economy getting better? [Balladur] Yes, indeed. And a number of figures show this. If you compare the situation ten months ago with what it is today, a number of improvements have appeared. The budget deficit is less than it was a few months ago, deficits in the social service budgets are much smaller, the deficit of the National Union for Industrial and Commercial Employment has been reduced to zero, interest rates have gone down by 40 percent, and -- more importantly -- we are gradually achieving growth, still timorously, but we are achieving it, and this year it will be positive. And finally, as far as unemployment is concerned, things look less dark, since in the first six months of 1993 there were 200,000 more people unemployed, and in the second [half of 1993] -- it is still a huge number -- there were 100,000 more, which is half as much, and this trend is being confirmed. [Giesbert] Do you have the figures? [Balladur] I have the figures that are to be issued today: In December, unemployment went up by 4,300 rather than the average of 30,000 which is what it was ten months ago. Of course, there is still a long way to go. [passage omitted] I am not happy with the situation. I do not find it satisfactory either. This is why we decided yesterday to adopt a number of measures to enable us to go further. [passage omitted] The French people are worried about the future -- and this is quite understandable. When there are more than three million unemployed in a country, there is almost one in every family or in a family they know well. So they are worried, and since they are worried they save a lot and do not consume enough. So our aim is to stimulate consumption, and that is why we adopted a number of measures, in particular connected with the motor industry and [words indistinct]. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Yesterday the government announced plans to pay car owners 5,000 francs to trade in their vehicles for new ones. You have thus given quite a helping hand to the motor industry which is in a very bad way. You said that things are getting better in some sectors, but they are not getting much better in the motor industry. [Balladur] No, indeed. The motor industry's turnover fell greatly in 1993, and that is one of the reasons why the revival of consumption must happen through the motor industry, as it must happen through housing, too. [passage omitted] The way I see things is that you have to encourage people to consume more. This can be done by reducing interest rates, by unfreezing workers' shares, by the measures we have taken over housing, by the ones we are taking today over the motor industry. In other words, nothing is ruled out of the area of our work and of our efforts. [Giesbert] You announced a decrease of 0.75 points in the payment rates of building and loan savings plans, which is currently six percent. That is not going to make you very popular. [Balladur] Excuse me, but this will reduce [the cost of] loans given to families when they want to buy their home. The two things are linked. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] There is a huge black spot: interest rates are much too high. Isn't this the explanation for our (?100) bankruptcies every day? [Balladur] Not at all, not at all. The short term interest rates were 11 percent when we came to power ten months ago, and now they are less than seven percent. Long term interest rates were 7.5, and on the whole they are now 5.5. Our rates are at the same level as those of all the European countries, including Great Britain -- without devaluation! This is a false problem. The truth is that interest rates must go down further, but in a natural way, because if we want to reduce them artificially, we shall have a crisis at the end of which we will have to raise them. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Do you expect to reduce income tax on households next year? [Balladur] We have already reduced it this year by 19 billion [francs]. It will be reduced again next year. [Giesbert] By how much? [Balladur] I cannot tell you today, but by an amount that will not be far off the same. [Giesbert] A little bit of politics: It is often said that you do not get on well with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Originally you said he was the best person to head the RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-Union for French Democracy] list for the European elections. Today you don't really seem to want this. Why? [Balladur] First, I get on well with all the ministers. I chose them, and if I chose them it was because I knew we could work well together. This applies to all of them, including the minister of foreign affairs, who is carrying out his job and his mission very well. [passage omitted]
