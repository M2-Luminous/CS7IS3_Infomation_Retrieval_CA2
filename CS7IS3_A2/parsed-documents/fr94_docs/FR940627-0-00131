FR940627-0-00131 FR940627-0-00019 EPA recognizes that current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original registration a list of all the potential additives that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. Under these circumstances, this final rule makes the non-baseline producer responsible for the testing of each oxygenate listed in the registration. For example, if a gasoline fuel registration lists methanol/co-solvent, ethanol, MTBE, and ETBE, then the manufacturer is responsible for separately testing each of four gasoline/oxygenate blends: gasoline-methanol/co-solvent, gasoline-ethanol, gasoline-MTBE, and gasoline-ETBE. The multiple testing responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in four applicable groups. In each group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest concentration of the oxygenate listed for any member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture would serve as the group representative to be tested to comply with the program's requirements. The existing fuel registration procedures also allow manufacturers to report a range of concentration-in-use for each bulk additive listed as a potential component of the registered fuel. Thus, it is possible for the same registration to include formulations under both baseline and non-baseline definitions. If so, the manufacturer is responsible for testing formulations in both categories covered by the indicated range listed in the registration. In other words, if the reported range of concentration-in-use of an added oxygenate could include gasoline formulations with less than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer is responsible for testing formulations in both baseline and non-baseline categories. For example, suppose a gasoline registration includes two potential oxygenates with respective concentration-in-use (shown here in terms of the resulting oxygen content in the formulation), as follows: ethanol (0 to 3.5 percent oxygen by weight) and ETBE (0 to 2.7 percent oxygen by weight). Because the indicated ranges include both baseline and non-baseline formulations, the manufacturer would be responsible for the testing of three formulations: baseline gasoline, a non-baseline gasoline-ethanol blend, and a non-baseline gasoline-ETBE blend. If the manufacturer chooses to participate in grouping arrangements, then he/she would be sharing the cost of the testing for the representative of each of these three groups. (b) Diesel. Non-baseline diesel formulations contain at least 1.0 percent oxygen by weight. Non-baseline formulations include alcohol blends, ether blends, biodiesels (e.g., diesel-soy methyl ester blend), and other formulations containing oxygenating compounds. Separate non-baseline groups are defined for each added alcohol or ether (e.g., methanol, ethanol, DME, etc.) and for other oxygenating compounds by class (e.g., peroxides, nitroso compounds, nitro compounds, alkyl nitrites, alkyl nitrates, animal-source alkyl esters, vegetable-source alkyl esters, furans, etc.). Diesel fuel manufacturers are responsible for the testing of each added alcohol, ether, or oxygenate class included in their fuel registration. For example, if the registration includes added methanol and soy methyl ester, the manufacturer will be responsible for testing two non-baseline formulations: (1) A diesel-methanol blend and (2) a diesel formulation containing a vegetable-source alkyl ester. In order to satisfy the testing requirements, the manufacturer may perform the tests individually or take advantage of the grouping provisions to share the testing costs with other manufacturers of similar products. In the above example, the manufacturer will be able to group with other manufacturers of diesel formulations containing methanol and with other manufacturers of formulations containing other vegetable-source alkyl esters (e.g., rape methyl ester). For each diesel non-baseline group defined by the presence of an alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound, the representative to be used in testing will be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the particular alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound, as recorded for any member of the group. For example, if manufacturers form a group of non-baseline diesel formulations containing vegetable-source alkyl esters, the group representative will be a diesel formulation containing the highest volume percent of any of the vegetable-source alkyl esters represented in the group. The alkyl ester is to be added to the base diesel fuel for conducting the required emission characterization and toxicity tests. EPA recognizes that current registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original diesel fuel registration a list of all the potential oxygenating compounds that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. As with gasoline formulations, this final rule requires the diesel fuel producer to test each alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenate listed in the registration. Also, if a registration lists a range of oxygen content that defines both baseline and non-baseline formulations, then the manufacturer is required to test both a baseline formulation and a non-baseline formulation. (c) Methanol. Non-baseline methanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain more than 4 percent by volume of substances other than methanol and gasoline. Individual groups are defined for each non-methanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative of each non-baseline methanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume) of the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s).
