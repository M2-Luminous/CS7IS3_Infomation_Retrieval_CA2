FBIS4-33169 "drlat107_a_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Authorities Concerned Over Embassy Takeover Authorities Concerned Over Embassy Takeover PA0206192594 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1735 GMT 2 Jun 94 PA0206192594 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Report by Marisol Marin] [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Although three more people left the Belgian Embassy in Havana last night, Cuban authorities are "very concerned" about the threat of suicide that was in a message sent by the 124 refugees to the press on Tuesday. Today, official sources expressed their concern to EFE, both for the "threat to commit suicide" and the fact that the refugees have formed an organization within the embassy grounds, on which they trespassed last Saturday to request asylum. In the message, the refugees announced their decision to create an organization called "Union of Cubans for Freedom;" they refused to hold talks with the government "for lack of guarantees" and said they were ready for anything, "even losing their lives." A high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be identified, stressed that the Cuban Government "has always honored its word and there is proof of that," in reference to the promise made to Belgian authorities that the refugees will not be punished after leaving the building. The official reiterated that the two countries agree these people must leave the building peacefully. The official also reported that Willy Verriest, special Belgian Government envoy who arrived on Tuesday, is cooperating so the refugees leave the embassy as soon as possible." "They have asked for time to convince the refugees and we will never violate Belgian territory," explained the source, who also complained about "the little cooperation received from the head of mission (Paul Veirmeirsch)." Diplomatic sources in Havana remarked that Verriest's arrival should expedite the solution to the problem, given that Ambassador Veirmeirsch seems to have had some communication difficulty with Cuban authorities. In short statements to the press, Verriest said the only thing that can be done is to convince the refugees to accept the guarantees given by the Cuban Government, "but this is not easy," he added. Verriest said: "We want a peaceful solution; the Cuban Government also wants a peaceful solution. None of us wants violence." Up until now, four people have left the diplomatic headquarters; one on Sunday and three yesterday. Their identities are unknown but, according to observers, they may be the last who, unexplainably, managed to enter the compound early Saturday morning by avoiding dozens of police. In a message sent to the press, the refugees said they suspected those four individuals were government security members. Meanwhile, the ambassadors of the European Union in Cuba have met three times in three consecutive days -- the last time was on yesterday, Wednesday -- but none of them has wanted to comment to the press. The wives of several ambassadors are actively cooperating in supplying food to the refugees and they regularly send snacks and other foodstuff, at the request of the Belgian ambassador. From the top of a ladder placed against a tree, a television channel was able to film a sort of a rustic scene in the gardens of the ambassador's residence yesterday afternoon. The children ran and played and the mothers, who were sitting down, were spending the afternoon peacefully. When he noticed the camera, a man said hello and then, with his hands, made the sign of victory.
