At the same time, the Russian air force and scientific and technological personnel are helping the CPC set up a large Su-27 jet maintenance center. Talks on transferring the Su-27 ground training simulator production technology are also under way. This shows that equipping the CPC's air force with Russia's new Su-27 fighters is just a matter of time. News from the Russian air force and the Sukhoi Design Bureau has confirmed that the first batch of 26 jets are the Su-27k model aircraft used by the navy and air force, that is, the already imported Su-33 model, which is produced in limited quantity. It is noteworthy that when the air unit of the Russian navy (stationed in the Kara peninsula) was equipped with the first batch of 12 Su-33 model jets, the firing and control system was redesigned at the request of the consumer. The new generation of Su-33 jets are refitted with SS35 firing control radar. The air and ground search distance (of the improved N-011 "Beetle" model) is 400 and 200 km, respectively. It can track 15 targets in the air at the same time and intercept 6 of them. The whole process of the Su-27 jet from take-off to searching targets, launching missiles, and returning is automatic, and it needs almost no manual operation. When the CPC's navy is equipped with the Su-33, it will undoubtedly become the best functional jet in Asia. It outshines the CPC's Su-27, which is now in service, and has the capability of attacking navy vessels and threatening warning systems. Meanwhile, the future trend of the weaponry such as the new Kh31 anti-vessel missile and the AA12 middle range air-to-air missile with a firing range of 400 km, which are in conformity with the Su-33 aircraft, also merit attention. If the CPC purchases these weapons, it will be able to change the comprehensive offensive and defensive structure across the Taiwan Strait. When something happens, it can make the most of the long-range advantage of the Su-27 (3,000 km) and use systems like the AA12 to attack Taiwan's warning systems from the northeast or southeast. The CPC's air force will possess a total of 52 jets when it is equipped with the second batch of Su-27. While its overall combat effectiveness has been enormously enhanced, the CPC will have more bargaining chips at the talks to obtain part of the Su-27 production technology. Viewed from the examples of Russian-Indian military cooperation, the transfer of production technology is carried out on the basis of a certain amount of imports. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the CPC will batch produce the Su-27 and turn it into the main combat force in the 21st century because it is costly, the production price for each aircraft reaching as high as $40 million. Moreover, the technology is complicated. Beset with economic difficulties, it seems that Russia simply cannot ensure a regular supply of technology and materials. The purchase of Su-27K once again proves that the CPC has taken the needs of both the navy and air force into account and has resolved the source of aircraft for the manufacture of medium and large aircraft carriers. There was hearsay about the CPC's interest in the vertaplanes on board the Yak-141, but the report was denied by the Yak Designing Bureau. Hence, the intention of the CPC to build a large aircraft carrier for fixed-wing planes is very clear.
