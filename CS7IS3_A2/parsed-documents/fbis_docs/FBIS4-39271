This enabled Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk to state, in an exclusive interview with a UKRINFORM correspondent, that the situation in the country will change radically in the next year or two owing to the extensive work on restructuring the economy. The adoption by Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers at the beginning of May of the decree "On Urgent Measures for Overcoming the Payments Crisis and Normalizing the Work of Enterprises" was the first step on that road. [Landyk] We must clearly specify what is meant. Today, the mutual insolvency of enterprises in Ukraine has reached 60 trillion karbovantsi [K]. The same situation also prevails in Russia. Payments are not transferred either there or to us. Production has been stopped again. All this time, a specific experiment was conducted: Every time a certain sum of money was injected, in other words, [monetary] emission was resorted to, the enterprises worked for two, three, or four months and... stopped again. [Yeremenko] In other words, they simply worked to fill warehouses and produced and stored products that nobody needed, and that was the end of it? [Landyk] Precisely. That is why, at the end of December and in January, we were faced with a dilemma: Whether to administer yet another monetary injection and raise prices by between three and five times or stop everything and say: "Well, enough is enough, let us address the problem in terms of the economy." [Yeremenko] However, how, being totally insolvent, can one extricate oneself from the standstill? [Landyk] There are two ways. Either monetary emission, which does not suit us, or an economic stimulation of production. We have analyzed the lists of all enterprises in order to see which of them (a) need to be taken under control, (b) whose products are in demand, and (c) only work to fill warehouses. The picture is appalling: Today, in Ukraine, the products of just 30 percent of enterprises are in demand. That is why the task is to assist those enterprises that manufacture competitive products. [Yeremenko] And close down the rest and throw the people into the street? [Landyk] No, it is also necessary to help them, but in the following way: To completely reprofile them and to change their production. Today, it is necessary to adopt a clear-cut system: At the beginning or at the end of the year, the marketing departments must travel through Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Poland, and Hungary and present their products, advertise them, and conclude contracts. Following that, all efforts must be focused on manufacturing those products for which there are contracts. Unless we realize this, we will not be able to get things going. In this connection, I believe that about 50 percent of directors need to be replaced. Nobody speaks of "creating" unemployment and throwing everybody into the street. This is incorrect and not normal. We must try and keep all those enterprises that are needed for the functioning of the economy of the sovereign Ukraine. Even if, for example, 1,000 people work there, it is necessary to have them employed. Once there is work, wages, and deductions to the budget, the social sphere will function. There will be economic turnover. We envisaged this in our program. It is also necessary to prepare documents, so that, starting from tiny steps, we could gradually raise the economy. [Yeremenko] How and on what principles? For example, there has long been talk that profits and not incomes need to be taxed. This is what is done everywhere in the world. [Landyk] That profit must be taxed is not subject to any doubt. Drafts of corresponding decrees will be submitted to the Supreme Council for consideration in the very near future. It is necessary to reduce the value-added tax, which presently constitutes 28 percent. I think that 20 percent will do. Moreover, we must look into the future, since there are different enterprises: For some of them, 20 percent may be assigned, whereas for others, 10 percent will be more than enough. In other words, there must be a differential approach. It is essential that people should be able to buy goods. Especially consumer goods. In some places, the excise duty needs to be reduced. Taxes should not render production inexpedient. Some people claim that the cancellation of taxes or excise duty will lead to a decrease of contributions to the budget. However, this is not so. If goods are selling, the state will also benefit from this. If there is stagnation, then there will be no value-added tax, sales tax, or excise duty. [Yeremenko] Such a situation prevailed in the Zaporizhzhya production association Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant. The prices of automobiles far exceeded K100 million. Mainly due to the exorbitant taxes, which rose above 65 percent of the automobile prices. As a consequence, nobody bought the cars and the warehouses became filled with automobiles. It was only after the administration managed to have the excise duty reduced and the prices lowered that the cars began to sell. Prior to that, the plant had stood idle for two weeks. Now, there is money, and production has been resumed. [Landyk] Here, the general director of the Zaporizhzhya Automobile Plant, Stepan Kravchun, showed perseverance and an ability to convince. The Cabinet of Ministers decided to help. The machine builders benefited from that, as well as the country's economy in general. Over this period of time, more cars have been sold than in the preceding three and a half months. Proceeding from the same circumstances, we decided to reduce the rates of the excise duty, in particular, on vodka, to 80 percent, various types of wine to 10 percent, cigarettes to 40 percent, color television sets to 10 percent, and to cancel the excise duty on black-and-white television sets and unprocessed alcohol. It is perfectly obvious that the state must hold the monopoly on the manufacture and sale of wine, vodka, and cigarettes. This is what is done in the majority of countries of the world, including highly developed ones, and this brings them large profits. [Yeremenko] All the more so since, even before, such a monopoly used to be one of the main sources of profit in our country. [Landyk] Yes, but then some people started hollering: This is illegal and contrary to market principles, let us open everything and import everything. It is not a matter of this being in line with the market or against the market. One must also know what the market is all about. The state, which manufactures alcohol that used to satisfy the needs of the entire Soviet Union in this sphere, must now import alcohol and not protect the interests of its own producers. However, the problem does not only lie in such a monopoly and not only in whether we should import or export alcohol, wine, or vodka. Our export-import policy is generally wrong and turned upside down. In addition to taxes on profits, the producer in Ukraine is so burdened by such obstacles created by licensing that he is actually rendered helpless. With regard to exports, we also have everything clearly specified. First, we will lower the prime cost of the output, as also the rates of various taxes. At the same time, imports will be regulated. It is necessary to protect our own producers. In this manner, we will emerge from the crisis. This may be called nonmarket methods. However, today, we must try to rescue our producers in every possible way and to prevent mass unemployment. When we emerge from the crisis, we will see what to do next. We have clearly adopted a course toward liberalizing exports and regulating imports. However, this does not apply to the CIS states. [Yeremenko] Incidentally, about the CIS. It looks like the Commonwealth countries fail to trigger this mechanism. In this country, debates are in progress on whether Ukraine should be a member of the CIS (Ukraine is one of its three founders) or whether it should abandon the Commonwealth. Nor is there a common attitude toward the fact that, after the dispute that lasted more than a year, Ukraine became an associated member of the CIS economic union. Many people express their fear that this may become a new channel for colonizing Ukraine and for enslaving it. [Landyk] Before answering this question, I want to focus on the European Economic Union. Why are the highly developed European countries uniting? In order not to admit us to that market. Moreover, in order to win over the market of the former USSR by joint efforts. Nobody is afraid of anything there. Work on introducing the single monetary unit -- the ECU -- is under way. That is why we must also unite in order to protect our own market. Here, I do not only see an economic union of the countries of the former Soviet Union, but also of Eastern European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, former Yugoslavia, and so on. It is our market, a market where our products may be in demand. We may sell our products in Russia and Russia in Ukraine. There is no other way. Our export potential is not that high and it mainly applies to raw materials. If we take our machinery, we do not, unfortunately, have much competitive equipment. It is, therefore, meaningless to give up this market. It will be occupied by others. I believe that Ukraine's joining the economic union of the CIS countries is an important step. It is shear nonsense to say that we may be drawn into something. There is no bondage of any kind. Frankly speaking, an associated member is in an even more advantageous situation that an effective one, as we have the right of choice, after all: We may or we may not take part in implementing a particular project. There is more freedom and room for maneuver. Besides, we will restore, stage by stage, technological ties and establish new ones. [Yeremenko] So far, just the first step has been made. [Landyk] It is also essential to elaborate an extremely complex mechanism and prepare a number of accords. We have already signed one -- on the creation of a free-trade zone. We are now discussing the need to proceed, stage by stage, to an economic and customs union. Altogether, 35 accords must be prepared. One can say that integration is a trend prevailing in the world, and we must integrate at least within the framework of former structures, but on a qualitatively new principle, which will be mutual advantage and not mutual dependence. [Yeremenko] All of these are global problems. What is being done specifically for every person and for every citizen of Ukraine? [Landyk] First of all, it is planned to conduct indexation of minimal wages and provide purpose-oriented support for low-income families. It is envisaged that the state will pay for the increase in the number of working positions. It does not matter what form of ownership a particular enterprise has. If it functions and creates working places, it will also receive subsidies. This is the mechanism of state stimulation. Well, we are also coming closer to a monetary reform, which is inevitable. In the first stage, this is the ban on the circulation of foreign currencies in Ukraine already this year. In the second stage, the hryvnya will be introduced. [Yeremenko] How much time will it take to implement the program? [Landyk] Here is the forecast: If all of these decisions are fulfilled and if we establish new economic ties and maintain the already existing ones, it will take at least two years.
