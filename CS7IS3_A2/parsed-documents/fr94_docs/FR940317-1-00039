FR940317-1-00039 FR940317-1-00011 3. Cable Services Bureau 41. Cable television systems. We seek comment on how to verify a cable television operator's regulatory fee obligation, which, as noted is based on its total number of subscribers. We propose to initially rely on a cable operator's good faith representation on its fee remittance form as to the number of subscribers it has as of the date of its annual regulatory fee payment. We also intend to perform random audits to determine whether individual cable systems have based their fee payments on the correct number of subscribers. Commenters are invited to suggest other alternatives. 42. As indicated above, we propose to allow installment payments for these regulatory fees if a cable television system's annual fee exceed $18,500.00 ( i.e., systems with more than 50,000 subscribers). 14 We propose that this amount be considered large in this context in part because it significantly exceeds the estimated average fee that will be paid by most cable systems. Specifically, according to our estimates, the average fee in this category will be approximately $1,914.00 in FY 1994. However, a relatively few systems (approximately 2 percent of all systems) will be subject to fees over $18,500.00 and significantly above the $1,914.00 average. These systems will pay, on average, a fee of approximately $36,000. Thus, we believe that $18,500 is a reasonable cut-off. Therefore, pursuant to the statute, we propose to permit cable systems whose regulatory fee for FY 1994 exceeds $18,500 to pay in two equal installments on the dates later specified by the Commission, subject to additional administrative and interest charges. We invite comment on this proposal. 14 The term ``subscriber'' is defined in section 76.5 of the Commission's Rules. 47 CFR 76.5. 4. Common Carrier Bureau 43. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communication operation as determined by number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas. We intend to rely on the Bureau's licensing data bases to confirm the identity and fee amount for most radio common carriers, to the extent possible. However, where the Commission does not have information on hand to verify a regulatory fee multiplier ( e.g. number of subscribers), we intend to rely on the good faith representations made on a regulatee's fee remittance form. We also intend to perform random audits to determine whether individual regulatees have reported the correct multiplier. Additionally, we request comment with respect to how well the specific regulatory fee multiplier set forth in the statutory schedule are ``reasonable related to the benefits provided'' to regulatees. 15 Commenters should proposed specific alternatives, which we may either recommend to Congress as technical amendments to the statutory schedule or incorporate into our own schedule of regulatory fees. 15 See 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(A). 44. Mobile services. Licensed personal communications services (``PCS'') will consist of a wide variety of commercial or private mobile communications services, including advanced paging, microcellular telephone communications, portable facsimile and other video and data transmission services. See generally, First Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100, 8 FCC Rcd 7162, 58 FR 42681 (August 11, 1993) on recon., FCC 94&hyph;30 (released March 4, 1994) (narrowband PCS); Second Report and Order, Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700, 58 FR 59174 (Nov. 8, 1993) recon. pending (broadband PCS). The statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted in the 1993 Budget Act established an annual fee of $60.00 per 1000 subscribers for PCS licensees. At the same time, the 1993 Budget Act recognized that PCS licenses have not yet been issued. In particular, Congress directed the Commission to conclude its PCS rulemaking proceedings (Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314 and ET Docket No. 92&hyph;100) by February 6, 1994, and to commence the PCS licensing process by May 7, 1994. 16 In addition, our new PCS service rules provide licensees five years to meet minimum construction requirements. Accordingly, since it is unlikely that may PCS licensee will have a significant number of subscribers in the immediate future, we tentatively conclude that no regulatory fees will be collected from PCS licensees during the 1994 fiscal year. We intend to begin assessing and collecting regulatory fees for PCS in the 1995 fiscal year. 16 Section 6002(d)(2), 1993 Budget Act. 45. Space stations. Domestic and international non-geostationary satellites, positioned in a low-earth orbit (``LEO''), may be authorized to transmit to satellites and fixed or mobile earth stations. These services include the new non-vioice, non-geostationary mobile-satellite service in bands below 1 GHz, see Report and Order, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;76, 8 FCC Rcd 8450, 58 FR 68053 (Dec. 23, 1993) and Mobile Satellite Services in bands above 1 Ghz, see Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;166, FCC 94&hyph;11 (released Feb. 18, 1994). Entities authorized to operate LEO systems will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $90,000.00 for each such system. We note that the Commission's new rules do not define how many space stations in low-earth orbit would constitute a ``system.'' See Below 1 GHZ Report and Order at para. 3. Although no LEO systems are currently operational, for purposes of assessing regulatory fees, we propose to require a LEO operator to begin paying annual regulatory fees in the fiscal year in which they launch the first satellite in their system even though all the space stations specified in its application or instrument of authorization have not become operational. We request comment on this proposal. While it appears unlikely that a LEO system will be launched in the 1994 fiscal year, should be LEO system be launched during that period, we tentatively propose to collect a regulatory fee for such launched systems and request comment on whether the entire annual fee amount should be required or if the fee should be assessed on a pro-rata basis.
