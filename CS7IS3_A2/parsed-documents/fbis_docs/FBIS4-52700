The Tokyo High Court on Oct. 20, 1993, ordered the government to pay 300,000 yen in compensation to Saburo Ienaga, 80, a noted historian and professor emeritus of Tokyo University of Education, the predecessor of Tsukuba University. Ienaga claimed the Education Ministry had illegally ordered him to change eight descriptions in a high school textbook on Japanese history he had written, and the high court accepted his complaint on three of the eight points. One point was an account of the 1937 Nanjing massacre, which the judge said reviewers were wrong to change and that the account was "the prevailing view in the academic community" at the time the book was screened. Another point, which had been accepted by a lower court, was the deletion of a passage saying the Imperial Government of the 1860's broke a promise to halve a tax on rice farmers. Ienaga and his lawyers met reporters and said the illegality of textbook screenings has been fixed for the first time. The lawsuit was the third filed by Ienaga in his nearly 30-year legal battle against textbook screening. According to precedents, the government is thought to have been able to appeal until Tuesday in a legal procedure called an incidental appeal, the lawyers said. The Education Ministry, however, said it had interpreted this differently and it is still able to appeal. Ienaga has appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the ministry's screening system violates a ban on censorship contained in the Constitution.
