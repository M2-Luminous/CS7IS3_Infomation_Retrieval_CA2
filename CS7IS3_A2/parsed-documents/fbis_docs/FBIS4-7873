Despite the general cutbacks, reports Pavel Jegl in the Prague daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY, this year's budget contains new line items for the creation of a rapid deployment force (Kc800 million), the restructuring of logistic systems (Kc500 million), and the modernization of the communications network (Kc300 million). Jegl writes that the Defense Ministry, emphasizing the reduced expenditures in the new budget, has labeled it a "survival budget." Miroslav Kalousek, the deputy defense minister, has been charged with developing a new system of planning, programming, and budgeting that is compatible with the systems of NATO member countries, notes Jegl. The new system is intended to facilitate the detection of wasteful expenditures and thus reduce costs. It should also make it easier to examine the expense structure, analyze revenue and expenditures, and make rapid budgetary adjustments. Kalousek told Jegl that the Czech military is in the process of redefining the nature of the threats facing the Czech Republic and is designing a force structure to meet such threats. He estimates that this redefinition of the defense system should be completed by the middle of this year.
