The third round of talks, which ended on Friday, revealed at least two problems where a compromise is hardly possible. They are the future political status of Abkhazia and conditions for the return home of refugees. The draft agreements on both these problems remained unsigned. The two sides agreed to renew negotiations in New York on March 7 on the proposal put forward by U.N. Secretary General's envoy Edward Brunner and backed by Russian envoy Boris Pastukhov. Pastukhov told ITAR-TASS that he "regretted that the round of talks had not brought the desired result". The only positive moment he could mention was the "motion towards a compromise" as both delegations confirmed that they welcomed the participation of the Russian military contingent in the UN peace- keeping operations in the conflict area.
