The fourth working-level contact, held at "peace house" on the southern side of the demilitarized zone, was attended by Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate, and his North Korean counterpart, Pak Yong-su. The two sides are meeting at Panmunjom to determine the date and agenda for the exchange of special envoys. The envoy exchange between the two Koreas was one of the conditions set in the U.S.-North Korean agreement worked out at their working-level contact in New York. Pyongyang must resume dialogue with Seoul if it wants to hold a third round of high-level talks with the United States, tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva. With the meeting, Seoul is expected to announce the suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise Team Spirit on condition that practical discussion toward the resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will be undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea.
