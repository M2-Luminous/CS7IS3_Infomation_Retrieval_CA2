Regarding this measure, Segundo Melendez, leader of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] legislative wing, has termed the sale of foreign exchange as the most appropriate way to combat the escalation of the U.S. dollar. The MAS deputy explained the implementation of this exchange policy reveals the state has enough resources to solve the country's financial crisis. Meanwhile, Henry Ramos Ayub, leader of the Democratic Action [AD] legislative wing, considered the sale of dollars by the Central Bank of Venezuela a necessary control measure, given the situation of collective irrationality. The AD deputy added exchange controls should have been established in the country long ago. Jose Miguel Uzcategui, leader of the National Convergence, said the sale of dollars by the Central Bank is the most transparent exchange control that can be established. In response to a poll conducted by Union Radio at the National Congress, most members of parliament agreed that the sale of dollars is a form of exchange control to contain the fears of citizens. In this regard, let us listen to Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui. [Begin Uzcategui recording] All those authorized to carry out exchange transactions go to the Central Bank, which quotes a price, and based on that price they conduct the sale. This is the most transparent exchange control mechanism that exists in the world. It does not account for the abuses of rigid exchange controls that exist in Europe. These controls greatly limit the purchase and sale of foreign currency. [end recording] Meanwhile, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower chamber's Finance Commission, said the following. [Begin Tarre Briceno recording] The first thing we must note is that there is no free sale of dollars. As a result, we are in the presence of a market subjected to some form of control. The sale mechanism is correct, because the demand will determine the value of the dollar within limited amounts offered for sale each day by the Central Bank. I think the closing of the market yesterday is more important than the dollar sale. By looking at how the day concluded yesterday, it appears nervousness is decreasing. [end recording] Radical Cause Deputy Ali Rodriguez thinks the government is improvising. [Begin Rodriguez recording] In any case, as we have stated systematically, we are responding to emergencies and we are not basing our response on a coherent strategic plan. I asked for the right to speak tomorrow at the Chamber of Deputies to discuss this crisis at the national level and its solution. [end recording] In the meantime, AD thinks it is necessary to wait and see the results of this mechanism implemented by the executive branch.
