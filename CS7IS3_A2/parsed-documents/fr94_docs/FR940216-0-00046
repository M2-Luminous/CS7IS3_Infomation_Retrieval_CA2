FR940216-0-00046 FR940216-0-00010 In view of ethanol's importance to the nation's energy security and agricultural economy, ethanol representatives urged that the proposal be revised to allow ethanol to effectively participate in the RFG market. They suggested several possible revisions. For example, they argued that the 1 psi waiver granted to certain ethanol blends by section 211(h) of the CAA be applied to ethanol-blended RFG under section 211(k). They reasoned that since Congress recognized in the provision requiring nationwide reductions in fuel RVP that ethanol required such a waiver, ethanol should receive a similar waiver if the VOC performance standard for RFG sold in the smoggiest cities were defined in terms of a required reduction in RVP. If the section 211(h) waiver were not available to RFG ethanol blends, the ethanol industry suggested that the VOC reduction requirement take into account that specific VOCs from various reformulated gasolines differ in their ozone formation potential. While ethanol raises a fuel's volatility and thus its VOC emissions, they argued that the resulting VOCs are less ozone-forming than those that would otherwise occur. They urged that the 15 percent reduction requirement should thus be interpreted to require a 15 percent reduction in ozone-forming potential, not simply mass of ozone-forming VOCs. Ethanol supporters suggested additional ways of encouraging or even requiring ethanol use in RFG. The Governors Ethanol Coalition, for instance, suggested that EPA require the RFG market to satisfy its oxygenate requirements through a minimum percentage of domestically produced renewable fuel. Based on ethanol's importance to the nation's energy and agricultural policy, President Bush on October 1, 1992 announced a plan to allow ethanol to effectively compete in the RFG program, with the expectation that, with barriers removed, ethanol use would grow. In lieu of an RVP waiver, or inclusion of ozone reactivity this plan was based upon provisions of section 211(k)(1) allowing the Administrator to take into consideration cost, energy requirements, and other specified factors in setting RFG performance standards. The most significant part of this plan called for EPA to ``establish rules for reformulated gasoline in all northern cities that will have the effect of granting a one-pound waiver for the first 30 percent market share of ethanol blends, while achieving environmental benefits comparable to those provided for in EPA's proposed rule and regulatory negotiation.'' The environmental benefits of the proposed RFG program would be maintained by offsetting any increase in volatility of RFG containing ethanol with reductions in the volatility of the rest of the reformulated gasoline pool. In response to the announcement by former President Bush, EPA proposed on February 26, 1993 provisions to provide an RVP (and VOC) incentive for the use in reformulated gasoline of renewable oxygenates such as ethanol. B. Concerns With the Proposal At the time of the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA had a number of concerns with respect to its legality, energy benefits, and environmental neutrality. Nevertheless, we proposed the provisions for public comment in the hope that these concerns could be overcome based on new data and information developed in-house or received through public comment. Since the time of the proposal these concerns have been enhanced. Additional data and information has been developed which indicates that energy benefits would be unlikely to occur as a result of the proposal. While the production of much of the ethanol in the country produces on the margin more energy and uses less petroleum than went into its production, a recent study by the Department of Energy (refer to DOE's comments on the proposal) indicates that the margin disappears when ethanol is mixed with gasoline. The energy loss and additional petroleum consumption necessary to reduce the volatility of the blend to offset the volatility increase caused by the ethanol causes the energy balance and petroleum balance to go negative. Since the potential energy benefits were the basis in the proposal for providing the incentives for renewable oxygenates, the justification for the proposal no longer exists. Additional data and information has also been developed which indicates that VOC emissions would increase significantly under the proposal. As discussed in section I of the RIA, the commingling effect of mixing ethanol blends with non-ethanol blends in consumer's fuel tanks, the effect of ethanol on the distillation curve of the blend, and unrestricted early use of the complex model combined result in roughly a 6&hyph;7.5% increase in gasoline vehicle VOC emissions even though there is no increase in the average RVP of in-use gasoline. As a result, the proposal would have sacrificed 40 to 50 percent of the VOC control that is required under section 211(k) for reformulated gasoline in exchange for incentives for what is likely to have been only a marginal increase in the market share of ethanol in reformulated gasoline and no energy benefits or cost savings. As discussed in section I of the RIA, ethanol is not excluded from competing in the reformulated gasoline market under the provisions of the April 16, 1992 SNPRM. As a result of the economic advantage of ethanol over other oxygenates, ethanol should maintain a significant market share under the reformulated gasoline program even without the renewable oxygenate incentives proposed in the February 16, 1993 proposal. As a result, the actual ethanol market share increase as a result of the renewable oxygenate provisions would be expected to be far less than the maximum of 30% for which incentives were provided. Given the relatively small increase in ethanol demand as a result of the renewable oxygenate provisions in exchange for such a large loss in the environmental control of the reformulated gasoline program, there does not appear to be any justification for promulgating these provisions. Furthermore, comments were received from virtually all parties, including ethanol industry representatives, that the proposal was unworkable and would significantly increase the cost of the reformulated gasoline program. While EPA maintains that the program would have provided an economic incentive for the use of renewable oxygenates in reformulated gasoline up to a 30% market share, EPA acknowledges that the proposal would have intruded into the efficient operation of the marketplace, impacting the cost of the reformulated gasoline program. As a result, after taking into account the cost, non-air quality and environmental impacts, and energy impacts, EPA has found itself with no choice but to back away from the renewable oxygenate provisions of the February 26, 1993 proposal.
