Over the past four decades, the ROC in Taiwan, supported by the determination and solidarity of our compatriots who fought arduously, overcame numerous difficulties, and created a multiparty democratic political system unprecedented in the history of the Chinese nation, setting an example for the world's developing countries in economic development and political democracy. The people of the whole country are proud of this achievement. However, the world keeps on revolving and the international situation keeps on changing. Not only should we not feel complacent with ourselves, but we should step forward bravely to meet the challenges of the future. Today, with the end of the Cold War and the international order waiting to be rebuilt, the ROC is still confronted with the Chinese Communist regime, which is pursuing a dictatorial rule and accelerating its military strength and has never abandoned its ambition to invade Taiwan with force. While doing our best to cope with fast-changing international relations, we must break the Chinese Communists' diplomatic blockade to win a place in the international community. Especially after we have become economically prosperous and created a democratic political system, we must work harder to improve the quality of life and attach importance to human dignity. We must seek consensus with regard to traditions and modernization and concepts and behavior so we can join hands in creating peace and harmony. Our past efforts have laid a sound foundation for future development. Henceforth, with the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties and build a modern, prosperous, and urbane society in which there is justice and mutual respect. The Foundation of the Rule of Law Is Improving Since I was elected the eighth president of the ROC by the National Assembly, I have always been aware of the heavy responsibility on my shoulders, and I hope the foundation for the rule of law needed for our country's long-term development will be built at an early date. To deal with the matter of constitutional reform before the country's reunification, four years ago we invited noted figures at home and abroad to a conference to discuss state affairs. We have made a big stride forward in constitutional reform based on the measures adopted at the conference. According to our reform procedures, we terminated the period of mobilization for the suppression of the communist rebellion; opened up a new era of peaceful competition between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait; retired the deputies to the First National Assembly; and elected new deputies to the Second National Assembly. We have also built a legal basis for local self-government. Clear standards were established for the development of the economy, science and technology, environmental protection, agriculture, and fishing industry; for the advancement of health insurance for the whole people; and for the protection of the rights and interests of women, handicapped people, aborigines, compatriots in the Kinmen and Matsu region, and Overseas Chinese. As for the method of electing the president and vice president and other related questions, they concern the perfection of the system of constitutional government and their impact will be far-reaching. With regard to these issues, I trust the deputies will heed the people's will, pool your wisdom, and make the most appropriate decision in accordance with the basic framework of the five-power Constitution after analyzing the present state of the development of constitutional government in our country and the needs for national reunification in the future. In implementing democracy, the establishment of party politics is a major task that should be neglected. The more plural and open the society is, the more it will rely on political parties to play a role in integrating values and forming a consensus. Currently, our party politics have not operated in a mature way; however, as long as we are open-minded, far-sighted, have the daring to institute the system, and tolerate and respect each other, we will make our ideal come true in a short time. In implementing constitutional reform, the political structure and development objectives, following the end of the mobilization for the suppression of communist rebellion period, will be readjusted. How to implement the revised Constitution in terms of laws and policies, is a major task that should be carried out earnestly by our government. Today, since our democratic society is taking shape, we are confident and determined that the ROC will become a first-class country in the world and our people, first-class people in the world. Economic Construction That Increases Our Actual Strength Over the past four decades, the ROC has concentrated efforts on economic development and created an "economic miracle" that attracts worldwide attention. The solid national strength we have built has not only improved the standard of living but has also become a powerful backing force for expanding international relations. Under a situation of global economic recession, our economic growth rate was 5.9 percent in 1993 -- evidence of a brisk economy. However, in the face of the challenges of domestic economic transition and readjustment of an international economic order, we should accelerate structural readjustment and increase our economic strength, so as to score even greater economic achievements. Therefore, in 1993 our government proposed an "Economic Revitalization Package" and 12 projects in an attempt to strengthen basic construction of our society, stimulate investment from the private sector, accelerate upgrading industries, and make greater contributions to the world economy. To implement the policy on economic revitalization, our government has worked out some concrete supporting measures. In instituting systems, we should accelerate liberalizing and internationalizing our economy and privatizing the government-run enterprises, as well as institute a legal and institutional framework in line with international practices. In improving manpower quality, we should encourage even more scientists and technicians abroad to start an undertaking in our country, assist enterprises at home to engage in research and development on high technology products, and improve the technological level. In land utilization, we are pushing forward policies on releasing farmland and improving land utilization, so as to return interests from land development to the whole nation and lighten the financial burden of public construction. International trade is the main force of our economy. Changes in the international economic climate will have an impact on domestic economic development. The international economic system has undergone drastic changes in recent years. The formation of North American and European economic blocs in 1993, operation of the "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation" forum in an active way, and agreements reached at the Uruguay Round show that in the future, a new international economic order will be established under the two major axes of regional economic integration and trade liberalization. In view of this situation, our government has made positive and responsive preparations. First of all, we will make positive efforts to join international economic organizations to secure international dialogue channels. We are now prepared to join GATT. Although this will have some impacts on the domestic markets, the government will take prudent measures to safeguard the rights and interests of farmers and domestic industries. Second, in addition to continuing to strengthen bilateral trade relations with Japan, the United States, and Europe, we will actively promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, especially our economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations. By doing so, we will be able to make use of Southeast Asia's rich resources and help countries in this region develop their economies, thus establishing cooperative and mutually beneficial relations with them. Moreover, Taiwan's good geographical position is also a favorable factor that we can make good use of. We will woo international enterprises to invest in Taiwan in a planned manner and use Taiwan as a base for entering the Asia-Pacific market, to develop Taiwan into the business center of the Asia-Pacific region, and to expand the space for Taiwan's long-range development. A Newly-Born and Diversified Culture Culture is a heritage of history, crystallization of wisdom, and distillation of social activities. A glance at world history tells us that only societies with a highly developed economy and in which people can freely express their will can develop a spectacular culture. Therefore, a country's cultural level is an important indicator of its national strengthens. Today, the ROC has created an affluent and democratic society that had never been seen in Chinese history. We will work even harder to add new vitality to the Chinese culture. The Chinese nation has a long history and rich cultural heritage. This of course is an inexhaustible resource. But, culture is not historical ruins that never change -- it should be a life force that continues to grow in daily life and spiritually. Therefore, we must not let the substance of culture be confined within traditional cultural relics and classic inheritance. Instead, we should inject new vitality into our traditional culture to create new life. To bring about new cultural development, the government, in addition to continuing to protect and promote our fine traditional culture, will encourage the people to assimilate all kinds of cultures and to blend them with our traditional culture so that our traditional culture will assume a brand new look. Because Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are at the edge of the Asian continent, they have been a region where Oriental and Western cultures meet and where continental and oceanic characteristics merge -- this region is the most ideal place for the development of a diversified culture. Therefore, we can now see that cultural and artistic activities have developed vibrantly in this region and can feel the vigor born out of various cultures. The cultural potential accumulated by all our social strata is now ready to be released and the "new Chinese culture" will blossom soon. Following our economic and political accomplishments, culture will be another sphere in which we score great achievements. A Streamlined, Solid, and Strong National Defense Force National security is the precondition for a nation's survival and a society's development, and a strong national defense force is the cornerstone of national security. Although currently the international situation tends to be relaxed, regional conflicts have erupted around the world from time to time. In Asia, North Korea is developing nuclear weapons and there are disputes over territorial sovereignty and resources in the South China Sea, casting clouds of instability over countries in this region. And, in recent years, the Chinese Communists have continued to increase their defense budget, expand their naval and air force armament, purchase sophisticated weapons, and redeploy their troops in the mainland's southeast coastal areas. All this has increased the potential threat to us. For this reason, maintaining a strong national defense force is still an important goal of our policy. Our current defense policy is to build a high-quality defense force of fewer men and high combat capability; and to devise a defense strategy according to the priority order of gaining air superiority and command of the sea and developing an anti-landing force, according to the principle of developing the three armed services in a balanced way, and starting from reducing the size of the troops, increasing the troops' firepower, and improving the troops' mobility. In recent years, we have readjusted the military's organizational structure, downsized the troops, improved the military education system, refined the noncommissioned officer system, updated our weapons and armament, improved the troops' training, revised and restructured the logistics system, and improved the livelihood of military officers and men to build a strong and dependable defense force. The idea of building up the Armed Forces at the current stage is, based on future combat requirements and the available national defense manpower and financial resources, to plan for the defense force for the next decade, to downsize the troops, to maintain an ever-ready force, and to maintain a large number of reserve personnel. In addition to gradually reducing the troops to 400,000 men, we are studying changing the mobilization system to maintain a large number of reserve personnel during peace time and to enable them to swiftly support combat when war breaks out. Without national defense, there is no national security, hence, no construction and prosperity. Modern national defense is all-people defense. I hope all the people, based on our common sense of patriotism, will regard national defense as an important link in the nation's development and will unite to support our national defense efforts to build a modern national defense system to ensure the nation's security. Cultivate a Mutual-Trust Cross-Strait Relationship The ROC Government's mainland policy is to achieve national unification following the procedures laid down in the Guidelines for National Unification and on the basis of democracy, freedom, and equal distribution of wealth. Over the last few years, the government has gradually lifted control over people-to-people communications between the two sides of the Strait, thus gradually increasing cross-Strait relative visiting and exchange in the economic, trade, cultural, academic, and sports fields. This development is very important to enhancing mutual understanding between the two sides. The two sides across the Strait have been split and governed separately for more than four decades. As a result of different ideologies, there is a giant gap between the two sides in terms of politics, economics, and social systems. To narrow the gap and seek a consensus, the two sides should accumulate experience and build mutual trust through various talks and routine consultations. The Koo-Wang meeting held in Singapore in April 1993 has set up channels for institutionalized contacts and talks and has worked out some topics for future discussions. This concrete result is a good start in institutionalizing and regularizing cross-Strait interaction between the nongovernmental organizations. In the years ahead, the ROC will continue to adhere to the principle of rationality, peace, equality, and reciprocity to develop cross-Strait relations. However, we would also like to reiterate that the Chinese Communist authority, refusing to face the reality that the two sides are split and governed separately, is the major reason the two sides have not been able to build a mutual trust. We want to solemnly call on the Chinese Communist authority to face the new cross-Strait situation of peaceful competition with a new understanding, knowledge, and policies and to make contributions to opening a new chapter in Chinese history. Foreign Relations Promoted in a Practical Way After the ending of the Cold War, the international situation has shifted from military standoff to economic cooperation. In view of the international situation, the focus of the ROC's diplomatic work is to fully utilize its economic power and show its sincerity and competence to share and fulfill international responsibilities, so as to call international attention to the fact that the ROC on Taiwan exists and to call respect for ROC's aspiration and rights to participate in international affairs. As far as concrete policies are concerned, our government has earnestly developed substantial relations with countries around the world and strived to join in international organizations to promote international cooperation and to seek peaceful settlement for international issues through multilateral consultations, according to the principle of making extensive friendly contacts and making contributions to the international community, In recent years, we have scored remarkable results in strengthening relations and expanding cooperation and exchanges with countries with or without diplomatic ties with our country. Many countries have broken the past taboo to develop a higher level of contacts with our country. Over the past year, international leaders such as former British prime minister, Madame Thatcher; former U.S. President, Mr. Bush; and former USSR president, Mr. Gorbachev came to visit our country. These visits have further widened our international horizon and have called international attention to our country. In February this year, I visited the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. I met with the heads of state of the three countries and exchanged views with them. This is an important milestone in the cooperative relations between our country and Southeast Asian countries and is a pioneering move to expand all-directional international relations for our country. In developing multilateral relations, we will continue to push our established policy of joining the United Nations. In addition, we will not give up any opportunity to participate in international organizations or international meetings, so as to expand our area of activity in the international arena and to establish an international status for our country. Even though the Chinese Communists have vainly attempted to undermine our international relations and downgraded our international status, our determination to expand pragmatic diplomacy will never change. Because the ROC is a peace-loving country, we are earnestly willing to do our best to join the countries and peoples of the world in working for peace, cooperation, and prosperity of the human race. With Consensus, Success Can Be Expected Ladies and gentlemen, since I was elected president, I have always been aware of my heavy responsibility. I have constantly encouraged myself, and I hope that with your support and the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, the goal of enhancing the people's welfare and establishing a system under which the country is well-governed and enjoys lasting stability will be realized. The road we have traveled over the past four decades proves that we have been making efforts in the right direction. We have not worked in vain. Today, the economic prosperity, the practice of democratic politics, and social stability in the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions show we are already standing on another new historical starting point. As we look into the future, we see the world situation is changing and treacherous. The situation in Mainland China is unpredictable, and we are being tested by numerous obstacles and difficulties. However, our successful "Taiwan experience" tells us that so long as the people of the country form a consensus on "the community of life" and enhance the plentiful vitality of society, they will be able to stand firm like a rock and create another new situation. The 21st century is approaching. To meet the challenges of the new era, we must widen our horizon. The ROC can neither alienate itself from the mainland nor isolate itself from the world. Henceforth, we will, of course, continue our reform and respect the people's will. We will not only build the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions into a modern society that conforms to world trends and advanced standards, but we will also strive to lay a solid foundation for a free, democratic, prosperous, and unified New China. In conclusion, let us wish the ROC and its people prosperity and peace! At the same time, I wish you all good health and happiness! Thank you.
