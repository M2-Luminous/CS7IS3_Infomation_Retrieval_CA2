Maragay] [Text] President Ramos created yesterday a new body that will oversee the implementation of projects for the social and economic rehabilitation of rebels who have returned to the folds of the law. The Chief Executive issued Executive Order (EO) No. 152 creating the National Program for Unification and Development (NPUD) to replace the National Reconciliation and Development Program (NRDP) which had been rendered inoperative due to the deletion of its P200 million budget from the 1994 general appropriations act. In the same EO, Mr. Ramos formed the three-man National Program for Unification and Development Council (NPUDC) to be headed by Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III. The NPUDC will have Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and Presidential Adviser on Peace Process Oscar Santos as vice chairman and member. The creation of the NPUDC is seen as a rebuff to the Senate's withdrawal of funding to the rebel-returnees program that was tantamount to the abolition of the NRDP. The Senate chopped off the P200 million rebel-returnee program over the vehement objection of Malacanang which warned that such action would jeopardize the peace and reconciliation program. The alleged rampant irregularities in disbursements of rebel- returnee fund induced the Upper Chamber into scrapping the said funding. The senators gave credence to reports that funds were released for fake rebel-returnees and even ghost surrenderees. Malacanang, however, said that action was being taken to check the alleged anomalies. The [Malacanang] palace said even assuming that these anomalies existed, this was not sufficient ground to withhold funding for the program.
