The families of the two were notified to receive the bodies last Thursday. On 17 February, the military court sentenced to death three people: Midhat al-Tahhawi, Hamadah Lutfi, and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id Salih (fugitive). The court also sentenced Fathi Muhammad Khattab, Khalid Faraj, and Khalid Rashad to 10 years in prison. Observers have noted that the indictment and trial were carried out quickly, with the whole case taking no more than one month. It all began when security services, in an inspection campaign in Abu Za'bal in mid-January, accidentally arrested one of the suspects. After that, the military prosecution prepared the indictment and the military court began its hearings on 30 January. Three court sessions were held in 10 days, and families of the suspects were not allowed to contact their sons or appoint lawyers to defend them. The court appointed the defense lawyers. Najar al-'Arabi, secretary of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization, commented on the military court ruling by saying: The trial was extremely hasty, and the defense could not perform its duty. The new executions only exacerbate the phenomenon of political executions; law organizations have repeatedly called for halting them and for the defendants to be allowed to appear before civilian judges.
