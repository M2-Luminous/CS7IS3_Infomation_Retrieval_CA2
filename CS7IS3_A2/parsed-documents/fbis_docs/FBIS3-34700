You said he should sweat it out in Tunis. And yet in the end, he accepted practically every demand Israel posed in the sphere of security. Has 'Arafat changed in any way? [Rabin] I am not saying he accepted every demand; we too compromised here and there. I thought there were basic things on which we had to insist, and I am happy that the sides drew closer to each other on that. I do not want the outcome to be presented as if he alone did all the conceding; we did some too. [Rosen] What concessions did we make? [Rabin] We ceded on several issues pertaining to the border crossings; several issues pertaining to the right to hold Muslim religious rituals in al-Nabi Musa, for instance; to permit the holding of baptism rituals in the Jordan River three times a year, and in special cases that have to be coordinated with us; even with a flag. [Raz] Yet last night, before the agreement was signed, you and the military advisers who surrounded you seemed to be wavering, unsure that the agreement should be signed. [Rabin] Not at all wavering or unsure, rather anxious to do everything to ensure our vital security issues. Allow me to add something: I have been hearing criticism of the Army involvement. I am simply unable to understand both politicians and media people. I remember when I once said I did not involve the Army in the months-long negotiations -- the secret Oslo negotiations which gave us the Declaration of Principles [DOP] -- there was an outcry of criticism: How can you keep the Army out of it? That was a matter of principle, a political decision. Now, when the implementation of that agreement is at stake, the implementation of security issues, I see it as my pragmatic As#?V????l duty to involve the Army. [Rosen] Someone wrote about a putsch this week. [Rabin] Right. I have never heard baloney worse than that. [passage omitted] [Raz] I assume a meeting between you and 'Arafat should not be expected in the near future. [Rabin] I see no reason to attend such a meeting before everything is finalized. [Rosen] I assume this will not happen before 13 April. [Rabin] There are no sacred dates. Even the DOP stipulates that the dates are based on the assumption that agreements will be attained. From my point of view, what matters is attaining an agreement that, with all this complexity, stands a chance to succeed.
