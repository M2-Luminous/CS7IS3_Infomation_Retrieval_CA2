More than 17.73 billion yuan ($2.03 billion) worth of bonds had been sold by last Saturday, according to the People's Bank of China. The sales included 8.13 billion yuan ($934.4 million) in two-year bonds and 9.6 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in three-year bonds. This year, China is planning to issue 87 billion yuan ($10 million) in two- and three-year bonds--twice as much as last year. Bonds have sold better in large cities than in small- and medium- sized cities. They have also had a warmer welcome in urban areas than in rural areas, and in inland provinces than along the coast. In Beijing alone, the sales volume for the first nine days amounted to nearly 2.9 billion yuan ($333.3 million). Shanghai also tallied up more than 2.5 billion yuan ($287.3 million) in sales. But in some places, the issuance of treasury bonds has not been as successful due to competition from other high-yield investments. Analysts said the receptivity to this year's treasury bonds is good news for the government, which has high expectations for the bonds. Starting this year, bonds are the government's sole method to offset the national deficit--estimated at 60 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year. Bond sales are attractive this year because of the financial reform that began last year. The unauthorized raising of capital has been stopped, which frees up more capital for bond sales. The bonds' high interest rates also spark interest. This year's two-year bonds go for 1.3 percentage points higher than bank deposits for the same term. The three-year bonds are 1.72 percentage points higher.
