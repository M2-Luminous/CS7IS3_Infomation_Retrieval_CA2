NATO's military operation against the Serbs in Bosnia last night has obviously brought about a change to the agenda for the talks between Milosevic and Churkin, as well as a change in the timetable of the Russian envoy's visit. Instead of travelling to Zagreb, as he initially planned, Churkin will pay an urgent visit to Pale. Following his two hour talks with President Milosevic, Churkin described the latest situation in Bosnia in the wake of NATO's military operation as a very serious one, stressing that the peace process has been pushed down a dangerous ravine. In Churkin's words, at the moment Moscow's diplomatic efforts are being invested in such a way whereby the tragic experience in Gorazde will not be repeated anywhere else in Bosnia. In this context he told reporters that he was immediately setting off for Pale where he will talk to representatives of the Serb republic. He did not rule out contacts with other sides, including the Americans too. The Russian envoy said that President Milosevic today had asked him to try and help in order to have this present dangerous situation overcome. We are aware of the problems arising between the Bosnian Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]. I nevertheless believe that we can help in restarting the negotiating process. In Churkin's opinion, it is now of crucial importance to reach a firm agreement on the cessation of hostilities across the entire territory of Bosnia, including Gorazde. One of the questions addressed to Churkin was whether NATO had consulted Moscow before attacking the Serb positions around Gorazde. No, we were not informed about the attack, Churkin said. He added that Moscow had certain objections about the level of communication between all factors involved in the Bosnian conflict. He said that Moscow had received assurances from the Bosnian Serbs that nothing serious would happen in Gorazde. He stressed that if Russia had been more involved and better informed about the situation around Gorazde, certain things would not have happened, obviously hinting to last night's NATO attack. In the Russian envoy's opinion, NATO's military action will have no influence on the relations between Moscow and Washington. He said that Russia and the United States are working together to solve the Bosnian conflict, that sometimes they had different approaches, but that was not a reason to give up on joint action. Churkin expressed hope that, by working together, Moscow and Washington could achieve a lot in order to bring the situation, which is now exceptionally dangerous, back to normal. Asked whether NATO's consultation with Moscow about yesterday's action would have been necessary, Churkin said yes. He believes that not only consultations between NATO and Moscow would have been necessary, but that it was particularly important that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali should have informed Russia about what was going on around Gorazde. However, Butrus-Ghali did not do that, and Churkin sees the great speed in the development of the situation around Gorazde as the only justification for that. In the end, stressing the necessity of better communication between the crucial players in the Bosnian conflict, Churkin said that he hoped that NATO would learn a lesson from yesterday's action and not do that again.
