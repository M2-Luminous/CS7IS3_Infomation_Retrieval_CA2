FR940930-1-00049 FR940930-1-00015 Rulemaking Analyses and Notices Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This proposed rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The notice is not considered significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); because it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect of extending a compliance date. The original regulatory evaluation of the final rule has been modified because this proposed rule would reduce costs and is available for review in the docket for this notice. Federalism Assessment This proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the relationship between the Federal Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), RSPA has determined that this notice does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulatory Flexibility Act There are very few small entities that operate pipelines affected by this rulemaking. To the extent that any small entity is affected, the effect is minimal because it does not impose additional requirements and has the effect of extending a compliance date. Based on these facts, I certify that under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 192 Pipeline safety, Reporting and recording requirements. In consideration of the foregoing, RSPA proposes to amend title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations part 192 as follows: PART 192_[AMENDED] 1.

In ยง192.150, the introductory text of paragraph (b) is republished without change, paragraph (b)(8) would be redesignated as paragraph (b)(9) and revised, paragraph (b)(7) would be redesignated as paragraph (b)(8) and revised, a new paragraphs (b)(7) and (d) would be added, to read as follows: ยง192.150 Passage of internal inspection devices. * * * * * (b) This section does not apply to: * * * * * (7) Replacements in transmission lines in Class 1 or 2 locations (other than replaced line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component) if the operator can demonstrate that modifying the line section to accommodate instrumented internal inspection devices: (i) is not feasible; and (ii) is not, based on an assessment of the operating and maintenance history of the line section, needed for future safety.
