He is deputy chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of Industry. [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, you have devoted all your life to shipbuilding and you are well acquainted with all the stages of boom and decline in the Russian Navy's history. In your opinion what kind of stage is it going through now? [Voronin] A stage of decline, of course. It takes time to do what we have to do to overcome this stage in accordance with the new military doctrine -- with smaller numbers but higher quality, as the saying goes. But so far there has not been enough time for the Navy to acquire new qualities, that is for it to obtain new, high-precision weapons, more modern ships and command and control systems, and so on. Speaking in broad terms, we currently have no military equipment program, whereas in the past we had plans for 10-15 years in advance. [Gundarov] Just how long do we still have to wait? [Voronin] We have been waiting for a program for over 18 months. It has now been finalized and signed, but it is not yet an official document which could be sent to our plants. I think it will be approved in the first quarter of this year. But the program is not dogma. Obviously it will still be subject to amendment, hopefully in the direction of increasing the fleet's combat strength. [Gundarov] The press has repeatedly expressed the opinion that the current reduction in the number of Navy ships is the consequence not only of the USSR's geopolitical disintegration and the economic crisis in Russia, but also of mistakes made in drawing up the preceding shipbuilding programs.... [Gundarov] Everything can be doubted and criticized with the benefit of hindsight. For example, many people say that we should not have built aircraft carriers; they say it was too expensive. But what is cheap? At that historical stage, given the military doctrine and given the confrontation with NATO and in particular with the United States, our shipbuilding program designed to take us through the year 2000 was, I believe, correct. It was elaborated and approved at collegiums of various ministries: defense, shipbuilding, and others. I do not deny that mistakes are made in any business. We sometimes philosophize that everything should be decided collectively -- by some kind of oblast committees, soviets, or collegiums. Nevertheless the role of the individual will, I think, always influence specific decisions. Recently I went to America and England and saw how things are done there. There the role of the individual, judging by what happens, is simply staggering. Although outwardly it is less noticeable, maybe because everyone there has more freedom. [Gundarov] We are now in Russia, where there have always been people with a preference for certain types of ship. So it would be interesting to find out which ships you have a preference for. [Voronin] I have a preference for the Navy as a whole. I have carefully studied U.S. naval doctrine. By the year 2000 their combat effectiveness will have increased 100 percent. Not through the number of ships but through the quality of new weapons and power-generating systems, in short, through science. Everything there is resolved in a comprehensive manner. At the same time it should be noted that many countries have decided to build small aircraft carriers designed to take 15-20 Harrier-type aircraft. I believe that we too should have these aircraft carriers in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. They could be built in St. Petersburg or Severodvinsk. We have the stocks on which to do that. But I am concerned by what the Americans are doing now while we are doing nothing. We have started work to salvage old ships and submarines. While the United States is practically ceasing its involvement in salvaging and is converting old ships into training ships. A ship can be made ready for combat again within a month or two. [Gundarov] Do you yourself believe that? [Voronin] Generally it is hard to believe in something 100 percent. But I know that the work is being done. I do not think that they will be able to convert all old ships into training ships, but here we often write off even quite new ships for scrap. [Gundarov] For example, the aircraft carrying cruiser Kiev? [Voronin] Its fate has still not been decided, but it is predetermined. [Gundarov] Why can we not take the same road as the Americans? [Voronin] We are probably prevented from doing so by a kind of "special Russian genotype." All the time we are trying to make economies without investing money in anything. In two years we have not built a single surface ship. But the problem of repairing old ships is not being solved either. So far only the salvaging of submarines has been "stoked up" because ship-repair plants, which have no other orders at present, have clutched at this work like a straw. [Gundarov] What is in store for the Navy in the near future? [Voronin] We have worked out a program through 2003 in which we have taken account of the new military doctrine's demands. The program is based above all on the real situation in industry. Every plant has a so-called "red" technological line below which the plant must not go, in order to prevent the disintegration of production sectors. The illogical thing is that conversion has proceeded apace, that is, it has been several times greater than that originally planned. For example, we have enterprises where the main production decreased 80 percent in one year. In this situation no economic formula works any more. That is why, when elaborating the economic program, we took as our basis the task of maintaining production. But even our minimal program, it turned out, costs four times as much as the budget available to the Defense Ministry. I know that the Defense Ministry is currently battling with the Finance and Economy Ministries. To avoid a total collapse we have been forced to take a risk: To put new systems, instruments, and units into production without having official documents for doing so. [Gundarov] Are you not afraid that in five years or so people will at best start criticizing you for building ships without a program and therefore for making more mistakes? [Voronin] There is something else that we have to fear: Being accused of doing nothing. After all, science cannot be stopped, but what we are doing is not essential. We know how and on what a potential enemy is working, how a process is proceeding throughout the world, and what new systems, component base, and new technologies are being developed. Of course, we too are compelled to carry out this work, but, it turns out, with our eyes shut. [Gundarov] Still, is it not easier to work with our eyes open, even if on a minimal program? [Voronin] I do not want to reveal all our secrets. I will merely note that an enterprise which has been able to get into a foreign market and make a dollar profit uses it not for its own social needs but for finding solutions to state tasks, including scientific developments. We are hard-put to compete with the Japanese, who already have the fifth generation of radio electronics in production -- molecular electronics and biocomputers. But should we not at least keep our finger on the pulse? Irrespective of whether the new parliament gives money or not. That is life. [Gundarov] At the moment Russia has no enemies, politicians claim. Maybe the need to build new ships intensively has also ceased? [Voronin] Sometimes I am asked a simple "peasant" question: Why can U.S. submarines dart around Severodvinsk while we cannot do the same near their country? Moreover, the opposing side refuses to hold any talks on cutting naval forces, considering itself a great naval power and guarantor of peace. Not only the United States is looking after its fleet. Work to build up China's naval forces has now been launched as never before. Hundreds of representatives of various firms and departments in that country are coming to us. I have met many of them and formed the conclusion that they have set themselves the task of making their country one of the most powerful naval powers in the near future. Recently I visited South Korea, where I met the president of the "Khala" [as translaiterated] firm. In 18 months they intend to construct a new state-of-the-art shipyard. South Korea is currently the world's second biggest shipbuilder and will probably soon be the biggest. Even that small country intends to begin building submarines -- diesel submarines for the time being. While China is already interested in nuclear-powered submarines. Those two countries' strategy is to invest colossal amounts of money in their own naval forces. We have already sensed this during business contacts. [Gundarov] Do you notice a desire on the part of our government to maintain Russia's naval might? [Voronin) ) No. In our country, as is often the case, words are at variance with actions. Judging from the state orders which shipbuilders now have, our main customer is foreign rather than our Defense Ministry: Forty percent of domestic shipyards' capacities are starting to work for the West. [Gundarov] In that case, what awaits the industrial complex which works for the Russian Navy? [Voronin] We are waiting for the state to settle accounts with shipbuilders. I will cite just one figure. The state owes the "Sevmash" production association 130 billion rubles. For several months we have been promised that this money would be paid, but the debt has not yet been cleared. Hence the enterprise has no circulating capital and the production chain is being destroyed. In short, all this is a string of truisms about which a considerable amount has already been said. [Gundarov] Do you have specific proposals as to how to maintain production? [Voronin] The matter is complicated by the fact that, on the one hand, conversion programs apparently exist but, on the other, they are not being implemented because finance for them is lacking. Therefore we are not elaborating proposals but specific subprograms for every plant. They do not have to choose right now. They are getting to work fulfilling any orders: Whether they be for peasants, oil or gas industry workers, or along ecological lines. [Gundarov] And at the same time shipbuilding technology is being destroyed? [Voronin] Yes, from the viewpoint of shipbuilding construction we are, of course, losing out. [Gundarov] Maybe this is a consequence of the fact that there is no Navy lobby in the government? [Voronin] To some extent I agree with you. There are many lobbyists of various persuasions. But as far as the Navy goes I do not see its lobbyists. Yuriy Yarov has a better grasp of the Navy's problems than others in the government. But unfortunately he is engaged in resolving other questions. But I do not sense in certain other people who have reached the crucible of power any understanding of the tasks facing the production complex, which in particular provides for the Navy's needs. This occurs because these people have not passed through the plant school. The moment has now come when nobody wants to hear the exhortations of practical people, and they themselves are called antireformists. But practical people would not have made the colossal mistakes we are now observing in the management of industry. The problem of cadres, I believe, is now the most pressing. Incidentally, I am for reforms, but they must be carried out in a more evolutionary way. [Gundarov] What would you do first of all if the situation in which the Navy found itself depended entirely on you? [Voronin] It is just the same as asking a mechanic at a technical servicing center what he would do first of all with a broken machine. First he would probably have a look at it. If we start at the beginning, I am convinced that industry could withstand 5 percent or a maximum of 10 percent conversion. Foreign experience demonstrates this. As conversion increases the production process becomes unmanageable, because it comes into conflict with science and economics. It is therefore hard to say what should be done first of all when everything has disintegrated. Wars are raging all over the world. The situation in the Near East is complex, and it is becoming acute in Asia. The brake has been taken off the U.S. Navy. I think I would review the shipbuilding program and adopt a more careful attitude to reducing it. Obsolete ships, which are not combat-effective in a modern war, can be cut. But in fact we are cutting ships which have been in service only 15 years instead of 25. Second, whether we like it or not, plants must not be allowed to fall below the "red" line. Otherwise no edicts or orders will save production from collapsing. [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, in ending our conversation, what would you -- the man who is building the Navy -- like to wish the Navy's sailors in the new year of 1994? [Voronin] It is hard to find more optimistic people, although figuratively speaking they have to "fight" every day: When cruising, on combat service, or on alert status. I would like to wish that their optimism never deserts them. I am convinced that better times are ahead for the Navy, because we have a demonstrable trump card enabling us to be a naval power. And no political battles can take it away from us.
