Security Council to consider the possibility of granting the collective CIS peace-keeping forces formed last autumn and still deployed in Tajikistan the status of U.N. peace-keeping forces. In his messages sent on Saturday to the chairman of the U.N. Security Council, Jean-Bernard Merimee, and to the U.N. Secretary-General, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, Rakhmanov expressed concern over the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, where "armed units of the Tajik opposition backed by some groups of Afghan mujaheddin continue to stage acts of terrorism and sabotage." The Government of Tajikistan "intends to firmly follow its program for settling the conflict between different political forces in Tajikistan peacefully and resolving the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border by political means," Rakhmanov assured members of the U.N. Security Council. In this connection the Tajik leadership intends to enter into talks with spokesmen for the opposition in Moscow this month, the messages said.
