However, Chien said, th ROC will not forge diplomatic relations with a number of "mini" states simply to reach that goal. "We'll develop formal ties only with those countries whose ecoomies are complementary with ours and whose political situations are stable," Chien told a press conference at the Foreign Ministry. The ROC currently maintains diplomatic ties with 29 countries, mostly in Latin America and Africa. "The government needs the support of the press and academic communities as well as the Legislative Yuan in seeking to expand diplomatic frontiers," Chien said. He stressed that the government will continue to seek membership in major international organizations and forge diplomatic ties with more countries under the "one China" policy. "China is divided and ruled by two separate governments," Chien said. "As a sovereign state, the ROC, which controls Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, is entitled to have a role in the world arena." Chien said that although Beijing has spared no efforts to block Taiwan's international presence, the ROC won't abandon its bid to join the United Nations and other important world bodies. Chien added that he is reserved toward a proposal made recently by a Taiwan affairs official in Beijing that the two sides stop their "cutthroat" competition on the diplomatic front. "It is Beijing that has adopted a `zero-sum' strategy against Taiwan in diplomatic arenas," Chien said. "In forging ties with other countries, we have never asked them to either totally cut relations or reduce exchanges with Beijing." "Under the current conditions, I doubt the Chinese Communist Party leadership will accept the so-called `diplomatic truce' overture," Chien said, adding that unless Mainland China's political system changes, cross-strait relations are unlikely to make great headway.
