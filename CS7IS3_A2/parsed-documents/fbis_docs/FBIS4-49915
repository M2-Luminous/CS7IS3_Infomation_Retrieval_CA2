It also calls for banning air and sea transportation to Haiti except scheduled transportation for passengers. The resolution emphatically points out that the UN Security Council will remove all sanctions against Haiti only when Haiti's military rulers step down and the executive power of Aristide, the democratically elected president of Haiti, is returned and restored. The UN Security Council resolution was proposed by the United States, France, Argentina, and other countries. China maintains its reservations, although China voted for the resolution. Chen Jian, deputy representative of China's permanent mission to the United Nations, emphatically pointed out in his speech that China's persistent stand is not in favor of using sanctions as a method to resolve conflicts. The sanctions measure included in the resolution is a special measure to be taken under the extremely special situation in Haiti at present.
