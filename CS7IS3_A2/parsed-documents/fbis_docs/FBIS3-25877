However, it has been learned that the MAC has arranged for its Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian to personally explain to the people our policy and stand vis-a-vis why it is inappropriate for cross-strait "direct shipping between designated points" at the present stage. It has been learned that the MAC still holds that before the removal of substantive barriers in politics, law, and security confronting the issue of direct navigation between the two sides of the strait, various forms of shipping links such as "direct shipping between designated points" and "unilateral opening to shipping" may just slightly improve on the subject of opening up navigation in terms of volume or mode, but their practicality is not great. Nevertheless, the MAC still has not ruled out the possibility of carrying out such a link as "direct shipping between designated points" or "unilateral opening to shipping" in the initial stage as a transitional measure after direct navigation has been opened up.
