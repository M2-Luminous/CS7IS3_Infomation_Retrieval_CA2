In an interview with AL-ANBA today, Shaykh Sabah said that the new government had not been chosen to represent any particular trend or orientation, but had been chosen from all the sons of Kuwait. He added that what distinguishes Kuwait is that all its sons belong to one family and there is no discrimination or preference for any of its sons over any other except on the basis of his abilities and aptitudes. Al-Sabah said that even if their opinions differ on some matters, the opinions of all Kuwaitis ultimately serve the interest of Kuwait. He said that the new government faces the challenges of implementing the law and extending the rule of law, and will not be a government of challenges to persons or trends as some people are saying.
