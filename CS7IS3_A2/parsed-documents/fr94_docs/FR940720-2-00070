ACTION: Scheduling of public hearing. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. SUMMARY: Following receipt of a letter dated June 9, 1993, from the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Commission instituted investigation No. 332&hyph;344, The Economic Effects of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders and Suspension Agreements, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)) on July 1, 1993 (Fed. Reg., Vol. 58, No. 133, July 14, 1993, pp. 37966&hyph;37967). The Commission was requested to submit its report by June 30, 1995.

Hearing impaired individuals are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the TDD terminal on (202) 205&hyph;1810. Background As requested by USTR, the Commission will investigate the economic effects of such orders and suspension agreements, and the economic effects of the dumping and subsidy practices that such orders and agreements address. The investigation will include a comprehensive empirical analysis of the economic condition of U.S. domestic industries impacted (including upstream and downstream industries) by unfairly traded imports both before and after relief was granted. This analysis will include relevant industry information on employment, wages, production, prices, investment, trade and other factors internal and external to the industry including but not limited to the relevant unfair foreign trade practices affecting the general health and competitiveness of such industries. Also, the USTR has requested that a standard comparative static model be employed to estimate the economic effects of the unfair trade practices and remedies on selected U.S. industries. The USTR noted that the process of relief from unfair trade practices entails real costs to firms, to individual workers and to taxpayers. The USTR has requested the Commission to complement the empirical analysis above with quantitative and other estimates of the labor and other domestic adjustment costs involved. Also as requested by the USTR, the Commission will seek to provide an assessment of the economy-wide net economic welfare effects of unfair trade practices and the remedies provided.
