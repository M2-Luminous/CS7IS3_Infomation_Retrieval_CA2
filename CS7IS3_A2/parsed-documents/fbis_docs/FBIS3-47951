Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said it was "highly regrettable" that the four political reform bills were killed. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the failure a dark day for Japan and one that could further dampen the slumping economy. Inaba also expressed concern that the setback for political reform could slow economic deregulation that had been promoted by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration. Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said a joint committee of both chambers of the Diet should compromise so that the package is enacted. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said failure to enact the package could heighten public distrust of politics and damage Japan's image overseas.
