In the Matter of: Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers; Motion for Extension of Time. By the Acting Chief, Common Carrier Bureau: 1. On March 30, 1994, the United States Telephone Association (USTA) filed a motion for extension of time to file comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 1 in the above-captioned proceeding. Comments are scheduled to be filed by April 18, 1994 and replies by May 17, 1994. USTA seeks an extension until May 9, 1994 for comments and until June 8, 1994 for replies. 1 Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 94&hyph;1, FCC No. 94&hyph;10, rel. Feb. 16, 1994. 2. USTA states that the Commission has requested that interested parties submit detailed information and quantitative data on a wide variety of issues, ranging from the broad policy goals underlying the price cap plan, to specific details of the plan, to transition issues related to increasing competition in access markets. USTA indicates that it is the principal trade association representing the entire local exchange carrier industry and views this proceeding as critically important to determining the future of the telecommunications industry. USTA asserts that the quantification and other analyses that it will be submitting cannot be completed in time for inclusion in comments to be filed on April 18. Therefore, it argues, an extension of time is necessary for USTA to gather and analyze relevant data and to allow its consultants to prepare their reports and obtain the approval of USTA's membership before those reports can be incorporated in its comments. 3. The Common Carrier Bureau has reviewed USTA's request for extension of time and has determined that good cause has been shown to grant all interested parties additional time, until May 9, 1994, to file comments and until June 8, 1994 to file reply comments. 4. Therefore, it is ordered that the United States Telephone Association's motion for extension of time is granted to the extent specified herein. Federal Communications Commission. A. Richard Metzger, Jr., Acting Chief, Common Carrier Bureau. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10611 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
