This view is borne out by, among other things, an opinion survey commissioned by the Polish Development Bank [Polski Bank Rozwoju SA] and carried out by the Market Economy Research Institute. The former GDR, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary were chosen for comparison purposes. The Institute's respondents, selected from a number of Western firms conducting business with the former CEMA as well as international consultancy institutions, were asked to draw a ranking list arranging the above-mentioned countries according to, first, their importance in business relations (the market attractiveness factor) and, second, the degree of risk involved in placing investment in them. Our place on the list is very high as regards the attractiveness of our market to foreign business. Using a five-point scale, the consultancy firms awarded 4.5 points to Poland (and, respectively, 4 points to Hungary, 3.5 points to the Czech Republic, 3 points to the former GDR, and 1.8 points to Slovakia). Business firms gave us a slightly lower rating (3.3 points), but, even so, we came before all of the other contestants. The next country on the list, Hungary, was allocated 2.5 points, the Czech Republic 2.4 points, the former GDR 2.2 points, and Slovakia 1.9 points. A different picture emerged when it came to evaluating the risk factor involved in investing in our group of countries. The businessmen believe that Poland and Slovakia were leaders in the "high-risk" stakes. The international consultancy firms drew up a list with a slightly different order. They have the least confidence in Slovakia. However, Poland comes a close second to Slovakia. Analyses carried out by the Market Economy Research Institute attempted to uncover the reasons for this particular ranking order, which is so unfavorable to us. Among other things, techniques developed in the West and adapted for use in our country were used to draw up a "sector map" designed to present a picture of the current levels of our enterprises' competition potential. The map comprises five sections. The first section lists industry sectors for which, in the present state of our economy, the risk of bringing in outside capital is considered to be "small"--in other words, those that promise relatively high profits, with an advantageous correlation of outlays to results. The second section of the map comprises "medium-risk" industry sectors; the third, "increased-risk"; the fourth, "high-risk"; and the fifth, "particularly-high-risk." Startling as it may seem, from the economic viewpoint, the sectors listed as involving small and medium investment risk represent more than 50 percent of current industrial production! Another group of sectors, representing approximately 14.4 percent of output, are relatively close to the potentially profitable zone, although they require appropriate efficiency-enhancement measures (the "increased-risk zone"). Sectors that have been described as representing high risk for potential investment and that thus promise many difficulties for firms that might decide to invest in them turn out approximately 7.8 percent of our industrial production. Finally, sectors that constitute particularly high risk for potential investors and that, consequently, are at present the least attractive--or, to be more precise, that lag furthest behind others and thus threaten the hypothetical investors with many unpleasant surprises--represent slightly more than 27 percent of industrial production. Among the sectors that already offer only small risk to investors are the herb industry, the match-manufacturing industry, the sugar industry, and the pharmaceutical industry, although the last requires a very high degree of specialist knowledge and experience. At the other end of the scale, very high risk is involved in investing in such sectors as the high-technology optical, aircraft, and computer industries, but also, among others, the potato-growing industry, the spirits and yeast-manufacturing industries, and the footwear industry, none of which, or so it would seem, present particular technological difficulties hard to master for any country with a relatively high level of technological and industrial advancement and expertise, and whose work force has at least moderate professional and technical qualifications. Through an additional survey conducted among foreign businessmen and business consultants, the Market Economy Research Institute set out to ascertain the most prominent reason for anxiety concerning the potential involvement of foreign investment in the five countries listed above. In the case of the former GDR, for example, social tension gave the greatest cause for concern; in the Czech Republic, legislative and economic difficulties were listed as most worrying; in Slovakia, there was concern over economic problems; and, in Hungary, economic and social factors alike were found to give reason for anxiety. In Poland, the chief risk factors are political instability and imperfect legislation. No other country of our group of five received even a comparably poor political rating from the potential investors consulted in the survey.
