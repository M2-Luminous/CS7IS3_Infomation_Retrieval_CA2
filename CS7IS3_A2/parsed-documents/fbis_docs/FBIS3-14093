During the exchanges of fire, several terrorists were hit, but their condition is not yet known. During the fire exchanges yesterday two Hebron women were wounded. According to an initial IDF [Israel Defense Forces] investigation, the women were hit by terrorists' gunfire, rather than by the IDF. One of the women was seriously wounded and died a short time later in Hebron's 'Aliya Hospital. The other woman was slightly wounded in the head and was evacuated to a hospital in Jerusalem after being treated on the spot by an IDF doctor. From the IDF's investigation it transpired that the two were hit by the terrorists' gunfire. Hebron is under curfew and the area was declared a closed military zone. Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq has just told the Shamgar Commission that the 18 hour-long battle with the terrorists in Hebron has just ended. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that to the best of his knowledge five IDF soldiers were slightly wounded in the fire exchanges. They were evacuated for treatment at a Jerusalem hospital. The bodies of three terrorists were found in the building in which they were barricaded in the al-Taraq neighborhood in Hebron; Kalashnikov rifles and a Glilon submachine gun were found near the bodies. During the battle the IDF directed antitank missiles and machine gun fire at the building. Last night the area was lit with flares; early this morning a large bulldozer was brought to the area to demolish one of the buildings in which the terrorists barricaded themselves. The bulldozer broke down and it was necessary to bring in another bulldozer this afternoon to recover the first one. The terrorists attacked the soldiers operating the bulldozer, and at that point the IDF forces stormed the building and killed the terrorists. Our correspondent notes that in during the operation the management of the al-Muhtasib children's hospital -- which is located near the building concerned -- complained that soldiers entered the hospital premises and that the children hospitalized were greatly alarmed by the explosions and gunfire.
