This is a major scientific decision since it will enable experts at the French Arms Delegation (DGA) and the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] -- who have been pondering the design of such a system since 1991 in the framework of the Palen program (for the preparation and limitation of nuclear testing) -- to devise new methods for performing heavy-duty studies and experiments. Notable developments include extremely powerful lasers and high-performance computers which would also have considerable benefits for the civil domain. While it is hard to imagine, the means do exist for simulating or partially reconstructing the diabolical energy release that is characterized by the triggering of a thermonuclear bomb. Better still, while the most complex means of simulation are still confined to the realms of theory, certain others already exist in concrete form. In two decades these resources have reduced the annual number of real nuclear tests carried out on the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean from a dozen to just five, before the total test ban moratorium was imposed in April 1992. The equipment already used in a number of Defense Ministry research centers make it possible to reconstruct some of the main mechanical or electromagnetic effects of a nuclear explosion, such as the blast, the heat wave, and the high-energy radiation flux that is generated. One of the simplest simulation tools to design -- but still delicate to use and particularly impressive to see in action -- is the giant blast tunnel at Grammat in the Lot region of France. Some 110 mt long and 12 mt wide, this structure, camouflaged to blend into the countryside, makes it possible to subject different types of military equipment to a very violent and instantaneous pressurization caused by the release in less than one-hundredth of a second of 300,000 lt of air stored in giant compressors. This involves generating 8 million times the normal atmospheric pressure, equivalent to the shock wave of a thermonuclear explosion, which, in the tunnel, sweeps jeeps aside like mere wisps of straw. Another, less spectacular example but equipment that is doubtless even more complex to use, is the "radiation chamber" that has been built in the Vernon ballistics and aerodynamics research laboratory. This tool -- the only one of its kind in Europe -- makes it possible to subject all types of electronic components to the kind of intense electromagnetic flash generated by an atomic bomb. However, scientists have yet to implement the most difficult type of nuclear simulation: reconstructing the processes that lie at the heart of the explosion and which, in a few hundredths of a second, cause matter to change into other, lighter, atomic elements, generating an enormous amount of energy in the process. To improve the effectiveness of existing weapons and to design new ones -- like the famous neutron bombs -- it is vital to be able to accurately predict the operational effectiveness of various kinds of architecture and to select one material in preference to another. As a result it is essential to have "keys" composed either of real tests or a series of physical simulations and calculations using codes detailed enough to accurately determine by "virtual" means the way in which this energy will be released and then dispersed. If they are to pinpoint the actual transmutation of elements during an atomic explosion, scientists in the AEC's military applications department will have to develop the two tools that are essential for any nuclear simulation: power lasers and massively parallel computers. The credits awarded for this task for the five years covered by the military planning law far exceed those currently allocated: the decision to invest a sum of Fr10 billion practically multiplies tenfold the budget for the Palen program which this year stands at Fr300 million. On the computing level this will be enough to provide considerable stimulus for the work being done in France in the field of so-called "massively parallel" computing: using machines whose architecture is such that they can perform simultaneous rather than successive calculations interactively -- i.e. in parallel. This technology is still in its infancy, but it appears to be the only way of processing the phenomenal amount of data (people are talking of several hundred billion instructions per second) that this type of simulation requires -- even harder to do, say the experts, than atmospheric modeling. Mastering such computing power, the experts claim, could only benefit the resource-hungry calculations used in weather forecasting and computer-assisted aircraft design. In the field of lasers, the Palen program would enable France to build tools performing better than Phebus, the most powerful device currently being used by the AEC in Limeil, near Paris. Capable of delivering power of almost 10 kilojoules for about a billionth of a second, this would already be enough to light veritable miniature suns heating minuscule samples of matter to over 10 million degrees. The matter would then be converted into plasma such as is found in the core of a thermonuclear weapon. A major line of research in future years will consist of designing a system for amplifying the flashes emitted by such types of equipment to exceed the performance of the American "Nova," currently the most powerful laser in the world that can put out around 50 kilojoules in flashes of light emitted in a single time period of around one nanosecond. In the civil domain, tools such as this would make it easier to examine the technology needed to master continuous fusion, i.e. generated in reactors that can supply infinitely more energy than existing atomic power stations. However, if we are to believe many military experts, several more real nuclear tests are needed to perfectly calibrate their data with the processes that occur inside a real bomb.
