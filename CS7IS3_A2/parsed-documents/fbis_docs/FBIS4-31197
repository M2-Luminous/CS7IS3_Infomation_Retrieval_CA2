FBIS4-31197 "dreeu109_d_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 SLOVAKIA Bugar Seen Replacing Duray as Ethnic Leader Bugar Seen Replacing Duray as Ethnic Leader AU0606195494 AU0606195494 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June and Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June both publish commentaries on waning support for Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence Movement, among the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June on page 4 carries a 500-word Milan Stanislav commentary entitled "A New Leader?" The commentator observes that, besides bringing a victory for the left, the Hungarian elections showed that Hungarian voters had rejected the "gaining of political capital out of nationalism." In Stanislav's opinion, this "signal" from Hungary is also likely to influence ethnic Hungarian voters in southern Slovakia. He continues: "Miklos Duray, in particular, has found himself in a difficult situation. In public opinion polls on trust in politicians, Duray has suffered the greatest loss of support, and Vojtech Bugar, who, by his moderate and realistic policy, has become the natural leader of the Hungarian ethnic minority, ranks above him by a wide margin. Miklos Duray also had to swallow a bitter pill at a meeting of the Coexistence Council when he had to agree to the idea of a three-member coalition that was advocated by Vojtech Bugar. Why did Mr. Duray oppose this idea? Most likely, he saw in the alliance of the moderate Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] with the liberal and level-headed Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] a strong competition for his own policy, which is marked by extremism. By trying to include the de facto nonexistent Hungarian People's Party in the contemplated `union of four [ethnic Hungarian] parties,' he tried to eliminate the influence of the MOS within this grouping. Because the idea of a union, based on the circumvention of the electoral law, did not meet with support, Coexistence sounded the retreat. Given the current distribution of electoral preferences within the Hungarian community, Coexistence would be risking a duel with a possible MKDH-MOS two-member coalition and would not have to get into parliament. Moreover, it also had to reckon with the Social Democratic bloc's campaign for the votes of Hungarian voters, who are influenced by the Socialists' victory in the neighboring country." In conclusion, the commentator observes that Duray's "radical" statements "jeopardize dialogue between the minority and the government," which could threaten the passage of legislative norms benefiting the minority and strengthen the position of Slovak nationalist parties. Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June on page 3 carries a 600-word Emil Lopasovsky commentary entitled "Is Duray Losing Ground Under His Feet?" The commentator considers two recent incidents that, in his opinion, document a loss of support for the Coexistence chairman within the Hungarian minority. First, Lopasovsky gives an account of a rally held in the overwhelmingly Hungarian community of Velka nad Iplom "late last week," which was attended by Miklos Duray. According to Lopasovsky, "Duray suffered a debacle" at Velka nad Iplom when the community's residents "ignored" his presence. According to the commentator, the company awaiting Duray consisted of his brother-in-law, his sister, the mayor of the community, and two journalists, who were subsequently joined by "a few elderly locals who had quickly emptied their mugs of beer in the pub across the street." The subsequent discussion reportedly demonstrated that Duray's "political steps and escalating demands are out of tune with the views of people about whom he pretends to be concerned." Particularly Duray's campaign against the so-called alternative education, whose aim is to improve ethnic Hungarians' command of the Slovak language, reportedly met with criticism. The second indication of waning support for Duray, according to Lopasovsky, was the meeting of the Coexistence Council at Lucenec on 28 May, which advocated a coalition of ethnic Hungarian parties, in defiance of Duray's preference for the project of a union. Lopasovsky claims that "it was even rumored at Lucenec that Duray's chair in Coexistence is not quite stable."
