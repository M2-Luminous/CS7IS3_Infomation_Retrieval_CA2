Kim said in a press conference before his departure for Manila to attend the annual Asian Development Bank meeting that the economic growth in the January-March period was estimated to be more than 8.5 percent, thanks to increased exports and capital investment in all sectors except agriculture, though the estimate was not based on accurate data. Kim's estimate is compared with the 8.3-percent growth estimated by the Korea Development Institute, indicating that the economy will grow 8 percent this year against the Bank of Korea's earlier projection of 6.3 percent. It is too early to say that the economy is overheating because the economy is not yet showing such signs of overheating as supply shortages and rapid wage hikes. But the economy has entered an expansion period after a recovery from the recession, he observed. Commenting on the current-account deficit of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars recorded in the first quarter, he said, "When the economy is recovering or expanding, imports are usually greater than exports chiefly because of the rapidly increasing demand for imported equipment and machinery. So, the deficit is a temporary phenomenon and I think it will not last long until the end of the year." Kim said there would be no revision of the money supply growth goal of 14-17 percent for this year because the financial situation is so good that such revision is not needed.
