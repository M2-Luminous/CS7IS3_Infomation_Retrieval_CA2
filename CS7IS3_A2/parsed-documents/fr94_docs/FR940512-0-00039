These final regulations for the NEISP Program specify the role of the Secretary and the responsibilities of the States in the administration of the program. The final regulations also specify the State and student applicant eligibility requirements and the criteria by which the Secretary approves a State's application to participate in the program. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect either 45 days after publication in the Federal Register or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments. If you want to know the effective date of these regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daniel Sullivan or Priscilla Zink Mulford, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 4018, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5447.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Secretary provides final regulations to implement the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership (NEISP) Program, a new program authorized under the amended HEA, (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). The Secretary also amends a reference to the NEISP Program in 34 CFR 75.60 of the regulations for the Direct Grant Programs. The Secretary also is making technical amendments in separate final regulations to insert references to the NEISP Program into the appropriate sections of 34 CFR part 668, the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. The NEISP Program provides States with Federal financial incentives to establish or maintain a program with matching State-originated funds. It provides for (1) a scholarship component that, to the extent possible, guarantees the financial assistance necessary for eligible low-income students who graduate from high school to attend an institution of higher education, and (2) an early intervention component that uses Statewide resources, both government and private, to provide additional counseling, financial aid counseling, mentoring, academic support, outreach, and supportive services to preschool, elementary, middle, and secondary school students who are at risk of dropping out of school. The NEISP Program's early intervention component supports National Education Goals 2 (High School Completion), 3 (Student Achievement and Citizenship), and 4 (Science and Mathematics). The NEISP Program's scholarship component also supports National Education Goal 5 (Adult Literacy and Lifelong Learning). On March 8, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the Federal Register (59 FR 10926&hyph;10937). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. Except for minor editorial and technical revisions, there are no differences between the NPRM and these final regulations. One of the technical revisions is that the Secretary is including in §693.40(d) the requirement under section 404D(d)(2) of the HEA that, to be eligible for a NEISP Program scholarship, a student must have received a high school diploma or a certificate of high school equivalence on or after January 1, 1993. Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, six parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.
