These media men came to Jordan in order to report on the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee. During the meeting, the prime minister discussed bilateral relations and the regional situation. Here are more details: Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali welcomed the resumption of the meetings of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee. He said: We hope these meetings will be a foundation stone for reinstating work among the Arab states in the required way. He also pointed out the importance of coordination between the two fraternal countries, particularly in this phase. The prime minister explained that the agenda of the meetings includes many issues and topics, led by consolidating political relations between the sisterly countries and discussing a number of economic issues, such as exports, protocols, dealing with trucks, transportation, the Arab bridge, and electric power connection. Dr. al-Majali said that the Arab world is now passing through a crucial stage, that facts and events are accelerating rapidly, and that the Arab world is still unaware of the serious phase we are passing through because it is still dealing, to a limited degree, with the reasons for differences, but no genuine attempts have been made to remove these differences and deal with the new facts. Al-Majali added that the real features of the new world order have not yet become clear, except for the fact that the United States is the country that is currently dominating this order. He noted that the character of the regional order that could prevail in our region has not yet become clear. The prime minister asserted that if the Arabs do not act before it is too late, do not reach understanding, and do not achieve accord, a regional order could be arranged and imposed on them. Such an order could affect the Arabs for a long period of time. Al-Majali asserted that there is no room for spectators in such an order, and that we, the Arabs, should play an effective and influential role in this order. The prime minister reviewed the siege imposed on the port of al-'Aqabah and the efforts that the Jordanian king and government have made to resolve this issue, as a result of which Jordan has sustained great financial losses that reflected negatively on the performance of the Jordanian economy. He said that since the meeting held between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in London last week no ship bound for al-'Aqabah has been intercepted. He added that the Jordanian proposal that the international company Lloyds supervise the dealings with cargo bound for the port of al-'Aqabah was approved. Al-Majali explained that some matters pertaining to this issue are still being studied.
