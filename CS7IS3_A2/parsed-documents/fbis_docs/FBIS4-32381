The cabinet approved a budget proposal for 1995, planning a 15- percent unemployment rate, a two percent GDP growth and an eight percent inflation rate. The cabinet asked the Finance Ministry to discuss the budget proposal with representatives of the central bank and of the National Property Fund (FNM). Filkus said a problem was the amount of debt to be paid next year. Slovakia is expected to pay 38 to 44 billion Slovak crowns (about $1.3 billion), an increase by 11 to 17 billion crowns compared with this year. This increase is higher than the year-on-year growth in budget revenues and would draw a quarter of annual budget expenditures. In case the central bank and the FNM refuse to share in paying back the debt, the budget deficit could not be maintained, Filkus added. In an interview published by yesterday's issue of the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Premier Jozef Moravcik said Slovakia's goal for this year was to completely halt the fall of GDP, reduce the inflation rate to 13 percent (from last year's 23.1 percent) and maintain the budget deficit at 14 billion crowns.
