FR941110-0-00229 FR941110-0-00016 However, it is not just the inconsistency with the other remedies which has led us to reexamine our policy on this issue. In addition, HCFA does not want to discourage new, capable ownership interests from improving the quality of care that residents receive. Investing in a NATCEP may enhance quality of care; to prohibit a new owner from having such a program would be counterproductive with the larger purposes of the programs. Therefore, under this regulation, we are changing our policy on transfer of the prohibition of NATCEP to a new owner to bring it into line with the workings of other remedies. The 2-year restriction of NATCEP will not apply to the new owner of a provider unless that new owner or organization has been the subject of an extended (or partial extended) survey, or is otherwise subject to the terms of §483.151, under its tenure. If all other requirements for the approval of NATCEP are met, including substantial compliance with all program requirements, the new owner may provide NATCEP. We have received numerous inquiries from providers as well as their attorneys asking what appeal rights are available when approval of a facility's NATCEP has been denied or withdrawn. While the Act does not provide for any formal appeals for denial or withdrawal of a NATCEP, we believe that providers ought to have some opportunity to challenge this disapproval. Therefore, we expect providers to appeal their NATCEP disapproval within the timeframes established for dispute resolution, as described in §488.331 of this final rule. We have reached this result because, notwithstanding the fact that the Act permits us and the State survey agencies to conduct extended (or partial extended) surveys for any reason, we are nevertheless under this regulation choosing to conduct such surveys only when we or a State survey agency determines that substandard quality of care exists. Just as we believe a provider ought to have access to an informal dispute resolution mechanism to challenge what it perceives to be inaccurate survey findings, we believe that it ought to be able to challenge the correctness of the State survey agency's or HCFA's determination that substandard quality of care existed. If successful in that challenge, then the factual basis for doing the extended survey will have been removed, and, in such cases, it would be inequitable to saddle the provider with the loss of its NATCEP when there was no factual basis for doing so. We are limiting the appeals of these matters to the informal dispute resolution process because we do not believe the loss of a NATCEP is a remedy of the same magnitude or type as other statutory remedies for which a more formal appeals mechanism is available. Unlike the case with other remedies, a facility losing its NATCEP will not, on that basis alone, face exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, nor will it face the same kind of deprivation that is arguably the case with respect to civil money penalties, denial of payment, or the imposition of temporary management. We believe the informal dispute resolution process satisfies essential elements of due process here, since a provider will have notice of the intended denial of its NATCEP and the opportunity to meet with agency officials to challenge the findings that gave rise to the denial. Comment: One commenter believed that every State should implement the same penalty system. Response: The Act permits the States to elect alternative remedies if they can demonstrate that the alternative remedies are as effective as the remedies specified by the Act. V. Additional Conforming Changes. In addition to change to our regulations identified above, it is necessary that we make minor, technical, editorial or cross reference changes to several other regulation sections. We are making conforming changes to: •Part 401 (§§401.130, and 401.133), part 431 (§§431.115, 431.151, 431.152, 431.153, 431.154, 431.221, and 431.610); •Part 435 (§435.1009); •Part 440 (§440.40, 440.140, 440.150); we recodified §440.150 to separate NFs and ICFs/MR to make it clear which provisions apply to each. No substantive changes have been made as a result of this new section. •Part 441 (§441.11); •Part 442 (§§442.1, 442.12, 442.14, 442.15, 442.16, 442.20, 442.30, 442.40, 442.42, 442.101, 442.105, 442.109, 442.110, 442.111, 442.117, 442.118, and 442.119); •Part 488 (§§488.8, 488.11, 488.14, 488.18, 488.20, 488.24, 488.26, 488.28, and 488.50); •Part 489 (§§489.3, 489.11, 489.12, 489.15, 489.16, 489.18, 489.53, 489.60, 489.62, and 489.64); and •Part 498 (§§498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5). •Part 498 (§§498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5); we revised §498.3(b)(7) to exclude SNF and NF terminations. SNFs and NFs may appeal the noncompliance that led to a termination under §498.3(b)(13).
