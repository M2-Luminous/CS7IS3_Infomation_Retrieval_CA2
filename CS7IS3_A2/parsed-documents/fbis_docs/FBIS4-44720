"Moreover," the minister continued, "the Government considers the aerospace programs to be real priorities. In spite of the difficult budgetary and financial context, according to the prime minister's first evaluation of defense programs, our defense modernization is allowed to continue." Before the National Assembly's Defense Committee, the Eurocopter group's president, Jean-Francois Bigay, stated that "the cost of the NH-90 program has been 1.376 billion ECU," that is, more than 1.3 billion French francs [Fr]. The French participation stands at 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion for Eurocopter France and Fr3.9 billion for the French Government). Then Mr. Bigay added: "The cost per unit of an NH-90 is Fr85 million" for the army, "and Fr135 million" for the navy models. The four countries participating in the program (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy) ordered a total of 726 crafts, while the export market, outside Europe, has been estimated at approximately 500 "machines." Today this program is very much endangered by reductions of the defense budgets in the four participating countries.
