A decision to expel Mr Bangarappa was taken by the disciplinary action committee (DAC) of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), which met here on Monday under the chairmanship of Dr Balram Jakhar, vice-chairman of the committee and Union Agriculture Minister. The decision, after considering Mr Bangarappa's reply to the show-cause notice, was unanimous. To expel the former Chief Minister for six years with immediate effect. Apart from Dr Jakhar, three other members, Mr A.K. Antony, Mr R.K. Dhawan and Mrs Omem Deori, attended the meeting. The committee chairman and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr Kotla Vijayabhaskara Reddy has conveyed his agreement over telephone. The AICC spokesman, Mr Chandulal Chandrakar, who announced the decision at his routine press briefing here on Monday, said he was not aware whether Dr Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the party's Lok Sabha member from Cuddapah, who was also served a show-cause notice along with Mr Bangarappa, has sent his reply to the notice. He also had no official information from the committee about Dr Reddy's reply and whether his case has come up for discussion in Monday's DAC meeting. Mr Chandrakar said he was informed only about the action taken against Mr Bangarappa. He said the DAC has taken the strongest action against the former Karnataka Chief Minister in order to maintain discipline in the party. Mr Bangarappa had sent a very strongly-worded reply to the show-cause notice served on him, in which he launched a blistering attack on the leadership of the party president and Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Mr Bangarappa had also leaked out the reply to a section of the press and announced his intention to launch a regional party in the next few months. In view of this, his expulsion was very much on cards and quite anticipated. As a matter of fact, the decision to expel Mr Bangarappa from the party was taken by last Friday's meeting of the DAC, which was attended by Mr Vijayabhaskara Reddy, Mr Dhawan and Mr Antony, and there was no need for the committee to meet again on Monday. It was decided then that "strictist possible action" should be taken against Mr Bangarappa for his recent utterances against the party leadership. The delay in announcing the decision was attributed to the fact that the committee wanted to take the approval of Mr Narasimha Rao, which in turn was delayed because Mr Rao was on tour on Saturday and Sunday in Karnataka. The second meeting of the committee was an attempt to explain the delay in announcing the decision. This was the third meeting of the DAC on the Bangarappa issue. According to senior party leaders here, the expulsion of Mr Bangarappa is not going to affect the interests of the party in the State. The State leadership had conveyed to the Centre that not a single legislator was likely to go with the former Chief Minister, they said. Mr Bangarappa's recent action had drawn flak from his party colleagues both in the State as well as at the Centre. About a dozen MPs had recently met Mr Rao and urged him to take drastic action against Mr Bangarappa. Mr Bangarappa reacted to his expulsion from the Congress on Monday by announcing that he would launch a new State-level party. Mr Bangarappa said, "I am happy I am out of the Congress headed by Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who is unable to uplift the poorer and farming community of the country." He also said that Mr Rao had failed to protect secularism. When the news of his expulsion was conveyed to him, Mr Bangarappa remarked: "Congratulations, I am happy that I am out of the Congress headed by Mr Narasimha Rao." He said it was a pity that his friends were still there in the Congress under Mr Narasimha Rao, "who is hobnobbing with the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]." Mr Bangarappa said he would decide the date and other details of launching the new party after consultations with his supporters. The Bangarappa camp received a shot in the arm when five legislators, including three former ministers came out with a statement that the expulsion only proved Mr Rao's "anti-down trodden stand." Alleging that Mr Rao's "singular objective" that to destroy the leadership of backward classes in the State, they called upon other Congress(I) men to quit the party and form a "new force." Mr Bangarappa had been toying with the idea of starting a regional party and his expulsion would only hasten the birth of a new party, sources close to him said. He had toured the districts to scout for support for his move. In the meetings with his supporters, Mr Bangarappa was understood to have discussed the issue of launching a separate outfit to champion the cause of backward classes. In fact, he had talked of a party on the lines of the Mulayam Singh Yadav-Kanshiram combine. The supporters of Mr Bangarappa said the expulsion could not have come at a more opportune time with the panchayat elections round the corner in the State. "This would be the acid test for us," the sources said. However, the supporters of the Chief Minister, Mr M. Veerappa Moily, were jubilant over Mr Bangarappa's expulsion. They felt that dissident activity, which was dented with Mr Bangarappa choosing to take on Mr Rao himself, would now become inconsequential. The Bangarappa group had provided the backbone for the "oust Moily" campaign. The sources said the former Chief Minister would not be able to draw significant support from the legislature party as a majority of legislators would not be prepared to leave the party for his sake. Interestingly, this is not the first time that such drastic action has been taken against Mr Bangarappa. He had faced a similar situation earlier and he had floated a regional party then also. The party failed to kick-off and he had to enact a 'home-coming' into the Congress. Mr Bangarappa, who was made Chief Minister of Karnataka in October 1990 after Mr Veerendra Patil, had to step down following large-scale dissidence in the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) and serious charges of corruption. He was replaced by Mr Veerappa Moily in November last year. Bangalore (UNI): The Karnataka Chief Minister, Mr M. Veerappa Moily, has termed the expulsion of his predecessor, Mr S. Bangarappa, on Monday as "inevitable." Mr Moily said that by taking a strong stand against the party and its leadership, Mr Bangarappa had invited expulsion.
