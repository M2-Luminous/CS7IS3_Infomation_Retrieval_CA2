[Waniek] No. (After a moment). Oh, I am sorry--I did go through military training at the university, and, while I was in high school, I took a course entitled "Defensive Adaptation." An excellent teacher happened to teach the class in my school, and he was the one who shaped my sympathetic attitude toward the Army. [Kowalska] How do you intend to go about achieving authority with the military cadre, which is so conservative that it sometimes even has a hard time accepting the supervision of civilian males? [Waniek] I am not really sure about this whole conservatism thing. I have been asked about this for several days now, but I have to see for myself first whether the cadre is really that conservative. Besides, our Army is making efforts to be included in European structures. So it follows that the Army must modernize its organizational structures, the same way it is happening all over the world. More women will have to be included in our Ministry of National Defense [MON]. [Kowalska] There are some who fear that your nomination may make it difficult to make attempts to increase parliamentary supervision over MON. Right now, the dispute is taking place in the area of disciplinary internal regulations because the military does not want a civilian supervisor to be able to discipline it, even if the supervisor is a minister. What do you think will be the reaction of a general with years of experience when faced with the prospect of being disciplined by a woman? [Waniek] That is a very difficult problem. One must have an understanding of the Army. I can understand the resistance, even though I watched the dispute from a distance. Perhaps a more comprehensive debate on the issue will allow both sides to elaborate on their positions regarding Army issues. I have always greatly respected those who serve in the Army because they have devoted their entire professional lives to the military. I have been in MON for three days, and it would be hard to say that my whole life was associated with the Army, as opposed to a majority of officers. So there must be a difference between us. Of course, I am referring to the advantage of a professional military. [Kowalska] What is your assessment of the changes that are taking place right now in MON, aimed at moving many powers from the "civilian" sector to the General Staff? [Waniek] One must somehow find a middle-of-the-road solution. I do not think that the Army's isolation from the environment in which it functions--which, after all, is a civilian environment--could possibly be to anybody's advantage. I think the trend to open armies up to the civilian world, which has been observed throughout Europe and in Poland for four years now, is probably the right trend. The Army will always retain its specific nature, and I do not think anyone has to fear its being otherwise. Taking up defensive positions is not necessary. At the same time, I do not think a distortion of a balance between MON's civilian and military employees should be a danger right now. [Kowalska] Minister Kolodziejczyk has admitted in the Sejm that there have occurred cases in the Army of forcing soldiers to perform religious practices. Being famous for your fights for the state's philosophy-of-life neutrality, do you intend to prevent such phenomena from occurring in the future? [Waniek] These issues are within the powers of another deputy minister and I have no intentions of interfering with his powers. My views on these issues are well known. Field ordinariates are in operation, but I think that availing oneself of their presence should be voluntary. We have received reports of soldiers being forced to take part in religious ceremonies and that should, of course, be viewed negatively. I would like some guarantees against such cases of coercion to be included in a Charter of Soldier Rights. We plan to prepare such a charter in connection with European and UN human rights conventions. The military has up to now been functioning primarily on the basis of order and discipline. Soldiers' rights have always been regarded as being of the last order of importance. If the MON leadership thinks that these relationships can be changed, that is a very good trend. This applies in particular to soldiers serving in the basic service, for whom human rights in the Army will be of particular value. Thanks to the Army, they will be able to understand what civic rights are all about. [Kowalska] The issue of your nomination was settled within a matter of hours, which is in contrast to Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, the previous candidate put forward by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. How did that happen? Were you a less controversial candidate? [Waniek] They said on television that I was the most controversial candidate of all those proposed to MON, the Foreign Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. But I think the issue is really about something else. The candidacy of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, whom I respect and like very much, emerged in the atmosphere of a public conflict between the SLD and the Belweder. It was the same case with Professor Dariusz Rosati, who was our candidate for the post of finance minister and deputy prime minister. Both of these candidacies were excellent, but they came about at the politically wrong time. [Kowalska] What does the SLD gain by introducing you into a ministry that is headed by a minister put forward by the president? [Waniek] One of the advantages is precisely the fact that an SLD representative is included in a "presidential" ministry. That was not so obvious not so long ago. We have been implementing a plan of our Sejm deputies club--gradually, but with obstacles--for the governing coalition to actively participate in the activities of the three ministries, given that the coalition is taking upon itself the responsibility for the ministries' functioning. The situation up to now was abnormal. There was talk of a coalition consisting of two parties, but, actually, it was a trilateral SLD-Polish Peasant Party-Belweder coalition. [Kowalska] The range of your powers at MON is not too comprehensive, and, most probably, few of the ministry's decisions will be left entirely up to you. But, at the same time, it is you who will have to stick your neck out for the entire ministry in parliament. [Waniek] I do not think it will be that bad. I can resist attempts to shift the burden of someone else's decisions onto me.
