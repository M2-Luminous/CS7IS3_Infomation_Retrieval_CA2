FR940413-2-00018 FR940413-2-00011 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Project No. 2420&hyph;001 Utah] PacifiCorp Electric Operations; Availability of Environmental Assessment April 7, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new license for the existing Cutler Project, located on the Bear River in Cache and Box Elder Counties, Utah, near Logan, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project. In the EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that issuance of a new license for the project, with appropriate environmental protection and enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
