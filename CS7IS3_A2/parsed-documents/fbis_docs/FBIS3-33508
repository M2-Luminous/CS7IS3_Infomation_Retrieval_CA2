Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Alfonsin movement, Simon Lazara, remarked yesterday that a meeting between the chairman of the UCR national committee, Raul Alfonsin, and the senator and Radical leader in the capital, Fernando de la Rua, "would be good" for resolving the conflict among the capital's UCR internal factions. The poll, taken last Friday, showed that 78.9 percent of the citizens affiliated with the UCR reject the agreement between the PJ [Justicialist Party] and the UCR favoring amendment of the Constitution. On the other hand, 21.1 percent support it. Otaegui's survey consists of a sampling of 790 telephone calls selected on the basis of social strata and districts. The poll may possibly prove to be an encouraging precedent for De la Rua, a staunch opponent of the pact, whose supporters in the district promoted a referendum on that subject. Doors Open for Dialogue Lazara explained that no talks have yet been held regarding the possibility of an Alfonsin-De la Rua summmit. The spokesman stressed: "The doors are always open for a dialogue between the two leaders." The presumption of a possible conclave began to be discussed after De la Rua met with the Alfonsinist critic, Jesus Rodriguez (of the Centennial Studies Center). That meeting came to an abrupt end, when the possibilities of no confrontation in the district were exhausted. Meanwhile, next Thursday, the various metropolitan UCR forces will decide at the district committee meeting whether or not to hold the referendum on the Olivos pact favoring constitutional amendment jointly with the internal elections to determine the Buenos Aires convention slates. The De la Rua faction has a wide majority on the board of directors, but the question lies in whether it will obtain the two thirds majority required to impose its will. The De la Rua deputy, Jorge Enrique Benedetti, told LA NACION yesterday: "It would be best if the Centennial group abstained from voting against the referendum next Thursday, and, as a democratic gesture, let the affiliate decide, as stipulated in Articles 112 and 114 of the party's organic charter." Deputy Federico Storani (UCR-Buenos Aires), in statements made to the Cordoba newspaper LA VOZ DEL INTERIOR, lashed out severely against his main internal adversary, expressing the view that, "If the Radical Party fails in the 10 April elections, Raul Alfonsin will pay the political price."
