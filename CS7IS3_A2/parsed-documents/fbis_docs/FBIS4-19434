This morning, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro commented on this. [Unidentified correspondent] To threaten to partially or completely dissolve parliament would be a serious error because it would impinge on the head of state's legal competence. This is how the president's office has replied to members of the majority parties who stressed the problems the new government would have if there were two different majorities in the two chambers of parliament. In the face of this criticism, Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi has sought to clarify his position: [Begin Berlusconi recording] I said that it was clear that in order for a government to govern it must have the two chambers of parliament on its side. If the situation were to arise in one of the two chambers where a majority close to the government could not be found, it would be impossible to govern. [end recording] According to the Northern League's Roberto Maroni, who has made the same points as Berlusconi, the presidency has not understood the gist of his argument. He has denied threatening to dissolve parliament. Christian Democratic Center party leader Pierferdinando Casinis said his were only political observations. For the Progressive Alliance, Achille Occhetto [Democratic Party of the Left leader] commented: [Begin Occhetto recording] I think it was his duty. The head of state has simply said that only he and no one else can dissolve parliament. [end recording] [passage omitted]
