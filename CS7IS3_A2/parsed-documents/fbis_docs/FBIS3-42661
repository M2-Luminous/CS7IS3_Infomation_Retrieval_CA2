For Now the Future Looks Better Than the Present"] [Text] Trade and economic cooperation with the United States is the most politicized sphere of Russia's foreign economic relations. The roots of this go back to the times of the Cold War. In recent years quite a few attempts have been made to rid ourselves of this heritage, and Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow on Saturday may be considered one of the most productive steps along this path. There is reason to hope that the stereotype of relations between Russia and the United States that has developed since the collapse of the USSR and is characterized by various forms of economic assistance (for more about this see KOMMERSANT for 14 January) from the United States while Russia retains discrimination in trade, shall be replaced by macroeconomic cooperation with equal rights. The term "unstable balance" is quite appropriate for a more precise definition of its current condition: This cooperation could become significantly more active in the near future or it could lapse into a condition of stagnation or even decline. The situation before and after Clinton's visit to Moscow is analyzed by KOMMERSANT observer Georgiy Bovt and correspondent Svetlana Sukhova. Trade Has Not Yet Been Liberated From the Legacy of the Past The condition of trade and economic cooperation between Russia and the United States today leaves something to be desired: America's share of Russia's foreign trade is only 2 percent. Commodity turnover at the end of 1993 reached $2.42 billion (Russian exports--$1.007 billion, imports--$1.418 billion). The basis of Russian exports is made up of raw materials and certain agricultural products (grain, nonferrous and precious metals, oil, and certain chemical commodities). Imports are dominated by food and equipment. The figures for 1993 are not the worst of the indicators for recent years. The deficit of the USSR and then Russia is an old affliction of trade with the United States: In 1992 Russian imports exceeded exports as much as 4.2-fold. True, positive tendencies have also appeared recently. This pertains to the gradual elimination of discriminatory restrictions in trade with Russia. For the first time since 1951 Moscow was offered most favored nation status (MFN), and bans and limits on credit through the Commodity-Credit Corporation and Ex-Im Bank were removed, as were restrictions on services of the federal Overseas Private Investment Corporation--OPIC. It is permitted to use preferential credit under the program "Food for Progress" and the Law "On Contributing to Reform in New Democratic Countries" has been adopted (70 restrictions established for "communist countries" have been removed). With input from the United States the reform of Cocom [Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] began--albeit late. This makes it possible for Russia to hope to gain access to science-intensive technologies. During the summer Clinton promised (and Moscow again repeated this promise) to extend to Moscow the Generalized System of Preferences, which will make it possible to abolish customs duties on 5,000 kinds of goods. Russia is also promised certain advantages by the creation of the North American Free Trade Zone (NAFTA) and the promise from the United States (documented in Moscow) to contribute to its entry into GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. Restrictions on American agricultural exports have been removed more dynamically. Since 1991 grain has been delivered to Russia under special credit programs which, as distinct from the five-year agreement between the USSR and the United States of 1990 (strict minimal volumes of annual purchases were stipulated there), leaves a great deal of freedom for the importer to maneuver. True, last year Russia ran up a heavy debt for agricultural credit (at one time the debt exceeded $500 million). Active discussions in Moscow about the need to curtail agricultural imports in general moved the United States to make a number of compromises and in June 1993 conclude four new agreements for the delivery of agricultural products to Russia within the framework of the "Food for Progress" program. Deliveries began in September 1993. At the same time many discriminatory restrictions are still in force. The infamous Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which links the granting of most favored nation status to free immigration, has not been abolished. Although the President has suspended it since 1992 (and since 1990--with respect to agricultural trade), Congress can restore it fully at any time. And there are also many other obstacles to trade. The United States has one of the strictest systems of antidumping legislation in the world. In 1993 a quota was introduced on imports of ferrosilicon from Russia and there is the threat that similar measures may be introduced for aluminum, steel, and potassium chloride. True, the negotiations at the Moscow summit give certain justification for assuming that the U.S. administration will not be in any hurry with such measures. And among their experts, voices are being heard ever more loudly (while, true, they have not prevailed) saying that antidumping provisions concerning "unfair competition" should not be applied to Russia at all during the transition period. There is a precedent already: A decision was adopted in Moscow to give Russia guaranteed access to the American uranium market for 20 years (the planned profit from this transaction is $12 billion). And even earlier, in December, as a result of the work of the Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission many disputed issues related to interaction between the two countries on the space services market were resolved. Investment Cooperation Still the future of economic cooperation between Russia and the United States lies not in the sphere of basic buying and selling and, of course, not in the expansion of assistance to Russia from the United States. It is no accident that during the course of the summit in Moscow a leitmotif of the speeches of Russian representatives was the idea of the need not only for Russia's access to the U.S. market, but also for an increase in private American investments in Russia. Their actual level today cannot be called satisfactory. According to figures of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, U.S. businessmen have invested only $400 million in the Russian economy. And in the Hungarian economy--$2.5 billion. The Americans explain their passivity by the "high risk related to the political instability." Although firms from the United States are even the leaders among Western investors in the creation of joint ventures in Russia--there are already 1,400 of them. But capital investments in Russia cannot even be called completely private because they are backed by the federal government in the form, for example, of the OPIC or the Ex-Im Bank. When granting guarantees (like the federal OPIC) or credit (like, again, the state Ex-Im Bank--$2 billion for the development of the petroleum and gas complex) they protect the private investor from that very "political risk in Russia." And therefore--with such a marked role of the administration--economic cooperation is still far from being completely depoliticized. Obviously it will still depend for a long time on decisions made within bilateral governmental commissions--such, for example, as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission. A great deal will also depend on representative associations of businessmen of a lobbyist bent--like the American Chamber of Commerce that was opened in Moscow during the summit (it unites 150 U.S. firms operating in Russia). The potential for investment cooperation looks quite optimistic. According to information from the data bank of the EAST EUROPEAN INVESTMENT MAGAZINE, the overall volume of declared American private investments during the past four years exceeded $4 billion (of the $8.9 billion for the 10 leading Western countries). This sum was distributed among 207 bilateral projects. The most widespread form of introduction of U.S. businessmen to the Russian market is the creation of joint ventures (70 percent of all the projects and 90 percent of the volume of declared investments). True, it is alarming that the growth rate of the number of declared projects was highest in 1992 and then dropped off. Obviously, in the near future it will become clear how successful they are at dispelling the misgivings caused by the political instability in Russia. In 1993 several U.S. firms included on the FORTUNE 500 List simultaneously announced their intentions to make investments: Cummins created a joint venture with KAMAZ for producing engines; Exxon, Amoco, and Conoco began to penetrate the Russian petroleum and gas complex. It inspires hope that in 1993 they announced the largest number of projects in the areas of computers and telecommunications in recent years (the removal of the Cocom restrictions makes conditions even more favorable for new ones). Investors' interest in the Russian aerospace complex also increased last year (nine projects were earmarked). But the petroleum and gas complex continues to be as juicy a morsel as it was before. According to estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Russia's minimum need for credits for its modernization is now no less than $18 billion, and the maximum (spread over 10 years)--up to $300 billion. After the abolition of the Byrd-Stevenson Amendment in 1992, which set a ceiling of $300 million on the overall volume of credits to Russia from the Ex-Im Bank (with 40 million--for energy projects), the Ex-Im Bank along with the World Bank has already allotted more than $2 billion for the development of the petroleum and gas branch. The realization of the potential for economic cooperation will depend, of course, on the success of the reforms in Russia. The question of creating favorable tax and other conditions for foreign companies is still crucial. So far guarantees from the Russian government to Americans are being replaced by guarantees of the OPIC, which intends to help in the creation of an independent Russian organization for insurance against political risk. The United States has not freed itself (and is not likely to free itself) from the "missionary component" in its foreign economic policy. Questions of human rights and also political interaction with Russia on such global problems as the conditions for nonproliferation of missile and dual-use technologies, actions with respect to "terrorist regimes," etc. will inevitably influence economic relations with Moscow. At least until the purely economic interests and investments of the United States in Russia reach a level that would enable them to rise above the political conditions.
