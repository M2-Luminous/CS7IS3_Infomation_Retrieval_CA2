But the bill is still pending in Congress. Well, what is important here is there is some kind of persistence on our part that we should have a decent Armed Forces in terms of equippage. And what we are really asking for is not really, in the true sense of the word, modernization. We are only pushing for what is really the basic equippage that our Armed Forces should have to make it a credible military force. An air force, for example, cannot be called an honest-to-goodness air force if it does not have any jet fighter interceptors or if it does not have any radar. What we are asking for is very basic. In other words when we talk about modernization we are not talking about high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment, we are only talking of the basic equipment we need in the Armed Forces to at least make it a decent Armed Forces. Sa Navy [in the Navy], for example, how can you say that we have an effective Navy when we don't even have sufficient fast patrol craft that can intimidate fishermen from other countries poaching in our waters? While the AFP is waiting for the modernization bill to be passed, what do you intend to do? We just have to make the most of what we have. We have to be able to maintain the assets we have, although maintaining aging equipment is also not economical. We are maintaining for example ships that are older than the captains of the ship. It's really difficult. Pag tumatanda and [If the equipment is antiquated] the more you spend on maintenance until it becomes more economical to buy a new one already. I think we have gone way past that. Manila and Seoul worked out an arrangement last year which allowed the South Korean government to donate 12 boats to the Navy. Are there any other such projects being planned? We are looking at this. Of course the Koreans, as a matter of fact some of their vessels have been given to us already. We are looking at items for the Air Force also. I'm sure we will not be capable of buying F-16's or things like that. But if we can get geared-up F5's, which will serve the purpose in the interim, maybe for the next 10 years. What about American excess defense articles (EDAs)? We are looking into that possibilities but we also have to look into the aspect of how sufficiently we will be able to maintain this equipment? You talk of EDAs, but there may be no accompanying spare parts. Baka [maybe] after a few months or a year we will be needing spare parts and we will not know where to get them because probably the company that produced these EDAs does not exist anymore or manufacture the parts that we need so balik na naman tayo sa [so we are back to] scrounging. Just like Air Force items na [that are] EDA, they would like to give it to us. Wala namang spare parts [Whereas there are no spare parts]. That's a problem. We will study that very well in the sense that when we accept, these are items that we should be able to maintain and sustain. What is the thrust of the AFP's modernization? The thrust shall be the Navy and Air Force. But critics say your Army background might get in the way. In my first conference with the senior staff and commanders, in the presence of everybody, I said the first priority for modernization is the Air Force and Navy. Pasensya muna ang Army [The Army has to wait]. That's exactly what I said, even when I was commanding general of the Army. I had accepted that: that we have to play second fiddle to the Air Force and Navy. Because as it is, we are proud of the Army already. Ang army naman, halimbawa, makadating sila diyan sa ground, mga adventurers na yan, [The Army, for example, can go to their ground on foot, they are adventurers already] we will give them hell. We have the best soldiers in terms of experience. Of course, certainly, we also would like to upgrade some of the Army's equipment. Engineering equipment and some upgrading. For example, our artillery pieces. Mayroon kaming [We have] 105's howitzers that can shoot at a distance of 10-11 kilometers. If we can upgrade this same gun, we can increase its range to 18-20 kilometers sana [hopefully], which is now being done in other countries. We should be able to do that. Then the army will probably need medyo bago na sasakyan na rin [rather new vehicles] to be used as cargo vehicles for transport of troops and even for use during disasters and calamities. In other words, whatever we get will as much as possible be tied up with national concerns. Yung equipment na kunin namin [The equipment we will procure] will at the same time be made available in case the national government will need them for calamities, disasters, civic action, all of these. What about the plans to streamline the AFP? Oh yes, we will continue it, the streamlining. We have nowhere to go. We have to streamline. Defense Secretary De Villa said this may entail reducing the AFP's strength by 35 percent over a period of 10 years. That's possible. Wala pa tayong fixed figures diyan [We don't have fixed figures yet], but one thing is definite: we will reduce in strength, especially the Army. Is AFP that confident its counterinsurgency efforts will succeed? Well not exactly that confident but I think the trends are there, mukhang [looks like it is] irreversible. I'm not saying 100 percent... mukhang [just seemingly] irreversible. The streamlining will affect thousands of soldiers. How will the AFP prepare them for civilian life? Yes, that's the thing that is really worrying us at the moment. But we are lining up plans to make sure that once a soldier is attrited he must have enough preparation to meet other challenges other than being a soldier. But streamlining will not happen immediately. Right now we will use the normal attrition process. It will be the Army which will have the most strength reduction because when you talk of personnel strength, I think the Navy and Air Force will not be touched so much. It will be the Army that will be very much affected by the reduction in warm-body strength. Now we have, for example, on the average the Army attrites about 200 men per month. This is in the form of retirement, separation and death, etc. So you're talking of about 2,400 per year. Of course hindi naman puwede na [it is not possible that] you will stop recruiting. So maybe for every 2,000 that are separated through normal attrition, probably we can bring in 300, 400 something like that. So in a span of just five years, we are able to attrite 10,000. What about the Civilian Armed Forces Units (Cafgus)? How do you view the proposal to disband them? We have no objection. But it should be done in a manner na hindi naman biglaan [that is not be abrupt]. Hindi naman puwedeng sabihin na bukas i-disband na natin ang Cafgus [We can't say that tomorrow we will disband]. We have to phase it in such a way that it will be in line or proportionate to the improvement in the insurgency situation. Ibig sabihin [What I'm saying is that], we are still pursuing our operational activities... so we will need the Cafgus in many areas. Will the Cafgus be disbanded by the year 2000? Oh yes, probably even before that. How much money will the AFP save when it streamlines? No, we are not talking about savings because as you streamline it probably will be more expensive because you will be spending more on equipment to make up for the loss in personnel. Sabihin mo magbawas ka ng [Say, you reduce] 10,000 troops, that does not mean It will be a big savings. To make up for that ano kailangan mo [what would you need]? You need equipment. The AFP will be more efficient because we should be able to use less people, but of course the effect of that also is we will also be contributing to unemployment if we are not able to prepare for civilian life those who will be taken out of the service. What about the planned reorganization of the AFP, including tbe Kasama na yan [That is included]. It's an overall streamlining process. In other words lahat yan [all of that] will be taken into consideration. Do you accept the view that along with external defense, AFP should Okay lang [That's okay]. The engineers, definitely can help. Even armored cars. If there comes a time na kailangan [that we need] a lot of muscle insofar as illegal logging operations are concerned we can use the armored cars to patrol the forests. That will be tied up with environmental protection. Even the Navy. You are talking about protection of our seas, yung mga corals natin [the corals] that are being raped. If you have sufficient fast patrol craft na nakikita nilang nagpapatrol diyan, yung ating mga [that they see patrolling in the area, the] illegal poachers will think twice. The AFP is also helping in the improvement of the economy. Actually, indirectly, the AFP is helping the economy. Even without talking of engineering, even without talking of direct involvement, indirect involvement of the AFP na lang [just that], it is helping improve the economy. Why is the economy improving? Huwag mo sabihin sa akin hindi kasali ang AFP diyan [Don't tell me the AFP is not involved in it]. How will you handle our relations with other Asean countries? Yung [The] military exercises with Singapore, tuloy pa ba yon [will it push through]? Yes. What about Indonesia? Well, we are now in the process of working this out. This should be a natural, shall we say, arrangement in terms of exercises, bilateral muna [first]. Then maybe multilateral later. Also you have heard the president talking about, even in the Spratlys, yung mga commanders doon e, mag-usap-usap [the commanders there should be speaking to each other]. For example if I'm a commander of the area that we claim, I go there, let's say sa [to the] Vietnamese commander of the area that we claim, I go there, let's say sa Vietnamese commander, ano [right], "o [hey], I'll be going there, mag-picnic tayo diyan [let's picnic there], or something like that. This is more of friendly gestures ba [isn't it]. That the area is not really, should not really be an area of conflict but it should be an area to promote understanding and cooperation for the interest of the nations with conflicting claims. How do you propose to further improve military ties with other Asean countries? It has improved a lot. Unang una [First of all], maybe about three years ago, it was not the same. Right now, ako lang [just me], personally, my counterparts in the army of these other nations, are all now chiefs of staff also, one is even minister of defense. I have met them, we have established very good cooperative and friendly relations with them, they have visited us here, I have visited them. Alam mo [You know], military to military, wala kang problema [you don't have any problem]. Kasi ang culture ng military all over the world isa lang [Because military culture all over the world is one]. Very easy to establish friendships. Kasi walang [Because there are no] political undertones, or political implications. Back to the insurgency, has strategic victory been achieved? What do you think? Alam mo it's very difficult for us to say this. Ikaw [You] what do you think? Have you seen any insurgent activities? Totoo ba yung nasa NSC (National Security Council) briefing na 2.6 percent barangay na lang ang hawak nila [Is it true that in the NSC briefing, the insurgents exert influence only in 2.6 percent of the country's villages]? Oo [Yes]. You interpret it already. Kasi kami pagsinabi namin yan kayo na ang mag-ano niyan [Because if we say so, it is up to you to consider]. Baka mas magaling pa kayo mag-interpret ng data [You must be better in terms of interpreting data]. Matutuloy ang [Are you pushing through the] turnover of counterinsurgency duties to the Philippine National Police (PNP)by the end of this year? Unless there are amendments to the law. The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [RAM -- Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] claims its people are being deliberately targeted for attrition from the AFP. That's not true. I wouldn't say that because they were under my custody when I was Army commander. They seem to have greeted your appointment with relative enthusiasm. . I'm glad, I'm complimented by that. Does this mean you will participate in the peace process more actively, even only in confidence building efforts? I have been doing that, even before. How? I have been showing a lot of sincerity, even at the time when many of them were detained, they were not treated like prisoners, and I helped them. From family problems to bigger problems, open tayo diyan [I'm amenable to that]. This was a period when most of them realized this is part of the game, nadedetain sila, pero hindi dahil na-detain sila pababayaan natin [they are detained, but because they are detained, doesn't mean that they should be ignored]. So when they had problems, we took care of them, that's part of confidence building. But of course this is not for me to become popular with these people. I will help them for as long it will not go beyond policies, regulations. Will AFP continue its support to PNP [Philippine National Police] in its anti-criminality drive? We are providing full support. As chief of staff now, I am committing the resources of the AFP on whatever the PACC [Presidential Anti-Crime Commission] will need without necessarily being seen as being the major (player). Ano lang tayo [We are just their], support. Our role is we should be able to help all the agencies of government that need our help. Is the AFP's rapid deployment force, about one battalion of crack troops, still under the AFP's Task Force Hammerhead which is mandated to assist law enforcement agencies? Oo. Nag-usap nga kami ni vice president diyan, sabi ko [Yes. The vice president and I have discussed this. I told him], if Gen. Lisandro Abadia supported you so much, I will support you with more. The AFP seems to be adopting a "low profile policy." Good. That's the way it should be. Alam mo the less the AFP is talked about, the better. So the less you get news from us the better. The less I appear on TV, the less I am read about, di-ba [right?], it is better. What do you anticipate will offer you the greatest difficulty as chief of staff? I do not know yet. I hope I do not have the greatest difficulty. Back to modernization, do you really feel a substantial upgrade in equippage is possible, given all the limitations? Modernization will be one of my "flagship projects." By the end of my term, I hope I will not be frustrated. Ang importante diyan [What is important] is we are following a certain line, if somehow we can improve the Armed Forces in terms of equippage, I will be very happy. If we are able to improve some more the attitudes of our people, better. Because when you talk of modernization, you are not only talking of equippage. You are talking of training, and the goal of having every person in the armed forces, ang kanyang [his] preoccupation is to strive for excellence. To be able to show to the civilian community that we are not different. Though we are soldiers, we are part of the country, part of the community.
