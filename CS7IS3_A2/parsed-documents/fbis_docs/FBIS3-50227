It is now more than one year since this government assumed the leadership of the country under conditions that were very difficult regarding both the international and domestic situation. Despite this, in 1993 we achieved important results in implementing the government program. Annual inflation decreased 15 percent. The fall in industrial output was sharply decreased. A provisional trade agreement was signed between Bulgaria and the European Union. Agreement was reached with the London Club on settling our foreign debt. A decision was adopted on settling the so-called bad debts of the state enterprises that date before 1991. Some 43 percent of the land was restored to former owners, and an additional 23 percent was allocated for provisional use. We saw the beginning of market privatization. All the conditions for rapidly carrying out the first stage of mass privatization were prepared, despite the fact that the relevant bill has already been delayed five months by the parliamentary commissions. We have fulfilled the promise to compensate for 95 percent of the income of pensioners and those who work in the state sector affected by inflation. Without this those people would have found themselves in a much more serious situation than existed in December 1992. I do not say that there were no shortcomings in our work, but it is irresponsible to claim that nothing was accomplished during the past year. At the beginning of 1994 we face a significant test -- the adoption of the 1994 state budget. In this sphere the government completed its work on time. The draft budget was prepared and submitted to the National Assembly at the beginning of December 1993. This draft is the cornerstone of the government's intentions in economic policy. We fully realize that despite the achievements, the country's economy is still unstable. This requires us to implement balanced measures aimed at restructuring, stabilizing, maintaining, and developing the social welfare system and apply funds prudently. One of the cabinet's basic goals, in addition to the struggle against inflation and the economic crisis, is to resolve the issue of the country's foreign debt to commercial banks. In this way we will relieve our economy of the burden of its total isolation vis-a- vis the international financial markets. The achievement of the economic policy goals proposed by the cabinet depends to a large extent on the support our country receives from the international financial community. This applies not only to the scope of the aid we will receive, but also to the timing of receiving it. In the course of the discussion on the budget in the National Assembly and outside it demands were voiced by separate departments and public sectors to receive far more resources than envisaged by the budget. When such demands are voiced those who make them act purely from their own limited interests without taking into consideration the general national balance. Such a course is very easy and perhaps even very profitable from a political point of view. An impossible situation would emerge, however, if we all head in the same direction. This government was elected on the basis of an anti-inflation program. Despite the views of some that it has not shown sufficient will to govern, the government has in fact followed this anti- inflation policy until now. The government will continue to follow this policy with determination, despite the unpopular measures that are occasionally necessary. It is very easy to release the anti-inflation brakes and give everyone much higher pensions and wages, free medical services, free medicines, free higher education, and cheap apartments, heating, and electric power, all subsidized by the government. This is possible only if parliament relieves the government of the responsibility of struggling against inflation. Either we wage this struggle, or by implementing the aforementioned benefits we will slide down the slope of accelerated inflation. There is no middle way. Let those who want a policy that leads to accelerated inflation have the courage to say so clearly and openly. The draft budget is being discussed by the relevant parliamentary commissions and it will soon be included in the National Assembly agenda for its first reading. It must be pointed out that several important factors for the country depend on the final adoption of the budget at the second reading no later than 16 February. The government has already taken those factors into account in various agreements that it signed. The first is the receipt of the financial aid from the G-24, which will meet on 4 March in Brussels to discuss financial issues. We expect aid from them to the tune of $300-330 million for financing the country's balance of payments on condition that the implementation of the government's economic policy begins on the basis of adopting the 1994 draft budget. However, the G-24 countries need a minimum of two weeks to prepare their meeting and assume their commitments. Precisely this determines the term that I have mentioned, namely, adopting the budget no later than 16 February. Signing a new agreement with the IMF is another significant source of financing the country's process of reforms. This could be implemented by mid-March, if the budget is adopted by 16 February. On this basis, even before the end of March the country could receive the first part of the financial aid, which amounts to about $150 million, and an additional $100 million from the World Bank structural restructuring loan. By about the same time -- 22 March -- and under the same preconditions a meeting of the Paris Club will take place. We expect from this meeting not only officially to reschedule the payments of our foreign debt at better conditions, but also to obtain an additional reduction of 50-60 percent on a bilateral basis. For this we are relying on France's active support. If this entire chain reaction is not put into effect because we do not adopt or we delay the adoption of the Budget Bill, everything we achieved in the past year will lose its importance. The disruption of this chain of favorable opportunities that we have prepared by not adopting the 1994 Budget Bill on time, will result in a sharp worsening of our balance of payments, the dollar exchange rate, accelerated inflation, and generally, an economic crisis in 1994. I would like to remind you that in addition to this financial aspect there is a social one: Everyone can imagine what effect all this will have on socially deprived circles and how pensions, grants, medical services, education, culture, the police, and the army, on which the country's security depends, will be affected. In such a case, if the adoption of the budget is delayed after 16 February, or if the Budget Bill is not adopted by the National Assembly, the government will not be held responsible for the consequences. The government's task ends here, namely, with ensuring this chain of favorable opportunities. From this point on the responsibility belongs to parliament. Therefore I appeal to politicians to adopt the budget by mid-February. Afterward, everyone may act in accordance with his own understanding. However, now, those politicians in and outside parliament who cause a delay in adopting the budget or prevent its adoption will be betraying the interests of their people and, because of their malice and political shortsightedness, they are prepared to ruin the country if they cannot rule it. It is not in this way that one could assume power in the country. The last opportunity to adopt the budget on time will be if it is put on the National Assembly agenda on Thursday [27 January] or Friday [28 February]. The two Mondays and Tuesdays before 16 February must become regular working days for the National Assembly. I appeal to the National Assembly members not only to adopt the Budget Bill rapidly, but also to show a responsible and competent approach during the debate. The alternative to adopting the budget is obvious -- immediate new parliamentary elections. Simultaneously, the sociological polls and the experts imply that this is an illusionary alternative, unwanted by the political forces and the voters. The elections will immediately mean that the country will be in the midst of a desperate political crisis that will lead to economic chaos and delayed reforms. There are only those two alternatives. No compromise is possible. You must select one of the two alternatives in the next few days. It was my duty today to warn you all about this, so that tomorrow there will be no misunderstanding as to who defended the national needs and who must bear the responsibility for causing the premeditated economic-political disaster in our country. Let us rally this time around the necessity to adopt the budget on time, and thus demonstrate that we are a nation that merits respect, and one that can understand and defend its common interests. Otherwise we will be at the end of the line. In such a case the difficulties that we have experienced in the last three years will be in vain, and the next government will have to begin everything anew. Thank you very much.
