Finland is and always will be an independent country, but it is very unpleasant if Finland wants to join NATO or some other military alliance acting against Russia. Membership in NATO would only bring corpses for Finland. As Russia and NATO would be brought into war against each other, Finland would be the battlefield and that is very regrettable. I know that efforts are now being made to incorporate our neighboring countries Poland and the Baltics into NATO. That is very regrettable from our point of view." Having arrived in Finland, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy denies his earlier demands for Finland to be incorporated into Russia and for the borders valid during the czar era to be restored. We do not want to revive the western borders of the Russian empire, we support the resolutions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe held in Helsinki in 1975. Together with other countries, Russia has ratified and signed the Helsinki agreement. A remark by Zhirinovskiy that the October Revolution was illegal and that Russia must restore the prerevolution borders nevertheless contradicts this statement. At his party congress [words indistinct] Zhirinovskiy showed a map indicating that Finland belongs to Russia and this was also included in the resolutions of the Liberal Democratic Party. Having arrived in Finland, Zhirinovskiy has not let lie the demands for a return of Karelia. "You have a successor who seeks to restore Karelia to Finland, but Karelia belongs to Russia. As you know, territorial demands only lead to war. You can see what is happening in the Balkans, in Central Asia, the Middle East. We must [word indistinct], be quiet and moderate." Zhirinovskiy is voicing language policy demands to Finland. "I think it would be a good thing if the Russian language were to become the third official language in Finland. I said that when I visited this country three years ago. Why do you have Swedish as the second language? At the least, write street names in Russian, and restaurant menus. Open a Russian school. Three years ago I asked for the Russian sixth form college to be reopened and why do you keep the Russian church as a storeroom, Zhirinovskiy asks. He does not even listen; although, it is explained to him that Helsinki does have both a Russian school and an Orthodox church, which are doing quite well." Zhirinovskiy is boasting about his relations with the Finno-Ugric nations living in Russia. In the elections, he received quite a lot of votes from our distant relatives, because Zhirinovskiy promised to retain the kolkhozes, knowing that the Ugrians of Russia fear the privatization of agriculture. "I am a member of the cultural society of Udmurtia, and we are well disposed towards your kindred nations the Udmurts, the Khants, Manses, and Maris, but you Finns do not care about your relatives. You only distance yourselves from them. Following on this, Zhirinovskiy reiterates his previous suggestion to be allowed to send Russian children from St. Petersburg to Lapland to celebrate New Year. Let us jointly develop trade and sports, he suggests. But if some general in your country demands that Karelia shall be reincorporated into Finland, the result will be only corpses, Zhirinovskiy threatens." Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy, who has been granted dictatorial powers by his own party for the next 10 years, is already preparing at full speed for the next presidential elections, but nevertheless he does not show his cards for Yeltsin to see. Zhirinovskiy denies rumors that Yeltsin is sick and is no longer capable of discharging his duties. This is what Zhirinovskiy has to say about Yeltsin: "Boris Nikolayevich is feeling fine, do not nurse any hopes that he would leave his post somehow. He will last until the end of term. After 12 June, there will be another president in the country. Our president, our nation, and our Army too are feeling fine. Hopefully, your president too is feeling fine and will live long. President Yeltsin is only cunning and now and again he plays a sick man, Zhirinovskiy claims. It is rumored that he is after all a good friend of Boris Yeltsin." In Zhirinovskiy's view, France's ban on Zhirinovskiy is linked to Russia's internal political struggle for power. France is defending tooth and nail the democrats in Russia, Zhirinovskiy claims: "[words indistinct] They understand it is impossible to stop me in my country. They are trying to thwart my support in my own country, but they will not succeed. They cannot stop me. They do not order what the Russians should think and whom they should support. It is better for me to be at home in Russia among my own voters, because that is where I am doing political work." Zhirinovskiy boasts that he represents the views of the majority in the Russian parliament, the Duma. In voting, we receive a majority with the support of the communists, farmers, and small groups, he says. This is indeed true when one follows voting in the Russian Duma. The democratic members of the delegation say that they disagree completely with Zhirinovskiy for example on NATO, the Council of Europe, and Finland, but the big-mouthed chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party interrupts their talk, claiming that they got into the Russian Duma by fraudulent means. In this way Vladimir Zhirinovskiy floors his opponents: "We received 50, as much as 70 percent of all votes in the elections. They, my opponents, stole my votes and for that reason they are now in the Duma quite illegally. There are groups who should not be in the Duma at all, but after the next elections they will no longer be there, claims Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Then the Liberal Democrats' number of representatives in the Duma will total 300 out of 450 seats. There will no longer be any democrats in the next Duma, we will see to that, Zhirinovskiy boasts." He declares that he is a convinced opponent of western democracy. "Russia does not have any model countries, we go our own way. I did not come here to Finland to learn from you, I have nothing to learn. I am ready to teach you if you so wish. We in Russia do not need the Council of Europe or NATO, but if they need Russia, then let them learn from us. Recently in Moscow we set up a pan-Slav parliament that unites Eastern Europe. Finland could join that too, Zhirinovskiy suggests." It is vain to explain to him that the Finns are not a Slav nation. The Finnish unemployment problem brings out the schadenfreude in Zhirinovskiy. "You now have half a million unemployed, soon they will be 1 million, unless you want economic cooperation with us. We will then have cooperation with Sweden if our cooperation is not good enough for Finland." In breach of all agreements signed by Russia, Zhirinovskiy demands that the Baltics be reincorporated into Russia. He swears that the Russian troops will remain in the Baltics as Russia's outpost picket. He claims that the states that have separated from Russia are all the time rejoining. That is what Tajikistan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and so forth are now doing. To Mr. Zhirinovskiy, NATO's Partnership for Peace is mere bluffing by which small states are deceived. It is only the porch into NATO, he claims. Russia was deceived when the Warsaw Treaty was wound up, because NATO was not wound up at the same time, but NATO will fall, Zhirinovskiy forecasts. When the Liberal Democratic Party gains power in Russia, Russia will leave the United Nations and the center of Europe will be in Russia. The intervention of the other parliamentary deputies in the talking makes Zhirinovskiy angry. He leaves the news conference very angry. Zhirinovskiy leaves angrily when the reporters began to interview other members of the delegation. To them Zhirinovskiy is quite an embarrassing representative in the Russian parliament.
