FBIS3-12442 "drnes040_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 SYRIA Commentaries Examine Israel, Hebron Massacre Peace Talks `Waste of Time' JN2802145694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 28 Feb 94 JN2802145694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Israel now stands accused before the entire world, ashamed and haunted by the curses of the innocent ones who were killed in the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque, the occupied Arab territories, and Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah as a result of the Zionist beast's rampage and indiscriminate shooting. Over 60 people were killed in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the horrible massacre that was carried out by settlers and covered by the Israeli Army. Hundreds were left wounded. In the occupied territories, 19 people were killed as of yesterday at the hands of the Israeli Army. Many were also wounded. As for the Juniyah church massacre, Israel deliberately carried out this attack to distract attention away from the horrible Friday massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque. In the face of the world's strong condemnation and rising calls for the protection of the Arab citizens in the occupied territories, Israel, as usual, has created a fog of falsehood. Its officials expressed regret and some of them alleged sorrow. Shim'on Peres went as far as saying that the settlers are a catastrophe for Israel, knowing that Shamir's former government and Rabin's current government gave priority to settlement activities. Rabin himself saw to it that the settlers were armed and given all means of support and, only recently, his agriculture minister expanded a settlement in the Golan Heights. Both Shamir and Rabin blocked the peace talks in Washington and two years later, Israel has not yet pledged to withdraw from the occupied territories. Rabin's main objective in singing the Oslo Agreement, and then holding negotiations to interpret it, was to maintain the settlements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as arsenals, a sword hanging over the heads of the Palestinians. Consequently, the alleged sorrow expressed by Israeli officials is a cheap attempt at deception. The return of stability, calm, and tranquility to the Middle East hinges on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the dismantling all forms of occupation, the end of all settlement activities, and the building of a just and comprehensive peace that protects everyone's rights. Israel has, thus far, rejected withdrawal, refused to halt settlement activities, and rejected just and comprehensive peace. Even after the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which shocked and disgusted the world, Israeli terrorism continued to claim more innocent lives. The Palestinian people were punished and subjected to military siege and curfews, and the Lebanese people, who denounced the massacre, were punished by an Israeli bomb in Juniyah church. Meanwhile, the Zionist settlers, who committed the slaughter in cold blood, are moving around freely and celebrating the crime. The measures, which Rabin claims to have taken against the fanatical settlers, are aimed at throwing dust in the eyes of the world. For over 40 years, Israel has been uprooting the Palestinian people from their land and property through force, terrorism, and massacres. The Friday massacre is not unusual in this Israeli trend. It is a continuation of the series of crimes, such as those in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, and al-Samu', and is aimed at terrorizing the Palestinian and forcing them to leave their land. Thus, talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of time. It is, indeed, absurd. For over two years, the Arab delegations have failed to prompt Israel to even pledge to withdraw from the occupied territories. Friday's massacre and the ensuing events threaten that the situation in the region will deteriorate unless the world community takes resolute and effective moves to protect the Palestinian people, first and foremost. They must also stress that the Middle East peace hinges on Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied territories and its removal of the settlers, and that these issues cannot be delayed or postponed. The Western powers, who have provided all kinds of military and economic aid to Israel, are responsible for checking the rampage of the Israeli beast. There is no purpose or meaning in holding any peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment to implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.
