For example, he said, over any "South/South" trade, he would welcome an opportunity for "shipping things into Barbados." "Let us look at more trade with our neighbours. Let us look at more trade in Caricom (the Caribbean Community). Let us look at more trade with Guadeloupe and Martinique," Maynard suggested. He was reacting to agronomist Arthie Martin's suggestion that Caribbean countries should engage in more South/South trade. Martin said that traditional trading arrangement which small countries like Dominica have with the industrialised world might take a beating from international trade arrangements like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Maynard said: "We have engaged in a programme of moving into trade with Venezuela... Despite that, this has been on for more than a year ... We have not seen any breakthrough." He also pointed to trade-related matters with Colombia and other Latin American countries, which "have remained merely at the level of discussions." He urged local manufacturers here to try to expand their exports in and out of the region.
