This morning, we are going to once again give you an update on the elections so far, particularly the counting process and progress. However, before we start I am pleased to say that we sincerely hope we will be getting here a number of commissioners to come and give you geographic details in terms of what happened during the voting process during the two, three days in some areas, and also bring you up to (?speed) about specifics of counting stations in their respective provinces. Before we proceed I am now going to hand you over to my colleague on the extreme left, my left that is, Pieter Cronje, to give you the latest results as we have them. Over to you, Pieter. [Cronje] Good morning. The latest results as at 11:14 AM for the National Assembly are as follows: PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], 27,915; Soccer Party, 1,649; VF/FF [Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front], 95,994; WLP [Worker's List Party], 622; WRPP [Women's Rights Peace Party], 1,661; XPP [Ximoko Progressive Party], 677; ACDP [African Christian Democratic Party], 14,585; ADM [African Democratic Movement], 1,073; AMCP [African Moderates Congress Party], 7,107; AMP [African Muslim Party], 3,087; ANC, 1,267,462; DP [Democratic Party], 62,771; DPSA [Dikwankwentla Party of South Africa], 2,772; FP [Federal Party], 2,940; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], 70,364; KISS [Keep It Straight and Simple Party], 1,284; Lusap [LUSO-South African Party], 625; MF [Minority Front], 1,710; NP [National Party], 814,260; Rejected, 43,214. And the total, as at 11:14 AM today, 2,421,772. I also have for you ladies and gentlemen a statement: Yesterday afternoon, the commission of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] took an important decision to release results as soon as they became available. That is at a point at which the results were still formally unverifiable. The separation of the verification process from the process of compilation of the results was successfully completed by about 10:00 PM last night. As a consequence of which the flow of results began to increase exponentially. Where the count had formerly stood at about 30,000 late yesterday afternoon, the position unverified, is presently approaching 5 million, enabling a clearer picture of trends to emerge, and we believe easing the minds of the electorate about the flow and ultimate success of this second stage of the electoral process. Nevertheless, the commission is of the view that the process should be completed by tomorrow night, and further efforts are being made to speed up the process of delivering unverified results. The verification process continues as a parallel process, and the results of this process will be fed into the commission's determination of the freeness and fairness of the result. Outstanding issues will continue to be dealt with after the formal announcement of the result, and these issues may cause minor, if not marginal adjustments to the final picture. Such adjustments are not expected to affect the overall picture. By last night this adjustment of the counting process had dramatically improved the flow of results to the electorate, and as things stand this morning results known are already showing the development of clear trends nationally and in certain provinces. Three major provincial counting centers, those are Pretoria Show Grounds, and Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and at the Durban Expo Center in Natal, are expected to begin delivering their results during the course of this morning. As these centers kick into the process, we expect the counting flow to increase substantially, moving the results process much closer to finalization. There has also been some questions about the issue of reconciliation, and for an explanation of that I hand you to my colleague Kumi Naidoo. [Naidoo] There have been several questions with regard to reconciliation. I will just read the questions out the way that they are put to us first, and then give you the response. The first question was.... [Announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] We'll just take my voice over of what's happening at the press conference there, just to remind you that as far strictly the results are concerned, if you sense a small discrepancy in what we already know and what we hear from the IEC press conference, it is simply because by virtue of the fact that our results are slightly ahead--so that discrepancy that you sense is simply because you're ahead of the IEC official announcement there, so keep staying with us. [Naidoo] Officials acting together with the party voting agents at a particular counting center. Where there is consensus with the regard to those ballot boxes that have not yet been reconciled then the counting can proceed with regard to those specific ballot boxes. Where there might be objections by any political party, then there is an objection form, prescribed form, where such objections will be noted. The important point to note is that these ballot boxes will be separated out and will be (?recorded) separately in the count. The second question was: Does this mean we won't know if extra ballot boxes stuffed with ballots of unknown origins get slipped into the count? The answer to that is no. We will know because of the specialized voting station stamp for each voting station. The voting station number will be on the ballot paper statement which will be prepared by the presiding officer and will be checked with the ballots in that particular box. Thirdly, does this mean we won't know if ballot boxes have been stolen, mislaid, or lost? The answer there is no, we will know, because the reconciliation of the ballot boxes itself is seen as part of the registration and receipt process of the ballot boxes, which you remember yesterday we said there was a first phase of the counting process, and that will still continue. The reconciliation process that the judge referred to last night, deals primarily with the reconciliation between the ballot paper statements per ballot box, and the contents of that box. Fourth: Has any other election in the world being conducted without reconciliation? In the elections with a voter's role reconciliation processes are fairly standard. Countries with an established electoral system generally have voter's lists. However, with regard to countries without a voter's role, at this stage we are not able to confirm whether there are other similar precedents. We are consulting with our international commissioners for a speedy answer with regard to this query. The next question: Where do all the unmarked ballot papers go now? They are secured at a safe place immediately after the count. The act provides for the commission to assess all the returned electoral materials and to destroy them after 30 days have passed after the count. This would include not only ballot papers but various other types of forms and other stationary that cannot be used again. The next question is when will these unused ballot papers be counted? These will be done at the counting station and is part of the documentation that will be worked on by the counting centers' staff, after the vote itself is done. And the question that leads on from that is: Will the IEC try to trace the so-called missing ballots? The answer to that is yes, and as you probably know already, the IEC has already instituted two investigations, an internal and an external one. Okay, there were some additional questions which arrived a bit late, and I will just respond to them now: What is the difference between rejected votes and spoilt votes? My understanding is that there isn't a difference. So, It's just a issue of terminology. The next question I don't know how to answer? How did voting go in the hostels on the Rand? Was it peaceful or tense? I'm not sure whether you can actually have a peaceful election, and be tense at the same time. But indications are that there was no reports of violence, and that elections proceeded smoothly on the hostels generally. [passage omitted]
