"I am worried because we now have more than 4 million unemployed in Germany as a whole," Kohl said on Friday [18 February], according to the prereleased text of his speech at the opening of the Ambiente consumer products fair in Frankfurt. In order to reduce unemployment, there must be a considerable increase in the number of part-time jobs offered, the chancellor said. According to the text, the chancellor said the conclusion of the collective agreement in the chemical industry with lower pay for newly employed long-term unemployed and entrants is "an important signal." European Economic and Monetary Union, which entered its second stage at the beginning of the year, is also a basis for employment, growth, and prosperity in the FRG, Kohl said at the beginning of the world's largest exhibition of consumer goods. In 1992, Germany exported goods valued at 365 billion German marks to countries of the European Union [EU]. Thus, since its founding in 1957, Germany's exports to the EU countries increased almost twice as much as to the rest of the world. At the Ambiente spring fair, almost 4,800 exhibitors from more than 70 countries are showing products for the table and kitchen, household and lighting ideas, and fancy goods.
