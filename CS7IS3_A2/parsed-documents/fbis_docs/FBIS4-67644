A couple of patients will soon take the matter to court. They are suing the Heart Disease Association, which assured them that it was safe to have bypass surgery done in Tallinn. Jyrki Olkinuora, who has been a specialist at the Heart Disease Association since the spring of 1990, says that suspicions regarding contaminated blood arose in the summer of 1990. That led to an agreement between the hospital doing the operations in Tallinn, the Blood Bank, and the Heart Disease Association. The agreement stipulated that only Finnish blood products would be used in operations thereafter. The last group of four patients was sent to Tallinn by the Heart Disease Association in the fall of that same year, he says. Why patients in that group were also infected is a mystery. "I feel that the infection came from local plasma products," says Olkinuora. He considers that to be malpractice. He says that unfortunately, Finnish law does not provide compensation for that kind of malpractice if the operating surgeons are not covered by our insurance system. About 100 Patients Between 1988 and 1990, nearly 100 patients underwent bypass surgery in Tallinn. There was also a period when bypass surgery on Finns was performed in Spain, England, and the United States. HUFVUDSTADSBLADET has learned that hepatitis C was a problem only in Tallinn. [passage omitted] Bypass patients who were operated on in Finland have also been infected with hepatitis C. A survey of 685 such patients at all the university hospital centers from December 1987 through November 1988 detected at least nine cases. Since every patient being operated on received an average of 12 units of blood, hepatitis C is estimated to have been present in one out of every 1,000 bags of Finnish blood at that time. That is a small percentage from the international standpoint. Blood Tested Since 1990 Although the virus was isolated in 1989, a long time passed before it was possible to detect hepatitis C in blood. The Finnish Red Cross blood bank was one of the first in the world to begin the first tests in April 1990. Since then the blood bank has systematically tested all blood for the presence of hepatitis C, and testing methods have been refined. Sweden did not follow our example until about a year later. So far, no studies have been made to determine how serious the liver damage caused by hepatitis C has been in Finland.
