Milyanchikov, including recorded comment by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Excerpts] Elections to a new parliament were held in Ukraine today. [Milyanchikov] Unlike Russian elections to local councils, Crimean elections can be regarded as valid. [passage omitted] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who also took part in today's voting, believes that the results of Crimean elections and of the poll [on relations with Russia] will not spoil relations with Kiev. [Meshkov] There are no grounds, no reasons for this. On the contrary, the situation is becoming more clear and calm. Mutual relations will be settled if we reach agreement and if the Kiev leadership shows understanding. In this case all problems will be solved. [Milyanchikov] At 2000 Moscow time -- and I will remind you that as of today Crimea lives according to Moscow time -- the polling stations closed and the count of votes started. Two forecasts can be made, however, before all the votes are counted. The Russian idea, with which the Russia bloc and the Crimea Russian-speaking movement came to the elections, has won. And the second thing: In many constituencies, electors will have to cast their votes again since more than 1,100 candidates are vying for the 90 seats in the Crimean parliament.
