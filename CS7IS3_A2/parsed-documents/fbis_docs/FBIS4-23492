The government-UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] talks are still bogged down on the issue of swearing in UNITA members of Parliament. Our Lusaka correspondent Alves Antonio has the details: The UNITA negotiators claim they are still considering the issue that was placed on the negotiating table on 3 June. This afternoon the two negotiating teams were at the Mulungushi Conference Center to once again try to find a way out to that issue, but to no avail. Meanwhile, efforts continue to be made to overcome the obstacles so that other aspects relating to national reconciliation can be addressed. It was not a productive day, but the delegations are still eager to negotiate.
