Washington has shown concern in recent weeks following the departure of two prominent officials from the Russian Government, and the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich as chairman of the Belarusian parliament. State Department Spokesman Michael D. McCurry said Shushkevich's ouster "deprives Belarus of a leadership that has made a remarkable contribution to peace and stability in Europe and to the development of U.S.-Belarus relations." The personnel changes in Russia and Belarus happened just weeks after President Bill Clinton's visit to the area. "We continually reassess the policy in terms of changing events, but I think the overall policy, which has been to support the reformists, to support democraticization, is the right policy," said White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. "We need to wait and see what their policies are before we make judgments about whether they've reversed course," Myers said. While economic aid in other areas is tied to progress of the reforms, the fund promised for nuclear weapons removal in Belarus will go ahead, Myers said.
