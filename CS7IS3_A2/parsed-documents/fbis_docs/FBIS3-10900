Interior Minister Jorge Busti also criticized the action. Santiago del Estero Radical Party members predicted, for their part, that the federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, "will come to the same end as his predecessors" and cautioned that the disturbances last December were not "the culmination of a process but rather a wake-up call." Nine workers at the company Textil Santiaguena, which is located in the Huaico Hondo neighborhood, were wounded by the rubber bullets or overcome by the tear gas used during the evacuation of the plant, which had been ordered by Judge Silvia de Ferreyra Lesye and carried out by the Infantry Corps of the provincial police. The workers said that they had occupied the plant "in defense of jobs" inasmuch as the firm had declared bankruptcy and the property had been auctioned off. At a press conference after the eviction the workers blamed the police crackdown on Brigadier Antonietti and said that the agents who had taken part in the maneuver "received extra pay to dislodge us by whatever means." One of the evicted workers related that "the chief of the Infantry Corps, Julio Olivera, made me kneel down, aimed his service weapon at my head, and then fired to one side. The blast made me pass out and damaged my hearing." The demonstrators also criticized the judge: "She deceived all of us workers by saying that she had decided to give us five days and then ordering the eviction a few hours later." In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station, Minister Busti described as "regrettable the way in which the police took action at the textile plant" and announced that he had ordered preliminary proceedings opened against Olivera for the means that he had used to regain control of the plant. Moreover, the Province Committee of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) asserted in a press release that overseer Schiaretti "will come to the same end as his predecessors," adding that he "is mistaken if he still thinks that what happened in December was the culmination of a process, inasmuch as it was only a wake-up call." The Santiago del Estero UCR, led by National Deputy Jose Zavalia, indicated that "Schiaretti is just as arrogant and deaf as his predecessors," asserting that the demands of the people "are still unmet." Legal Insecurity Former Federal Judge Federico Pinto Kramer charged yesterday in this city that "legal insecurity in Santiago del Estero is becoming increasingly self-evident," adding that "the desire of some judges to be in the limelight casts suspicion on court actions and confuses public opinion with false news." At a press conference the well-known attorney questioned the new arrest warrant issued for his client, former government spokesman Miguel Brevetta Rodriguez, who has been accused of signing a 300,000-peso advertising contract with a nonexistent Tucuman firm. Former Governor Carlos Mujica and his interior minister, Angel Bagli, are also at large in connection with this case. Pinto Kramer gave newsmen photocopies of the alleged contract and asserted that it was not signed with a dummy company. "The contract was signed with a well-known advertising firm on behalf of a printing house," he said. The former judge indicated that "there is a black smoke screen to confuse instead of clarify" and charged that "four months into the investigation the proceedings are still being kept confidential and there is more talk than action." In addition, the former federal judge also lashed out at the federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, recalling that he had said that he "would fill the jails." "With whom?" Pinto Kramer said sarcastically, then asserting that "so far the Mujica administration seems to be the most conscientious in recent years." Mujica resigned late last October amid charges of embezzlement and was replaced by Deputy Governor Fernando Lobo. Brevetta Rodriguez's and Mujica's homes are among the houses and public buildings that have been looted and burned.
