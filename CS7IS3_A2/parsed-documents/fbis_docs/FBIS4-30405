A total of 218 people, including proxies (and 112 actual members), attended the meeting. A group of Diet members who have been conducting a signature-collecting campaign seeking a general election under the new system formed "Kaikaku Rengo" to continue their campaign. It is comprised mainly of signers in the campaign, and former Health and Welfare Minister Yuji Tsushima was named a representative. Among the "Kaikaku Rengo" policies are: 1) it will tenaciously oppose the attempt to take political reform back to the drawing board by holding a general election under the current multiseat system; 2) Diet reform, administrative reform, and economic restructuring should be promoted; and 3) political ethics should be established to root out political corruption. The group intends to ask the government and each party to cooperate in realizing these policies. It also intends to positively tackle legislation sponsored by house members. The 218-member group is comprised of 31 Dietmen from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]; 23 from the Social Democratic Party of Japan; 52 from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 48 from Komeito; 26 from the Japan New Party; 14 from Sakigake [Harbinger Party], Group Seiun, and Minshu No Kaze; 10 from the Democratic Socialist Party; three from the Liberal Party; five from the New Party Mirai; and six independents. Group Representative Tsushima held a news conference after the general meeting. Commenting on the connection between the LDP move to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata Cabinet to Diet and "Kaikaku Rengo's" activities, he said: "Our appeal for political reform and the move toward the no-confidence motion are different issues." Meanwhile, he stressed: "The common view of `Kaikaku Rengo' members is that a general election should not be held unless the redistricting bill is enacted."
