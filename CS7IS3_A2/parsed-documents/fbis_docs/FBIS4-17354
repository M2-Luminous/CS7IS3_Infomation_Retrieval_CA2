Ponomarev and Yakunin Hate To `Lose Face'"] [Text] The "Democratic Russia" movement conference for hearing reports and preparing for elections was held in Moscow on 20 and 21 April. A split developed from the very first day both among the conference delegates and among the "Children of Russia" Coordination Council. The apple of discord was the "Children of Russia" movement's attitude toward the "Russia's Choice" party being created by Yegor Gaydar. The resolution on providing organizational support for "Russia's Choice" obtained 276 votes while 34 delegates were against and 13 abstained. A situation of uncertainty took shape. In the wake of Ilya Zaslavskiy's address saying that only a new reformers party with a rigid structure and individual membership can countervail the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, "Democratic Russia" cochairman Lev Ponomarev stated that in such a case the "Democratic Russia" movement was going to forfeit its political independence and "face." As for Gleb Yakunin, he discerned in Ilya Zaslavskiy's statement and in the passed resolution on "Russia's Choice" the beginning of the end of the Moscow-based "Democratic Russia." The discussion of organizational questions reconciled everybody for a time, however, and the delegates decided to make no amendments in the "Democratic Russia" rules for the time being. The conference did pass one amendment, though. The "Democratic Russia" rules say that the Coordination Council cannot be composed of more than 20 percent of representatives of one party, a collective participant, or any other component part. But the delegates, or more correctly, supporters of the creation of Gaydar's "Russia's Choice," decided that it can, following which Gleb Ponomarev, Gleb Yakunin, and their supporters walked out.
