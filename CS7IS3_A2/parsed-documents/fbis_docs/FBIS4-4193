During the meeting, described by a Chinese spokesman as "friendly and warm", Li spoke highly of Sino-Mongolian exchanges and cooperation in political, economic, cultural, military, scientific and technological fields. Calling Mongolia "an important neighbor," Li said China attaches great importance to friendly and good-neighborly ties with Mongolia. On developing relations with Mongolia, Li said, the Chinese Government will abide by the following five basic points: First, adherence to the five principles of peaceful coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century. Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice of their own path of development. Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common development and prosperity. Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East Asia, appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability, and support of Mongolia's policy to become a nuclear-free zone, not allowing foreign troops or the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction, in or through its territory. Fifth, a willingness to see Mongolia develop friendly relations with other countries. "The consolidation and development of Sino-Mongolian friendly relations is not only in keeping with the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but also will be conducive to regional peace, stability and development, as well," Li said. Referring to the Sino-Mongolian treaty on friendship and mutual help which was signed in 1960 and "laid a good foundation for bilateral ties", Li said that since both the domestic and international situations have undergone vast changes, "we have amended and perfected the treaty", in line with the wishes of Mongolia. Li said that signing the new treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperation was "an epoch-making event" in the history of bilateral ties, and will be formulated into legal form as a new political basis for future growth. "This treaty will make China and Mongolia even better friends and neighbors," he said. Agreeing with Li's assessment of bilateral ties, Jasray said that Li's significant visit coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Mongolia and China. He said that Mongolia's foreign policy was based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the beliefs or size of a country. The development of friendly relations with China and Russia, two large neighbors, is a priority of Mongolian foreign policy, he said. Mongolia will not only develop relations with the Western and developed nations, it also will strive to expand ties with Asian countries, in particular those of East Asia, Jasray said. Li welcomed Mongolia lending priority to its ties with China and Russia, a spokesman said. Jasray noted that China's respect for Mongolia's chosen method of development is very important for the further expansion of bilateral ties. The signing of the new treaty will serve to form a legal basis for developing long-term friendly cooperation, he said. Jasray predicted "smooth growth of Mongolia-China relations," which, he said, is in keeping with the fundamental interests of the two peoples. Li, turning to bilateral trade and economic cooperation, said that China, Mongolia's second largest trading partner, is ready to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation with Mongolia. He also called for expansion of such cooperation in diversified areas, particularly between business circles in the two countries, which will supplement inter-governmental ties. Jasray said that trade and economic cooperation with China are important to Mongolia, adding that great potential exist in this area. He also stressed the importance of border trade, saying he expects to see further exploration along these lines. Mongolia hopes to strengthen cooperation in terms of investment with China, as well, so as to allow cooperation between enterprises and localities to produce better economic results, he added. Calling transportation "another important factor" for developing cooperation, he said Mongolia would continue to work for further improvement in this field. Furthermore, Jasray expressed appreciation for China's support of Mongolia becoming a nuclear-free zone. He reiterated that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Jasray said that the Mongolian Government will have no official ties of any kind with Taiwan, a position for which Li expressed appreciation.
