This followed a request by the Freedom Alliance that the deadline should be postponed to give it the opportunity to examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC [African National Congress]. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after talks between the government, the ANC and the Freedom Alliance that the government had made a proposal regarding the future of the Zulu king and Natal/KwaZulu. A constitutional principle providing for traditional leadership is to be discussed with the Zulu king this weekend. However, new problems arose regarding a volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners. Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that the proposals submitted to the alliance were considered to have vast implications, and that urgent consultations with alliance leaders were imperative. Discussions were to have begun last night after the trilateral meeting. Mr. Cronje said the fact that the state president would be prevented from promulgating the election date today gave the alliance additional time to look for an acceptable solution. He said that changes to the constitution would not have been easy after the promulgation of the election date.
