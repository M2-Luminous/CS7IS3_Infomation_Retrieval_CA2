Chebotarev: "Running on the Razor's Edge"] [Text] They stood surrounded by shore patrol and police. The young AWOL seamen looked at them fearfully. This time their attempt was unsuccessful. But is there a guarantee that there won't be another? Mass flight of young seamen from units and from ships began around the Spring of 1990. It was then that talk went on about the insolvency of the ruling party's military policy, and about the inability of the leadership of those days to solve the country's concrete problems. But the CPSU ceased to exist, and the Soviet Union followed it into history. However, the problem of desertion grew even more acute. Now not only young seamen but also ones with a year or two of service were fleeing. The reasons were the most diverse--from a sick mother to jeering and humiliation. But the main causes were disorganization and impunity. I'm not about to analyze the state of affairs in this area, but I would like to describe the things I've witnessed, and my experiences on a few occasions when I took part in court examinations as an inquisitor. It is said that a few years' work in court was enough for Balzac to write for decades about the human passions he had witnessed. This came to mind as I looked at a familiar young lad standing under escort. I was to process several detainees through the military medical board. One of them, unwashed and suffering scabies, evoked pure human pity in me. It was not until the following day, when he called out my name, that I remembered who he was--he had changed that much. The story is tragically simple. Before joining the army he got in with some criminals. They stole everything they could get their hands on, along the entire southern Crimean shore. Then he was drafted. Upon graduating from his training subunit he received the rank of junior sergeant. He didn't have much longer to serve. Even so, he ran away. Back in with his criminal friends. More stealing. It all ended with a high-security prison colony. Moreover the trial was held at the time when he would have been returning home from service. He had a choice, and he made it. Last summer a seaman went AWOL off a neighboring ship. An officer rode out after him, found him, but too late to bring the runaway back to the unit. Perhaps out of the joy of having liberated himself from service, the former seaman got drunk and then went to the river for a swim. Whether he jumped in or dove in, I don't know, but he broke his back. His mother weeps, naturally, the grief is so great. She blames herself for not making him stay in, it would have been better if he had finished his tour. The most widespread means of flight is with the participation of parents. I'm certain that had it not been for relatives, many wouldn't even have thought of going AWOL. As far as I know, the passports belonging to civilian Smirnova and Mr. and Mrs. Poalelunzh, held as a pledge against their son, are still lying in the safe in the commander's office. After working 5 years with the personnel I became convinced that the runaways often develop a reluctance to serve because they were not prepared for service. The young person leaves the safety and warmth of his home for a life of hardship. Sweepdowns, physical loads, and then rough handling by others make their impact as well. Experiencing discomfort from the disturbance of the accustomed rhythm of life, the seaman seeks solutions, of which there are two. The first is to get a hold of one's self and serve out one's tour normally. The second is to go back, back home, where one's parents are always waiting. Upon returning home, as a rule the AWOL seamen go to the military commissariats and procuracies. There statements are always the same--they were belittled, they were humiliated. Then, after the runaways are reassigned to their respective military units, their complaints disappear. Such was the case in my experience with seamen Smirnov, Yesipov and Makhanov. I've always wondered about one thing: Why, after so many years of existence of the runaway problem, hasn't a system of effective measures to prevent such violations and avert their consequences not been developed? There are many questions, but no one is offering any answers. As always, officers and warrant officers end up having to carry additional loads. But isn't this out of their line?
