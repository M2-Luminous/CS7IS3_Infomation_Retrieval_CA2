The laundering has become frequent recently and abuses the non-tariff privileges for North Korean products in accordance with the law concerning the promotion of inter-Korean exchanges legislated in August, 1990. The concept is similar to money laundering on black markets to avoid tax payment or the tracing of money flow. One of the laundering processes presumed to exist by the customs authorities is for traders to receive certificates of country of origin and quarantine inspections in conspiracy with Pyongyang authorities bringing Chinese products into the North before shipping them to the South. Another type is for domestic importers to conspire with their counterparts in third nations, including Japan and Hong Kong, to import Chinese products disguising them as North Korean produce. The customs authorities have reached their conclusions about the laundering process based on several cases of detection of disguised imports. But they have not been able to obtain clear-cut evidence as the laundering is taking place in China and North Korea and they cannot understand will their trading and customs practices, a customs official said. [sentence as received] Inchon Customs Office detected four false claims since 1991 till last February but arrested only two importers involved in the laundering. The office has faced difficulty in proceeding to the trial because of the lack of evidence and appeals by defendants to higher courts, buying attorneys, the official said. The office recently launched investigations of alleged imports of Chinese royal jelly upon a tip from the Korea Beekeepers Association that 10 tons of North Korean royal jelly customs-cleared in Inchon was Chinese product. But the jelly contains the certificate oe North Korean origin confirmed by Pyongyang North Korean Taesong No. 8 Trade Co., the official said, adding that there was no defect in the documents. As a result, the office has failed to confirm it was from China. The office also found that 554 tons of walnuts brought in by an importer through the port of Inchon in January this year were in fact Chinese product. The Chinese walnuts were found to have been transported by rail from China to Nampo on the western coast of North Korea, where they were transshipped to the South with North Korean certificates of country of origin and quarantine documents, he said. He explained the rail luggage labels were still attached to the farm produce verifying that the products were transported by rail from China. "We were very lucky in being able to confirm this," he said. A walnut importer, who is also suspicious of rampant laundering said that walnuts imported from North Korea were double the volume produced in the north last year. Major reasons of the laundering are that Chinese products are not as good as North Korea's and traders are able to make much profit due to duty-free prices, the official said. Another speculation is that importers of Chinese products have a tacit understanding with the North Korean authorities on the laundering in return for paying a portion of the value to the North which is hungry for foreign currency. Meanwhile, Yi Hwan-kyun, commissioner of the Korea Customs Administration, ordered customs officials across the country to thoroughly crack down on disguised imports of Chinese farm and marine products under North Korean certificates of origin last week.
