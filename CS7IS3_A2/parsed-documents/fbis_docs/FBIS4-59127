A political statement released by the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF]: The APF's Central Command has convened a meeting to study the dangers of the agreement signed in Cairo between 'Arafat -- who has, along with his team, switched over to the camp of the enemies of the people and the revolution -- and Rabin, the prime minister of the Zionist entity, in the Cairo circus, with the Americans playing the role of sponsors and the Egyptians playing the role of middleman. The APF's Central Command decided to expose the risks the agreement carries for the rights of our people to liberation, repatriation, self-determination, and national independence. The APF's Central Command would like to make the following points: This agreement of capitulation is little more than a reorganization of occupation and redeployment of the occupying military along the borders with Egypt and Jordan, the crossings, road junctures, and the security arrangements around the Zionist settlements. Thus, the agreement amounts to a complete capitulation to U.S.-Zionist terms, turning Gaza and Jericho into discrete crossings and cantons. This agreement blatantly ignores Jerusalem, the capital of Palestine, as well as the Palestinian refugees and their right to return to their homeland, leaving them vulnerable to resettlement in the host countries and in the diaspora. This agreement ignores thousands of Palestinian expellees and prisoners and detainees who are being held in the prisons of the occupation authority. The agreement of liquidation approaches their case selectively, providing the release of several hundred detainees, whose prison terms had either nearly or completely expired. This agreement sets out to tear asunder the land and people and marks a dangerous gateway for the Zionist penetration of our Arab nation and people with a view to controlling their resources through a plan of normalized relations, which has already begun in certain Arab capitals. Driven by our concern for the supreme Palestinian interests, and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people and the Arab and Muslim nations and world public opinion, the alliance announces the following: First, this agreement of liquidation is null and void and is binding neither on the Palestinian people, nor on the Arab and Islamic masses. The signers of the agreement do not speak for the Palestinian people. Accordingly, we urge our Palestinian and Arab masses to take a determined stand against this U.S.-Zionist-'Arafatist conspiracy being peddled by certain Arab governments, led by the Camp David regime. Second, the APF reiterates its determination to maintain the struggle and thwart the implementation of this agreement. It calls on the Palestinian and Arab masses to boycott the self-rule institutions and defy all their decisions, including a boycott of the elections. The APF further calls for ostracizing and besieging the self-rule clique as a tool of repression manipulated by occupation, as envisaged in the ominous agreement. We urge our Arab and Islamic masses and the patriotic governments and world public opinion to stand by the Palestinian people's struggle and support them as they fight to topple the agreement. We call on them to boycott and refuse to have anything to do with the self-rule institutions and agencies as a confirmation of our people's cohesion with the Arab and Islamic nations. Third, the alliance reiterates a commitment to the continuation, escalation, and enhancement of the valiant intifadah. It also pledges to secure whatever is necessary to ensure the continued dynamism of the intifadah until the national goals of our people are attained. Fourth, what 'Arafat and his team have done in signing the agreement with the Zionist enemy in Cairo amounts to treason against the nation, the liquidation of the Palestinian cause, and the disposal of the PLO. The APF reiterates its adherence to the PL0 as a national achievement and demands that its institutions be rebuilt on democratic foundations. The APF extends greetings to our people who have renounced this agreement by declaring the signing day a day of national strike and national mourning. The alliance hails our people's valiant intifadah as it confronts occupation, and urges them to close ranks and upgrade their militant, mass action inside and outside the occupied territory with the objective of toppling the agreement of humiliation and disgrace and realizing the aspirations of the Palestinian people. It calls for 15 May, 1994 -- the anniversary of the theft of Palestine -- to be observed as a day of sweeping anger in the homeland and in the diaspora.
