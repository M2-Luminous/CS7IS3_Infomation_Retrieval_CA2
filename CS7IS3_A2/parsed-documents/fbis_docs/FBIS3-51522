Robaina is expected to depart Zimbabwe on Tuesday and go to Zambia on the penultimate leg of an African tour that took him to Ghana and Angola and is expected to conclude in Namibia. Robaina, who was appointed foreign relations minister in April 1993, indicated that Cuba will not compromise with respect to positions of principle, such as Cuba's independence and sovereignty, which, according to him, "are nonnegotiable. Our independence and sovereignty is not a matter for discussion, neither is our capability to speak for ourselves," Robaina stated. Cuba cannot "revert regarding those sectors that are sacred to us, sectors such as education and health, with which my people and no one in the world would forgive us if we decided to retrogress," he added. However, he explained, Cuba "is inclined to exchange, adapt, and trade with anyone who is willing. In order to adapt to this economic world we must trade with capitalists whether we like it or not," he acknowledged. "I am not one of those who believes that all capitalists are bad," but "to trade under the pressure my country is undergoing is extremely difficult," he pointed out. In reference to the U.S. blockade and the fall of the Soviet Union, Robaina explained that "conditions" in Cuba "are abnormal. My country cannot trade as it wishes and with whom it wishes. We would first have to disclose who are investing and how they are doing it. But we cannot do that. If we did," there would be, "pressure ... blackmail and persecution against anyone who decides to do business with us." Nevertheless, Robaina expressed optimism with respect to future relations between Cuba and the United States. "I do not believe that the new generation of Americans is injected with that virus of aggression against a country that does not represent a threat to the United States," he pointed out. "I cannot believe," he stated, "that now that we are about to begin a new century, countries such as Cuba and the United States, which are merely 90 miles apart, can continue to live as we are currently living." I am "convinced that there must be a solution, but the solution must not imply that my country ceases to exist as a country. If it means that we have to revert to being the United States' back door, then we prefer that the solution never be found." Robaina indicated that during his visit to New York last September he noticed that "the American people are becoming more aware of the senselessness of this relationship. Our message is being heard and more people are now aware that Cuba is not the hell it is depicted as being." Robaina explained that "at the government level there is no contact whatsoever, except with the Coast Guard -- border guard contacts with some joint action against drug trafficking. In addition, we are discussing a telecommunications project, but there are many differences and many stumbling blocks." In recalling his experiences in Angola from 1988 to 1989 when he was a member of an "internationalist" contingent, the Cuban foreign minister stated that "there has been no greater experience in my personal life." It "was the most important stage of my life," he reiterated. "In Angola we were able to modestly contribute to Namibia being what it is today, to its independence." He added that "the pages my country wrote in Angola were written most of all for Angola, not for Cuba." Robaina, who at 37 is the youngest member of the Cuban Government, expressed his "amazement" at the interest caused by his appointment. "I am simply a visible face, maybe one of the most visible," he insisted. The Cuban minister added, "I don't see why the appointment of a minister my age should be a surprise when there are 5 million Cubans who are younger than 30." Our "fundamental priority lies in the surroundings we inhabit," he pointed out before proceeding to explain that Cuba's priority is in the "Caribbean and Latin American" region, but that Cuba must maintain "special relations" with Africa. "My country is what it is because of Africa. Cuba is a mix of Spanish and African," he explained and added that Cuba, "has much to contribute in some fields, such as education, health, medicine, and human resources." In addition, the minister declared that he is "passionately mad about human rights, because of the human aspect of my job," but believes that Cuba is being unjustly accused when "we are one of the countries where more human beings know that they have rights. Ten million Cubans know they have rights because they know they are humans," he indicated. "The reality for millions of human beings who inhabit this earth is much more tragic because they are not recognized as human beings and they neither know how to read or write. Who speaks about child prostitution and who is organizing it? Who speaks about the sale of children's organs? Who speaks about xenophobia," the minister asked before concluding.
