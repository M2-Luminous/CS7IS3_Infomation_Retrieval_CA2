He told journalists in Abu-Dhabi, as reported by Damascus radio, that north Yemen had accepted proposals put forward by our country on sending international observers to supervise the cease-fire. The UN secretary general's envoy went on to say that he had been informed of Sanaa's decision this evening. He said this represented a major change in the position of north Yemen in that it had accepted the idea of Yemeni and foreign observers, whereas previously Sanaa had rejected any foreign role. In the same context, Associated Press has reported that this force be formed under the supervision of a committee comprising 11 military members representing the Arab League, the United Nations and Oman, and two military attaches [as heard] from the United States and Russia. The supervisory force should comprise between 100 and 150 officers drawn from the states represented in the supervisory committee. The memorandum defined the mission of the observers who would operate under the UN as implementing the cease-fire and guaranteeing the withdrawal of the forces, while the UN envoy was to take the necessary steps to render successful the mission of the force supervising the cease-fire.
