In his opinion, some time in the near future opponents to the market in the government will start introducing all possible restrictions in the economy. Therefore, according to Borovoy, empty shelves, lines, and distribution coupons might very soon appear. Also, he does not rule out that a rigid dollar exchange rate might be introduced. According to Borovoy, this will happen when the dollar rate exceeds 2,500 rubles. Such economic decisions might be followed by anti-democratic moves.
