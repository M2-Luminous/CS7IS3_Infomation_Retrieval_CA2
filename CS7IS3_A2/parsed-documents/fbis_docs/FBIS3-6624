FBIS3-6624 "dreas054__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-054-A Document Type:Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Polls Gauge Hosokawa Cabinet Support Rate Disapproval Rate Increases OW1903010194 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 Mar 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1903010194 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Japan Opinion Survey Institute, of which TOKYO SHIMBUN is a member, has conducted a nationwide opinion poll to survey the popularity of the seven-month-old Hosokawa cabinet and various political parties. The survey was carried out by interviewing respondents on 12 and 13 March. The poll found that the support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet stood at 61.5 percent, only 1.3 points lower than in the last survey in December. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been often criticized for his indecisiveness -- as seen, for example, in announcing and then scrapping a "national welfare tax" plan, and in giving up a planned cabinet reshuffle. But, his cabinet still maintains a support rate of around 60 percent. This is the fifth- highest rate found for a cabinet (since the Sato cabinet) in opinion polls which include three carried out on the Hosokawa cabinet since last summer. However, the proportion of respondents who did not support the Hosokawa cabinet increased by 7.5 points to 31.9 percent, the worst such rate for the Hosokawa cabinet. The respondents who cited "Hosokawa's lack of leadership" as their reason for disapproving of the cabinet almost tripled to 31 percent compared to the last poll. The number can be a sign that the popularity of the highly popular Hosokawa cabinet may be falling. As for political parties, the rate of support for the Liberal Democratic Party dropped slightly compared to the last poll, apparently because of the arrest of former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura concerning a corruption scandal involving a general contractor. Meanwhile, the support rate for Sakigake [Harbinger], which fought the removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from the cabinet, rose substantially to 7.2 percent. When asked their reasons for supporting the present cabinet, 31.9 percent (32.6 percent in the previous poll) of those who supported the cabinet replied "there is no other appropriate person to head the government," and 23.9 percent (20.9 percent in the last poll) said "we trust the prime minister."
