Twenty independent candidates and 1,022 candidates from 13 parties and blocs contend for 104 seats in a new parliament. Numerous public opinion polls taken on the eve of the elections forecast a convincing victory of the Agrarian Democratic Party headed by Parliament Speaker Petr Lucinschi. Sociologists' view is that success is also expected to be achieved by the Socialist, Social Democratic, and Republican Parties, which, like the Agrarians, strive for Moldova's independence, a fair solution to the Gagauz and Dniester region problems, and for stronger ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. They will be opposed by movements which believe that Moldova must unite with Romania. Those movements have a following despite the unpopularity of such slogans in Moldova.
