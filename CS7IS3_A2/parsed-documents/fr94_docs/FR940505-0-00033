FR940505-0-00033 FR940505-0-00008 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04; Amendment 39&hyph;8877; AD 94&hyph;08&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company CF6 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines, that requires installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud. This amendment is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which resulted in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective July 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, Room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Ganley, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299, telephone (617) 238&hyph;7138; fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines was published in the Federal Register on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1503). That action proposed to require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and a new stage one fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses. The compliance end date of December 31, 1996, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware availability. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573, Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. Two commenters support the rule as proposed. One commenter states that the compliance end-date of August 31, 1995, in compliance paragraph (a) of the proposed rule should be extended to December 31, 1996, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concurs. The FAA has determined that flight safety will not be compromised by extending the compliance end-date to December 31, 1996. The final rule has been changed accordingly. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change described previously. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 67 GE CF6&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA has been advised by the manufacturer that there are no engines on U.S. registered aircraft that would be affected by this AD. However, should an affected engine be imported on an aircraft and placed on the U.S. registry in the future, it would take approximately 48 work hours to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $9,360 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD is estimated to be $12,000 per engine. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
