The news conference was devoted to the results of the nine-day visit of Samadov to the Russian Federation, Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States. Tajikistan can not resolve the difficult issues of restoration of the national economy and ensuring the steady activity of its branches alone. Samadov said that the main aim of his visit to these countries was to familiarize the officials of these countries with the real situation of the Republic. The international financial organizations, businessmen, and entrepreneurs do understand our difficulties and demands very well and they are ready to invest in order to implement the specific difficulties. However, they give priority to stabilization of the political situation in Tajikistan. The important thing is that foreign entrepreneurs support the program of economic reforms submitted by our Republic. Abdujalil Samadov added that important events would take place in the country in the current year. These are, first of all, the nationwide referendum on the form of the state administration, the free Parliamentary elections, and the leadership of the country, nationwide discussion and adoption of the new Constitution. Similarly, the leadership of the Republic pays much attention to the talks with the representatives of the opposition. The aim of these talks is to stabilize the political and economic situation and to ensure the peaceful life of all inhabitants of the country and to concentrate all the sound forces. The head of the government expressed his satisfaction that the Russian Federation and neighboring Uzbekistan are rendering great assistance to the Republic as before. Today, we must decisively state that the fruitful work of every citizen of the Republic is important to resolve our problems. The chairman of the Council of Ministers was asked numerous questions related to the various spheres of the life of the country, entry of the republic to the ruble zone, and the ways of settling reciprocal payments. The head of the government informed that the work is under way in this field. All the issues will be positively resolved in the coming months, and there should be no doubts about that, he stressed. It is a difficult task in Tajikistan to involve all the people able to work in useful social labor. It will be necessary to construct new plants for that. According to Abdujalil Samadov the most important task of the day is to provide the agriculture of the Republic with fuel and seeds, because the provision of the population with food depends on the solution of this problem. It was decided to use all the loans that will be given to Tajikistan by the Russian Federation [words indistinct] Samadov said. Other economic and political issues were touched upon in the course of the new conference.
