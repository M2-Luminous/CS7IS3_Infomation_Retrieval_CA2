Bari GAZETA SHQIPTARE in Albanian on 20 April carries a 300-word "Fa. Ba." report from Sarande entitled "`Omonia' Activists From the South Detained." Tirana RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE and ZERI I POPULLIT in Albanian on 20 April make no mention of the detention of Greek minority leaders. T. Cela writes in KOHA JONE, "According to information reaching our editorial office late in the evening of 18 April as well as yesterday morning, the main leaders of Omonia and the Human Rights Defense Party (PDNJ), which is represented in parliament, have been detained by the police in some southern districts and in Tirana." Cela later continues, "It seems that interstate tensions have this time not spared these two organizations, whose leaders have taken up the defense of the Greek minority in Albania. Only a few days ago, in one of the zigzags that have characterized the Albanian official attitude, President Berisha stated that the deterioration of relations between the two neighbors would not influence the Albanian Government's attitude to the Greek minority." Interviewed by Cela, PDNJ Chairman Vasil Melo is reported as declaring, "I cannot say anything or give any explanation of what has happened. I have been told on the phone from Gjirokaster about some detentions. I know that Mr. Andrea Marto, deputy chairman of Omonia in Tirana, was detained on Monday [18 April] evening, and that documentation was taken from the Omonia offices." Reporting from Korce under the headline "Omonia Chairman Detained by the Police," Z. Dule writes: "The homes of the leaders of Omonia in the districts of Devoll, Pogradec, and Kolonje have been searched. Mrs Ermioni Andrea, Omonia chairwoman in Korce; Jani Mulas, Omonia deputy chairman; Kostandina Tushi, Omonia secretary; Niko Mongoleci, chairman of the Albanian-Greek Friendship Association; Gjerkji Leka, chairman of the PDNJ; and Stefan Papa, member of the PDNJ Presidium, all became the targets of a large scale operation by the ShIK [National Intelligence Service] and the police in the early hours of the night of 18-19 April. It was 2200 on Monday evening when a group of ShIK agents and policemen knocked at Mrs Ermioni Andrea's door. `After we opened the door, seven people -- five civilians and two policemen -- came in,' Mr. Sotiraq Andrea, husband of the chairwoman of Omonia in Korce, explained to KOHA JONE, 'After identifying themselves, they started searching the apartment, ransacking everything. They took with them books, magazines, and dictionaries in Greek. When they left, the ShIK agents also took Mrs Ermione Andrea, on the pretext that they wanted to search the Omonia office.' On Tuesday Mr. Andrea learned of his wife's fate when he asked the police. `They told me that they had set off for Tirana at 1400, having found compromising material in the office,' Mr. Andrea said, not excluding the possibility that the ShIK itself might have planted material with anticonstitutional contents in the office. The apartment of Mr. Niko Mungoleci, chairman of the Albanian-Greek friendship Association, was searched, and he was also detained. Searches were also carried out of the family of Mr. Jani Mula, deputy chairman of Omonia; in the family of Omonia secretary Kostandina Tusha, wife of the well-known painter Vangjush Tusha; in the homes of PDNJ Chairman Gjergji Leka and PDNJ Presidium member Stefan Papa, etc. `We are worried about our father,' Mr. Stefan Papa's son told KOHA JONE. When the search was carried out on the night of 18 April, he was in Salonika. He reported to the police on the morning of 19 April. Besides this, the Omonia chairmen in Devoli, Kolonje, and Pogradec have been subjected to searches and taken in for questioning. We did not succeed in obtaining any official confirmation because the operation is still continuing. Nor is the exact number of those detained known, because it is still unknown whether they will be arrested following their detention and accused of anticonstitutional activities." An unnamed KOHA JONE correspondent in Gjirokaster writes, "The police made a series of detentions in some homes of Omonia leaders in Gjirokaster late on 18 April. We have learned that Theodori Bezhani, Omonia chairman for Gjirokaster District; Kosta Oirjako, resident of the village of Dervican; Irakli Sirmo, and others have been detained. We have also learned that there have been detentions of Greek-minority Albanian citizens in Tepelene and Sarande. On Tuesday, police officials arrived from Tirana and took the detainees to the capital. Trying to find out more about this operation and the reason behind these detentions, a police officer involved in this lightning operation confirmed to us, `A U.S.-type rifle and a considerable number of hunting cartridges were found in Mr. Behani's house, and it is not known whether he possessed a permit.' We have also learned that his home contained a considerable amount of literature covered by the Law on Anticonstitutional Activity. This literature included calendars showing maps of the so-called Vorio-Epiros of 1914, and maps showing this area's borders as mentioned in the aforementioned literature. A few bullets and anticonstitutional literature were also found in Kosta Qirjako's house. Nevertheless, the police have still not confirmed the precise reason for these citizens' detention. Similarly, nothing is known about the detentions of the Greek-minority citizens in Tepelene and Sarabde except that they are connected with the work of the Greek-minority political organization in Albania. News of these detentions was followed with very great interest in Greece yesterday. All the television stations and daily papers gave reports, without explaining the charges behind these detentions. Nor have the Omonia leaders issued any statement about the reasons for the detentions, despite our correspondent's insistence."
