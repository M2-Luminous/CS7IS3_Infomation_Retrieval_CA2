FBIS3-52258 "drnes001_k_94009" FBIS-NES-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Jan 1994 IRAQ PUK Commentary on Victory Over Islamic Movement NC2712213293 (Clandestine) Voice of the People of Kurdistan in Arabic 1500 GMT 27 Dec 93 NC2712213293 (Clandestine) Voice of the People of Kurdistan in Arabic 1500 GMT 27 Dec 93 Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Our talk yesterday should have dealt with the phenomenon of extremism and revanchism [al-salafiyah] in Islam, in view of the danger, difficulty, and [word indistinct] that such radicalism poses to the noble Islamic religion. The rapid succession of events prevented this, however. At the same time, my personal closeness to these rapid events during two full nights and two full days in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan's [PUK] operations rooms provided a motive for writing this commentary. PUK leaders ran the operations with a presence of mind that demonstrated wisdom, experience, and political, military, and psychological competence. The telephone did not stop ringing, and there was an endless flood of volunteer fighters. Everyone in the operations room, particularly the PUK leaders, were emphatically determined that no harm should befall venerable al-Sulaymaniyah and its dear citizens, especially the women and children. The sight of veteran peshmergas, those who fought in the difficult battles of the past, streaming to the place with their weapons in hand was unforgettable. I even saw among them a group of elderly men and others in suits and ties who came late at night to take up arms. Women, children, and innocent men were killed or wounded when the terrorists turned their mortar fire, katyushas, and Grads against peaceable homes. Doctors and nurses hurried to help the wounded at all hours of the night and day, spurred on by their professional sense of duty and patriotic and humanitarian sentiments. Their honorable and humanitarian action is difficult to forget. This is only a small part of what I saw. On the subjects of war and politics, we declare: What happened was not a war between the PUK and the Muslims. Before the matter was settled decisively, as we have seen, the PUK made strenuous efforts on all levels to resolve the issue peacefully. Political parties in the Kurdish liberation movement made valuable efforts to salvage the situation and safeguard the citizens' lives. However, the extremist, terrorist, radical movement sought a war of extermination. We can see now how the consequence was the end of the terrorists' extremism. We have seen how citizens, normally uninvolved in politics, participated in deciding the issue for the good of Kurdistan and its people, not merely for the good of the PUK. Yes, it has been a national victory. We have driven off the specter of fear and danger that threatened our country and our people. Nevertheless, the PUK must continue to be wary of falling victim to vanity. In the future, the PUK must be even more humble than it is now. It must conduct its transactions with other parties in a humble manner, with the wisdom of the victor and the knowledge of one conversant with all things. Yes, the momentous event has demonstrated the Kurdish people's support for the PUK and how the veteran peshmergas and veteran PUK members backed their triumphant party, just as they have always supported it during good and bad times. At this point, we want to comment on an astounding feature: Thousands of Grad missiles were found in the extremists' warehouses. Even the united army of Kurdistan does not possess such missiles. The kinds of weapons that are only used in sophisticated battles were also found. Hallowed houses of worship were used as trenches. It was a wise and splendid thing that dear al-Sulaymaniyah and other cities of Kurdistan were protected from devastation. To enable our nation to live in security and peace and to build up Kurdistan, let us all rise to the level of events and future contingencies. Let us reinforce our fraternity and mutual trust. Let all the parties of Kurdistan focus their efforts on bringing happiness to the people and defend them against terrorism.
