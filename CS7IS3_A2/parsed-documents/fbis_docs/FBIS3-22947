This report was confirmed today by a high-ranking security source, who said the murderer and three other Palestinians, suspected of being his accomplices in the assassination, are members of Fatah-the Revolutionary Council led by Sabri al-Banna, alias Abu-Nidal. The source said that the four individuals admitted that they are members of Fatah--the Revolutionary Council. REUTER cited Brigadier General Staff Salim Salim, commander of the judicial police, as saying that the latest investigation into the case revealed that one of the three suspects is a woman, who is more of a witness than an accomplice to the crime. He noted that at first she declined to give particular information but did so later. The judiciary will determine the fate of each suspect. Security sources said the Palestinian detainees have been placed under strict security guard for fear that they might be attacked in jail. President Ilyas al-Hirawi informed King Husayn of Jordan last night that the Lebanese authorities have apprehended the Jordanian diplomat's killer. He said the law will take its course.
