SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of the party's legislators that "the party's responsibility is grave." But Murayama did not specify if he will take responsibility for the failure by resigning as chairman of the largest force within the seven-party coalition government. In a plenary session Friday afternoon, the House of Councillors voted down the package of four political reform bills with a vote of 130-118. Although the seven coalition parties hold a majority in the 252-seat upper house, 17 SDP members voted with the opposition to defeat the bills. After the voting, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Affairs Committee, told reporters the failure of the bills "will be the responsibility of the (SDP's) leadership." The SDP is expected to expel the 17 members who voted against the bills from the party, party sources said. Murayama said Thursday he might resign if an expected rebellion by several SDP legislators led to the breakdown of the reform package in Friday's vote. "If the political reform package fails to clear the upper chamber as a result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will take responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would not be able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he said.
