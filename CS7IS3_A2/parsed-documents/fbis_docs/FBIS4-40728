He was speaking in Tashkent on Friday [17 June] at a meeting with the heads of the diplomatic corps accredited in the Republic. Saydkasymov said the CIS has not exhausted its opportunities yet and a Eurasian Union would mean a return to the past. "Uzbekistan links its future with the sovereignty obtained by the Republic," he said. Kazakhstan's Ambassador to Uzbekistan Nazhameden Iskaliyev told INTERFAX that "every state has the right to express its opinion on issues in which it has an interest." Iskaliyev believes that the idea of an Eurasian Union would be discussed at the September summit of the heads of CIS states. "Of course, certain corrections will be introduced into the document, nevertheless it should be treated with great attention," Iskalilyev said.
