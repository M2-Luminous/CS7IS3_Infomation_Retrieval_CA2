"China Financial Outlook", serving as PBC's annual forecast for 1994, features articles, charts and tables of figures. The forecast anticipates that, by the end of July, the Central Bank will be able to withdraw the new banknotes put into circulation during the first half of this year. It also predicts that personal savings in Chinese banks in 1994 will total more than 400 billion yuan. To ensure smooth economic development, "China Financial Outlook" recommends that the bank continue to adopt a tight monetary policy. "We are generally satisfied with the book as we've tried our best to present a true picture of the country's financial landscape in 1994," said Xie Ping, a leading PBC researcher and writer of "a preview of China's financial situation in 1994", one of the two keynote articles in the book. According to him, analysis and forecasts are also made in areas of investment, prices, foreign trade, financial markets, and international current accounting. The book's intensive focus on the Central Bank's monetary policy for this year is intended to make it better understood and accepted, especially by departments and local leaders. "It is time that the Central Bank's voice should be heard, and its views heeded and shared," said Xie, adding that sensible enterprises will readjust their strategies in line with Central Bank signals. This will in turn contribute to the successful implementation of the monetary policy, noted Xie. The book will come out in late July and will most likely become the Central Bank's model for future annual forecasts.
