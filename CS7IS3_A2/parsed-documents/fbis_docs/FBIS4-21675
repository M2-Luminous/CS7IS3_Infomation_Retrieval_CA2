Until now, however, the SNA accidents have not had fatal consequences. Yesterday morning, at 1045 [0845 GMT], 10 submariners were in the SNA Emeraude's turbo alternator compartment. According to Rear Admiral Philippe Roy of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, the reasons are still not clear: "A leak occurred. The immediate reaction was the isolation of the cooling circuits. Steam poured into the compartment and the 10 seamen were killed by asphyxiation or burns." The explosion of one of the two condensers projected steam at 250 degrees and 45 bars of pressure, and would have resulted in instant death. According to initial data released, the explosion caused no damage to the vessel's structure and the disaster was restricted to the compartment protected by two airlocks. The Defense Ministry stated: "This accident in no way calls into question the nuclear safety of the vessel." The 48-megawatt nuclear reactor located next to the compartment is itself contained in a sealed-off area. When the accident occurred, it shut down automatically and was cooled by its own primary circuit. Unlike missile-launching submarines [SNLE's], SNA's are equipped with only conventional weaponry. According to Rear Admiral Roy, the 10 submariners killed "were from all categories of personnel." The victims included two officers. While normally the turbo alternator compartment is only subject to routine inspection, yesterday the Emeraude's crew was carrying out a "section inspection" which is done at six-monthly intervals on all naval vessels in the presence of the captain or his second-in-command. According to a source cited by AFP, the Emeraude's captain was among the victims, although no conscripts were killed. The Emeraude has a crew of 66, including eight officers and two conscripts. Like all submarines, it has two crews, termed "red" and "blue," alternating for periods of six weeks at a time. Together with the SNLE's, part of the nuclear deterrent force, the mission of the SNA's is to sweep the seas and oceans to flush out intruders and, using highly-sophisticated equipment, to monitor the activities of other vessels. The incident took place during an exercise with surface vessels (Casex, in NATO jargon), 50 nautical miles off Toulon in the south of Corsica. Diving when the explosion occurred, the Emeraude managed to make it back up to the surface. The bodies of the victims were winched off by helicopter to one of the accompanying frigates and then flown back in a helicopter to Toulon. The Emeraude returned to Toulon yesterday evening at low speed (four to five knots, instead of the normal 25 knots), propelled by a backup electric engine. A legal inquiry and a Naval Command inquest have been opened. At the same time, the Navy has decided to inspect the other five SNA's currently in service. Three of these are out on missions, two in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic. They have been recalled to Toulon. The Navy is already denying any comparison with the accidents on the SNA's Rubis in August 1993 and Amethyst last March. In both cases, these incidents were collisions that could probably be put down to navigational errors and which have already resulted in reprimands. In the case of the Emeraude, it will be necessary to essentially determine the cause of the problem, unprecedented on this type of vessel which has been in service with the Navy for six years. Defense Minister Francois Leotard visited Toulon yesterday, accompanied by the head of the Naval Chiefs-of-Staff, Alain Coaranea. He restated that "there is no nuclear risk." Stressing that the French people had to be informed of the "responsibilities and the technical causes" of the accident, he indicated that the conclusions of the inquiries will be made public. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Technical Specifications of SNA Emeraude | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length |72.1 meters | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Diameter |7.6 meters | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speed |Over 25 knots (46 km/h) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Surface displacement (weight) |2,385 tonnes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Depth |Over 300 meters | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Crew |66 men, including eight officers | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weapons tubes |Four | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armament capacity |14 T-533 torpedoes or SM-39 missiles (| | |conventional weapons) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Autonomous operation |60 days | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
