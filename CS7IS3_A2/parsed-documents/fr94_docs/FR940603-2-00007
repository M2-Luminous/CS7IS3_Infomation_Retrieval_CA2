FR940603-2-00007 FR940603-2-00006 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Survey of Congressional Committees. Form Number(s): 628, 628L. Agency Approval Number: None. Type of Request: New collection. Burden: 21 hours. Number of Respondents: 242. Avg Hours Per Response: 5 minutes. Needs and Uses: In October 1993, the Census Bureau, with approval from OMB, surveyed all members of Congress to determine how we can better meet their needs for Census Bureau data. We are requesting OMB clearance to conduct a similar survey of Congressional committees/subcommittees. The survey will identify which committees/subcommittees use our data, which do not want any census data, and which would like a briefing on how to use Census Bureau data. This information is needed to determine how the Census Bureau can revise and improve the current program it uses to disseminate data to committees/subcommittees of Congress. This information will enable us to provide committees/subcommittees of Congress only the data for which they have a specific need, and will reduce the amount of data currently being sent that is not being used. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: One time only. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Tach√©, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: May 31, 1994. Gerald Tache, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
