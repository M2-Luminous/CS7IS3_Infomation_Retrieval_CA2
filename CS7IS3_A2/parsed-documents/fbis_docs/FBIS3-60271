It will involve taking air, water, and soil samples on a 500-meter radius around the national smelting enterprise. This work has been designed for the first phase of the environmental control program, with backing from the German Government, whose investment will amount to 10 million German marks (approximately $7.5 million), to be completed by fiscal year 1994. The environmental control plan will make it possible to learn the real pollution levels, and will serve as a basic factor for future environmental control regulations on the national level, according to Rene Candia Trigo, general manager of the smelting complex. He explained that the results of the study being made will soon afford the opportunity to achieve regulations for environmental control based on a detailed analysis, and taking all the studies conducted thus far into account. He claimed that the environmental control program is the metallurgical enterprise's top priority, noting that they are waiting to hear the first results of the evaluation, so as to continue with that program. He maintained that the latter would make it possible to guarantee a production "without pollution, while protecting the population's health." He added that this work was begun based on the commitment assumed by the mining secretary, Jaime Villalobos, to deal with the region's problem and to provide an opportunity for making environmental audits in the area of environmental pollution, using Oruro as a pilot city.
