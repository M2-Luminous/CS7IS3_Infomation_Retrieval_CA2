[Belloch] The events that have occurred have meant accepting particularly rigorous political responsibilities, largely owing to the social atmosphere that has been created. This does not mean that there could not be more people accepting responsibility if there are further developments or information. But with what we have right now, this matter has been resolved, except for those who can only repeat: "Resign, Mr. Gonzalez." That assertion does not acquire further intellectual nuances by being said many more times. That kind of line is unreasonable from the democratic viewpoint, because Felipe Gonzalez won the election with a very clear message that he was going to act against corruption. If we who work with him do not do our jobs well, let us be called to account at the polls. [Brunet] Do you believe that the government and Felipe Gonzalez have suffered a grave deterioration over the past few days? [Belloch] My sincere opinion is that it depends whether or not we do things well. If we are able to restore an atmosphere of calm and win confidence through sensible and balanced actions, he will more than surmount the crisis and carry out what he promised and what we members of his government must now implement. [Brunet] There is an impression that this crisis could be tackled because the nationalists have caused the government to dig its heels in and shake off its doubts. [Belloch] I do not believe so. All that I believe is that this has been a month in which it had to be shown which is the parliamentary majority and which is the minority. Naturally, majorities are formed in accordance with their own laws; the partners in that majority have the right and duty to intervene and act. That is what has happened, but I would not submit a confidence motion right now. It would be like succumbing to a minor pitfall. If anybody should submit anything, the People's Party should submit a censure motion. A confidence motion makes sense only when you lose the parliamentary majority -- that is, the vote on an important bill. [Brunet] Why has cooperation between yourself and Baltasar Garzon not been possible, when you are both judges and independents? [Belloch] The first thing that I must say is that I greatly regret that he has tendered his resignation. I regret it because he was the appropriate person to take charge of the task that he had -- namely, the struggle against drug trafficking, plus the set of policies entailed by the National Plan Against Drugs, and also the possibility of coordinating anticorruption units. He had the right profile for that task, and that is why I offered him that post. But I am going to create a secretaryship of state for the interior, and I certainly have not offered him that. I believe that the profile of a secretary of state for the interior is different. He has very wide-ranging duties and a very different set of general guidelines, and another profile is needed for that. I believe that he was not satisfied with the offer to stay in the current secretaryship, and that is why he tendered his resignation to me. [Brunet] Garzon was the Interior Ministry's number two. Was there no basis for a relationship of trust between yourselves and for his remaining so? [Belloch] The point is that we are now going to set up a different structure, because there is now a new ministry, the Ministry of Justice and the Interior. This should be organized in accordance with a principle of autonomy: on one hand, the secretaryship of state for justice and the secretaryship of state for the interior, and coordination from above through the minister, and also, in parallel, two autonomous central matters -- the struggle against drug trafficking and corruption, and prison institutions -- that should have autonomous secretaryships of state. That structure means that the secretaries of state for the interior and justice are actually deputy ministers or responsible overall for the area as a whole. I believe that they have more appropriate profiles for that task than Garzon. That is why, while greatly regretting it, I had to act accordingly. The prime minister had a high opinion of Baltasar and knew that he must be doing a good job in his field, but it matters more to me that I choose people with the appropriate profile. [Brunet] In any event, you showed Garzon the door by saying in public that if he tendered his resignation, you would accept it. [Belloch] I would be sorry for that impression to remain. It is true that he asked me for two weeks to reflect, and I did not give him them. In my opinion, it is essential to finish appointing the secretaries of state this weekend. As the situation stands, the impression of a makeshift situation must not be given. [Brunet] Has the government "applied the scalpel" against corruption, as Garzon demanded? [Belloch] Of course. This is not a matter of the past two months. When he offered me the post of justice minister, the prime minister told me that my aim was to combat corruption thoroughly, with all the means available at the Justice Ministry. Moreover, I am convinced that he chose me for that reason. There is no doubt, because it was a result of his commitment to the electorate with two messages -- to surmount the economic crisis and to end corruption and the atmosphere of impunity. I was one of the elements for this second major aim, and he appointed me minister for that reason. [Brunet] The most sensational corruption cases were raised by the press. [Belloch] Following my appointment, I gave the state attorney general instructions, making it clear that the struggle against corruption was an absolute priority in terms of criminal policy. After that, a series of investigations which are producing results began. In short, the instruments are working. Paradoxically, the uncovering of corruption cases can become a matter which disturbs the impression of calm and civil peace. However, it is the natural consequence of going all-out to combat any form of corruption. [Brunet] Have you been appointed to clean up the Interior Ministry? [Belloch] I do not believe that is the central aim. I have been appointed to investigate all the cases which may exist, but it is not fair for us to speak in general terms of the Interior Ministry or the Civil Guard. The Civil Guard cannot bear the blame of the director general who commanded it. That is not in keeping with the feeling of the public, who have a level of confidence in the security forces which many other institutions would like for themselves. [Brunet] In any event, the prevailing view is that the government did not take the struggle against corruption so seriously before the cases of Roldan and Rubio. [Belloch] That is the public impression, but it is not in keeping with the facts. The qualitative change in the assessment of the corruption phenomenon dates from the first day of the formation of the current government. There is, however, a change of approach in assessing the phenomenon's importance in comparison with the previous situation. If this were not so, we would not have been able to ensure that many investigations would be completed so quickly. [Brunet] Do you believe that there could be concealed interests behind the outbreak of the Rubio affair? [Belloch] I believe that precisely because we have begun a process of thorough investigation of corruption, there are a number of consequences. There are people who may have taken part in such activities and are rightly afraid that they will be uncovered. So one thing can lead to another. This could cause some people to play at a war of cases. We knew that this possibility existed when we accepted this priority, but it was necessary. The public's confidence cannot be restored unless we end this atmosphere. The public should see that this process has a cost but that it is unavoidable. So they should be calm. Cases could, of course, continue to emerge. The important thing is that the public support this struggle. [Brunet] In any event, the question is whether the cases are a consequence of the current atmosphere concerning corruption or else are one of the causes of it. Are more cases emerging because there are those who have an interest in this? [Belloch] There are undoubtedly moves of that kind, but I would like to make a general observation: You cannot switch from an atmosphere of a certain passivity and inhibition with respect to tax crime to suddenly setting up a Holy Inquisition or launching general inquisitorial processes. Our duty is that there should be neither tolerance not inquisitors in this respect. Inquisitors, especially those acting in the name of the good, have always caused very clear consequences. The principle of legality, calm, confidence, and balance must be restored. [Brunet] Do you believe that an anticorruption Holy Inquisition has been set up? [Belloch] It is clear that we cannot switch overnight from a situation in which the public considered that this matter of tax crime was a minor matter to launching a historical crusade of the masked warrior. I am not here for that purpose. I have always had a poor opinion of inquisitors, and if, moreover, the cause for which they fight is just, they are usually more dangerous. Against that, there should be reason, the rule-of-law state, legality, and each institution's doing its job, and so confidence will spread. [Brunet] Over the past few days, the government has joined the crusade with the arrest of Rubio. [Belloch] That impression may exist, but those who acted were two professional prosecuting attorneys, without anybody's instructions. These prosecuting attorneys immediately placed the matter in the hands of a police court judge. Nobody can express suspicions of a judge's acting with the intention of favoring somebody's image. This judge examined the facts and took the steps that he deemed opportune. Along with this, an atmosphere of confusion is being created according to which the necessary steps were not taken with Luis Roldan, who was accused simply of a tax offense, and in this other matter, in which the accusations are more serious -- because they include forgery -- the same people criticize the latter situation. Precautionary steps were not taken with Roldan, and the result is that this gentleman has been able to escape. In the second case, the steps that in fact have prevented this were taken. No inquisitorial spirit should be seen in this. It is a matter of the gravity of the alleged conduct and of the evidence gathered by some professionals. [Brunet] Was it necessary to make these arrests by night? Was it not intended that they spend that night in the cells? [Belloch] I do not believe so. The main work of this ministry is legality and reason. Therefore, insofar as it is my responsibility, I will try to ensure that there is always proportion in what falls within the police sphere, and the least possible harm is done to the accused person's rights. I reject any formula of the kind which they have suffered in Italy -- unnecessary cameras, handcuffing people needlessly, and turning these actions into a spectacle. It is necessary to act very vigorously, but always with the least possible harm to those accused of the offense. [Brunet] The opposition says that this arrest was made on the day before Garzon's press conference in order to influence the atmosphere. [Belloch] That is an insult to the two prosecuting attorneys in the case. They do not deserve it. I sincerely believe that that is quite enough. All those who aim to hold political responsibilities should realize that this leads nowhere except to unnecessarily discrediting the institutions and destroying the country. And nobody who aims to hold responsibility can afford that. [Brunet] Could the government do nothing to prevent Roldan's escape? [Belloch] The administration could have been more effective in remote surveillance or other methods which are not interpreted as coercion, but that is all there is to it. The interior minister -- a particularly courageous, honorable, upright, and competent person -- accepted his political responsibility and resigned. In any country in the world, it is destructive to continue to speak of these matters. [Brunet] But what would you do in a similar case? [Belloch] Order that there be a reasonable remote surveillance system in order to try to prevent escape. That is what I believe Asuncion did. [Brunet] Then he was not obeyed. [Belloch] We are investigating whether there are administrative responsibilities, in order to find out how those methods were organized. There are no conclusions as yet. [Brunet] That is, the system failed; it has been shown that it is not always possible to reconcile individual rights with collective security. [Belloch] It is very possible. One of the reasons for seriously considering a change of procedural model is because there are structural defects. For instance, a prosecuting attorney could adopt those surveillance measures. Our model has its difficulties. Would you accept three policemen accompanying you everywhere? Asuncion said so: All this has happened because it was the Roldan affair. In no other case would he have accepted political responsibility. This was an exceptional situation, in which the system could have worked better, but, as a method, it makes no sense for a gentleman against whom proceedings have been opened to be under police surveillance. [Brunet] Is it difficult to explain to the public that there was no arrangement with Roldan? [Belloch] Those who refer to the possibility of an arrangement necessarily do so in bad faith or believe that other people do not have a normal intelligence quotient. It is clear that the chief interest which the government and the minister had was for this not to have happened. We have launched a very large-scale search operation to find him. The theory of an arrangement is untenable. [Brunet] Would you negotiate a posteriori with Roldan for him to give himself up? [Belloch] The only thing of which he can be assured, like anybody else, is that he will have security, but the same as any other criminal: Excuse me, suspected criminal. [passage omitted]
