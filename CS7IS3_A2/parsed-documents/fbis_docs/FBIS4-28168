In the second-day session of the IAEA Board of Governors held early this morning, Director General Han Blix made a separate report on North Korea's violations of the nuclear agreement in which he expressed with high intensity and certainty that there is undeclared plutonium in North Korea at the moment, while saying that he did not know whether it is in gram or kilogram. Director General Han Blix pointed out that the two undeclared facilities, which North Korea has not opened to inspections claiming they are military facilities, exist within the Yongbyon nuclear complex. He stressed that North Korea's allegations they are military facilities are not sufficient to set aside inspection. In particular, Director General Han Blix said for the first time that it is essential to make approaches to more facilities in addition to ad hoc inspections of the treatment site of nuclear waste materials for the purpose of looking into the exact amount of the plutonium produced, thereby strongly hinting that there are several new undeclared nuclear facilities. In the meantime, the IAEA Board of Governors will adopt a resolution of warning against North Korea after discussing North Korea's nuclear issue either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
