The report says that the Pacific Fleet has sold to North Korea four submarines which, after repair, will join the DPRK naval forces. The press office of the Russian Navy said that a contract had indeed been signed for the sale of 12 obsolete diesel submarines with a Japanese firm. However, at present these submarines are in a condition which rules out their being used for combat purposes. Moreover, Russian experts will be monitoring the complete dismantling of the submarines.
