Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a news conference that panel members "were convinced" of the need for tax reform in line with materials prepared at a meeting Friday [3 June] for regional hearings next week. They included notes from discussions so far, social welfare measures prepared by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, fiscal 2000 revenue estimates and problems of the current income and consumption tax systems by the Finance Ministry. The materials call for tax reform that results in net tax revenue increases after cuts and adjustments, and Finance Ministry estimates that would satisfy this goal would require hiking the consumption tax to between 7 percent and 10 percent. The ministry estimates are based on a three-year time lag between the 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts and the sales tax hike, and also on a 10-20 year maturity of stopgap bonds for financing the advance tax cuts. As for cutting income and resident's taxes, the panel is expected to call for lessening tax burdens in the 7-10 million yen annual income bracket, according to the materials. Uncertainty remains whether the advisory panel to the prime minister will include concrete figures in its report to be compiled soon after the regional hearings. Indeed, forum sources said the panel is inclined to exclude figures to avoid unnecessary political disputes, especially for the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is sensitive about raising the consumption tax. The SDP split off from the ruling coalition amid disputes over cabinet formation by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, thus leaving the coalition with a minority rule. Kato has said the report will include various alternatives for the ruling parties to decide on tax reform led by permanent tax cuts by the end of June, as Japan promised in the March market-opening package. But even if the panel leaves the report vague, its implications will be quite obvious since the ministry's revenue estimates are also submitted to the ruling parties. Meanwhile, Kato indicated earlier that the panel may call for a phased consumption tax hike -- initially raising it only to 6 percent. Considering administrative and fiscal overhauls, the panel is expected to call for government leadership to win public support for the planned tax reform that will ask for heavier tax burdens. The panel chairman said he trusts Hata, who indicated his "strong determination" to promote administrative reforms when Kato visited the prime minister on Wednesday. On the regional consumption tax, the report is to call for further discussions, the sources said. Kato said the consensus is that local governments should have their own tax revenue sources but the panel is still undecided on the method, with various "clerical and technical problems" seen in adopting a regional consumption tax. But he suggested in his earlier press remarks that the panel may encourage the ruling parties to decide on a regional tax, saying, "there are some political ways (to go about it)."
