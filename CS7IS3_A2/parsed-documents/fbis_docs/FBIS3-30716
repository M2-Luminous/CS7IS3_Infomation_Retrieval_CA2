[Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, who visited Serbia a few days ago, talked about the Yugoslav situation this afternoon at a news conference. Miklos Lengyel reports: [Lengyel] Hungary supports the lifting of sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia only if Belgrade meets international expectations, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized at his press briefing today. The Hungarian foreign minister said that pressure on the Hungarian minority in Serbia had eased. Hungary was striving for balanced relations with all successor states to Yugoslavia. The Hungarian foreign minister also plans to visit Zagreb and Sarajevo soon. Geza Jeszenszky thinks there is still a chance of finding some sort of peace solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, Geza Jeszenszky considered it regrettable that Istvan Szentivanyi, an Alliance of Free Democrats deputy, had criticized the foreign minister's Belgrade talks. He was surprised that THE WASHINGTON POST had only belatedly commented on his visit to Belgrade. He denied that the Hungarian Government had only now mentioned the detrimental effects of the sanctions on Hungary. If the sanctions did not work properly, it was not Hungary's fault, Geza Jeszenszky said.
