Saudi Arabia thus overruled a bid by Iran and other non-Gulf members, including Indonesia, to reduce the ceiling from its present level of 24.52 million barrels a day (MBD) to bolster weak oil prices, delegates said. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazir told reporters "it was the best we could do under the circumstances." Nazir declined to say what the impact could be on oil prices. Ahmed Said al-Badi, of the United Arab Emirates, said the decision was a unanimous one and the Libyan minister, Abdalla al-Badri, said he was "not happy" with the outcome.
