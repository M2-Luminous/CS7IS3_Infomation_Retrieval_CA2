Lystopad: "A Graveyard With an Area of 420,000 Square Kilometers"] [Text] Recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine issued Decree No. 867 on Pollution Abatement Measures in the Northwestern Section of the Black Sea in the Odessa Area. The measures envisioned by the decree--the repair of existing systems and the construction of new sewer, water-treatment, and water supply systems in Odessa, the removal of the Odessa Oil Refinery, the Odessa oil tank farm, and the oil harbor beyond the city limits of Odessa--have been the cherished dream of all Odessa "greens." However, the joy is overshadowed by the understanding that these measures are the "payoff" for the construction, in the vicinity of Odessa, of an oil terminal designed to receive 40 million tonnes of oil a year. It will cause a multitude of ecological problems. Let us examine them beginning with the end--the end of the Black Sea and the resorts of Odessa. Unfortunately, this is not an exaggeration. Here are the statistics: When each tonne of refinery products is offloaded, 70 grams, on the average, spill into the sea (the water area of the port). A trifle? However, these 70 grams must be multiplied by 40 million. Here we are! That sounds more convincing--2,800 tonnes, all the more so because, according to calculations by Professor O.H. Mironov (the Sevastopol branch of the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas), the self-cleaning capacity of the Black Sea comes to only 2,600 tonnes a year. Therefore, dear gentlemen, you may strike the Odessa area from the list of Ukrainian resorts. The difference of 200 tonnes will suffice in order to dirty the entire Bay of Odessa and all the beaches of Odessa from Luzanivka to Chornomorka: One cubic meter of oil spills in a film that covers 10 square kilometers! As a result, the functioning of the "water area-atmosphere" system is disrupted, along with uncontrollable climatic changes, and phytoplankton (that is, the lungs of the sea) die en masse. The further it goes, the worse it becomes. Crustaceans and worms perish, as do fish, because of famine and suffocation. New fish will not hatch, because the spawn will have perished even earlier. We will not be the only ones left without fish: There will be none in the Black Sea; after all, the Odessa bank ensures 70 percent of the biological productivity of the sea. This is a maternity ward from which 60 percent of all Black Sea fish come. What about the people? Some will be looking for work--fishing kolkhozes and other enterprises whose names begin with "fishing" will be ruined. Others, those who have managed to catch and eat the fish, will be patients in oncologic hospitals: Toxic components of oil may accumulate in fish in large amounts. In addition, an accident may occur at the 25-kilometer-long pipeline, and an accident involving oil intake equipment. Finally, there are tanker accidents. Let us once again turn to statistics that testify that there is an upward trend in the number of accidents with large oil spills: in 1986--one accident, in 1987--five accidents, in 1988--21 accidents, and in 1989--39 accidents! The sea in the Odessa area resembles Deribasivska Street in Odessa itself. However, a collision of two pedestrians on Deribasivska causes nothing but a colorful shouting match, whereas a similar collision at sea will end in more than a shouting match. Supporters of the terminal respond to the danger of pollution of the sea with oil: We will call in oil-sweeper vessels, and they will clean everything up. S.K. Dolinskiy, chief of the State Inspectorate for the Protection of the Black Sea, is considerably more pessimistic: They will succeed in cleaning up only 10 percent of the spilled oil. Incidentally, if one of our tankers "splashes" oil somewhere close to someone else's shores, we will have to pay large fines and compensation for damages. Turkey has stated its reluctance to let our tankers through its straits for a reason. After all, the risk of collision increases many times over in these narrow sea passages. Is there an opportunity to reduce risk? Yes! First, tankers should be unloaded in a closed port. The oil harbor that operates in Odessa is ready to receive 4 million tonnes of oil right now, 8 million tonnes after two weeks of work on its reconstruction, and 12 million tonnes in two months--as much as the first phase of the terminal is designed to receive. It will be the same amount of oil, but less money for reconstruction. Besides, as has already been noted, it will be cheaper. Almost 90 percent of the oil may be cleaned up in the enclosed space of the harbor, and the rest will pollute only the harbor itself. If reconstruction is carried out in keeping with the requirements of the "greens," the issue of removing the harbor beyond the city limits may be obviated. The collective of the port of Odessa has submitted such proposals to all interested echelons. Somehow, nobody has responded. Was it because they would have to travel to Odessa rather than England for negotiations? The reduced tonnage of oil tanker vessels is another way to prevent accidents--tankers one-third the size of those that carry 100,000-150,000 tonnes. Such vessels may be built at our shipbuilding plants in Kerch, Kherson, and Nikolayev. Instead, orders "sail" to the Federal Republic of Germany, for some reason. Our countrymen are being left without work, while the government intends to keep German shipyard workers fed. We have already mentioned the advantage of business trips abroad over local ones. Could this be a more serious issue? But then it falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Service to clarify it. The Security Service should also evaluate this entire project from the point of view of security. This will simply be a juicy morsel for terrorists, both domestic and foreign. If the maritime segment of the terminal is sabotaged, the entire country will be left without "black blood." On-shore installations are even more attractive. They are located side by side with the Odessa plant adjacent to the port. In addition to burning oil, there will be ammonia clouds that will turn Odessa and its vicinity into one big cemetery within a few hours. If the Security Service has no time to work on this, the military may be asked to. They have considerable experience in operating terminals. If there is such a predicament, then why build a new terminal? Could we not use the existing terminals of the Black Sea Fleet? Implement conversion! Enough talking about the Security Service and the Ministry of Defense. There is, after all, a special Ministry! Of Environmental! Protection! This is who should be sounding the alarm! To be sure, the Ministry of Environmental Protection objects to the entire project, and is even demanding that the designers explain: Why do we need specifically 40 million tonnes of oil? However, the ministry did consent to the first phase, failing to understand that having said "A," it will have to say "B." The reason for this decision may be that, although the ministry has enough qualified experts at the middle and lower levels, it is still run by, putting it mildly, nonprofessionals. Therefore, some oil should be brought in through the oil harbor, and some through the terminals of the Black Sea Fleet. What about the rest? Could it be that even this is enough? Who said that we need precisely 40 million tonnes of oil? Does this 40 million include the 8 million tonnes that our traders shipped across the border (incidentally, once again, where was the Security Service?). An interesting fact: Some give the number of 100-150 million tonnes, rather than 40 million. Here is another one: According to data from the Odessa Social and Ecological Alliance, yet another oil refinery in the vicinity of Odessa is being designed. The design of the terminal itself provides for an outer harbor--an installation that is intended to export rather than import oil. The following picture emerges: We receive oil, refine it, give 50 percent back to the owner of the oil, and keep 50 percent, along with all the smoke, dust, smog, and so on. Beautiful, is it not? The "gasoline" problem will be solved. Hail to the "banana" Republic of Ukraine! We will sell out the health of our citizens, but in exchange we will have food to feed them with so that they will not rise up and demand early elections to the Supreme Council.
