Li Peng arrived in Tashkent on his first official visit on Monday. During his three-day stay he will meet with Uzbek leaders to discuss bilateral relations, regional and international issues. The visit is the first leg of his foreign trip, the first in the last 18 months, during which he will also visit Turkmenistan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Kazakhstan and Mongolia. He is the highest foreign leader to visit the four Central Asian republics since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Li Peng said China is interested in maintaining good relations with Central Asian republics and Russia. He said China wants to have long-term, stable and friendly relations with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China established diplomatic relations with Uzbekistan in January 1992. The two countries have also agreed to establish embassies and trade offices in China and Uzbekistan and signed a bilateral agreement on trade and economic cooperation. "I am glad that I am here, in this ancient and world-known city of Tashkent," Li Peng said. "The visit by President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan to our country in 1992 opened a new page in the history of friendly relations between our countries" and gave a powerful impetus to their development and expansion, he continued. The Chinese premier expressed the hope that "the documents to be signed during the visit will strengthen friendly ties and elevate our economic cooperation to a new height." Karimov stressed that Li Peng's visit is taking place at a time when political, economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries are growing ever stronger. He expressed the confidence that the visit will become a new step towards strengthening relations between Uzbekistan and China. "Friendly ties between our states date back to the time of the `great silk route,'" he said.
