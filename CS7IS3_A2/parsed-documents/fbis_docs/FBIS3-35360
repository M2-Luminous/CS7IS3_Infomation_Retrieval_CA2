These countries are Egypt, Tunisia, Oman, Qatar, and Morocco. Peres stressed that the Arab boycott is as much a problem for the Arab world as it is for Israel. Speaking before the Knesset Economic Affairs Committee, which discussed the effects of the Arab boycott on Israel, the foreign minister added that in its war against the Arab boycott, Israel is not seeking to take over the Arab world. Through the peace process, Israel is trying to bring about an economization of politics instead of a politicization of economics. This was reported by our correspondent Eytan Almog. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1105 GMT on 21 February adds that Foreign Minister Peres also said that "the economic aid Israel receives from the United States compensates for the losses incurred as a result of the Arab boycott."]
