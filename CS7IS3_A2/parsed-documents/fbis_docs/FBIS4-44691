The manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, was enthusiastic: the principle of a single-stage, fully reusable booster system had proven its practicability. The first flight into the stratosphere of the Delta Clipper-Experimental [DC-X] is supposed to follow with two years. If all goes well, commercially usable rockets measuring 39 meters in height and having an 11.5-ton payload could then be developed. The idea of a "single-stage-to-orbit vehicle" [SSTO] reaches back to the sixties. Douglas Aircraft's Phil Bono wanted to build a rocket that could dispatch U.S. troops to crisis areas around the world in an hour. At the time there were no prospects for the project. NASA had its hands full with the space shuttle. Only after it became fully evident that over the long run the principle of lavish space travel was too costly did people in the U.S. space sector recall the SSTO that had been shelved. Max Hunter, one of McDonnell Douglas' leading design engineers in Huntington Beach (California), also saw in it an opportunity to recoup at least something from the loss of contracts concomitant upon the cessation of the Space Defense Initiative [SDI] program. Other lobbyists kept pressuring until then U.S. vice-president Dan Quayle diverted $80 million from the SDI program to McDonnell Douglas' SSTO project in 1991. In the words of project director William Gaubitz: "The aim in developing the Delta Clipper is a space-travel system that can fly both with and without a human crew, does not eject any part in flight, lands upright and is fully reusable." Average cost of a "Space Shuttle Light" launch will supposedly cost $10 million. NASA currently projects $409 million for each launch of a space shot. It takes only 18 months to build the DC-X. In the period following the first trial flight in August 1993 at the U.S. White Sands test site in New Mexico additional launches entailing flights as high as several hundred meters have been carried out. German engineers have likewise contributed to the current success. The landing system with each of its 160 kilogram [kg] light-weight telescoping legs and landing feet was developed and built in the record time of nine months at Deutsche Aerospace AG [DASA] in Munich. It also entailed the largest subcontract that U.S. aerospace firms have awarded so far outside the U.S. for the Ottobrunner design engineering firm.
