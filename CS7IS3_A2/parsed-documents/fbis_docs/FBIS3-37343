Do they have a particular reason for being in such a hurry? [Birkavs] We are not in any more of a hurry than anyone else, but you only need to look at the map to understand. For us, security has its own dynamic, its own timetable, and nothing can be done before its time comes, and nothing after it has passed. I believe that now is the time. [Mathil] Why precisely now? Have the results of the Russian elections exerted any pressure on the timetable? [Birkavs] Certainly. After the Russian elections I stated that security was now the number one issue. We are very close neighbors, we are deeply interested in developments inside Russia. [Mathil] Should we consider that you place yourself within what the Russians term as the "near abroad" where, in the words of Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, Moscow has "legitimate interests"? [Birkavs] Of course not. Admittedly, we are neighbors and I suppose will always remain so. Unfortunately, Mr. Kozyrev said some very muddled things about Russian "interests" in the Baltic states, without ever really explaining what this means. [Mathil] It is this Monday also that discussions on the withdrawal of Russian soldiers are due to restart in Riga. How many remain in Latvia? [Birkavs] About 10,000. [Mathil] You are going to leave a major radar base in Skrunda (150 kilometers west of Riga) in Russian hands for another four years, followed by 18 months to dismantle it. Is it true that you agreed to this under pressure from NATO and the European Union? [Birkavs] Clinton and Yeltsin set this timetable at their last summit. This compromise will be debated by our parliament. We do not want to adopt too rigid a position with regard to the West, but nothing will be done without parliament's approval. [Mathil] Why is this base so important to the Russians? [Birkavs] It is just one aspect of the pressure they are exerting on us. The Russians have three instruments: Their army, the Russian-speaking minority, and economic dependency. The military question is now being settled. The nationality law is being debated by parliament. We must face the consequences of a genuine colonization. [Mathil] Do you accept dual nationality? [Birkavs] Never. [Mathil] There remains economic dependency: The Russian government has just threatened to cut off gas supplies to Latvia for non-payment of its debt. [Birkavs] This debt does not exist. We signed an accord with GazProm (Russian gas company) which Moscow has unilaterally cancelled. [Mathil] Is not the general manager of GazProm none other than Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's present prime minister? [Birkavs] Yes. He knows that we owe them nothing. They are trying to make gas a political issue. That is how dependency is created, it is not only economic. [Mathil] Do you believe the `Partnership For Peace' can help you to overcome this type of difficulty, and free you from various forms of dependency? [Birkavs] The Partnership is a major step in the right direction, but it is no more than a step, the first step toward a satisfactory security structure. It contains no formal guarantee. [Mathil] What is your analysis of the situation in Moscow? [Birkavs] If the Russians really carry out the economic reforms they will have to face a number of very difficult years, but after that their prospects will be favorable. If they do not carry out the reforms, they will also have a number of very difficult years, with no other prospect in view. In other words, in two years time, at the time of the presidential elections, the situation is in any case going to be very tense and a radical and nationalist president could be voted into power. [Mathil] You are not very optimistic. What to do about Russia? [Birkavs] Recently, when I attended the economic forum in Davos everyone asked me that same question. Nobody had the answer. [Mathil] How do you explain that Russia has not yet reacted to the `Partnership for Peace'? Do you think there is a debate on this subject within the Kremlin? [Birkavs] Yes, I believe so. When we had to take a decision on this question, we consulted all the political forces in the country. It would be natural for such a debate to take place in the Kremlin. [Birkavs] What do you think of NATO's ultimatum in Sarajevo? Do you think it sets a precedent? Would you like to see NATO intervene in a similar way in other European conflicts? In the Baltic region for example? [Birkavs] Faced with a situation as explosive as in the former Yugoslavia, you must adopt a very strong but also a very prudent position. The NATO ultimatum satisfies these criteria. It is a positive step. It is just one means of action. We will see the result.
