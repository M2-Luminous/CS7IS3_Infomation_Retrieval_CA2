The bills released by credit card enterprises may be issued in URV's. The Finance Ministry has warned that "there can be no price difference between the transactions made with credit cards and those made with checks or in cash." Under the previous legislation, enterprises had to issue bills in real cruzeiros. "The resolution cancels the compulsory use of real cruzeiros in this type of document. Enterprises may use the URV, but they are not compelled to do so," Finance Ministry Economic Policy Secretariat member Roberto Padovani said. State companies will not be allowed to collect utility rates through installments in URV's. Bills for electric power, water, telephone, stamps, mail services, and fuel purchases will continue to be issued in cruzeiros. The copies, bills, and cards issued in URV's, even if valid for a period shorter than one month, will be paid in real cruzeiros by the URV value of the day on which the obligation comes due. Issuance in URV's will allow enterprises to exclude inflationary expectations from their transactions in installments. Since no inflation is expected to grow in URV's, the most that enterprises can do is include a small interest rate in the sales in installments. It is as if it were the price in cash plus the interest. Receipts issued by enterprises will continue to be in real cruzeiros. Merchandise prices will continue to be expressed in real cruzeiros. The only thing that changed is the possibility of including on a bill or copy the total value of the transaction in URV's. The receipts giving rise to a bill must be issued in real cruzeiros. Impasse The lack of clear rules for the use of the URV made retailers and industrialists adopt opposing positions, while stores were half paralyzed. The day before yesterday the larger Sao Paulo supermarkets agreed on a deflation formula to orient the introduction of the URV. The proposal by retailers, which was formulated by Carrefour during a meeting that was also attended by representatives of the Pao de Acucar, Se, Eldorado, Peralta, and Tulha networks, is the following: Take the credit price set by suppliers in February, remove the 48 percent financial cost, and pay in 28 days, corrected by the URV. With this formula, the March price list will have prices that will be 6 percent lower than the average of the last four-month period of 1993. Industry representatives who yesterday talked with FOLHA -- and who asked not to be identified -- said that the proposal was "indecent." They argued that no one lends money for the industrial sector to finance its operational capital in URV's. According to their figures, the February financial cost remained below 48 percent. Up until yesterday, the industrial and the retail sectors had ruled out the possibility of a supply shortage. Yet FOLHA learned that some products can be in short supply if negotiations are not resumed at their normal rate as of next week. The decentralized stores of the Pao de Acucar network, which have reduced stocks, have already been authorized to restock from the deposits of the Brazilian Distribution Company, which supplies products to centralized management stores. Other supermarkets are making their purchases from wholesalers. Carlos Eduardo Toro, of the Colgate-Palmolive company, believes that negotiations in URV will become feasible as soon as the government clarifies the taxation procedure. "We already have a table for negotiating in URV's, but without clear rules on how taxes will be collected the table cannot be enforced," Toro said.
