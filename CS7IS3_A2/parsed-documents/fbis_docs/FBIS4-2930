A thorough probe will be launched this year by the ministry to identify all toll posts across China's 1.07 million-kilometre highway network. Then the ministry intends to pool efforts to clear out any illegal or excessive tolls. The ministry has also drafted a regulation on the installation of highway toll stations, which is expected to take effect later this year. Under the rules, the rationale, location and charges of highway toll stations will be standardized across the country. The 2,800-kilometre State-level highway from Beijing to Shenzhen will be set up as China's first "model road," where all the checkposts, charges and fines are based on relevant rules. The "model road" standard will be applied to all State-level or provincial-level highways next year. The ministry will also tighten its grip over its own law enforcement teams on the highways to rein in any abuses of power. To encourage local enthusiasm for highway construction, the central government determined years ago that jurisdictions borrowing money to build highways and bridges could levy tolls to pay back their loans. But many local departments abused the policy and put up tollposts without approval, or collected tolls before building the highways. Also, many individuals seeking easy money have blocked the roads and posed as officials to compel passing vehicles to pay "tolls." In some chaotic highway sections drivers and trucking firms are afraid of highway bandits at night and irrational charges or fines during the day. China's crackdown began in 1990 and has gathered momentum since last August as part of the country's anti-corruption drive. More than 10,000 officials participating in the crackdown have covered 340,000 kilometres of highways -- about one-third of the country's total. Incomplete statistics show that 467 tollposts have been removed and 54 irrational highway or waterway charges have been halted over the past seven months.
