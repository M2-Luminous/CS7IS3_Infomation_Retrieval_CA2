The new member countries do not perhaps have a real understanding of us in the south. But on the other hand we will have access to your market." The EU's [European Union] current president, Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, was careful when he gave a short press conference in Stockholm yesterday. To give the appearance of concern over the fears of northern dominance during his first visit to one of the Nordic applicant countries would hardly have been fitting. "We have had political discussions, but no negotiations," Pangalos said, referring to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Dinkelspiel. On Thursday [20 January] Pangalos visited Helsinki. The same evening it was time for Stockholm, prior to traveling on to Oslo yesterday afternoon. A lightning Arctic tour, intended to sound out the political terrain. In the last week a controversial Greek proposal has leaked out to the international press. According to this proposal, Norrbotten would no longer be given the status of an objective 1 region -- something that the EU Commission has proposed. Instead Norrbotten, like three Finnish and Norwegian regions, would receive financial support from a new fund which would take account of what are for the EU new criteria, such as sparse population and cold climate. This could seem generous. At a press conference with Ulf Dinkelspiel on Thursday, Dinkelspiel said that he thought that "the Greeks understand and recognize our subdivisions." The problem is simply that the proposal seems to be that the new fund will chiefly be financed by Sweden, Norway, and Finland. So far the Greeks have neglected to give any more detailed description. At yesterday's press conference Pangalos merely said: "It will be financed from the EU budget." He was unwilling to say more. Since Sweden as a member would be covered by the EU budget, it remains unclear what the net effect of the Greek proposal would be. The Greek EU president admitted that "there are problems" in the ongoing negotiations. "Sometimes they are of importance. Like this one about the regions. But it can be solved. We will have success, and have it now." This success must therefore be achieved in the days around 10 to 14 March. This is the deadline for the negotiations which are already in time trouble. As well as regional support the main things left on the Swedish negotiating agenda are the budget question and agriculture. As far as the budget is concerned there are two Swedish considerations -- a phasing-in of the Swedish contribution, and the position that the GNP criterion "does not properly reflect our purchasing power." "On this latter point we have met with a complete lack of understanding," Ulf Dinkelspiel said on Thursday. On the central issue of agriculture there is as yet no official EU position paper. "We must have such a paper within a few days or a week at the latest," Dinkelspiel said. Theodhoros Pangalos has so far only promised position papers on agriculture and regional support for the meeting with EU ministers on 7 and 8 February. This meeting will not take place for two weeks.
