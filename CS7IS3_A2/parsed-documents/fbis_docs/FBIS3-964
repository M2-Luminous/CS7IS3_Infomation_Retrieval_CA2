Last night, a source close to UNITA described as interesting the government's offer, adding however that UNITA was going to propose some amendments. The source declined to comment on the nature of such amendments, saying only that UNITA will today continue its meetings with the mediators and the observers to discuss the matter. Meanwhile, another source has said that UNITA continues to avoid a definitive settlement to the problem and is only making general considerations concerning the government's offer. It is believed, though, that the mediators and observers want concrete answers from UNITA and will likely exert pressure on it today to obtain them. We will have to wait and see.
