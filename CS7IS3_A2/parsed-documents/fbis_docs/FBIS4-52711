[Matsuoka] He has already apologized for his controversial remarks, and I am not in a position to comment on his resignation. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito are in control of the Hata government, is it not true? [Matsuoka] Outsiders may view the Hata government that way. The situation is that, after the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] backed out of the coalition, both Shinseito and Komeito had to fill the vacuum left by the SDPJ. We are calling on the SDPJ to return to the coalition, and with Shinseito and Komeito in the coalition, members of the Hata cabinet can be replaced whenever the SDPJ returns to the coalition. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are the coalition partners going to coax the SDPJ into the government? [Matsuoka] There is no way but for us to show sincerity. The Japan New Party [JNP] is playing a role of holding the coalition partners together. The JNP intends to contact the SDPJ through various channels and create the climate for the SDPJ to return to the coalition. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN) What are the major tasks the Hata government must grapple with? [Matsuoka] It goes without saying that the Hata government should work for economic recovery. The Hata government will work on economic reform, deregulation, and administrative reform, for which the Hosokawa government paved the way. The Hata government was inaugurated under a banner of continuing those reforms. The 1975 system [the Liberal Democratic Party-SDPJ system] is in the process of collapsing, but I believe that the biggest task for the Hata government is to put an end to the system that is still active. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata government is expected to face difficulty in running the Diet. How about the possibility of the coalition partners cooperating with the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the Diet? [Matsuoka] I believe that past coalition partners deserve to be thanked for their efforts to shore up the Hosokawa government, and the Hata government should reciprocate their efforts. Taking advantage of disarray among the coalition partners, the LDP is making moves to forge an alliance with conservative members of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ cooperates with the LDP in running the Diet, this would be a big minus for it, because the coalition government came into being to end the one-party rule of the LDP. If the SDPJ cooperates with the LDP in steering the Diet, it would make meaningless the efforts that we have made over the past eight months. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Details of the political reform remain to be work out. What is your opinion? [Matsuoka] We will have to do everything we can do to get the Diet to pass a bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies during its current session. The SDPJ held two important cabinet posts for political reform and autonomy when a new electoral system was adopted. The SDPJ should fulfill its responsibility to the end. Some are advocating that the House of Representatives should be dissolved and general elections held under the present multiseat constituency system. If their advocacy is accepted, this would deny the political reform for which we have striven so hard. In principle, the general elections should be held under a new electoral system. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The JNP is suffering a sharp fall in its public support rating. [Matsuoka] That means the difference between the ideal and reality. The JNP has taken the position of keeping the government in check with the feelings of citizens. The JNP was an amateur in politics when it was formed, but it later joined the government as a result of representative Hosokawa's assumption of the premiership. Our party should deal realistically with Diet affairs and in its relationship with other ruling coalition parties. Our party can no longer speak only of ideals. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How does the JNP plan to win back public support? [Matsuoka] Our party is a political group of newly elected legislators, but our party is rapidly bolstering its policymaking ability. The JNP has set forth policies from the position of a civic political party. Our party intends to fulfill the public's expectations. We will ask representative Hosokawa to assume his duty of running our party. We also will ask him to prepare our party for the next leap forward in the period of change. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some members of the JNP have broken away, and their breakaway has shaken the JNP. [MAINICH SHIHMBUN] Legislators with various experiences and differing views formed the JNP. Essentially, it is difficult to hold them together. If they leave the JNP, it would cause big troubles. I hope they will remain in the JNP and fight for reforms. In last year's general elections, our party won many seats with the support of many voters, but our party will be unable to win so many seats if it simply relies on the support of voters. It is important for the ruling coalition parties to create a system under which they make concerted campaigns in the next general election. I want to urge the ruling coalition parties to create a unified parliamentary group. If the next general election is held under the single-seat constituency system, a change will occur among the ruling coalition parties. I intend to hasten enactment of the bill on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies to hold our party together.
