The president has, for the time being, ruled out declaring a "state of emergency" to halt the public workers' stoppage, which affects mostly education and health sectors due to the strike of some 12,000 teachers and 32,000 health sector workers, including 9,000 doctors. De Leon, who ordered that workers who join the strike be reported, ruled out fears by the Catholic Church that the strike may destabilize his government and for the time being did not accept a mediation offer by Archbishop Propsepero Penados del Barrio to seek a solution to the crisis. "It is not necessary because we are open to negotiations," the president underscored and asked that the full weight of the law fall on those doctors who may turn out to be responsible for the death of a woman for alleged lack of medical attention. The case was reported to the Attorney General's Office. Penados has stated that the workers' demands are "fair," even though he regrets it is affecting the poorest people. The National Federation of Public Employees Unions (FENASEP), which has about 40,000 members who do not support the strike, on Thursday began talks with the government to put forth their demands. In view of the general strike called by the National Federation of State Workers Unions (FENASTEG) and the State Workers United Instance [Instancia Unitaria de Trabajadores del Estado -- UITE], the president ratified that he will not grant any salary increases. "It is impossible that in order to grant an increase to about 150,000 workers we will harm 10 million inhabitants," the president emphasized and explained that to give in to the demands of the workers means printing money without backing or investing funds, earmarked for social development programs, in operating expenses. De Leon reiterated that workers who are on strike will not be paid in full. Despite the president's warnings, UITE leader Nery Hernandez told ACAN-EFE that they will not give up holding a national strike, which is not only to demand a readjustment, but also so that the government suspends the privatization process. Hernadez described as "regrettable" the position FENASEP has taken by not supporting the workers' movement, which according to him, includes Guatemala's 22 departments. "We are reaching a social and economic disaster due to government negligence," the union leader said. Meanwhile, FENASTEG Secretary General Armando Sanchez also told ACAN-EFE that with the exception of the municipalities, the Finance [Ministry], the Judicial Branch, and the Labor and Social Security Ministry, the remaining government offices back the strike. Sanchez described the president's stance of not agreeing to the increase as "intransigent" and warned that they will not back down on their demands. Labor and Social Security Minister Anabela Morfin also reiterated that her office will continue to open file cases on workers who go on strike to ensure that they are punished because "we cannot allow services to be affected."
