"If Germany takes MiG-29 planes we are ready to ship them", he told TASS on Friday and quoted President Boris Yeltsin as saying that "if necessary hundreds of fighters will arrive at local (German) airports in two days". Shokhin added that one major project has been practically agreed upon during the visit of the Russian president to Germany. Bonn is to grant Russia a 500-million mark easy-term credit for buying railway cars produced in former east Germany. Shokhin explained that it was impossible for Russia to manage the deal without the easy-term credit. Early this year Russia informed Bonn that the problem of shipping railway cars to Russia was irresolvable without privileged terms. The German Government met the Russian request although it was fraught with a certain confrontation with the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, Shokhin said. This is a 10-year easy-term credit granted under government guarantees, Shokhin said and added that the terms are suitable for Russia and will not negatively affect its budget deficit.
