FR940407-0-00009 FR940407-0-00002 Although the proposed rule discussed a revision to the size standards for over three hundred industries, the SBA received thirty-three comments (nearly 25 percent of all comments received) specifically on the size standard relating to Travel Agencies (SIC code 4724). The proposed rule would have increased the size standard for this industry from $500,000 to $5.0 million in commission-based income, or a 900 percent increase. The $5.0 million size standard was proposed because it was the lowest of the four receipts-based size standards under the proposed simplification of size standards. The majority of the comments received on the travel agencies size standard, nineteen or nearly 60 percent of the thirty-three comments, opposed increasing the size standard by 900 percent. However, twenty-seven of the commenters (82 percent) favored increasing the existing size standard by at least 100 percent. The SBA believes that the fourteen comments that agreed with the proposed revision of the Travel Agencies size standard, coupled with the alternatives recommended in the nineteen opposing comments, demonstrate an overwhelming consensus that the existing size standard is too low. Most of the comments received opposing the $5 million proposed size standard suggested an alternative size standard level that would qualify companies as small whose commission-based receipts were between $1.0 and $2.0 million. SBA notes that none of those submitting opposing comments suggested that the size standard should be increased beyond $2.5 million in commission-based income. The commenters emphasized that since under the $5.0 million proposal all but 100 of the 35,000 travel companies would be considered small, the result of increasing the size standard to the proposed level would virtually eliminate the benefits provided to smaller companies because they would be unable to compete with companies that were from 10 to 50 times their size. The largest trade association of professional travel agents indicated that doubling the standard to $1.0 million in receipts (commission plus other revenues) would sufficiently accommodate the growth in the size of agencies and the need for some room to grow by travel agencies that are successful in their initial bids for government procurement. The SBA fully agrees with the prevailing views of the commenters that the current size standard for the travel agency industry is too low and that it does not reflect current market conditions within the industry. Data from the Louis Harris & Associates 1992 U.S. Travel Agency Survey of market conditions indicate that the existing size standard includes 89 percent of travel agencies and that the proposed size standard would result in the inclusion of 99.8 percent of travel agencies. In consideration of the comments reviewed on this specific size standard, the SBA believes that an inflationary adjustment of 48.2 percent coupled with a rounding upwards to the next $0.5 million increment establishes the appropriate size standard for this industry. Therefore, this final rule establishes a $1.0 million commission-based income size standard for the travel agencies industry, SIC code 4724. A total of nineteen comments, two from firms involved in the construction industry, nine from firms involved in the architectural and engineering industries, and eight from firms involved in various other industries, were received concerning the SBA's decision not to increase the size standards of the construction and engineering industries. As specifically stated in the proposed rule, the SBA is constrained by statute from increasing the size standards in these industries.
