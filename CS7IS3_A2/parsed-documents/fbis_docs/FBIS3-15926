On consulting the "Who's Who in Russia" I ascertained that Shakhray was the sole laboratory head among current and recent deputy chairmen. What is the significance of this? To be serious, no other major revelations were made at the session. The president's guidelines were repeated in a pretty general and vague way. The differences in objectives regarding inflation were retained. As expected, it remained unclear how the government intends to carry out its plans. Three months have now passed since the elections, but no specific action has been seen to date. I have just returned from abroad, where I met with foreign bankers, industrialists, and journalists. I was very curious to learn their reaction to the "new economic course" so solemnly discussed in Moscow. The fact is there was virtually no reaction. There was indifference and skepticism. Virtually no one pins great hopes on the "new course." No matter how I tried to persuade potential investors that the snags and deviations of Russian reforms should not be feared -- that the general course, despite everything, remains correct -- edginess and suspicion prevailed. Their stance may be summed up as follows: You regularly dupe us with your reforms and financial stabilization but still ask us to make investments and grant credit and talk about writing off old debts.... Unfortunately this is, from a certain standpoint, true. There are many people among our functionaries who want to go into reverse, to isolate us from the world community, to introduce censorship and other delights of the old system.... However, on the other hand, life serves as a good school and personal responsibility as a whole university. It seems to me that the key figures in executive power are drawing correct conclusions. The last two months have shown that when it comes to specific actions and decisions the evaluation of the situation has substantially changed. The premier and the Central Bank chairman are today behaving like the most consistent "monetarists" -- they promise a lot but they give no money. These actions, of course, have nothing to do with real monetarism, but they are very sensible in principle, as they counter the attempts to flood the country with worthless money. In this regard you can only express your respect for the authorities: They are withstanding monstrous pressure, they are considered by "their own people" to be the most arrant conservatives, Skokov asks them to acknowledge honestly that the causes of inflation lie in production and sign an agreement with his Union of Manufacturers, yet they hold out and give no one any money, and they have forgotten about "nonmonetary methods" of fighting inflation and its "inertial-oscillatory" character. The sole problem is the lack of specific reform measures. In 1993 several dozen such were implemented. In the current year, not a single one. On the contrary, there are signs of the reverse. Take, for example, such a masterpiece as the 23 February decree on the agrarian complex. Apart from its patently crude nature -- it clearly cannot be carried out -- it contains many features agreeable to the ear of lobbyists -- subsidies, grants, credits.... It is essential to move from simple "withholding" of money and talk of bankruptcies to decisive action; it is essential above all to establish basic order in finances and the state apparatus and to adopt a real budget. In two to three weeks from now, we will start analyzing the first quarter's results and will have to face up to the facts. The main conclusion I have drawn from the past week is that there has been no "new" course. The government basically remains committed, albeit not consistently, to the old course. It is unclear why it was necessary to waste several months, undermine the exchange rate of the ruble, and make bombastic statements just for this. However, the political situation is such that the government has no political base. It is under attack from left and right. Zyuganov demands that Chubays and Kozyrev be driven out of the government, others demand the government's resignation and early presidential elections, yet others demand a coalition government, even though the coalition we have today is more than sufficient. According to the "Itogi" TV program, only 5 percent of Russians think that the government has real power. I think that until the government really changes its course, the democratic forces in the Duma should support it, since it could be replaced by an even less experienced government with an itch to test out experimentally their more than dubious ideas.
