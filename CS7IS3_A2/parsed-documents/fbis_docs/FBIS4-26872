The five principles are: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. After 40 years of tests in practice, the five principles of peaceful coexistence have shown strong vitality and become a universally-acknowledged basic norm governing relations among nations. After World War II, national independence and liberation movements flourished vigorously in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Newly independent countries were in urgent need of a new international relationship based on equality to defend national sovereignty and develop their national economies. The five principles of peaceful coexistence had emerged precisely to meet such a strong common aspiration of the newly independent countries. China and India, two giants in Asia, established diplomatic relations on 1 April 1950 after their rebirths. On 29 April 1954, China and India signed an "agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on trade and communications between China's Tibet region and India," and the five principles of peaceful coexistence were introduced for the first time into the preface of the agreement. In June 1954, Premier Zhou Enlai visited India and Burma at the invitation of the two countries and successively held talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. The five principles of peaceful coexistence were officially announced as the basic norms for guiding bilateral relations in both the "joint statement of Chinese and Indian prime ministers" issued on 28 June 1954 and the "joint statement of Chinese and Burmese prime ministers" issued on 29 June 1954. The Sino-Indian joint statement proposed that "these principles not only be applicable to relations between nations, but also to international relations in general." The Sino-Burmese joint statement hoped that "these principles will be observed by all countries." In April 1955, the year after China, India, and Burma initiated the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 29 newly independent countries from Asia and Africa held the historic Asian-African Conference in Bangdung, Indonesia. With concerted efforts made by the representatives of various countries, the conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation" and formulated the ten principles of the Bangdung Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all five of the principles of peaceful coexistence, represented an extension and development of the latter. Since then, the five principles of peaceful coexistence have been recognized and accepted by more and more nations, international organizations, and international meetings; and have been incorporated into a series of major international documents, including declarations adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The five principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on China's establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100 nations, including Western countries like the United States, and in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other countries. The world today is characterized by diversity. There are about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries, including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations. They differ not only in social systems and development levels, but also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character, and religious belief. The practice of many years has proved that whenever a few countries in disregard of the said differences tried stubbornly to impose their values on "democracy" and "human rights" as well as their social systems on other countries, there would invariably be unrest and chaos, making such practice utterly futile. Similarly, contradictions would be intensified and international tensions heightened if the modes of "big family," "bloc politics," "sphere of influence" and "world leadership" were applied in handling international relations. With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony between the two superpowers. However, manifestations of power politics still exist in international relations, marked by the big suppressing the small, the strong bullying the weak, interference in others' internal affairs under various excuses, and frequent threats to apply sanctions and even to use force. Therefore, it is still of paramount and realistic significance to actively advocate and apply the five principles of peaceful coexistence in handling international relations. The five principles of peaceful coexistence, transcending the limits of social system and ideology, have generalized the most basic norms that govern international relations. Only when international relations are completely based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence; the differences between nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as equals in the international community with the right to choose their own ideology, social system, and the mode of development suitable for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common grounds and keeping of differences, as well as complementary exchange are encouraged, can the nations co-exist peacefully and enjoy genuine peace, stability and development. In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful, stable, just, and equitable new international political and economic order should be established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence and on the premise of recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between nations. Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality, and cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism and power politics; negotiations and dialogue will replace the use and the threat of the use of force; and equality, mutual benefit, and complementary exchange will substitute for trade protectionism and unequal exchange. To achieve these ends, the international community needs to cooperate extensively and make long-term and unremitting efforts.
