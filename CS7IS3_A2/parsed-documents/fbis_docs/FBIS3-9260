The two sides agreed this would be the best way to ensure prosperity of the Balkan peoples and guarantee them that their rights and interests would be implemented in peace and in conditions of goodneighbourliness and mutual respect, said a statement released by the Serbian president's office. Stressing the importance of friendship and close ties between the Serb and Greek peoples, Milosevic said that "for Serbia and its citizens, the support and solidarity of Greece mean moral support and encouragement to put up with the pressure to which they are exposed." A Greek parliamentary delegation headed by Florakis said on Tuesday in a meeting with Yugoslav Parliamentarian Borisav Jovic that a settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia should be sought only in talks between the warring sides without any external interference, and warned of the danger of the conflict spreading to the entire Balkan region. The Greek delegation also said that the Greek people had nothing but praise for the Serb people's resistance to attempts by imperalist powers, such as the United States and Germany, to establish a new world order in the Balkans and zones of their economic and political influence in the region. Jovic, who is chairman of the parliamentary foreign policy committee, said Yugoslavia was vitally interested in an end to all fighting, lifting of unjust sanctions and return to the international community. In late May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina although no Yugoslav soldier has been fighting there. Jovic also hailed Greece's support and aid it had been wholeheartedly rendering to the Serb people in this difficult stage in its history.
