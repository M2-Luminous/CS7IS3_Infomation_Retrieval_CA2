Libyan authorities will suggest that an all-Scottish jury be created for the trial of the two, wanted in Scotland and the United States on charges of having planned the bombing. Two hundred and seventy people died when a Pan Am jet exploded in flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on December 21 1988. According to Tremaglia, the Libyan government will send the Italian authorities "a written statement on their decision, which is aimed at finding a definitive resolution for the issue." The Libyan ambassador argued that such a step would meet demands of successive United Nations resolutions on the question, Tremaglia said.
