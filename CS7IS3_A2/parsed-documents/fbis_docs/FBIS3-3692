In a friendly atmosphere Li and Ballen exchanged views on issues of common concern. Li said that the talks between the presidents of the two countries yesterday afternoon were fruitful, with extensive common understanding reached and some important agreements signed. He added that he believed that the current visit by President Ballen, who is also accompanied by some entrepreneurs, will surely help promote bilateral relations. Li continued that, as a developing country, the economic aid that China can offer to the other developing countries is quite limited, adding the aid is a kind of manifestation of friendship. But Li said that China is willing to further cooperative relations in economy, trade and other fields with Ecuador. Ballen agreed that his talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin were fruitful, saying that the Ecuadorian Government respects China's achievements in economic construction. He also said he hoped that the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries would be further enhanced. The Ecuadorian president noted that there exist unreasonable economic structure and unfair commodity prices in the world, which make the economies of many developing countries, including Ecuador, suffer big losses and many difficulties. Li agreed with Ballen, adding that there are still in the current world hegemonism and power politics, as well as an unreasonable political and economic order. He said that for the developing countries the most outstanding problems are the heavy debt burdens and unfair exchange rates. Such a situation should be changed and China will make efforts to this end, together with Ecuador and other developing countries, Li added. Ballen invited Li to visit Ecuador and Li expressed his thanks for the invitation. Those present at the meeting were Zhu Lin, wife of Li Peng, Josefina Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen, and Vice Minister of Agriculture Wu Yixia, who is also chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee.
