FR940314-0-00008 FR940314-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Rural Electrification Administration 7 CFR Part 1703 RIN 0572&hyph;AA87 Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program; Grants AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its regulation on the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program. This amended regulation establishes procedures for approving and administering grants, clarifying the eligible uses of grant funds, supplemental funds requirements, and administrative requirements for grant funds. The amendments contained in this final rule will facilitate the process whereby REA borrowers can apply to REA for community development grant funding. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Blaine D. Stockton, Jr., Assistant Administrator, Economic Development and Technical Services, Rural Electrification Administration, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;9552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Administrator certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ). Based on current and historical funding levels for this program and a projected average size loan and/or grant in the range of $300,000 to $400,000, it is estimated that 50 to 60 loans and/or grants will be made nationwide each year. It is projected that the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program will have a limited impact upon small businesses because of the program's unique delivery system; i.e., loans and grants will be made through REA financed electric and telephone cooperatives or companies. These entities do not operate as credit institutions, thus they do not seek funds for the expressed purpose of loan portfolio expansion. Rather, REA financed entities request REA funding through this program to enhance economic development in rural areas by funding a limited number of selected development projects. Since credit is channeled to areas which are generally underdeveloped and financially depressed, job creation and economic development resulting from newly emerging businesses and community facilities funded by REA does not pose undue competition or other adverse effects upon existing businesses. Therefore, this final rule will have no effect upon businesses or entities other than those to be funded through this program. National Environmental Policy Act Certification The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Intergovernmental Review The program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials, with the exception of applications for Project Feasibility Studies. A notice informing the public of the intergovernmental review coverage was published in the Federal Register on March 20, 1989, at 54 FR 11426. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.854, Rural Economic Development Loans and Grants. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 9609511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0572&hyph;0090. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. Background On February 15, 1989, REA published the final rule, 7 CFR 1709, subpart B, in the Federal Register (54 FR 6867), implementing the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program to provide funds to REA Borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 USC 901 et seq. ) (Act). This program provides zero-interest loans to REA Borrowers for the promotion of rural economic development and job creation projects. On September 27, 1990, REA changed the designation of this rule from 7 CFR part 1709 to part 1703 (55 FR 39394). On September 25, 1992, REA published a final rule in 7 CFR 1703 subpart B (57 FR 44317) to revise the loan program. The revision provided additional information to potential applicants on the selection factors and rating criteria, allowed monthly submittal of applications and established a maximum amount of project funding as a fixed percentage of allocated funds. Subsequently, a proposed rule was published on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52688), to establish procedures for approving and administering grants and make minor changes to enhance the overall program delivery for the zero-interest loan and grant program. This final rule contains the provisions set forth in the proposed rule published October 12, 1993.
