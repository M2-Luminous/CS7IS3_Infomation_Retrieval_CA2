Before yesterday's anniversary of Russia's sovereignty declaration of 12 June 1991, the Moscow politician said yesterday in an interview with BERLINER ZEITUNG that he currently does not see an alternative to President Yeltsin. [passage omitted] He affirmed that in the Russian Duma there is a far-reaching consensus on the development of all forms of ownership -- both state and private ones. "All parliamentary groups, also the communists, advocated this." There are only differences on the share of the state property in the economy -- at present, it is still two-thirds. Duma President Rybkin regularly meets with President Yeltsin. He had just visited him in the Kremlin, in order to discuss important domestic and foreign policy questions, he reported rather casually. "My relations with President Yeltsin -- on a factual level -- are the very best, they are constructive." The relations between the parliament and the president -- marked by confrontation in the time of the old Supreme Soviet -- have also changed. Rybkin is convinced that a vast majority in the parliament and the state structures proceeds on the assumption that President Yeltsin will exercise his full powers until June 1996, which is, according to the Constitution, the scheduled date of new elections. Talks on candidates at a time when the present president will be in office for another two years are simply not correct. Moreover, he does not see a suitable candidate anywhere. "I know those who want to become president very well and I can tell you: With the limited experience that they have, the presidential responsibility will simply collapse on the day after the election and nothing will be left." In order to anticipate the consequences of decisions made in Moscow for the most distant parts of the country, great experiences of life and leadership are required. All the differences that exist in Russia have to be unified, he said. He admitted that the previous economic policy has resulted in an extreme differentiation of the living conditions in Russia. The rich earn 45 times more than the poor. However, the Duma president claimed that, during his numerous trips through the country, he ascertained that "the reserves of endurance are sufficiently large." The people keep above water with second and third jobs, he said. Meanwhile, the majority in the country has realized that "the time of speedy solutions" is over. He is convinced that "the people have understood that daily work is in demand now." The president's latest edicts and the Duma's work is now aimed at a revival of production, on the one hand, and at letting ineffective enterprises go bankrupt, on the other, he said.
