Addressing the inaugural session of the constituent congress of the Palestinian Contractors Federation last night, 'Arafat said: The best achievement of the accord is that after 100 years we are again on the geographical map and the Palestinian entity is being recognized by those who said: "Palestine is a land without people for a people without a homeland." 'Arafat criticized the donor nations because they allocated just $2.2 billion for the West bank and Gaza Strip over five years at the rate of $440 million a year. He added that he informed U.S. President Clinton that the struggle is over whether Palestine should be a famine-stricken area as Gaza is now or one of the economic tigers in the region.
