The concerted action is aimed in part at sending warning signals to speculators, the BOJ source said. The Bank of Japan expects the intervention to have maximum possible effect on the foreign exchange markets, the source said. The G-7 nations are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. In addition to these countries, Spain, Belgium and other European countries reportedly participated in the concerted market intervention.
