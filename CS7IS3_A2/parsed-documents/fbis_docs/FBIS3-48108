Last year, An Kwang-nam, a worker of the Kangso District coal mining complex, Chong Myong-il, a worker of the Uiju County urban management office in North Pyongan Province, and many other people adopted orphaned children and brought home lonely old men and women and took utmost care of them. The great leader President Kim Il-song, long ago, put forward the slogan "One for all and all for one!" and has made sure that a beautiful communist morality of helping and leading each other forward pervades the whole country. At the national meeting of mothers held in November 1961 he highly estimated Yi Yong-suk, a woman in Sunchon City, South Pyongan Province, who adopted and brought up nine war orphans during the fatherland liberation war, saying her example should be generalized throughout the country, and saw to it that the title of labour heroine was awarded to her. Kim Hui-chong, a labour heroine living in Taetan County, South Hwanghae Province, brought up 15 children of fallen fighters to be reliable officials of the country. Kim Yun-yong, principal of the Pyongyang Sangdang Primary School, Yi Hwa-yong, secretary of the primary party committee of the welfare cooperative in Waudo District, Nampo municipality, Wi Hwak-sil, a resident in Kumchon County, North Hwanghae Province, Hwang Pi-pong, a worker of the Nahung washing machine factory in Iwon County, South Hamgyong Province, and many others also became parents of orphaned children and brought home and look after old men and women with no one to support them. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly estimated their deeds and sent benevolent gifts to them. Last year, he praised as a very good party worker and extended thanks to Chang Sa-hong, secretary of the primary party committee of an organ under the General Bureau of Western Railways, who had taken warm care of the son and daughter of a worker who died, giving more thought to them than to his own children. Indeed, there is not a single orphan, not a single lonely old person in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where the leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind and the entire people form one big family.
