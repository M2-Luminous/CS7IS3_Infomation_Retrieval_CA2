According to a recent survey, three-quarters of the migrants in Shanghai came to seek jobs or do business. This reflects Shanghai's rapid economic development and benign environment for doing business. The survey showed that people moving into and out of Shanghai numbered 3.31 million in the past year. In particular, 2.81 million people moved into Shanghai and 0.5 million people moved out. The total number of migrants increased by 1.22 million as compared with 2.09 million in 1988. According to statistics, 74.3 percent of the migrants moved into Shanghai for various economic purposes; 0.8 percent of the people came to Shanghai for such cultural purposes as receiving education and training; 24.5 percent came to visit friends and relatives, make sightseeing tours, or seek medical treatment; and visitors for other purposes accounted for 0.4 percent. The relevant department in Shanghai held that the increase in the migrant population brought economic and labor resources to the city, but, at the same time, it also produced certain negative effects on Shanghai's public security, transportation, environment, and residents' daily lives. People of insight have urged the authorities concerned to solve the new problems caused by the inflow of migrants as soon as possible.
