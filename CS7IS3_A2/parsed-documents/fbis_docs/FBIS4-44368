Treasury ministers are anxious to limit spending rises below the ceiling of 263 billion pounds -- excluding government debt interest payments and social security payments affected by the level of unemployment -- announced by Mr Clarke in last autumn's Budget. That would allow room for the tax cuts the right is clamouring for before the next general election, with defence and social security identified as early targets for restraints on increases. Downing Street officials described the figure as a cash control ceiling rather than a target prompting speculation at Westminster that the Treasury will seek to bring in public spending below that level. Even so, 263 billion pounds was described as extremely challenging. Privately, ministers believe tax cuts will be possible from next year, with increased contingency reserves to draw on, unemployment dropping, inflation steady and the deficit be low worst predictions. Ministerial sources have suggested there may not be the need for the second stage next year of introducing VAT [Value Added Tax] on fuel, taking it from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Options for cuts look limited, with Tory backbench defence specialists already limbering up to fight off a further squeeze. Decommissioning the 41-year-old royal yacht Britannia -- a cut announced yesterday -- was already prompting protests on the backbenches. Cuts in social security, the Tory right's loudly-preferred option, may also prove difficult ministers fear, without incurring fierce public criticism for attacking the most vulnerable. Ministers will argue their departmental case for spending increases before Mr Clarke's seven-strong ministerial committee into the autumn. The economics and the politics of the spending cuts/tax cuts equation, however, may prove complicated. The legacy of the bust-boom-bust cycle of the past 15 years means the economy cannot afford another consumer spree driven by tax cuts. Nor is it obvious that tax cuts accompanied by reductions in public expenditure will do down well with voters. But there are at least five reasons why the Treasury should be able to shave a few billions off its planning totals: A. Inflation has come in below the Treasury's November forecasts, allowing departments to provide the same level of service for less money. B. Growth looks like being a touch stronger this year than the 2.5 per cent forecast in the Budget. Although the reduction in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit has not been accompanied by a rise in employment, lower dole payments could save the Chancellor around 1 billion pounds next year according to Simon Briscoe economist with S.G. Warburg. C. The Chancellor's Red Book calculations contain a very low figure of 1 billion pounds from privatisation receipts for 1995/96. The Government still has a 40 per cent stake in the two electricity generating companies, worth an estimated 4 billion pounds, and around 5 billion pounds of other sale able assets. D. Messrs Clarke and Portillo will be hoping to see the fundamental reviews of public spending bearing fruit, although the early favourites for deep cuts defence and social security spending, may not prove to be easy pickings. E. The Chancellor could indulge in some financial sleight of hand and chop a few billions off the contingency reserve that the Government earmarks each year for unforeseen emergencies. Mr Clarke has 7 billion pounds stashed away for 1995/96 and 10.5 billion pounds to play with in 1996/97. Mr Briscoe believes that as a result of all these factors it should not prove too difficult to shave 5 billion pounds off the spending totals for this year and next. Of this, he believes the Chancellor will hand out 2 billion pounds in tax cuts and use the rest to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector Borrowing Requirement] by 3 billion pound. Labour suggested cuts would not reduce the tax burden below the increases already imposed. Harriet Harman, the shadow Treasury spokeswoman, said: "Having hit people with the biggest tax increases in history, the Government is now intent On further damaging spending cuts which will cost jobs, undermine public services and seriously weaken Britain's long-term economic prospects." Alan Beith, Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, said: "The Conservatives' search for short-term popularity is in danger of preventing prudent judgment about the level of taxation needed to secure investment and reduce the borrowing requirement without placing the burden on the most vulnerable groups in society."
