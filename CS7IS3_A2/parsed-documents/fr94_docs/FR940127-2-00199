The authority for the Program is contained in section 1668 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;624 (the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 5921). The Program is administered by the Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The purpose of the Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the safety of introducing genetically modified plants, animals, and microorganisms into the environment. The Program accomplishes this purpose by providing scientific information derived from the risk assessment research conducted under it. Research proposals submitted to the Program must be applicable to the purpose of the Program to be considered. Proposals based upon field research and whole organism-population level studies are strongly encouraged. Awards will not be made for clinical trials, commercial product development, product marketing strategies, or other research not appropriate to risk assessment. Proposals should be applicable to current regulatory issues surrounding the ecological impacts of genetically modified organisms, with special emphasis on natural ecosystem consequences. Applicant Eligibility Proposals may be submitted by any public or private research or educational institution or organization. Available Funding The approximate amount available for support of the program in fiscal year 1994 is $1,700,000. Pursuant to Section 719 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;111 (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994), funds available in fiscal year 1994 to pay indirect costs on research grants awarded competitively by CSRS may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award. In addition, pursuant to sec. 727(b) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;111, in the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized to be purchased with the funds provided under this Program, entities are encouraged to use such funds to purchase only American-made equipment or products.
