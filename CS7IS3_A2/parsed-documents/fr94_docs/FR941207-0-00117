FR941207-0-00117 FR941207-0-00020 For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 216 is amended as follows: PART 216_REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE TAKING AND IMPORTING OF MARINE MAMMALS 1. The authority citation for part 216 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq., unless otherwise noted. §216.3 [Amended] 2. §216.3, the definition of ``Intermediary nation'' is removed. 3. In §216.24, paragraph (e)(5)(xiv) is revised to read as follows: §216.24 Taking and related acts incidental to commercial fishing operations. * * * * * (e) *␣*␣* (5) *␣*␣* (xiv) Intermediary nation. Any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products in the classifications listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, from any intermediary nation, as that term is defined in section 3 of the MMPA, may not be imported into the United States unless the Assistant Administrator determines and publishes in the Federal Register that the intermediary nation has provided reasonable proof and has certified to the United States that it has not imported, in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a ban on direct importation into the United States under section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. A prohibition on imports under this paragraph may be lifted by the Assistant Administrator upon a determination announced in the Federal Register , based upon new information supplied by the government of the intermediary nation, that the nation has not imported, in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products subject to a ban on direct imports under section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. Shipments of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products through a nation on a through bill of lading or in another manner that does not enter the shipments into that nation as an importation do not make that nation an intermediary nation. The Assistant Administrator shall act on any request to review decisions under this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv) that are accompanied by specific and detailed supporting information or documentation, within 30 days of receipt of such request. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv), certification and reasonable proof means the submission by a responsible government official from the nation of a document reflecting the nation's customs records for the preceding 6 months, together with a certificate attesting that the document is accurate. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30081 Filed 12&hyph;06&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
