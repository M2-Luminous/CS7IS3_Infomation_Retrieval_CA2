The government coalition was divided over the chairmanships of the parliamentary committees and the previous negotiated agreements were thrown out the window. During the contest for the chairmanship of the public works committee the Northern League voted with the opposition. This was a bitter blow for the government. Of the 13 committees, three have gone to the ruling coalition and five to the opposition. The chairmanships of the other five committees will be decided tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti will explain exactly what happened: [Masotti] Today was a day of upheavals and the unleashed political earthquake has set alarm bells ringing within the ranks of the ruling coalition. A summit meeting of the government parties has been called for this evening. Giulio Maceratini, the head of the National Alliance Senate grouping, has called for fresh Senate elections to choose new candidates. The Senate is the thorn in the side of the ruling government coalition. The ruling coalition was unsuccessful in its tactic of trying to impose its will on the Senate despite the lack of an overall majority. Its tactic had, however, worked twice before; first with the election of the Senate speaker, Carlo Scognamiglio, and then during the government confidence motion. Why was the government defeated today? One of the main factors in the defeat was the creation of a new Senate grouping, the Democratic Left, which has overturned the numerical balance and has sown tensions within the ranks of the Freedom Alliance by accentuating internal divisions. Furthermore, we are in the middle of an election campaign and stances are becoming more intransigent. The strongest evidence of this intransigence came during the election of the chairman of the highly important public works and telecommunications committee. For days this committee had been the object of a showdown between the Northern League and Forza Italia. In the end the League's candidate, Erminio Bosco, was elected with the help of the opposition parties. In other words, all the previous agreements were thrown out of the window. The same thing happened during the election of the chairman of the foreign affairs committee. Giovanni Spadolini had support but yet was unable to obtain the votes of the opposition--only those of the government. He did not obtain enough votes and a fresh election will be held tomorrow. The former speaker of the Senate immediately withdrew his nomination for the post. [passage omitted]
