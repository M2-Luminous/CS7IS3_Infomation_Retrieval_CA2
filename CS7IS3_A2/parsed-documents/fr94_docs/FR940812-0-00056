(c) The SF 149 and SF 149A are the only Governmentwide credit cards approved for use by Federal agencies using IFMS vehicles for the procurement of motor fuel (including alternative fuels) and services at service stations and refueling sites dispensing items provided by the contractors listed in the Defense Fuel Supply Center publication referenced in paragraph (a) of this section. However, agencies are not required to use the SF 149 or SF 149A for motor vehicles used for purposes in which identification as Government vehicles would interfere with the performance of the functions for which the vehicles were acquired and are used.
