The group verified that an initially established target of decomposing 50 kg freon in one hour was achieved. The technology was also confirmed to be effective in the decomposition of halon. Based on the judgement that ``the technology can be commercialized,'' the group plans to commercialize the decomposition device. In July 1990, the group began a research project concerning the use of plasma capable of breaking atoms into nuclei and electrons, for the purpose of decomposing freon into harmless materials. As a result, the group developed a 100-kW decomposition device that was tested for verification through March 1993. A mixed gas of freon and steam is fed to the plasma device, and decomposition takes place in a plasma state at approximately 10,000�C. A neutralizer (sodium hydroxide) and a fixer (calcium hydroxide) are added to the acidic gas formed by the decomposition to produce salt and fluorite. In the verification tests, the group decomposed freon 113 (which is used to clean semiconductors), freons 12 and 11 (which are used as refrigerator coolant), and halon 1301 (which is the active ingredient in fire extinguishers). As a result, the different types of freon were successfully decomposed at the initially established target rate of 50 kg per hour. This rate is equivalent to the decomposition of enough freon for approximately 280 units of household refrigerators. The decomposition of freon was reliable at an efficiency of 99.999 percent, and the decomposition products were proven to be harmless. Also, halon was decomposed at a rate of 53 kg per hour. The group also confirmed that the total cost of decomposing 1 kg of freon was less than ¥300, which included approximately ¥100 for operation, including the cost of electricity, and additional costs for facilities and labor. Based on the verification test results, the group plans to study the feasibility of the commercialization of the decomposition device in FY93 and, in the spring of 1994, begin to contact government and private organizations involved in freon recovery. In February 1990, at the Montreal Protocol Second Treaty Nations Conference, it was decided that the so-called ozone-layer- destroying substances -- such as special freon, special halon, and trichloroethane -- would be totally banned in the period from year 2000 to year 2005. Subsequently, an increasing number of nations began to enforce the ban earlier than year 2000. Japan has also decided to enforce the ban by the end of 1995. The freon decomposition technology, along with the development of freon substitutes, appears to have a bright future. In Japan, various combustion and catalytic methods are currently being studied, although studies are still at the basic research stage.
