Three Are Eyeing the Trans-Danubian Region"--first paragraph is NEPSZABADSAG introduction] [Text] The five companies that submitted tenders for concessions to produce oil and natural gas would be spending more than five billion forints on prospecting and exploration. The invitation to tender closed Monday, and its results will be announced in June. As Antal Fust, the deputy chairman of the Hungarian Bureau of Mines, told our reporter, initially 22 international companies had bought the package of data on oil and natural gas deposits in Hungary, and five of them submitted tenders for concessions. Three of them would like to prospect and explore in the Trans-Danubian Region; and the other two, in the Danube-Tisza interfluve. Of course, they would also want to produce oil or natural gas if their prospecting and exploration proves successful. First, experts will examine and comment on the submitted tenders, from the viewpoint of technological, economic and other considerations. Then a jury, consisting of representatives of the central agencies concerned, will review the tenders and submit its recommendations to the minister of industry and trade, on which companies should be awarded concessions. On first reading it appears that all the tenders satisfy the requirements, Antal Fust said. If all five companies get concessions, that will mean a foreign investment of about 5.0 billion forints in oil and gas prospecting and exploration in Hungary. According to the plans, the foreign companies will use Hungarian enterprises as their subcontractors.
