The Finance Ministry needs to earn the respect of society. We are collecting more but this is not enough. We have several commitments with the IMF that have yet to be accomplished." Lopez Silvero replaces Carlos Sosa Jovellanos, who resigned yesterday. Several other replacements were announced through an executive branch decree. The most surprising one was that of Revenues Department Director Inocencio Davalos. He will be replaced by Castor Acosta. Sandoval said the executive branch and the Finance Ministry are concerned about the Revenues Department performance compared to the progress by the Customs Directorate and the Collection Department (in charge of medium and small contributors).
