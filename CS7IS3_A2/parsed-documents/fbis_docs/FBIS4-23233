We have Aaron Cally with the detailed story: [Cally] The statement signed by President Taylor outlining the position of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] regarding the current peace process, reads thus: We are very disturbed by the artificial barriers that have been erected to delay the seating of the entire Liberian National Transitional Government, the LNTG, including autonomous agencies and public corporations. Even more disturbing is the apparent prevailing attitude of relegating the Cotonou Accord, by those who derive their authority from them, in pursuit of a fruitless exercise and usurpation of powers not delegated to them. Lest we forget, the Council of State is only a part of the LNTG. It is a creation arising out of the Cotonou Accord, signed by the NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government], NPFL, ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and IGNU [Interim Government National Unity] on 25 July, 1993 in Cotonou, Benin, and was sworn into office on 7 March, 1994. The LNTG is only a transitional government, with a very short and definite life span. The press statement continued: The present tragedy we are experiencing was primarily caused by the failure to respect the rule of law, or the fundamental law of the land -- or just basic ground rules. We had hoped that our people would have learned a valuable lesson by now, and change their attitude accordingly. Instead, we see a disheartening compulsion by the creature to violate the laws that created it. For example, the following have been observed since the Council of State was seated, the statement continued: 1. The council's first public pronouncement stated, among other things, that as of 7 March, 1994, the NPFL and ULIMO are dissolved, and have been referred to as erstwhile, former, et cetera. 2. The Council of State's attempt to frustrate the full implementation of the allocation of ministries, public corporations, and autonomous agencies, as spelled out in the allocation of Cotonou III, defies common sense. This had not only violated the Cotonou Accord, but effectively delayed the progress of the peace process. 3. The chairman of the Council of State has begun to behave, and usurp, the powers of the president of the Republic of Liberia, thereby attempting to marginalize the other members of the council. This is also in violation of the Cotonou Accord. 4. The Council of State had assumed appointed powers which are reserved by and for the parties to the Cotonou Accord. The press statement continued: Now therefore, it has become necessary to indicate that the Council of State must abide by the Cotonou Accord in its entirety, if the process of disarmament is to proceed unimpeded, leading to peaceful, democratic, free, and fair elections. The statement, signed by President Taylor, also stated the following: 1. The Council of State must correct the erroneous statements about the dissolution of ULIMO and the NPFL; 2. The Council of State must be allowed to function in accordance with the Cotonou Accord. The council is a collective presidency, and therefore its five members are co-equals. The chairman is not president of the Republic of Liberia, therefore, all privileges accorded the chairman must be equally accorded to the other members of the council. The press statement continued: The allocations for public corporations and autonomous agencies must be allowed to go through, in fulfillment of Cotonou III. The Council of State must not allow itself to be manipulated by individual interests, at the expense of bringing peace to all people and the nation. The statement concluded: Since the LNTG has a life span of six months, these blatant violations of the Cotonou Accord must remedied immediately. Failure to do so will coerce us to review the entire process, with a view to taking the appropriate corrective actions, in order to sustain and maintain the peace, bring about disarmament, and create the necessary conditions of free and fair elections, the statement concluded.
