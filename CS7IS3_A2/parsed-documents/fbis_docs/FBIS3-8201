Here is a statement from the session we have just received. The council reviewed the importance and circumstances of the Washington preliminary agreement on the establishment of Bosnia-Herzegovina on a federal basis as a union of inherently sovereign peoples in the Federal Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and its entering a confederal union with the Republic of Croatia. The delegation of the Republic of Croatia, which was headed by Foreign Minister Mate Granic and took part in drawing up and signing the preliminary agreement, submitted a report to the council. The council Described the agreement as a historic event, which further develops and strengthens the independent and sovereign Croatian state and which secures the survival of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and congratulated President Tudjman and the Croatian delegation on the agreement. With its active and consistent policy toward the European Community and world factors, the Croatian state policy has created preconditions and made possible the adoption of the agreement and the reaching of accord with the Bosnian Muslim delegation, while fully preserving the strategic interests of the Croatian state. The agreement of the Muslim and Croatian sides is not directed against the Serb side, and makes it possible to find a solution with the Serb side that will be acceptable to all three nations within Bosnia-Herzegovina. The agreement marks the success of Croatia's consistent policy implemented through several agreements with the Bosnian Muslim leaders, President Tudjman's letter to President Clinton, the participation in the drawing up and adoption of Cutilheiro's plan on cantons, the Vance-Owan plan on provinces and the Vance-Stoltenberg plan on the union of republics, and President Tudjman's recent peace initiative. The agreement also shows that major world factors have accepted Croatia. This also marks a change in the views of the United States and leading European countries, indicating their resolve regarding a solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the area of the former Yugoslavia. This agreement, which heralds peace, has considerably consolidated Croatia's international position as Croatia's interests correspond with those of the West. Thanks to its principled policies Croatia has been accepted as an entity with which the United States and the EC are conducting international policies. Croatia is no longer under the threat of sanctions. On the contrary, full support has been demonstrated for the security of the Croatian state and a quicker reintegration of the UN protected areas into the constitutional and legal framework of the Republic of Croatia and for the return of refugees at the earliest possible moment. The aid needed for the restoration of the country has been promised, while prospects are also opening up for economic cooperation because the signed agreement has met with positive reactions not only in the Western world but also in Islamic countries. The government of the Republic of Croatia will raise a number of concrete demands with United States, EC, and international financial institutions to secure the aid promised for the restoration of the country and for financing individual projects. A delegation to take part in the further negotiations in Vienna has also been appointed. It is tasked with drawing up all relevant documents for signing a final agreement at the highest level. The Council also discussed the imminent expiry of the UN Protection Forces mandate in Croatia. To this effect it decided to prepare a demand for concrete measures, the emphasis of which should be placed on full control over Croatian borders. The demands will be submitted to the UN Security Council before the expiry of the mandate. Discussing the continuation of the initiated process of normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations, the council stated that the process of normalization ought to continue but one has also to resolutely let the other side know that Croatian and international interests will not tolerate any further attempts at outmaneuvering the implementation of relevant UN resolutions. At its session today the council also discussed the need to finalize as soon as possible the procedure of appointing the state judiciary council. In this context it appointed a group who will inform it about what has been done so far, it is written at the end of the statement from the session of the Presidential Council of Defense and National Security.
