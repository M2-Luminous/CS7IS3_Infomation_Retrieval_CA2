An important reason for this, among many others, was that certain dealers hoarded grain for speculation. Therefore, we would like to give some advice to these people: Your speculative behavior is not in the interests of the country and the people and you will end up ruining yourselves. Grain dealers have played a positive and meaningful role in enlivening the grain market and in promoting rural economic development. However, as middlemen under the socialist market economy, they must do business and make money honestly and in a legal way rather then seeking high profits to the detriment of the country and the people. Only in this way can middlemen play a positive rather than negative part in promoting economic development. Some middlemen have played a negative role by hoarding grain for speculation. This tells us that imperfect market rules and immature markets make it possible for middlemen to hoard grain for speculation and that some middlemen are likely to become "profiteers." Grain is a special product which is essential to the national economy and the people's livelihood and we cannot do without it for even one day. Those who create social disorder and infringe upon the people's interests by hoarding grain for speculation are usually rejected by the people. Most of the blame for the recent sharp increase in grain prices in some places in South China should be ascribed to grain hoarders. They boosted grain price by hoarding grain, disrupting the relatively stable grain market and preventing the state, to a certain degree, from introducing major reform measures. Some people maintain that the state should allow grain dealers to hoard a certain amount of grain under the market economy. This is incorrect because ours is a socialist market economy and the basic purpose of production and circulation is to meet the people's increasing daily material and cultural demands. We must improve economic efficiency, but we must also take social effects into account. How can the government remain indifferent to hoarding and cornering, which is designed to seek exorbitant profits and which goes against the interests of the state and the people? It should be pointed out that the state is fully capable of restraining businessmen who hoard grain for speculation. For instance, the state can strengthen macroeconomic control. "With enough grain in stock, we will not panic." The grain price will fall when the state, which has sufficient grain reserves, sells grain in large quantities. Will the excessive grain the hoarders are stocking not become their burden if this happens? We would like to advise the middlemen engaged in the grain business: You had better do business in a legal way no matter what economic status you have. If you try to seek exorbitant profits by hoarding and speculation, which infringes upon the interests of the country and the people, you will get nowhere.
