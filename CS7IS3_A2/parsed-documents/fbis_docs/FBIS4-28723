[Aye] Concerning the return of the Kachin parliamentary representatives, we received the letter of the Organizational Committee of the National League for Democracy Liberated Area-North dated 27 March 1994 which was addressed to the Central Organizational Committee-Manerplaw, on 29 April 1994. The letter says [they] won't be able to properly discharge their duties and responsibilities given by the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and the National League for Democracy Liberated Area due to the cease-fire agreement between the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council]. The letter also says there are financial difficulties and security risks in carrying out their responsibilities outside KIO areas. It says they decided to return home because it is impossible to survive in the KIO area. Based on this letter, we perceive that the Kachin parliamentary representatives returned because they cannot survive in the KIO area. [Correspondent] It has been learned that the Kachin parliamentary representatives were discouraged and disappointed because they were not given any responsibilities in the NLD's exiled government. Would you like to clarify this matter? [Aye] It is not true. Our National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma was formed by parliamentary representatives. This is why our genuine desire is to expand the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma especially by including parliamentary representatives who are ethnic nationals, and we have been striving for this for quite some time. The Kachin parliamentary representatives also knew this. This is why we would like to clarify that the report we have just heard is not true. [Correspondent] How is the situation presently in the NLD's political movement? [Aye] Yes, the return of the parliamentary representatives will not affect the NLD's political movement because while there are many who have returned to the legal fold, there are also considerable numbers of parliamentary representatives, NLD members, and people from other political parties who do not want to live under the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council], and have come to the liberated area during the revolutionary period. It is a natural phenomenon. Concerning this matter, there is no effect on our work being carried out on this side. It is because the communications between the NLD groups in the north and the Manerplaw central headquarters are very difficult. We would like to say that the return of the NLD members in the north will not affect the National League for Democracy's present and future activities because the NLD's political activities are operated from Manerplaw. [Correspondent] How is the situation in the NLD's political movement in Thailand? [Aye] Yes, it is true that we face more difficulties than before, but not to the extend that we cannot do our work at all. We can continue to survive and move around. We would like to say that we are continuing to do our regular work.
