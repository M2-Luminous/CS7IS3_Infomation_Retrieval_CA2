He added that the total amount spent by the United Saudi Electricity Company in the Western Region on electricity for the holy pilgrimage shrines in Mecca, in order to add new stations and to reinforce and expand new services for subscribers and pilgrims going to the Holy Mosque in Mecca, has been more than SR400 million ($106.6 million). After making an inspection tour yesterday of the holy pilgrimage shrines in Muna, 'Arafat, and al-Muzdalifah and familiarizing himself with the electrical services provided by the Western Region and its preparations for the pilgrimage season, al-Zamil demanded that, in return for these generous expenditures, citizens should make a constant effort to conserve electricity. He said that preparations for the pilgrimage season are being completed and are being done by a [single] unified office in Muna. In less than 10 hours, orders are received and processed concerning tents and services for pilgrims, and maintenance teams always stand by ready to help. Concerning the inauguration of the new Ajyad electric transformer station in Mecca yesterday (Tuesday), al-Zamil said that it constitutes basic support for the holy pilgrimage shrines as well as reinforcement for the region's sources of electric power for providing electric services. Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the province of Mecca, yesterday inaugurated the Ajyad station in Mecca, which was completed at the beginning of this month, and those attending included Minister al-Zamil, Engineer Mahmud Tibah, head of the administrative council of the electricity authority of the Western Region, Dr. Bakr Hamzah Khushaym, director general of electricity for the Western Region, and Dr. Rabi' Sadiq Dahlan, deputy governor of the province of Mecca. It should be mentioned that the United Saudi Electricity Company in the Western Region put up the Ajyad transformer station at a total cost of SR157 million ($21.8 million), and implementation of the project took 15 months. This was in addition to implementation of the project dealing with construction of the al-Shubaykah transformer station, which has the purpose of providing a principal source of power for the area including the Holy Mosque in Mecca, which has a heavy demand for electricity. The cost of this project was SR118 million ($31.4 million), and it was completed in 18 months. Furthermore, the company implemented the project for expansion of the Muna transformer station at a cost of SR18 million, the project involving laying out the electrical cable between the Holy Mosque transformer station and al-Misfalah [name as transliterated] at a total cost of about 54 million riyals, and the project involving straightening out the path of the above-ground electricity line from the Jabal al-Nur transformer station to the 'Arafat transformer station at a cost of SR6 million, the implementation of which took six months. Right now the Umm al-Qura University transformer station is being put up, at a total cost of SR118 million, and work on this project will come to an end at the beginning of next year.
