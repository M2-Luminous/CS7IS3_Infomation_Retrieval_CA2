This missile makes wide use of modern technology. It possesses not only the head-on attack capability common to ground-to-air missiles, but flank attack, and stern-chase attack capabilities as well. Modern offensive air weapons frequently emit all kinds of jamming, and they maneuver in flight as a defense against ground-to-air missiles. Thus, ground-to-air missiles must possess strong ability to resist jamming, a large battle sky, and flexible ground mobility in order to attack various types of mobile targets, and they must have fairly high survivability. The HQ-2B missile is highly resistant to jamming; it is able to attack targets moving at a wide range of speeds, has a large battle sky, and a high kill probability; it is very able to attack moving targets; and all of its weapons systems and parts make wide use of digital circuits. Its command and control systems are computer-controlled. Therefore, this missile meets the requirements of modern air-defense. The HQ-2B missile is used mostly to defend important areas. It may be used alone or as part of a weapons system group, one group linked to another for large area echelon defense. Alternatively, several weapons systems may form a circular defense against a single target. This missile is used primarily to attack bombers, fighter bombers, fighters, reconnaissance aircraft, and helicopters. It may also be used to attack air-to-ground missiles. It may attack either single targets or groups of targets. It may attack high speed targets or low speed targets. The HQ-2B missile attacks aerial targets flying at high speeds and at a range of altitudes. Missiles such as this one can be counted on the fingers. The maximum combat altitude of this air defense missile is 27 kilometers, and its minimum combat altitude is 1 kilometer. Its maximum combat slant distance is 40 km, and its minimum slant distance is seven kilometers. The missile's maximum flight velocity is 1,250 meters per second. This means that the velocity of the target being attacked may not exceed 750 meters per second. The single missile kill rate probability for this missile is no less than 0.92. Against targets whose velocity is not greater than 750 meters per second, the single missile kill rate probability is no less than 0.73. Inasmuch as the HQ-2B is an omni-directional, ground-to-air missile that can make flank attacks or stern-chase attacks, it can attack anti-missile moving targets and turning attack targets. This is where this missile is superior. The HQ-2B missile's combat altitude is the maximum flight altitude of modern aircraft; its combat slant range can be maintained within the combat altitude range; and its kill area is sufficiently deep. Thus, it can effectively kill intruding aerial targets. This range of speeds at which this missile can attack targets covers all the range of speeds of modern aircraft. A certain kill probability against high speed targets is another special feature of this missile. The HQ-2B missile weapons system is made up of missiles, a guidance station, and launch equipment. The layout of a basic firepower unit is as follows: 12 missiles, one guidance station, and launch equipment (made up of 12 mobile launch vehicles and one launch control vehicle). Guidance is provided by connecting the main flight level with the booster level, using a fuze-warhead having strong killing power. Its anti-jamming phase comparison fuse can adjust the time of detonation of the warhead by comparing the relative speed of the target and the missile, so that the warhead explodes when the target is in the best location to be killed. Large shrapnel type warheads have a high dispersion speed and high armor penetration capabilities that insure that any target that is attacked is killed. The guidance station employs an anti-jamming digital code command transmission for signal transmission. The missile carries a corresponding anti-jamming digitally coded radio-control device. Consequently, signal transmission is accurate and reliable, and anti-jamming capability is strong. Since the weapons system has guided missiles that use employ various guidance patterns, in each salvo (1 to 3 missiles) of a running launch (or cluster launch), a different guidance pattern may be used to guide the missiles. This makes it possible to attack high speed targets, mobile targets, targets with on-board jammers, and low altitude targets. The HQ-2B mobile launch truck is self-propelled tracked vehicle that can both launch and transport missiles. Patriotic "Smart Kid" The HN-5C is a Chinese-developed short-range mobile air defense missile system that is used mostly to deal with the threat from sub-sonic, low flying, fighter aircraft and armed helicopters. It is a spot defense system all of whose combat equipment is loaded on one light cross-country vehicle. It is very mobile; thus, it can be rapidly deployed as needed to any combat zone. This missile system is composed of guided missiles, complete optical target detection and tracking sensors, a turret, a fire control computer and launch control electronic equipment, a missile launch rack, a power supply system, and radio data transmission, position finding, and direction detection equipment. All combat equipment in the firepower unit (including two operators and several missiles) are loaded on a single light cross-country truck that can travel at 60 kilometers per hour on a highway, and 30 kilometers per hour on a dirt road. The complete optical target detection and tracking sensor units consists of an infra-red ray angle tracker, a television controller, and a laser range finder. The function of the infra-red angle tacker is to track the direction of the target indicator to find and lock on to the target, and then switch to automatic tracking to guide the missile's target-seeker to lock on and track the target. The television controller employs a double field of vision working mode. When it seeks and finds a target, it uses a wide field of vision, then it brings the target into the field of vision of the infra-red ray goniometer until the infra-red ray goniometer locks on to the target. The laser range finder is used to measure the distance between the target and the firepower unit in order to calculate accurately the aiming lead required for the missile launch and to judge launch conditions. The turret is what carries the missile launch box and the target detection and tracking sensor unit. It has three working modes, namely initial switching, lock following, and lead switching, depending on the signals from the fire control computer and the target detection and tracking sensor. It operates in 360 degrees, its elevation angle is from 2 to 85 degrees, its angular velocity is 0.25-50 degrees per second, and its tracking precision is as little as 4 meters. The fire control computer is the key piece of equipment in the missile weapons system's automated combat control. It has multiple functions such as producing target detection, tracking, and laser range finder launch synchronous pulse control commands. It also issues commands to power up the missile, to lock and unlock the missile's target-seeking device, and to launch the missile. The HN-5C missile employs a passive working mode, which greatly reduces the probability of enemy aircraft detection. It has good concealment characteristics. Its target detection range is 7 kilometers, system response time is short, and combat efficiency is high. It may be used on various kinds of trucks, and it can be rapidly deployed. It can be used in night combat. Plans call for the use of a wheeled armored vehicle to transport the HN-5C, and the use of an infra-red ray detector. This will permit the missile to not only do stern-chase attacking, but it will also have a forward attack capability. Aerial Harpoon The Chinese-developed C601 is an air-to-ship tactical missile weapons system. It is slung beneath the wings of the Hong 6D medium range bomber for use against large and medium size surface ships that enter coastal waters. This weapons system is made up of C601 guided missiles, on-board aiming and launching equipment, and ground technical support equipment. C601 missiles may be launched from an altitude of 1,000 - 9,000 meters, and the combat radius of the Hong 6Ds that carry them is between 1,800 and 2,000 kilometers. Thus, a C601 missile weapons system can control a very large ocean area. The maximum effective range of a C601 missile is between 100 and 110 kilometers; the maximum powered flight distance is 150 kilometers; and the launch sector angle is plus or minus 12 degrees. Once the missile is launched, no control is needed. This means that once launched, the carrier aircraft can leave the combat zone at once or carry out follow-up missions. Not only does this protect the aircraft, but it also improves its combat capabilities. When the C601 missile is cruising in level flight, its altitude may be 50, 70, or 100 meters above the water, and its causing speed is 0.9 times the speed of sound. This missile's outstanding points are a long period of independent flight, good concealment, and low altitude penetration. Its homing target hit probability rate is greater than 90 percent. This missile's warhead carries a large charge, is powerful, and it has a shaped charge that can pierce armor, explode, and fragment. Single or multiple missiles may be launched. A single missile is enough to seriously damage or sink a 3,000 ton class or above destroyer or a 10,000 ton class transport. Since a monopulse active radar is used in missile's terminal guidance, it is able to resist the waves and all kinds of jamming. The C-601 is a cruise missile composed of a body, a control and guidance system, a power system, an electrical system, and a warhead. The missile is 7.36 meters long, and its launch weight is 2,440 kilograms. The missile is a symmetrical, normal type, aerodynamic, high subsonic speed flight vehicle that employs a post-launch independently controlled and terminal stage automatic homing guidance system. The onboard terminal homing radar provides target information about flight direction and pitch to guide the missile to the target following preset homing instructions. The power system consists of a liquid fuel rocket engine and an oxidizing agent blow-off system. The warhead contains a high energy mixed charge. Its front end is a hemispherical, metal, shaped-charge cover. Following ignition, a high temperature metallic jet flow occurs that can penetrate up to one meter thick armor plate. This missile's weapons system works in combat in the following way: After the on-board aiming and launching equipment sets the firing data parameters for the C-601 missile, the missile is fired from the aircraft. During this period, the missile goes into an unpowered glide. When the missile reaches 850 meters above the sea, the engine ignites causing the missile to pick up speed. When the missile glides to 500 meters above the sea, it shifts to ultra-low altitude, constant velocity, cruising flight. When the missile comes within the set firing range, the on-board Doppler homing radar shuts off, and the active terminal homing radar switches on to seek, lock on, and track the target. At this time, the missile's homing system automatically switches to the self-guidance mode to guide the missile in a dive toward the target. When the missile crashes into the target, the fuze detonates the warhead to destroy the target. The C-601 missile formed the basis for research and development of the C-611 air-to-ship missile whose range has increased to 200 kilometers. Anti-Ship Star The C-101 is a supersonic, super low level tactical anti-ship missile developed in China. This missile may be carried on both aircraft and ships for use mostly against large and medium size surface targets in the destroyer class or above. The C-101 missile weapons system consists of missiles, a carrier fire control system, launch equipment, and a ground system. It is at the advanced level of the 1990s. Its ability to cruise at supersonic speed just above the waves is one of its important features. The C-101 missile cruises above the waves at an altitude of 50 meters. When it is about 3,000 meters away from a target, the missile dives to an altitude of five meters to hit the target. This gives the missile concealability and enables it to hit the target near its water line. This missile maintains a supersonic flying speed that is two times the speed of sound when in flight against a target. Its concealability and speed means that the C-101 missile has very high penetration ability. In a diving attack 3,000 meters away from a target, the sudden maneuvering of the missile just at the point where an enemy anti-missile weapon might attack it greatly reduces the probability that the enemy will be able to stop it. Since the missile's homing system uses a monopulse terminal homing radar, and since it is able to skim the waves at supersonic speed, its anti-jamming capability is strong. This missile weapons system has a fairly high hit probability rate and destruction rate. The C-101 missile uses a supersonic high energy, semi-armor piercing, explosive warhead, and a time delay contact fuse. The warhead weighs 300 kilograms, making it larger that the warhead on similar foreign anti-ship missiles. Once launched, the missile flies entirely independently, that is, it flies unattended after launch. During its independent control stage, it relies on the on-board control system for flight control. During the self-homing stage, it relies on the on-board terminal homing radar and the automatic tracking radar. This permits the aircraft that carried the missile to return to base at once following launch, or to carry out other missions. The C-101 missile's aerodynamic shape is a canard layout in which two liquid fuel ram engines are symmetrically connected front and back to both sides of the missile. The missile body consists of a radar compartment and a warhead compartment. The missile employs an automatic pilot system that ensures that the missile flies at a pre-set altitude during the self-control stage. During the homing stage, the missile automatically tracks the target on the basis of control signals that the receiving radar emits. The terminal homing radar is located in the radar compartment. It is used to detect, lock on, and track ocean surface targets, and it sends corresponding control signals to the automatic pilot to effect automatic homing. Since the missile employs a supersonic, high energy, semi-armor piercing explosive warhead, it relies on the enormous kinetic energy that the missile's high velocity generates to penetrate the armor and explode inside the ship to produce huge casualties. The on-board time delay contact fuze effectively controls the explosion of the warhead inside the enemy ship. The C-101 weapons's system works in combat as follows: Once the on-board missile attack radar discovers a target, it conducts a target identification to select the target to be attacked. After tracking the target, the targets movement parameters are calculated and sent in real time to the missile's director. The director plots the firing data. Next, combat parameters and instructions are set in the missile, after which a pre-launch test of the missile is made and the missile launch controlled (either a single or multiple missiles may be launched). After launch, the missile climbs to a pre-set altitude, glides, and enters level flight according to a pre-set procedures. During this process, the missile is accelerated to 1.8 times the speed of sound by a solid rocket booster. After the booster falls away, a liquid fuel ram engine takes over to make the missile cruise steadily at two times the speed of sound. When the missile reaches a pre-set automatically controlled flight time, its on-board automatic pilot system switches to pre-programmed level flight, bringing to an end the automatically controlled flight stage. At this time, the on-board radar switches on to seek and track the target. After locking on the target, it goes into lateral and planar tracking of the target. A radio altimeter controls the missile's descent to an altitude of five meters to attack the target. When the missile contacts the target, the fuze begins to work. The warhead explodes after entering the ship near its water line to destroy the target. Flight tests show the C-101 missile to be at the level of the fourth generation anti-ship missiles of the 1990s. The foregoing is only a taste of China's several air defense and anti-ship missiles. The materials used in them are good and expensive, and they ave attracted the interest of all countries in international defense exhibitions.
