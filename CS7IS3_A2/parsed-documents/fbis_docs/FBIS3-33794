Our sources said Saddam's regime handed the body of martyr 'Ammar al-Maliki and the bodies of 20 other mujahidin to their families in Baghdad. On 15 January, the regime also handed over the bodies of 50 martyrs in al-Basrah, including the bodies of Husayn al-'Ibadi and Musa al-Hanafi. Al-Radwaniyah Prison southwest of Baghdad is currently the largest detention center in Iraq and run by tyrant Saddam's in-law Saddam Kamil. The prison, called the murder prison, was originally built as a military camp and was used during the Iraq-Iran war as a camp for Iranian prisoners. After the March 1991 uprising, it was converted to a large detention center. The prison is currently occupied by thousands of (?inmates)--those the regime suspects of taking part in the uprising--especially people from the center and the south.
