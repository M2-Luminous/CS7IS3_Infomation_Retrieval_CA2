On the one hand it is no longer separated by ideological and military-political barriers. A number of common principles, recorded in the Paris Charter of 1990, documents of the CSCE, and other multilateral acts, has been proclaimed throughout its expanse. The zone of European integration and, with it, the zone of particular legal, economic, and technological standards and provisions are expanding. On the other, the 45 countries located here--a record number for the 20th century--are astonishing in their diversity of forms of state arrangement and political life and models of economic development, which has not been seen for a long time and which is, by all accounts, growing. Ukraine and Denmark, Spain and Estonia, Finland and Bosnia--these are just some of the "poles" of European reality, from which it may be seen that it is hardly any easier to impart to it a common denominator today than it was before the recent "great change." The elimination in the East and the weakening in the West of bloc "discipline" has widened the way to individualization for the European countries. They are being prompted to take it by the aspiration to take advantage of the opportunities of independent development, but primarily by the need to adapt to the new conditions. Both are stimulating the cultivation of a new identity and compelling a fuller use of one's own potential with its frequently unique characteristics. National-state singularities, which previously were frequently blunted and suppressed even, are now being brought to the fore. The lifting of interbloc tension, democracy, and the market are causing a common complication of the European geopolitical landscape, by no means its alignment. Three `Not's' The post-postwar situation in Europe is NOT a malfunction in the course of a history which failed to reach the liberal-conformist "end" predicted for it. It is a natural fleshing out by the forces and regularities that were unable to develop to the full extent in the rigid structures of the bipolar world. But the latent accumulation of these forces had not been interrupted. All the more strongly and unpredictably have they begun to influence the course of things following the end of the cold war. The second occurrence is NOT the fate of the former socialist countries, which are clambering out of crisis with radically renewed economic and social structures, alone. Profound reforms are unfolding in states of the West also. Having liquidated the "iron curtain," the Old World has begun to change completely, according, what is more, to laws affecting it as an entirety, not only, for example, its more or, on the contrary, less prosperous parts. Differentiation and fragmentation are NOT alien phenomena for Europe. High heterogeneousness combined with internal unity constitute one of its fundamental qualities as a particular geopolitical zone. But this unity consists not of the uniformity of this "superstructural" institution or the other but primarily of the existence of organic relationships among all its so dissimilar components. Such relationships have been generated over centuries and are often of a nonmanifest nature mediated many times over. The unity of Europe is more fundamental than ideologies, blocs, and government policy. The erection of barriers or, on the contrary, centralized all-European structures camouflages or distorts its essence only to this extent or the other. New Directions of Differentiation Following the achievement of a very relative consensus on questions that had hitherto constituted the principal material of disagreements, Europe has begun with redoubled vigor, as it were, to draw lines of demarcation in other spheres. Specifically, the spectrum of tasks of national-state development has widened. Today it incorporates, aside from all else, completion of the processes of unification (Germany), the surmounting of the consequences of division (the Czech Republic, Slovakia), the preservation of territorial integrity (Ukraine), and a change in international status (as yet neutral Austria, Sweden, and Finland). There have come to be more types of national-state strategies in Europe. It is not surprising that it is increasingly difficult to bring them together in a single channel. The giant differences between individual countries in terms of length of sovereign existence and, correspondingly, maturity of state institutions have acquired new seriousness. The temporal horizon of European policy has lost its former evenness. Still strong "veterans" are living in direct proximity to the "newborn," among whom there are those who are near death also, most likely. The ways in which certain European governments and leaders have come to power sometimes differ just as strongly as the Bible and a detective novel. While having become fully equal from the viewpoint of international law (there were previously certain reservations on this score in respect to the communist regimes), they nonetheless afford grounds for comparisons of their legitimacy and also the probable longevity of their position. All this poses anew the problem of the compatibility of legal systems and the ponderability and reliability of agreements and treaties that are concluded. The culture factor is assuming ever increasing geopolitical, if not geostrategic, significance. It has been confirmed many times over in recent years that no fewer forces of rapprochement or repulsion may operate at the civilization level than in, say, the economic sphere. In addition, it is being recognized increasingly extensively that democracy in its canonical version advanced by the Council of Europe is part of a particular way of life and cannot take root in other cultural soil without detriment to both. Problems of the intrinsic value of all cultures, the preservation of which in their multiplicity is a prerequisite of the normal development, if not to say survival, of Europe, arise automatically. It may be assumed that the forms of state and political arrangement which are destined to take hold and function in Russia will differ from the Western forms no less than our way of life from, say, the German way of life. But in this case anything more than the coexistence of these forms is hardly to be expected. Although they all fall into the parliamentary democracy category. This entire national-state mosaic, after the artificial "capitalist-socialist" counterpoise has been rejected, does not fit within either the dichotomy of the "old democracies-new democracies," "market economy-transitional economy," or "rich countries-poor countries" type or within a rigid framework at all. The increased internal heterogeneousness in international associations, including the European Union and NATO, and their actual expansion are making it impossible to use membership of them as a basic typological characteristic. A new European area-study typology based on the principles of objectivity and ideological neutrality is required. Small countries would, probably, prove to be a principal typological group. No less than three-fourths of the CSCE members situated here could be classed as such in Europe. Small countries, which have tangibly influenced the state of affairs in Europe as it is, are now proving to be a quite clearly expressed level of its post-confrontation architecture. Their similarity in terms of type of behavior and problems creates the basis for a kind of small-state solidarity, from which it is easy to switch to the coordination of joint actions. For the major European powers, Russia included, numerous small partners could prove a highly promising, albeit complex, field for new geopolitical strategy and tactics. Dramatis Personae and Agents While having affirmed that the role and policy of states in Europe are changing considerably, it is essential, of course, to go deeper. That is, to the primary motives and energy sources of these changes. In other words, to the exponents of the interests or the participants in those same national interests which are usually discussed as a whole, whereas today they require an "address." The modern state and society are characterized by the increased assertiveness and autonomy of all their components, in respect to international affairs included. Especially if it is a question of today's European situation with its intensive modification of socioeconomic and political structures. The role and correlation of the principal exponents of interests in the European countries is a fundamental question of their status and future development. Together with an area-study typology this could be a priority and most applied topic of European research. We would point out by way of illustration that the structure and modus operandi of the elite of a united Germany will differ appreciably from that of the former Bonn republic. The changes have affected the holy of holies--the upper stratum of German banking business. The unprecedented infusions in the "new lands" ($100 billion a year along federal lines alone) have lent impetus to a reallocation of roles and influence among banking groups. New people with new aspirations and styles have begun to make their way into this sphere also. What is to be expected from this, the near future will tell. It is noticeable as yet how in traditional German expansionism (both external and internal) extensive ingredients are beginning to supplant intensive ingredients. The imbalance in the giant financial mechanism is forcing an acceleration of political steps and not that sensitive an attitude toward the interests of European neighbors, and of many compatriots also. Describing Russia as a riddle wrapped in a mystery, W. Churchill observed that there is a clue to this riddle in the form of Russian national interest. But judging Russian interest was simpler at that time inasmuch as there were before one's eyes merely several of its incarnations accommodated in Kremlin offices. For a serious analysis of Russian foreign policy today an in-depth knowledge of Russian society, which is in a state in which "only faith" remains, is required. The West has, seemingly, inwardly recoiled from the boundless and highly unfamiliar picture of the Russian cosmos which has suddenly been revealed. The reduction in the pace of rapprochement on the part of the former may partially be explained by this conceptual and, simply, informational insufficiency. Nonetheless, many key intra-Russian components are displaying a surprising stability, which is why the reforms under way here are in content closer to modernization. The role of the fuel and energy complex-military industrial complex duo is growing. Having regrouped, having cast off the jacket of super-centralization, and having united with the biggest banks, they will, most likely, increasingly assuredly influence Moscow's actions in the world arena. As before, they will need major external sales markets, better near than far. At the same time the pleiades of Afghan vets and politicized technocrats in the top leadership will for a long time, most likely, serve as guarantors against any adventures. It will not take these circles and groups long to ponder the nature of their overseas interest. The most concise description of Russian foreign policy in the coming years will be pragmatism. Crisis of the Structural Genre All that has been said merely confirms that the existing international structures and institutions are subject to reinterpretation and adjustment. It would seem that the stage of the unswerving increase in the level of their integration in the direction of some "higher state" is played out. The need for a further increase in their supra-national character is increasingly being called in question in the top political stratum of the West European states. European economic and political integration was conceived in certain "hard nuclei." The states belonging to them were particularly closely interconnected with one another and very close in terms of type of economic, political, and cultural development. The structures that they formed are genetically linked with this type, which, strictly speaking, limits the potential of their geographical expansion. The European Union and the Council of Europe and, in fact, this "hard nucleus" now face a strategic dilemma: either to lessen the demands on the internal consolidation of the international structures and on the new members or to expend additional resources on an upturn in the general level of integration. The path of compromise is preferred as yet, by all accounts. The existence in the European Union of at least two integration "speeds" has been acknowledged and institutionalized, virtually. The preparatory institution of "candidacy" (association, "partnership," "specially invited state") has been instituted under various structures. As distinct from the former political, more precisely, military-political, pressure along NATO lines, on the part of the United States, I should say, even the West European states will hardly succeed in sticking to a common integration course. A third version, no longer that hypothetical today, of a gradual transition of the leading role in respect to consolidation in Europe to Germany and, possibly, the Western European Union, is emerging. New Geopolitical Paradigm A serious modernization of their conceptual and methodological resources is required of European politicians and researchers today. The former foreign policy thinking that took shape under the influence of the rivalry between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was based to a large extent on numerical ideas. It was mainly a question of a comparison of military and economic potentials in their various aspects. This was, so to speak, an "arithmetical approach" to all-European reality. The impending era requires a recognition of the growing specificity and interdependence of all parts and aspects of European life. Tasks of a qualitatively new level of complexity are coming to confront the researchers and politicians. Inertia in thinking and political practice rooted in the previous stage could under these conditions do its exponents a bad turn, but those who depend on their decisions even more. As far as Russia is concerned, it is important for it today, in addition, not to lapse into conceptual dependence. The concentration of Russian geopolitical thought on the problems of international structure-formation could distract it from the rapidly developing European realities, from the new trends at the national-state level particularly. NATO and the European Union are and will for a long time yet remain for Russia "things in themselves." It will hardly ever have full-blooded relations with them. The CSCE is, like any club with a low admission requirement, incapable. The situation would change were it to interface with Western military-political mechanisms. But for Russia the same problems would then arise. The "all-European" idea as presently crafted is barren in itself also. The cross-breeding of Central Asian and, say, North European interests within the framework of a 54-party forum is just as absurd as it is patently unproductive. The anemic post-Helsinki principles and institutions have been cast aside, virtually, by acts of struggle for a restructuring of Europe and the world. Russia is persuaded on the basis of its own experience of the value of a direct approach to European affairs in their dynamic diversity and of the need for the retention of freedom of decisionmaking.
