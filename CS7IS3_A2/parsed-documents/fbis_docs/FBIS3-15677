Participants in the meeting stated that the second stage in scaling down and restructuring the Belarusian Army was completed in 1992 to 1993, which brought the size of the Belarusian Armed Forces down to nearly the levels specified by international agreements. Again noted were difficulties with recruiting enough troops, caused by the specific demographic situation in Belarus, the Chernobyl aftermath, and the anti-Army campaign launched by some media.
