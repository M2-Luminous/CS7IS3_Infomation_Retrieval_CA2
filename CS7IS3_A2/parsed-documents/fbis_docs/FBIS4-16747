Ukraine proceeds from the need for a comprehensive approach toward the issue of the Black Sea Fleet, taking into account the regulations of the Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo Accords, as well as of the Massandra Protocol. Nor does the "Ostankino" information on the visit to Odessa by a delegation of the Russian Federation correspond to reality. Contrary to the accords reached in Kiev, the commander in chief of the Russian Navy. S. Gromov, wrecked the meeting with the command and officers' personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, a meeting that had been planned jointly with the Ukrainian side. Such information and actions show who places obstacles to a just resolution of the Black Sea Fleet problem.
