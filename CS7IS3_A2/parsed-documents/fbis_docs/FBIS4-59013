The Syrians have shown interest in a meeting, but have not made any commitment. President Weizman, who leaves for Johannesburg this morning by Air Force plane, will meet with a number of political figures, including PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and perhaps Jordan's King Husayn, during his visit.
