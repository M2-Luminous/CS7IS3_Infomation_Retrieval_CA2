The dinar vouchers issued by the Ministry of Finance, as announced earlier, will be withdrawn from circulation on Statehood Day. They will be replaced with the real money of the National Bank of Croatia, which was originally supposed to be called kruna but has been renamed kuna. It is interesting that the replacement of the money will be complete. In addition to paper money, the kuna, citizens will also find in their pockets coins called lipa. Parents will again be able to buy for their children "piggy" saving boxes and similar devices for collecting coins that could eventually be transferred in the savings books. The entire operation of replacing money and all the technical details will be elaborated on in a special bill. The National Bank of Croatia has already prepared the working version of the bill, which will require endorsement by the government and the assembly. Correspondents have not seen the working version yet, but, judging by what was said at the government's session last Thursday [28 April], the most serious option concerning the exchange of money is the one proposing that three decimal points be knocked off. For instance, newspapers costing 2,500 Croatian dinars would cost 2.5 kunas. Such a denomination would be extremely simple and practical, even for those who require more time to work with naughts. However, some people are proposing that even four naughts be knocked off. In this case, coins would gain in value, something that could turn out to be useful for several reasons. The state would earn more. The state is entitled to the difference between the nominal value and the cost of producing the coins. The coins with greater purchasing power, which is still more important, would make people more aware of the fact that every coin, even the lowest denomination, are worth something and should therefore be respected. Possible objections to the "impossible psychological parity" of one German mark only being worth 37 lipas, or 3.7 kunas in the case of knocking off three decimal points, could be countered in the following way: It could be assumed that, as a result of structural disturbances, inflation will do its part and real wages will in the meantime rise to 1,000 German marks. Once we start receiving decent wages, it would not be a bad idea to stick with simple, four-digit figures. It would be good to hear what experts and those who will replace money in about one month have to say about this.
