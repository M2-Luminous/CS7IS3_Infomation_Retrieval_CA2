Sanaa, which announced a cease-fire as of midnight last night, accused the southern forces of breaking the cease-fire six hours after it began, according to Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, by southern Air Force raids against the legitimate forces inside Aden and the areas of Ma'rib and al-'Abr on the border. The bombing did not result in any damage to the oil installations. Gunboats also attacked the legitimate forces in (al-'Arish) near the Aden airport. Sanaa informed the United Nations, the Arab League, Washington, and ambassadors of other states of this violation and asked them not to support those who do not abide by international resolutions. Addressing a news conference, the Yemeni minister asserted that Sanaa is still prepared to abide by the cease-fire but cannot prevent its forces from defending themselves and confronting any attack against them. Basindwah said that the forces of legitimacy are present in Aden and have the right to be in any part of Yemen. Basindwah did not explain if these forces has actually entered the city. On the mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who is expected in Sanaa tomorrow, Basindwah voiced his confidence that Ibrahimi will deal with the legitimacy, which no longer needs to set preconditions because the facts are enough to prove that the constitutional legitimacy enjoys support in all parts of Yemen. [Begin Basindwah recording] [Words indistinct] because we are confident that His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, will deal with the constitutional legitimacy [word indistinct] in the Yemeni Republic. Of course we no longer need to set preconditions because the facts are enough to prove that constitutional legitimacy enjoys support everywhere in Yemen. The [word indistinct] by the UN Security Council resolution and the immediate cease-fire. This proves our good intentions toward international legitimacy and our concern to respect its resolutions. However, this does not mean that we will deal with the insurgents after the ruin, destruction, and bloodshed they caused. This also does not mean that we will accept that anyone comes here and talks with us or to us about dismembering Yemen. This is impossible. [end recording] He also said that the role of the UN envoy will not be at the expense of Yemeni unity in any case and that we will not accept anyone coming here and talking with us about dismembering Yemen. He said Sanaa's announcement of an immediate cease-fire is proof of respect for international legitimacy and abidance by its resolutions. Asked by Radio Monte Carlo if there is dialogue with certain Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders, the Yemeni minister said: There are YSP leaders even inside Sanaa and dialogue with them is being held. These leaders still hold their positions. There are also elements in Aden and Hadhramaut that we could not talk to in the past despite their readiness for dialogue. Asked if there were definite contacts, the minister said that he could not reveal if there were contacts of this kind. He also refused to give any explanations on the external assistance that the southern leaders might have obtained or name the side extending this assistance to them.
