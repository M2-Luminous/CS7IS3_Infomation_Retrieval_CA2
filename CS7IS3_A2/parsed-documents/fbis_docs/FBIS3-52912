Radio Pakistan's Peshawar correspondent reports that about 5,000 Afghan nationals have crossed over to Pakistan since the fighting erupted on New Year's Day. More than 60 diplomats and UN mission personnel arrived in Peshawar before the latest resumption of fighting. These diplomats belong to Saudi Arabia, Iran, Libya, Turkey, India, Sudan, and Somalia. They have temporarily closed their missions in Kabul. At least 15,000 have fled Kabul during the cease-fire to take shelter in Jalalabad. The influx of more people into Jalalabad continues. A spokesman of Afghanistan's Nigrar-e Jehad-e Shura told the Radio Pakistan correspondent that arrangements are being made to settle refugees in camps near Jalalabad. He said the Pakistan Government has sent food and other items for the settlement. An emergency meeting presided over by the UN High Commission for Refugees was held in Peshawar, and reviewed the settlement arrangements of the new refugees. The meeting was told that teams have been sent to Jalalabad to assess the needs of the refugees. The meeting, which was attended by officials of the UN High Commission for Refugees, was told that the Pakistan Government will extend all possible help to the non-governmental agencies to send essential items to Jalalabad. Meanwhile, reports from Kabul say Fort Bala Hissar and the Microryan District are centers of the latest fighting. These are the strongholds of the forces under General Abdul Rashid Dostam. Two people were killed while fleeing Microryan on bicycles when they tried to cross a bridge separating the warring factions.
