On Monday a march by tens of thousands of Zulu royalists in the city centre ended in many deaths and hundreds of injuries. Some reports put the death toll at 31. On Tuesday morning, about 100 men with spears and assegais poured out of a train near Newtown, scattering panicked commuters. Minibus taxis blocked roads into the area and traffic turned back. But the armed men soon vanished. Many Soweto commuters were left stranded again on Tuesday as minibus services came to a halt. There were unconfirmed reports of another group of armed men moving into the city from Booysens. An SAP [South African Police] spokesman said police had gone to Newtown. He said police had received reports of South African Communist Party supporters gathering for a march, but details were unclear. A police search of a train at New Canada railway station on Monday night yielded three AK-47 rifles and 10 pistols. Nine people were arrested.
