[Junblatt] That measure was needed because the Lebanese Forces phenomenon can only grow through a small partitionist scheme in a Christian area and on Christians' bodies. If we go back and read the speech by Samir Ja'ja' after the Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion, we can try him, regardless of the legal or criminal evidence. We can try Samir Ja'ja' because he wanted to arouse sectarian feelings and to say that the state is impotence, and to say, look, here we are. He delivered this speech on the same day the Sayyidat al-Najah bomb exploded. But we should not confuse the Lebanese Forces' disbandment at the political, security, and economic level and the issue of freedoms. There are people suspected of being key Forces financiers, some of whom may have laundered their money inside the country. These must be prosecuted. [Taqiyy-al-Din] Do you support the government's ban on news bulletins in the media services? [Junblatt] The government should long ago have studied the media issue and passed a clear law on the visual and audio media services. As a result of the Forces issue, the government hastily issued the decision in question. Unless the government draws up a clear bill on Tuesday (today) and speedily sends it to the Chamber of Deputies, we will consider that there is an unconstitutional and undeclared state of emergency in the country. I warn that we cannot tolerate such a situation. Because later, and under the slogan of suffocating and controlling freedoms, the situation will affect the theater issue and the opposition. That is, I personally am a member of the government but oppose it sometimes, so how about the legitimate opposition? If this situation continues, it will set a precedent we have never heard of before in Lebanon except in the days of Amin al-Jumayyil and the Shahabis. [Taqiyy-al-Din] Some Christians are frustrated and believe that the state is using two scales: disbanding the Forces and not touching Hizballah, for example. [Junblatt] The frustration theory is aimed at partitioning the country and hitting the achievements of the al-Ta'if agreement. We should give that up. Hizballah, the Islamic phenomenon, or the national phenomenon -- that is, the resistance -- is a different matter. It is natural for this phenomenon to perform its activities and maintain its presence in the south, only in the south. No one can put pressure on this phenomenon before the land in the south has been liberated. But the Christian frustration and the speeches delivered by the patriarch (Nasrallah Sfayr) and other leaders are sometimes aimed at striking at the al-Ta'if agreement or proposing Christian self-security, as advocated by some voices following the Sayyidat al-Najah Church explosion, to the extent that some of them wanted to close the Nahr al-Kalb tunnel in order to say: "We are here...this is our self-security" -- which is unacceptable. [Taqiyy-al-Din] If the involvement of Samir Ja'ja' is proved, do do you support his arrest, or do you believe that it would aggravate sectarian disunion? [Junblatt] When the Sayyidat al-Najah Church incident took place, I urged that those concerned be investigated and prosecuted and that the senior security officials of Ja'ja', like Ghassan Tuma in Paris, Pier Rizq, known as Akram, and others in Paris or in Canada, should be brought to the country. A very violent statement was issued by the Forces at the time, but I did not respond to it because I knew they were seeking to provoke me, that is all. I support the prosecution fully. I believe that Samir Ja'ja' must be arrested and condemned if it is proved he has certain links, as his history is eventful. I also believe that one of the security measures which should be taken is to close the crossings to the south in order to limit the Israeli infiltrations from Jazzin and elsewhere and prevent security elements from infiltrating the country and planting bombs or booby-trapped cars. The people of the south might complain in the end, but the people of the Golan have been steadfast for over 20 years and continue to safeguard their Arabism. I do not believe that the people of the south will abandon their Arabism. [Taqiyy-al-Din] What stage has been reached in your efforts to return the evacuees to the mountain? [Junblatt] The evacuees issue is linked to financial resources, and this issue and the other plans proposed by the state should be given every effort. We note some laxity on the part of some circles, which are interested in other projects which I believe are not among the priorities. Maybe the evacuees issue is not as "useful" as the conferences palace or the railroad project, but it should be given priority over the conferences palace, the railroad project, and the central Beirut project. We and [Prime Minister] al-Hariri are cooperating to give the fund a sufficient loan, but of course, we have to speed up this matter, because evacuees cannot wait. [Taqiyy-al-Din] How do you view the situation in the Arab-Israeli negotiations? [Junblatt] I said in the past, and I repeat and stress now, that we are at an impasse, because Israel is procrastinating and will not return the land. Nor will it give the Palestinians the right to sovereignty over the land and resources, especially water resources. It is an issue of time, as far as Israel is concerned. It is trying to absorb the Hebron shock and tomorrow it will invent something new. At present they are involved in the whirlpool of distracting the PLO with the protection issue, and there will be strange and amazing chaos among the Palestinian police, the Israeli Army, and the settlers, who will all be carrying weapons. It reminds me of the situation in Beirut during the chaos in the days of 'Arafat. We used to form joint committees, unified forces, and so on...the same situation has moved to the West Bank, but the difference is that we are dealing with a clever group, that is the Jews.
