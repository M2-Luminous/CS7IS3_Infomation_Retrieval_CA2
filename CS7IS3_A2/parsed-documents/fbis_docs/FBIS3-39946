Are you not afraid of pitting yourself against him? [Spaventa] I did not accept. I did more than that: I suggested it. I am not afraid. I am a teacher by profession, and I am not investing everything in this contest. I can always return to university and earn no less than I would as a deputy, and certainly more than as a minister. My motivation is not to win a seat in the lower house. [Valentini] So what did prompt you to run as a candidate? [Spaventa] Let us say moral irritation. [Valentini] What does that mean? [Spaventa] I was prompted by two factors. The first is that I have spent many years of my life condemning the intrusion of politics into industry, its contamination of business, and attacks on the production system. These ties are harmful to everyone. And now a representative of the economic world is entering politics, in an improper manner. You cannot become your own monitor. [Valentini] What is the second reason? [Spaventa] I do not think that at present it is permissible to deceive the Italian people with promises or announcements of miracles. Our past two governments have taken a difficult and exhausting path of reform. It is dangerous to think that anyone can guarantee at a stroke the recovery of employment, growth, a new economic miracle, and a reduction in taxes. [Valentini] Pardon me, Minister, but your constituency is made up of wealthy Rome storekeepers: How do you think voters will respond to a program of austerity and stringency? [Spaventa] We shall see whether there is an aware and responsible bourgeoisie. The choice is between believing in miracles or seeing things rationally. The people are free to choose: They will decide whether to place their trust in someone who is intimately acquainted with the city's problems or whether to assign the role of savior to someone coming from outside who does not know much about them. [Valentini] Which sectors will you be addressing in particular in your quest for votes? [Spaventa] Everyone. Absolutely everyone, without giving priority to any one source of votes. I want to understand and to reason with other people. Ours is a very diverse constituency, which includes some underprivileged areas. It could therefore constitute a representative sample of the entire city. [Valentini] Will you occupy an awkward third position between Berlusconi and Michelini [Pact for Italy]? [Spaventa] If the term "awkward" refers to my own personal situation, it is appropriate. I certainly do not have much experience, and I lack resources. The barefoot infantrymen must face armored divisions. I am fighting with my bare hands. [Valentini] The law sets a ceiling of 92 million lire for each candidate: How much do you expect to spend? And where will you get the money? [Spaventa] No, I could never spend as much as 92 million. I will draw on my meager savings. I have yet to see how. An electoral apparatus costs money, and I have no television networks. But the law also forbids explicitly costly forms of propaganda. It will not be an easy venture. [Valentini] What do you think of the Mammi law, which granted Fininvest three television networks? [Spaventa] A great number of gaps and shortcomings in this law have already been highlighted. The entire matter must be reappraised. In healthy conservative countries, such as Britain, no one private individual can own more than one network. [Valentini] Do you consider Berlusconi the reincarnation of [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi? [Spaventa] Many say so. Certainly in the past his proximity to Craxi did him no harm. [Valentini] What is your opinion of the electoral agreement between Forza Italia and Fini's National Alliance? [Spaventa] It is fundamentally ambiguous. It seems that the transitive relation, whereby the League is with Forza Italia in the North and Forza Italia with the National Alliance in the South but the League will not stand with the National Alliance, does not work. There are some major differences within this alignment, first and foremost over the federal issue. Here, more than in other instances, the uniting factor is merely electoral. [Valentini] Do you think Berlusconi needed [Northern League leader] Bossi more, or vice versa? [Spaventa] The League realized that it could lose some positions in the North to Berlusconi. This is no marriage for love, but a marriage of convenience. And perhaps each partner is thinking of his own interests. [Valentini] Some people are already talking in terms of a new fascism, of an Italian-style Peronism. Do you consider the right-wing front an authoritarian movement? [Spaventa] For the present, it is easier to say what it is not. Obviously it is not a responsible conservative right. Nor is there anything reminiscent of the Thatcher experience. In that alignment it is not easy to identify a uniting rationale and program, other than the slogan, "if we prevail everything will be fine." In other words, we lack one of the essential democratic elements -- a liberal-conservative right. [Valentini] This being so, are you not afraid that the so-called "pact for freedom" could win and govern, even on its own? [Spaventa] Until recently this prospect seemed very unlikely. Now it is much less so. Many misjudgements have been made, abroad too: Last month at a seminar at Harvard, everyone was still asking me for information about the League, not about Forza Italia. But I would like to quote from the FINANCIAL TIMES of 15 February: A victory by the left, it wrote, is the lesser of two evils; the greater danger comes from the League, the National Alliance, not to mention -- and I am translating literally here -- from Berlusconi's dubious credentials. [Valentini] Many predict that the next parliament, lacking a self-sufficient majority, will be ungovernable. [Spaventa] This danger does exist. Perhaps wings will be clipped on both sides. There could perhaps be some changes of heart with regard to the government. The center will be crucial, and in fact even it is a two-headed creature. [Valentini] If that does happen, could there be a second Ciampi government? [Spaventa] This hypothesis could be part of the postelection scenario. However, present conditions are very different from those of the first Ciampi government, which stemmed from a political disintegration. The new parliament may be fragmented, but it will be highly motivated from all sides. A political truce is unlikely to recur. [Valentini] So will we not have a government of experts? [Spaventa] I prefer to talk in terms of an institutional government. Be that as it may, it will have a stronger political role. [Valentini] Could you become prime minister, Mr. Spaventa? [Spaventa] Please! Let us not talk about such things. [Valentini] In recent weeks you clashed with Berlusconi over the issue of tax cuts. Is it really impossible to alleviate the tax burden? [Spaventa] We can and must do a great deal to reorganize what is a rickety system. In particular, taxes on industry are excessive and ill-conceived. Our tax system favors debt, but discourages risk capital. There could be a reduction of direct taxation, counterbalanced by an increase in indirect taxation. But a reduction of the tax burden is not feasible in view of our public debt situation. [Valentini] Forza Italia argues the need for further public spending cuts. [Spaventa] A gradual cut in expenditures is possible, and this has already been started by the government. But the results will be achieved in the medium term. Our welfare system, for instance, bears the burden of the fact that the entire West is growing older, with longer life expectancy and lower birth rates. Pensions reform must also safeguard the interests of our children when they grow old. [Valentini] What about interest costs? [Spaventa] The average cost of the debt is falling, with the cut in interest rates. As the positive response from the markets show, this is the only road to a proper reform. If tax reform were to fail, taxes would rise sharply and public finances would suffer as a consequence. [Valentini] So what is your answer to Berlusconi's group when they propose cutting taxes and reducing expenditure by 1 percent a year for the next 10 years? [Spaventa] I do not know whether those gentlemen have ever examined a state budget. I really would like to know where they intend to make such huge cuts. In some sectors, such as public investments and research, there have already been drastic reductions, verging on the intolerable. I am impatient to discover what other areas of expenditure they want to cut, and how. [Valentini] Meanwhile, Communist Renewal leader Fausto Bertinotti is suggesting taxing treasury bills above a certain ceiling. [Spaventa] That interest cannot be touched. This element of the state budget can be contained by credible debt management: The Treasury did so very successfully in 1993. The wealth tax or other such proposals are a recipe for the country's economic and political suicide. [Valentini] But Communist Renewal is part of the left-wing cartel. [Spaventa] Both in the Senate sand in the lower house Communist Renewal voted against my finance bill. They are well aware of who they are dealing with. Nor do I intend to relinquish the finance bill. [Valentini] Do you think that anything can be done to combat unemployment? [Spaventa] This disaster is affecting the whole of Europe. Unfortunately there are no solutions that will work overnight. There are means of facilitating higher employment: flexibility, the reduction of labor costs -- above all for young people -- and labor mobility. For instance, there is no reason to prevent any youngster from working in a supermarket for three hours a day. [Valentini] Mr. Spaventa, what does "solidarity" mean today? [Spaventa] Well, it is difficult to define in a few words. [Valentini] And who are the "progressives"? [Spaventa] This reminds me of the "shining and progressive future." Of course, everyone wants progress. The progressives' label seems to me a rather generic one. There is no question of changing forms of ownership. The progressives want a well-regulated and disciplined form of private capitalism; state intervention to regulate and redistribute (this is where the concept of solidarity could be relevant) in order not to debase some and to elevate others. In other words, a system more similar to other, better capitalist economies capable of achieving social solidarity. A system capable of limiting the domination of the economy by politics and, still more, the domination of politics by the economy.
