The Foreign Ministry considers this to be an act of premeditated and calculated provocation and a continuation of previous statements by Greek authorities on their alleged concern over whether the Orthodox Easter holiday is to be normally celebrated in Albania. This provocation testifies to the fact that there exists a clear connection between these statements by the Greek authorities regarding the Easter holiday and the action of the Greek diplomat in Tirana. It aims at aggravating the atmosphere before the meeting of both countries' foreign ministers in Zurich on 3 May 1994. The Foreign Ministry clarifies that all festivities related to the Albanian Orthodox Easter holiday have been and will be held normally, because Albanian law ensures and guarantees freedom of religion to all its nationals who are believers. There have been no complaints from any secular or church representative of the Orthodox community to Albanian state authorities regarding any obstacles or difficulties impeding the performance of religious festivities. We reiterate that the Albanian Orthodox Church is and will remain autocephalous and any arbitration by the Greek Embassy in the name of Orthodox believers aims at infringing its autocephaly and is considered to be interference in the internal affairs of the Albanian state. The Greek Government spokesman's statement on 29 April 1994, after religious ceremonies were normally held, maliciously distorts the truth and facts and constitutes a dishonorable tendency to exploit religion, the freedom of which is guaranteed in Albania, and casts doubts over the Greek Government's desire to go through with the meeting of foreign ministers scheduled for 3 May 1994 in Zurich, a meeting that the Albanian Government was seriously engaged in. The government believes that the nonrealization of this meeting will not serve the mutual interests of both countries and even less the region's, and that responsibility for this will fall on the Greek Government.
