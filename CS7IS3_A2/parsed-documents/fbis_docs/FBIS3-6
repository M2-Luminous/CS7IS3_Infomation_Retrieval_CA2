Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-O2MAR94-RUSSIA Yeltsin Restructures Media Bureaucracy SUMMARY Using his decree power to reorganize the media bureaucracy, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has consolidated his control over the broadcast media and attenuated the influence of the other branches of government and the cabinet. At the same time he has taken the first step in what is likely to be a far reaching, if reversible, reduction of the state's role in television by giving a private television company access to Russia's 4th television channel. The reorganization appears to signal that longtime close Yeltsin adviser Mikhail Poltoranin, who once shaped Yeltsin's media policy, no longer enjoys the President's confidence in this area. END SUMMARY In a series of edicts dating from 5 December, Yeltsin has effected a complete restructuring of state media structures and shuffled key media personnel consolidating his authority over state television, expanding private access to television broadcasting, and creating a potentially powerful new media arbitration court (see box 1). Begin Box 1 Yeltsin Decrees Changes in Media Structures In a series of edicts issued from 5 December to 4 January, Russian President Boris Yeltsin reorganized state television, created a new media oversight body, and made major changes in key media posts: --A 5 December edict "On the Directors of VGTRK [the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company--RTV]" reappointed Oleg Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko as chairman and general director respectively of RTV (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993). --A 22 December edict "On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere" abolished the Ministry of the Press and Information and the Federal Information Center (FIC), created the Russian Federation Committee for the Press and the Federal Service of Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and appointed Boris Mironov to head the former and Aleksandr Yakovlev the latter (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A second 22 December edict "On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company" consolidated state control over the the national television broadcast infrastructure (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A third 22 December edict "On Utilizing Moscow Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network" granted an independent television production company, NTV, access to Russia's 4th channel (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993). --A 29 December edict "On the Court of Appeals for Information Disputes Under the President of the Russian Federation" which is linked explicitly to articles 29 and 80 of the new constitution granting citizens the right to "freedom of mass information" and making the president the guarantor of that freedom created a new arbitration body under the president to resolve disputes over television coverage and access (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). --A 4 January edict officially relieved Mikhail Poltoranin of his duties as head of the FIC (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). End Box 1 President's Role Strengthened Several aspects of the reorganization strengthen the president's powers over the broadcast media. The new television and radio service under Yakovlev will be subordinate to the president, while the edict appointing Poptsov to head RTV extends Yeltsin's appointment powers to an area once held by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. The creation of 'Efir' consolidates state control over the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential appointee, and the new information appeals court gives the president a potentially great advantage over the other branches of government in determining the political slant and content of television programming. Profile Lowered By giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub- cabinet rank and moving out Mikhail Poltoranin and Vladimir Shumeyko, two favorite targets of his opponents, Yeltsin appears to be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the front lines of the political struggle. Poltoranin, as chief of the now defunct Federal Information Center (FIC), and Shumeyko, as head of the now abolished Ministry of the Press and Information both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads of the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status. New Bodies' Powers The reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the preeminent role in regulating broadcast media, eliminating overlapping responsibilities that existed under the former structures. From the FIC the broadcast service inherits the functions of "coordinating" state policy for television and radio, assisting in the provision of "objective" information to domestic and international audiences on Russian political and economic issues, and participating in the process of drafting legislation on the broadcast media. From the Press and Information Ministry the service inherits responsibilities for implementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and for television and radio licensing and registration. The service also has authority to administer government financing and subsidies for national and regional television (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993) but its authority has been severely circumscribed by the Ministry of Finance (see box 2). The 22 December edict names the Committee on the Press the legal successor to both the Ministry of Press and Information and the FIC but does not elaborate its functions in detail. It presumably will assume the FIC and press ministry functions that relate specifically to the press. The edict does explicitly establish that the committee will administer government financing and subsidies, formerly a prerogative of the press ministry. Begin Box 2 Finance Ministry Cuts Television Budget On 1 February Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported that acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin had recently "notified representatives of Ostankino and Russian Television . . . of a 50 percent cut in financing." The decision, if not amended, could have a devastating impact on both the television companies and the Ministry of Communications which broadcasts the television signals and depends heavily on state television for its own revenues. Russian Television General Director Anatoliy Lysenko predicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns and lead to the "loss of the broadcasting network on a large territory of Russia" (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 29 January). It is not clear if the ministry's decision to slash funding is a first step in a policy of reducing state ownership, as Yakovlev and others have advocated, or if state television simply served as a convenient target of opportunity in the finance ministry's struggle to control the money supply. End Box 2 Poltoranin Routed Aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that Poltoranin, once the most influential figure in the Yeltsin administration in shaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands of his rival for influence Shumeyko. According to Yuriy Baturin, Yeltsin's security adviser and a co-drafter of the existing law on the mass media, Yeltsin, Shumeyko, and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the 22 December edict "On Improving State Management in the Mass Information Sphere" (Izvestiya, 29 December 1993). That edict provided for separate commissions to liquidate the Press Ministry and the FIC but appointed Shumeyko to head both. Poltoranin also appears to have lost a battle over the edict granting NTV access to channel 4, a move which he reportedly opposed. Despite his removal as FIC head, Poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy- -possibly even in opposition to Yeltsin--as head of the Committee on Information Policy and Communications in the State Duma (ITAR- TASS; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 19 January). But, for the first time since before Yeltsin was elected president, (See Note 1) Poltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the administration's media policy or to advise the president in an official capacity. (Note 1) With the exception of a brief hiatus from 25 November 1992 when he stepped down as Minister of the Press and Information to 25 December 1992 when he was appointed head of the newly created Federal Information Center. Poltoranin was appointed Minister of the Press and Information 10 July 1990 by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. Yakovlev's Vision for Television Yeltsin's appointment of "the father of glasnost" and former close Gorbachev adviser Aleksandr Yakovlev to head the new broadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions regarding the broadcast media. Yakovlev once served as the head of the CPSU Central Committee's propaganda department and yet has been credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to liberalize the Soviet media. Although he has a reputation as a reformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of Russia or unrestricted freedom for the media. In an Izvestiya interview (24 December) following his appointment, Yakovlev stated that he would refrain from "influencing" subject matter but rather play a "strategic" role as Ostankino chairman. At the same time, however, he expressed hope that the company will be able to fulfill its role in society "without succumbing to extremes" and on another occasion he spoke of increasing "the share of Russian programs" as a "counterweight" to foreign productions, and criticized excessive sex and violence--generally attributed to foreign influence--on television (RRIA, 2 February). He has also apparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on Ostankino in which Head of the Presidential Administration Sergey Filatov will "explain" presidential edicts (Mayak Radio, 31 January). Yakovlev's appointment may signal future reductions in the state's role in television. He has asserted that there "must be one state television company" which would operate without paid advertising instead of the four companies (See Note 2) that exist now (RIA, 2 February). This goal appears to go hand-in-hand with the recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding (see box 2) and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the state's difficulty financing state television at current levels. Realization of Yakovlev's goal of having one non-commercial state television company could also provide a financial shot in the arm to non-state television since it would become the only vehicle for television advertising. (Note 2) The four are Ostankino, RTV, Channel 4, and the St. Petersburg Channel. Yakovlev's Deputy Valentin Lazutkin, a longtime television professional who appears to share Yakovlev's views on reducing the state's role in television has been appointed as Yakovlev's deputy. With Yakovlev taking a "strategic" approach to his chairmanship, Lazutkin, who has spent nearly 30 years in television, and served as first deputy chairman at Ostankino until his recent promotion will presumably run day-to-day operations at Ostankino. Asked in a recent interview published in Izvestiya, (21 January) about his opinion on the recent change in leadership, he expressed the "hope" that "we need not fear that Ostankino's airspace will be turned into the political property of a particular party, which happened under the former chairman." He also noted that he was "untroubled" by the recent decision to grant the private production company NTV access to the fourth channel (discussed below), though he did criticize the fact that access to the channel was not granted on a "competitive" basis. And finally, discussing his concept of the future of state-run television, Lazutkin said there "should be one powerful Russian company which is . . . part of the state structure" and he advocated transforming Ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences (including Russian-speaking viewers in the CIS). NTV Gains Broadcast Access In what may be the first step towards realizing Yakovlev's vision of decreasing the number of state television companies, Yeltsin granted television broadcasting rights on channel 4 to an independent company, NTV. The 22 December edict "On Using Moscow Television's Eighth Frequency Channel and its Dissemination Network" states that NTV will receive 58 hours of weekly broadcast time as an "experiment" aimed at "developing non-state television." NTV has been broadcasting a nightly news program, Segodnya, and a weekly newsmagazine, RItogi, to viewers of the St. Petersburg channel, which has a potential audience of about 70 million viewers, and will continue to do so. The significance of the edict for NTV does not appear to be that it increases potential audience size since the two channels have significant audience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence from St. Petersburg Television. Most importantly the NTV edict affirms Yeltsin's support for the idea of independent television following an apparent tug-of-war within the administration. Yeltsin first issued the edict on 22 November but suspended it the next day (ITAR-TASS, 22 November 1993; 23 November 1993). On 22 December Yeltsin reissued the edict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked the government with reviewing the issue of "state participation" in the ranks of the founders, making this text even more privatization-oriented than the original. Control of TV Infrastructure In the reorganization, Yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will retain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure, at least for the present. The edict of 22 December "On Setting Up the 'Efir' Russian State Television and Radio Engineering Center Holding Company and the 'Golos Rossii' Russian State Radio Broadcasting Company" created the Efir holding company, whose assets include much of the state's broadcasting infrastructure. Efir will be partially privatized, with employees receiving some shares, but the edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a controlling interest for three years. The edict does not specify, however, what the state will do with its controlling interest after three years. The edict appointed Lazutkin to serve as chairman of Efir's board of directors. Baturin criticized the creation of Efir (and the reorganization in general) which he claims "increases the state's control over the mass media" and even "to a certain extent threatens freedom of the press" (RIzvestiya, 29 December 1993). Noting that "all central television channels are broadcast" through Efir, Baturin asserted that independent television companies will "remain non- state only in formal terms." Control over RTV The reorganization also serves notice that the other major national television company, RTV, will remain under Yeltsin's and Yakovlev's control. Control of the company had been a prolonged point of contention between the President and the former Supreme Soviet. In a demonstration of his authority over RTV, Yeltsin re-appointed the current chairman and general director, Oleg Poptsov and Anatoliy Lysenko, by the edict of 5 December. Formerly, according to Russian Television's Statute, the right of appointment to these posts was held by the Supreme Soviet Presidium (Sobrianiye Aktov Pravitelsta RSFSR, No 6, 1991). Poltoranin Admirer To Head Press Body The 22 December edict reorganizing the media structures appointed Boris Mironov, former head of the Rossiya Publishing House and apparent close friend and admirer of Poltoranin as chairman of the new Committee on the Press. According to a profile of Mironov from Obshchaya Gazeta, Mironov had previously worked for Komsomolskaya Pravda and with Poltoranin when the latter served at Pravda. Mironov reportedly also served for "several days" as chief editor of Rossiyskaya Gazeta but was removed prior to or shortly after publication of the paper's inaugural issue in November 1990 (Obshchaya Gazeta, 14-20 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 6 November 1993). According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta's current chief editor, Natalya Polezhayeva, Mironov was removed "on the personal orders" of then Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. New Media Watchdog Created Yeltsin's establishment of the Court of Appeals for Information Disputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt the new parliament from "interfering" in media policy as did its predecessor (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January). The court is a successor to the Information Arbitration Court that was created during the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair media coverage with largely the same membership, including chairman Anatoliy Vengerov. During the campaign, Vengerov and the court demonstrated a degree of independence from Yeltsin by ruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was permissible, explicitly opposing Yeltsin's stated position that sought to prohibit such campaigning (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; Izvestiya, 27 November 1993). The court's powers include the authority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime among parliamentary factions. It is also charged with ensuring "objectivity and authenticity" in news reporting and the "principle of pluralism" in radio and television programming, and may issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media law, a power it inherited from the defunct Ministry of the Press and Information. Despite the court's record of independent action, the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating that it "is not part of the system" of Russian Federation federal courts, and the new body's statute gives the president the power to appoint and fire its members (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February). Prospects Yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of Russian media structures that seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing direct control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while maintaining presidential control over the main facilities of state television and the process of media oversight. The new parliament may challenge Yeltsin for control of at least some media--there is already talk among deputies of reasserting control over Rossiyskaya Gazeta which the dissolved Supreme Soviet controlled (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 5 January). Yeltsin is likely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his enhanced constitutional authority to do so. He may also calculate that more western-style media independence is the best way of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays out of his opponents' grasp. At the same time economic reality as manifest by the recent one-day widespread broadcast blackout and the Finance Ministry's decision to cut television funding by 50 percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting more and more air time to independent television companies as he has done with NTV and channel 4.
