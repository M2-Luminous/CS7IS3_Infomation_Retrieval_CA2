[passage omitted] This came in a joint news conference held at the Prime Ministry yesterday by Prime Minister Dr. al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi at the conclusion of the meetings of the Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee. [passage omitted] Asked about Egyptian-Palestinian relations and the news reports that Egypt should first approve of any Palestinian decision before it is announced, Dr. Sidqi denied these reports, saying: Egypt places itself, its resources, and its experience at the disposal of any Arab country. Therefore, it is natural to place our resources and experience at the disposal of the Palestinians, particularly the PLO. Dr. Sidqi added: However, it is incorrect to say that no Palestinian decisions are made without referring to Egypt. Palestinian decisions are made by the Palestinians themselves. We only help and express our opinions, which are sometimes taken into consideration and sometimes not. We have never imposed anything on the PLO since the time it was recognized as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people inside and outside [the occupied territory]. Dr. Sidqi indicated that Egypt has been maintaining good relations with the PLO for a long time. He said: Relations between us and the PLO have never been completely severed. Even during times of disagreement, contacts were held. The Palestine question is the heart of the Middle East issue. Therefore, it is in our common interest that we hold almost daily talks and consultations. [passage omitted] In response to a question on whether Jordan has asked Egypt to intervene with the United States to lift the al-'Aqabah siege, Dr. Sidqi said: There is no mediation in this regard. He added: We do, however, welcome the recent developments aimed at finding a solution to this problem because it harms Jordan. Egypt is ready to intervene and mediate should the need arise. However, the current proposals respond to most of Jordan's wishes and legitimate demands. This fact is supported by Egypt. [passage omitted]
