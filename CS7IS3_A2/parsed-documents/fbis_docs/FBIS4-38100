"If the house of Ka'ba or the mausoleum of prophet (pbuh) [peace be upon him] were in Iran, the criminals would not hesitate to commit such crimes against those holy places as well," Ayatollah Kashani told the congregation of worshippers gathered at Tehran University campus. The provisional leader of the Friday congregational prayers underlined that many traditions exist about the prophet's blessed household (ahlulbeit) which stipulate that those who are hostile towards the prophet's household, are not following any of the Islamic sects. He said that those who committed this crime were in complete darkness and that they were incapable of having any human feeling. Ayatollah Kashani went on to add that the emergence of the Islamic resurgence in the world could explain why such acts of terror were committed against Islam and Muslims. Referring to the enemies of worldwide Islamic movement, he said that "they had also shown their unhappiness with Islam through explosions and acts of terrorism that they committed prior to this last incident, (and now) they are hiring those who are mentally and emotionally slaves and those who are poor in spirit." Ayatollah Kashani added that the more horrible the crime, the more effect it will have on helping the growth of political consciousness of the people. "The more horrendous the crime, the more the people's growth and falsehood will gain nothing but misery," he said. He then addressed the Muslim nations, asking them to condemn this crime. "This tragedy is an insult to the divinely sanctified areas. this is a terrorist conspiracy to destabilize the (Muslim) countries. Not only Iran, but also the whole Muslim world, should condemn this horrifying crime," he said. Ayatollah Kashani then invited both Christians and Jews, respectfully known in Islam as the people of the book, to condemn this crime. "Of course the Islamic institutions, both Sunni and Shia, have condemned this crime and this is not sufficient. The whole Muslim world and also the people of the book should come out and condemn this act." He also lambasted the world bodies for keeping mum on this crime. "The world bodies that always make hue and cry over human rights should ask themselves why the paid mercenaries of the world arrogance have committed such a terrible crime," he added.
