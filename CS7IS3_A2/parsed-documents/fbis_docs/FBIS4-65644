I will try not to overlook any of them. A journalist friend says: We see that the issues cited in the package are not bound by a schedule. Does this not create the impression that the package is nothing but an intention? I cannot agree with this, because after a long study we analyzed about 60 laws, one by one. We agreed on the amendments that are necessary, starting from the Constitution. We are thinking of having these amendments passed in a very short time -- in fact, before the Assembly goes into recess. We are getting ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure that. Consequently, you can see that in the first stage, in their most basic lines, these issues have indeed been tied to a schedule. Second, we have determined the first 20 laws to be debated within this package. We did not name the date when the laws will be passed by the Assembly. We were not able to do that in the economic package either. As you see, the Assembly worked with great dedication and passed all the laws of the economic package. What is important is to start this working process. Sometimes, the Assembly needs more time to debate certain issues. Therefore, it is impossible to mortgage the behavior of the Assembly and tie it to a schedule. Our deputy friends worked with great dedication until late last night to pass all the laws to which we gave priority in the economic package. The important thing is to be determined and to convey to the Assembly the priority issues. The coalition government will stand behind these issues, and the True Path Party [TPP] and Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP] deputies will work on these issues with great enthusiasm. We have determined the priorities, we have shown our determination, and we will continue to do whatever we can in connection with the Assembly debates on the issues, just as we did in connection with the economic package. Another question asks if the issue of eight-year compulsory education was eliminated last night. No, we eliminated an article from the law, but the issue is not one of ending eight-year compulsory education. Our colleagues want us to debate the contents of the law. The TPP and SDPP deputies agree that there should be eight-year basic education. There is no question about that. They want us to study the legislation. That is what we will do. We have not given up on eight-year basic education. We consider it essential. Will this package mean that in the future fewer writers and journalists will be persecuted for expressing their views? Well, I would feel that whatever the laws have dictated in Turkey, we have adhered to them -- and we had to -- but the basic thing is to limit all those prohibitions and lift the various prohibitions that exist in the laws. If there is a law, you implement the law. So what you need to do is to change the law to change the implementation, and that is what we are after. At what stage, if any, will the coalition consider the idea of allowing Kurdish-language broadcasts and teaching in Kurdish? As I have specified in our democratization program, reform program, we are not going to segregate or separate any ethnic group. Whatever will be done needs to be done for the whole country and for all our citizens. We are not going to separate or segregate the Kurdish people, the people in my country of Kurdish-origin. The needed steps that will be taken in the future will be comprehensive. It will include all of my citizens and will not segregate a certain area geographically or a certain group. It will be for the whole country, for all the people. Another question is whether the state of emergency and the village guards system will be lifted, and if so, when. The state of emergency is in force because it is necessary. For it to be lifted, first the necessary conditions must be secured, security must be ensured, and the law on provincial administrations must be passed. We approach this process stage by stage. Conditions of security have emerged in the southeast and in our provinces in the east. The state and the regional people have become united. Our government is continuing to implement every necessary measure with determination to ensure that this goes on. Furthermore, the provincial administrations law is one of the first 20 laws to be debated. After the law is passed, it will be easier to lift the state of emergency. We will ensure that the necessary developments take place. Another question is whether we are considering turning the compulsory religion class in school into an elective course. The National Education Ministry will conduct a study on this issue. At the end of the study, the issue will be debated by the councils concerned and by our party assembly groups, and a conclusion will be reached. Before the study is completed, I cannot say that any decision has been reached. Another question asks if we are working on a second democratization package. Democratization is not a static matter; it is dynamic. It must continuously be changed and fed by the needs of the society. It is impossible for us to say that this is all there is to democracy in Turkey, that nothing else can be done, that nothing more or nothing less can be done, or that it is static. If there are any more needs in line with the development of the society and with the developments in general, then they will be discussed in line with the needs of the society. Today, that is what we foresee. [passage omitted] Another question says: The agreements you reached with Mr. Karayalcin are undone by certain other alliances. Are you aware of this, or do you not have any control over your party's assembly group? Let me say clearly that our friends in the TPP have been working very responsibly on all the issues we have announced, including the economic package and other matters. Naturally, a coalition means consensus, means conciliation. The two parties can have different views. We have had a very long series of conversations and dialogue to bring the two different views together. We will continue with this process. There is no other way, my honorable friends, because it was a coalition that emerged from this parliament. The coalition formed the 49th government and continues in the 50th government. We see that the consensus reached by this coalition is far more effective than the ones reached by previous coalitions. This coalition arrived at a variety of decisions. It made the most difficult decisions regarding the most difficult days of the government. It did so while meeting the needs of the economy on one hand and the democratization needs of the dynamic society on the other, while keeping everything under the umbrella of consensus. I am not saying that we think the same way on every issue or that we do not disagree on any matter. This has happened in the past and will happen in the future. We try to achieve consensus whenever there is no agreement. We start dialogues. You have seen this. This will continue to be the case. As far as I am concerned, we are providing a very good example of democracy. [passage omitted]
