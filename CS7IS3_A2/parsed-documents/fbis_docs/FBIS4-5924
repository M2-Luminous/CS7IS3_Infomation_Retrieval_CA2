FBIS4-5924 "dreas073_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 North Korea Activities Celebrate Kim Il-Song's Birthday Activities Celebrate Kim Il-Song's Birthday Tokyo TV Allowed To Cover Event OW1504021394 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1018 GMT 14 Apr 94 OW1504021394 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [Interview via telephone with Toshiro Kishi, NHK correspondent in Pyongyang, by NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata at the NHK studio in Tokyo -- live] [Text] [Kawabata] An event will be held in Pyongyang tomorrow marking the 82nd birthday of North Korean President Kim Il- song. North Korea has allowed a group of NHK correspondents and correspondents from an American television station to cover the event, issuing them visas. North Korea has permitted the NHK correspondents to cover the event for the first time in twenty months. Pyongyang has refused to permit foreign correspondents to cover activities in that country in the intervening time. North Korea's decision to permit foreign correspondents to cover the event amid mounting international tension following its refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency is drawing attention. I will interview NHK correspondent Yoshiro Kishi who is now in Pyongyang. Kishi, the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song will be celebrated tomorrow. What is Pyongyang like? [Kishi] It is fine in Pyongyang and the temperature is high. The streets are festooned with national flags and a variety of flowers to celebrate the North Korean leader's birthday. Tomorrow is a national holiday. I see many women carrying large shopping bags believed to contain food for picnics. There is a festive mood in Pyongyang. I anticipated military tension over the so-called nuclear issue before I arrived here, but see no signs of such tensions at all in Pyongyang. [Kawabata] Kishi, you visited Pyongyang two years ago. Have you found any changes this time? [Kishi] Yes. I visited Pyongyang to cover the 80th birthday of President Kim Il-song. At the time, a pompous event was held to celebrate his birthday. This time the event is likely to be relatively low key. [Kawabata] Kishi, North Korea has allowed NHK and American correspondents to cover the event. Why has North Korea decided to permit them to do so? (Kishi] To be honest, we were hard-pressed to obtain visas from North Korea. I heard that President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il made the final decision. Military tensions have been mounting on the Korean peninsula over the so-called nuclear issue ever since a solution through dialogue has been stalemated. The acceptance of NHK and American correspondents by the North Korea leaders is of great significance. I have felt North Korea's strong will to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. I will pay attention to how North Korean authorities will deal with our coverage activities. [Kawabata] Thank you very much.
