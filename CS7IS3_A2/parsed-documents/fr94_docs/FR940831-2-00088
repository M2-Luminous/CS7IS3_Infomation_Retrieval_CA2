FR940831-2-00088 FR940831-2-00067 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE [AAG/A Order No. 91&hyph;94] Privacy Act of 1974; Modified System of Records Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Office of the Deputy Attorney General proposes to modify the following system of records: Special Candidates for Presidential Appointments Records System, Justice/DAG&hyph;008 Specifically, the above system name, as it now appears in the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systems of records, is revised to read: Special Candidates for Presidential Appointments and Noncareer SES Positions Records System, Justice/DAG&hyph;008 In addition, a number of minor edits are made to the system of records to improve readability, to expand appointments covered by the system and to modify two existing routine uses. We have also added a ``Purpose'' statement to better inform the public regarding the nature of this system of records. The current notice indicates that the ``Categories of individuals covered by the system'' include individuals being considered for presidential appointments as ``heads of divisions or sections'' of the Department of Justice. The categories of individuals covered by the system have been modified to include deputy division heads and noncareer SES positions. The routine use permitting disclosure to the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), General Services Administration (GSA) for records management inspections has been modified. The routine use has been modified consistent with Public Law 98&hyph;497 (44 U.S.C. 2102) which renamed NARS as the ``National Archives and Records Administration'' (NARA), and established it as a separate agency which nevertheless would continue to share its records management inspection responsibilities with GSA. Accordingly, the routine use has been changed to show that NARA and GSA share responsibility for records management inspections conducted under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2904 and 2906. The routine use which permits disclosure for law enforcement purposes has been modified to indicate that the record must indicate a violation or a potential violation of law before it may be disclosed to law enforcement agencies. Comments may be addressed to Robert M. Zanger, Systems Policy Staff, Information Resources Management, Justice Management Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530 (room 850, WCTR Building). Please submit any comments by September 30, 1994. Dated: August 16, 1994. Stephen R. Colgate, Assistant Attorney General for Administration.
