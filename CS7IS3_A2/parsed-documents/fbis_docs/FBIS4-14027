This decision means continuing the siege of Libya, both people and state, for another four months, during which Libyan citizens will be paying the price for a crime they have not committed. Libya's children, including babies, will shoulder the burden of punishment for a crime on which no sentence has yet been issued. At the same time, the siege of Iraq continues. It is the siege of the people and state and not the siege of Saddam Husayn alone or his regime. The long-range monitoring is continuing and its purpose is to prevent the Iraqi people from benefiting from their resources and wealth. It is regrettable that international resolutions are issued one after the other against Libya and Iraq amid Arab silence at the best of times and even with an Arab welcome and blessing. While this silence by any other Arab country can be excused, we cannot excuse the silence of Egypt, the citadel of Arabism, the pillar of the Arab movement, and the country that represents the fundamental basis of every correct Arab policy. Also, lifting the siege from Libya and Iraq serves -- in the present circumstances -- a purely Egyptian interest. It is enough to mention that there are thousands of Egyptians working in these two fraternal countries and both countries can absorb more when the situation stabilizes and improves. We do not deny that there is Egyptian action toward lifting the siege. But we believe that, in view of its role, Egypt can act more strongly in this direction. The Arab League secretary general can also support and back this action. Conditions are possibly appropriate today for the Arab League head to call for an Arab summit, not to affect a reconciliation, to "kiss and make up," or to "forget the past," but to stop the deterioration in Arab relations, to save the fraternal peoples in Libya and Iraq, and to draw up a plan for lifting the siege imposed on them. At the same time, all the Egyptian forces, parties, and establishments, both the ruling and opposition ones, can today start an Arab campaign to save the Iraqi and Libyan peoples. The quicker this action is, the better it will be; otherwise, we will all pay the price in the form of more differences, divisions, and weakness in this era of the siege of the Arabs.
