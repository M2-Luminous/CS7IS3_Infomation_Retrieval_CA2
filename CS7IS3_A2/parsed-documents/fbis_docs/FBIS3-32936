When we compare this percentage to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product over the last five years, which was a negative 28.3 percent, we reach the conclusion that there is not enough output to feed these new mouths: there is more poverty, fewer businesses, and consequently fewer jobs. In this regard, in an interview with EL COMERCIO the president of the National Industries Association, Ricardo Marquez Flores, calls for a series of measures to improve standards for the population by creating jobs and bettering living conditions. The following is a summary of the interview: [EL COMERCIO] Mr. Marquez, how do we create more jobs? [Marquez] The National Industries Association is working on proposals to create new jobs in the country. We have seen that our industrial plants are operating at just slightly over half their capacity. So, one way to create jobs in Peru is to export and to continue promoting the programs for one million shoes, one million jogging suits, and the desks program. This will unquestionably further the development of microbusiness, which will create thousands and thousands of jobs, often involving entire families. Subcontracting is another way to create jobs. [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed any ways of cutting costs in industry? [Marquez] Studies conducted by the SNI indicate two ways to cut costs. Techniques of total quality control, timely delivery, and business re-engineering involve companies proper. In addition, though, costs can be reduced by reducing the cost of port operations and others, and this is something that is now starting to be felt. But when we talk about cutting costs, we are also talking about fiscal overpayments, antitechnology taxes, and ways of making tax reimbursements simple, timely, and transparent. [EL COMERCIO] Could you tell us about some alternatives to what you call the antitechnology taxes? [Marquez] In connection with the minimum income tax, we are proposing, to the extent that this tax is temporary, a tax credit equivalent to the difference between the 2 percent tax on the value of the net assets paid out by companies the year before and 30 percent of profits that year. [EL COMERCIO] What would the credit be used for? [Marquez] The credit would be used to pay the tax in the current year, and whatever balance there is would go to pay the income tax or other taxes that furnish revenue to the Treasury. [EL COMERCIO] As for negotiable credit memorandums, we know that $360 million has been returned in general sales taxes. Does this help you in any way? [Marquez] Although it is true that $360 million in general sales taxes has been returned this year, the new arrangement of negotiable credit memorandums would complicate the return of the tax. In spite of the two changes that have been made, we still feel that a third is needed to make them viable. It is becoming harder and harder every day to obtain credit, not only for small and midsized business but for big business as well. This mechanism makes financing exports more expensive, because no exporter buys raw materials for just one month's shipments. [EL COMERCIO] What proposals have you looked into for this tax? [Marquez] We ought to amend the system set up by Article 3 of Decree Law 25748. We should also extend the life of the system of documents with cancellation power (Legislative Decree 190) and make it applicable to the entire export sector. While continuing to cut costs at the denominator without emphasizing a higher exchange rate, inasmuch as this would alter the entire economic program, we believe that the tax credit for the selective consumers tax on oil purchases ought to be regulated. [EL COMERCIO] Does the industrial union that you head agree with the current economic program? [Marquez] We realize that the economic program has to maintain the iron discipline of expanding the tax base. [EL COMERCIO] Have you proposed alternatives for expanding the tax base? [Marquez] Individuals should be allowed to deduct from their income tax the general sales tax they pay when making a purchase. Businesses can check the invoices and the RUC [Single Taxpayer Registry]. Lowering the selective consumers tax on whiskey and cigarettes has raised revenues from $12,000 to $220,000 a month. Therefore, we think that if the simplified system is cut from 5 to 2 percent, it would further formalize the economy. If we review the numbers under this simplified system, we will see that they are not significant today, because of the standard system. We ought to go back to the Receipts Lottery, but with greater incentives to bring more people in. SUNAT [National Tax Administration Superintendency] has increased the tax burden from 4.5 to 10 percent of the GDP. Today we have 9,000 main taxpayers, and there are 852,000 registered in the RUC, but we need to have SUNAT and Customs conducting investigations and cracking down on smuggling and undervaluation. [EL COMERCIO] What is the commercial outlook in 1994 for the industrial union that you head? [Marquez] We hope that exports expand by much more than the 4 percent a year that is anticipated. Peru needs to increase its exports by at least 10 percent a year as of 1994.
