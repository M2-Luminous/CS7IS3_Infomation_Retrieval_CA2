He said that the parliamentary minority fails to oppose a policy conducted by the Georgian head of state. He referred to the parliamentary majority as a society of deaf- mutes. In Boris Kakubava's opinion, Georgia will not be able to get back its lost territories while Eduard Shevardnadze is the head of state. He has demanded that Eduard Shevardnadze resign voluntarily. According to Boris Kakubava, the Union of Georgia's Citizens is trying to mislead and deceive the Georgian people. The Georgian authorities have used 26 May, Georgia's Independence Day, to demonstrate the strength of Russian troops in Georgia. In Boris Kakubava's words: "We will not allow anyone to overthrow the present authorities by force. If we are together, we will survive. If we stay apart, we will be destroyed one by one."
