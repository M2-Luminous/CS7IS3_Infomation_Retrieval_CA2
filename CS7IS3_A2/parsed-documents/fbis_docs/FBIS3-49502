FBIS3-49502 "dreeu007__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-007-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Former Official Repeats Claim AU1001212894 Prague CTK in English 1928 GMT 10 Jan 94 AU1001212894 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Jaroslav Basta told CTK today he stuck by claim that the former Czechoslovak counter-intelligence agency had tried to discredit Bill Clinton during the 1992 presidential campaign, in which he ran as a rival to incumbent President George Bush. Basta, deputy chairman of the Federal Security and Information Service (FBIS) [FSIS] in 1990-91, was reacting to a statement made today by Stanislav Devaty, current Security and Information Service (BIS) director and FBIS deputy director until December 1992. In an interview with CTK Devaty dismissed allegations that the FBIS had actively worked against Clinton as "not based on fact." Basta told CTK he had much evidence to support his claim that the FBIS wanted to discredit Clinton by publishing information about his contacts with the family of Marie Svermova in January 1970, when he visited Prague as a student. Svermova, who died in 1992, was the widow of Jan Sverma, a communist and journalist who died during the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising in 1944. Svermova, expelled from the Communist Party in 1951, was a protagonist of the "Prague Spring" reform movement in 1968 and one of the first signatories of the Charter 77 human rights statement. Basta recalled an article published by the former daily METROPOLITNI TELEGRAF on November 3, 1992, whose author, Lubor Kohout, a former agent of the post-November 1989 secret service, wrote that Svermova's relatives, who hosted Clinton in Prague in 1970, collaborated at the end of the 1940s and at the beginning of the 1950s with the Czechoslovak secret services. "To retrieve this classified data from military counter-intelligence files more than 40 years old required expert team work. This could not be done by journalists, but exclusively by the counter-intelligence," Basta told CTK. He also pointed out Kohout's article carried by the Czech right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK today devoted to a member of Bush's former campaign staff. The article's authors were interested in contacts between his staff and the Czechoslovak secret service during the American election campaign. In this connection Basta ruled out the possibility that U.S. authorities would have requested the FBIS to provide any information. "Americans would never do anything like this," Basta stressed.
