FR940630-0-00007 FR940630-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;13&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8953; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;01] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With General Electric CF6&hyph;80A or Pratt and Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. This amendment is prompted by reports of piston seal leakage found during actuator overhaul on certain Model 767 series airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective August 1, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Simonson, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;140S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2683; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12207). That action proposed to require replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the two comments received. Both commenters support the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 119 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 69 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 32 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with General Electric CF6&hyph;80A engines is estimated to be $121,440, or $1,760 per airplane. There are approximately 95 Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 30 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators of Model 767 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D&hyph;7R4 engines is estimated to be $49,500, or $1,650 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $170,940. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
