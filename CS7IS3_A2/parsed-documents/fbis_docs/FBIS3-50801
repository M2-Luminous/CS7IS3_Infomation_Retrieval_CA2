Goulding continued the process that began Friday during which both delegations are meeting separately with UN officials, including mediator Jean Arnault. The secrecy surrounding the topics discussed and whether a consensus has been reached was maintained again today. Guerrilla Commander Pablo Monsanto, however, said that "the meeting is taking place under positive terms" and thus did not rule out the possibility of reaching an agreement if the current pace continues. Goulding's unexpected arrival has caused observers to believe that an agreement could be reached on Sunday, when the current round of talks is scheduled to end. The topics discussed include human rights, the situation of Conciliator Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada, whose mediation the government no longer recognizes, and the participation of civilian society in the solution of the conflict. Meanwhile, leaders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity rejected accusations by the Army that the URNG is linked to the guerrilla uprising in the Mexico's Chiapas State.
