As has been reported, a Russian train with 26 military armored vehicles aboard crossed the territory of Lithuania last weekend without informing the border guards in advance. The vehicles were accompanied by armed Russian servicemen who did not have the obligatory permission from the Lithuanian Ministry of Interior Affairs to transport weapons. Minister Povilas Gylys voiced his concern to the Russian ambassador concerning the incident and asked Russia to observe the transit regulations in future. Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska told the Baltic News Service correspondent that similar incidents could have a negative impact on the possibility of signing an agreement with Russia on its military transit through Lithuania. Events like this do not prove that Russia would observe the agreement, he said.
