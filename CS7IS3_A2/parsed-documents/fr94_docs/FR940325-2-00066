FR940325-2-00066 FR940325-2-00038 Attachment 2 [GSA Bulletin FTR 13] March 17, 1994. To: Heads of Federal agencies Subject: Reimbursement of higher actual subsistence expenses for travel to Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin 1. Purpose. This bulletin informs agencies of the establishment of a special actual subsistence expense ceiling for official travel to Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin, due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Experimental Aircraft Association Convention and Show held there. This special rate applies to claims for reimbursement covering travel during the period July 28, 1994, through August 3, 1994. 2. Background. The Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR chapters 301&hyph;304) part 301&hyph;8 permits the Administrator of General Services to establish a higher maximum daily rate for the reimbursement of actual subsistence expenses of Federal employees on official travel to an area within the continental United States. The head of an agency may request establishment of such a rate when special or unusual circumstances result in an extreme increase in subsistence costs for a temporary period. The Secretary of Transportation (DOT) requested establishment of such a rate for Oshkosh to accommodate employees who perform temporary duty there and experience a temporary but significant increase in lodging costs due to the escalation of lodging rates during the annual Experimental Aircraft Association Convention and Show. These circumstances justify the need for higher subsistence expense reimbursement in Oshkosh during the designated period. 3. Maximum rate and effective date. The Administrator of General Services, pursuant to 41 CFR 301&hyph;8.3(c), has increased the maximum daily amount of reimbursement that may be approved for actual and necessary subsistence expenses for official travel to Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin for travel during the period July 28, 1994, through August 3, 1994. Agencies may approve actual subsistence expense reimbursement not to exceed $149.00 ($119.00 maximum for lodging and a $30.00 allowance for meals and incidental expenses) for travel to Oshkosh (Winnebago County), Wisconsin, during this time period. 4. Expiration date. This bulletin expires on September 30, 1994. 5. For further information contact Jane E. Groat, General Services Administration, Transportation Management Division (FBX), Washington, DC 20406, telephone 703&hyph;305&hyph;5745. By delegation of the Commissioner, Federal Supply Service. Allan W. Beres, Assistant Commissioner, Transportation and Property Management. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7053 Filed 3&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;24&hyph;M
