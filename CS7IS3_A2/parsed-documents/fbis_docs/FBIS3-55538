Election Race Intrigue. Important for Victors and Vanquished To Understand Its Implications. Particularly Those for Whom Spring Holds an Election Campaign"] [Text] The main sensation in the recent elections is deemed to be the success of Zhirinovskiy's party, something that came as a surprise to many people. Lively discussion of the political, social, psychological, and even psychiatric reasons for and possible consequences of the resultant apportionment of votes is continuing. Many articles mention in passing the special features of a particular bloc's propaganda campaign. This is generally said to be a secondary factor with no decisive effect on the election results. That is true to some extent, but nonetheless for the main participants in the election race, had they taken a different approach to the election campaign, the results could have been appreciably different from those we have now. There is no point in analyzing the features of the election campaign conducted by all 13 movements, parties, and blocs. The overwhelming majority of these campaigns' organizers displayed professional feebleness. The results generally reflect not only the political amorphousness and featurelessness of these formations, but also their leaders' inability to competently plan and organize what Americans call the election race. The fact that V.V. Zhirinovskiy conducted his campaign the most professionally played an important role in his success. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] had strict targets for his propaganda. He was perfectly well aware on whom he could rely, clearly understood what worries his future voters, and deliberately put forward arguments that were understandable and appealing to the dregs of society [lyumpeny] (with or without a higher education) who form the backbone of his electorate. Efficient orchestration of the campaign played a considerable role. Each of Vladimir Volfovich's speeches was devoted to a single issue alone. This enabled him to outline in a thorough and at the same time very specific manner ways of resolving all the problems that really worry people. The choice of topics for the speeches created a certain amount of intrigue and ensured the momentum of the campaign. Anyone who started listening to Zhirinovskiy's passionate monologues could not wait for the followup, particularly when the subject of the next speech was not announced in advance. The propaganda campaign followed a rising curve, and, evidently, all its reserves were not depleted. The LDPR leader, with his inherent modesty, said after the elections that had the campaign lasted another 10 days he would have gotten 70 percent of the vote. Needless to say, that is an exaggeration, but other opportunities for the LDPR to enlarge its electorate did exist. The point is that Zhirinovskiy very skillfully and purposefully drew broader and broader population groups into his orbit. It is not after all only among hoboes that you find people who like simple solutions to complex problems. All these and many other means of conducting political (primarily election) campaigns are well known to campaign specialists and political managers, of which there are fairly large numbers in countries with a developed democracy, but which still have virtually no representation in our country taking its first steps down the road to democratization. Zhirinovskiy's advisers may not be very experienced managers. Otherwise it is difficult to account for the occasions which deflated his campaign. Video clips, inevitably prepared by other people, often strayed from the general strategy, proved protracted, and detracted from the exuberant, energetic rhythm of the campaign. Appearances on air by members of the leader's entourage were even worse -- their image was in sharp contrast with that of Zhirinovskiy himself and would have been more suitable for featureless political groups incapable of making any impression on the voters. Zhirinovskiy's irresponsibility and happy-go-lucky style that were pointed out by all his critics may quite well have been just a skillful election ploy. The nature of the LDPR leader's behavior will almost certainly change after the elections, and the stunned country will see a fairly respectable, restrained legislator who has forgotten most of his fantastic election outbursts and, bit by bit, is assembling the political baggage for his next electoral surge. The voters who have come to love this understandable, accessible politician will willingly forgive him certain departures from election promises in the realization that this is the cost of the struggle and circumstances sometimes make it necessary to switch to gradual actions. The election campaign of the "Russia's Choice" bloc was conducted at a far lower professional level. One of the main principles necessary for success seems to have been infringed. In planning the bloc's campaign its organizers were unable to work out a fundamental strategy that should have laid down all the tactical methods and been the cornerstone of all campaign events. The bloc's leading politicians made vigorous use of something which was not available to virtually all their adversaries, to wit -- their not inconsiderable experience of implementing the reforms and the government's definite achievements. This strong argument could have been the basis of their strategy, but in order for that to be so it should have been exploited consistently throughout the campaign. Generally speaking the campaign propaganda material was glaringly at variance with this fundamental idea. The exception being only the brilliant monologues by E. Pamfilova, the speeches by A. Chubays at the end of the campaign, and also certain (by no means all!) recordings of Ye. Gaydar's speeches. Viewers were most often shown a lyrical video clip with a cute kid and an appealing hound that had no connection with the presumed strategy. The election campaign lacked purpose, integrity, and a single ideological core. Virtually all the pieces were good in themselves, but put together the entire thing lacked punch. Nor did any of the "Russia's Choice" posters, without exception, in the slightest degree accord with any unified strategic line. Elegant views accompanied by the bloc's emblem were as feeble in backing up its leaders' arguments as pop concerts against the backdrop of the selfsame emblem. The only poster which in some way accorded with the main idea was executed extremely badly. It carried a picture of Ye.T. Gaydar in a somewhat affected pose, and the text could equally have been interpreted both for and against the bloc. You get the impression that the bloc campaign organizers did not entirely know whom they were addressing. The bloc's staunch supporters and adversaries did not need this kind of campaigning, while for the waverers totally different approaches were needed. There is reason to think that a considerable proportion of the supporters of democratic reforms, lulled by the cheery forecasts of an inevitable victory for "Russia's Choice," did not turn out to vote. That is the direct result of the campaign organizers' basic incompetence. Any professional manager knows that during the last few days before an election the main effort should be focused on persuading your supporters to turn out without fail. At some point, roughly a week before the election, the LDPR's growing superiority began to emerge clearly. An emergency adjustment to strategy was needed. One main adversary had emerged from among the 12. Had the main attack been focused in that direction, the gap could have been closed and some of the waverers -- those at least who, having voted for Zhirinovskiy, have now been frightened by the results -- drawn away from the LDPR. Many people would have changed their decision had everything now being said about Zhirinovskiy been said then in a fairly cogent and serious way -- during the last few days before the election. There was no sign of any effort to do this. The results indicate that inadequate use of the factor of the real fascist danger was also made during the formation of the coalition of democratic forces. For all their uncompromising arrogance, all the democratic blocs are now resolutely dissociating themselves from the LDPR. Consequently, attempts to pool efforts should have been more persistent prior to the election rather than now when little can be changed. It is easy to work out how many Duma seats the democrats lost owing to their disunity if you examine the election results in single-seat districts. As far as I know, in one of these districts alone -- namely Universitetskiy District No. 201 -- a serious attempt was made to avoid splitting the democrat vote. A primary election procedure was formulated here and coordinated with local democratic organizations, making it possible to select a single candidate from democratic associations and focus all efforts on supporting him. This was the first time such primary elections have been held in Russia. They were a success and attracted a large turnout. An experienced political manager from the United States, who was present during the primary elections as an observer, voiced a high opinion of their procedure and organization. It is deeply regrettable that the republic leaders of all democratic associations without exception did not back this initiative. The upshot was that candidates from all three democratic blocs vied with one another and an independent candidate, who was seeking election with the help of simple forgery, was close to success. Fortunately everything turned out OK and the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms candidate was elected, but in many districts the fragmented democrats helped their opponents win. It should be emphasized that under these conditions it was impossible to qualitatively affect the course of the campaign and radically alter the result thereof during the voting on federal lists. Underlying social and political factors played a decisive role, but the quantitative indicators could have been different. After all, we now calculate in hundredths of a percent. So, what is to be done? The two years' lifespan allotted for the new parliament is a short period. Serious politicians, above all reformers from "Russia's Choice," must learn from their defeat. As well as carrying out an in-depth analysis of the reasons for this defeat they must immediately start preparing for the next elections. To this end they must, in particular, begin the immediate professional training of party organizers capable of competently planning and conducting a national or regional campaign. It is also necessary urgently to organize the training of professional political managers capable of conducting local campaigns on the instructions of party organizers or individual candidates, primarily in single-seat districts. Methodological material must be based on two sources: on our already fairly extensive experience and on foreign experience adapted to fit Russian conditions. No one could have expected our country to move smoothly and triumphally to a democratic way of life. There will be more victories and defeats on this difficult road. We must draw the correct conclusions from the palpable defeat suffered by the reformers 12 December and start working intensively. That is the guarantee of future success!
