The election campaign rally of the right-wing extremist party, which was accompanied by massive protest campaigns, was concluded at noon after about two hours. Police temporarily arrested about 60 persons, who are supposed to be released in the course of the day after their identity has been checked. About 200 demonstrators against the Republikaner formed a demonstration column through Nuremberg's inner city after the Republikaner rally. As a result of the superiority, in terms of numbers, of the counter-demonstrators, the party's speakers could hardly be heard. However, according to policy, nothing happened apart from the throwing of a few eggs. The rally, which had been banned by the city of Nuremberg by referring to potential riots was permitted by the Bavarian Administrative Court on Friday after all. Before the rally almost 40 organizations had announced that they would stage protests and interference.
