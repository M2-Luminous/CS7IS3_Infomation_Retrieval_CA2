Hruzdeyev, administrative head, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, by B. Polishchuk, correspondent: "Let's Honor and Respect Spring Wheat"] [Text] [Polishchuk] Have the predictions regarding the need to resow winter wheat over considerable areas been confirmed? [Hruzdyevev] Yes, they have. We must resow winter wheat on 2,300,000 hectares and perform supplementary sowing on 339,000 hectares. That represents one-third of the areas involved. [Polishchuk] And how does that compare with last year? [Hruzdeyev] Twice as many tracts were dropped as occurred last. This is particularly true in Nikolayev, Odessa, and Kherson oblasts, where 45-63 percent of the appropriate areas must be resown in winter wheat. At many sites it did not sprout during the autumn because of the drought, or it was damaged by frosts, as was also the case in the Sumy, Poltava, Zaporozhye, Kharkov, Donets, and Crimean regions. [Polishchuk] With what crops do you plan to resow? [Hruzdeyev] Basically with barley, oats, peas, corn, millet, rye, and sorghum. Such operations are already widely underway in the southern oblasts. [Polishchuk] Viktor Hryhorovych, at the very beginning of spring last year our newspaper brought up the matter of the underestimation for extreme situations of spring wheat as an insurance crop. It was a matter of expanding the areas to be sown in that crop in a year of mass resowings so as to compensate in case there was a shortage of grain for making bread and pasta-type products. Was there some movement in this regard? [Hruzdeyev] There was. This past year more than 22,000 hectares were sown in spring wheat. [Polishchuk] This year--as they say--even God has commanded that the grain reserves be filled to overflowing. [Hruzdeyev] Yes. There is a clearly manifested tendency to expand the area sown in spring wheat. Whereas formerly there were some farmers who were quite dissatisfied with its varieties because of a low crop yield, nowadays there are several varieties of spring wheat which have a high yield. Among these are, for example, Kharkov-15, Kharkov-16, Kharkov-37, and a number of others. In testing fields they have produced 45-50 quintals of grain per hectare. [Polishchuk] Does Ukraine have a large enough supply of spring wheat seeds for the present sowing? [Hruzdeyev] There are enough seeds to sow this crop over a larger area than last year. They are kept principally in state reserves and in the system of seed farms under the Institute of Vegetation, Plant Breeding, and Genetics imeni V. Yuryev, which is located in Kharkov. A certain quantity of such seeds could be made available subsequently by the Ukrayina Experimental Farm, which is located in the Myronivskyy Rayon in the Kiev Region. Its farms, which were already engaged in studying spring wheat last year, now have these seeds. It's important to bear in mind that the value of spring wheat consists not merely in filling up the grain reserves when and if there is a reduction in the area sown in winter wheat. At present spring wheat seeds are also valuable--so to speak--as a kind of national currency. At one time Ukraine's services, in particular, those of the Kharkov plant-breeders, were utilized to good advantage by entire regions of the former Soviet Union. With the latter's disintegration, the demand for spring wheat seeds at first declined, but now it is abruptly increasing. There are many requests from the near abroad. If we had enough of these seeds, we would not have to beg for fuel. We could exchange one commodity for the other. [Polishchuk] And so we ought to apologize to spring wheat and accord it the honor and respect that it has come to deserve. Is that what you mean? [Hruzdeyev] I certainly do. We have to calculate everything and not give in to extremes. If we do, the mistakes we make could take years to overcome.
