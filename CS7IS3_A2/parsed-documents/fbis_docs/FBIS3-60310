Meanwhile, other dramatic events have shaken the world, and the international community has forgotten the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Ukraine has been left almost alone with its post- Chernobyl problems, which, despite all the forecasts, do not disappear, but grow in numbers. It is not possible to cope with the scope of tasks without help. The Supreme Council Committee for Issues of the Chernobyl Aftermath has held a press conference for Ukrainian and foreign journalists devoted to these problems. A new problem has appeared, in addition to the old ones, reported Professor Kopeykin, who has been working in Chernobyl since the first days of the disaster, often without any remuneration. All forecasts on the disintegration of radioactive fall-out were too optimistic. Nobody was anticipating that disintegrated plutonium would appear, but the professor found it in the vicinity of the "red forest" in 1989. Dangerous derivatives of plutonium decay were discovered -- americium and curium. The issue of including americium in the legislation concerning Chernobyl aftereffects is currently on the agenda. Due to americium's inclination to migrate, the resettlement zone may be expanded. After all, no one knows where will the winds blow from... Additionally, another issue seems very strange: Why are we calling on the international community to cooperate in liquidating the aftereffects of the disaster, while simultaneously adopting a resolution on continued operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant? Will the radioactive threat be more compelling this way? There is already enough evidence -- strontium can be found near Turkey and Italy, not mentioning CIS countries. It is quite understandable why the Belarusian legislature issued a statement objecting to the resolution. The entire world, not only our neighbors, has criticized our position on this issue... Explanations such us "if we stop the Chernobyl plant, we will freeze in the winter" are naive. As Volodymyr Usatenko, head of the Committee for Scientific, Social, and Legal Issues, emphasized, power units at the Chernobyl power plant, which are using 70 percent of their capabilities due to various malfunctions, are not even able to provide heat for the northern part of Kiev Oblast. To purchase five-year supplies of fuel for the plant, Ukraine needs 350 billion rubles, and it simply does not have such money... Last year, pointed out Deputy Attorney General Olha Kolinko, no official of the five ministries that are responsible for liquidating Chernobyl aftereffects visited the troubled zone, which is becoming a zone of crime.
