ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends the EPA Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR) coverage on organizational conflicts of interest for all EPA contracts. In addition, it adds EPAAR coverage on conflicts of interest related to contractor personnel working under EPA Superfund contracts and conflicts of interest related to contractors' future work which may jeopardize Superfund work. Under this rule, contracts funded through EPA's Superfund program will contain clauses: requiring contractor employees working on EPA Superfund contracts to sign confidentiality agreements; requiring a contractor to notify the Agency immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel working on the EPA contract; and restricting a contractor's future contracts, outside of those with EPA, when such contracts may conflict with the work performed for EPA. These changes are necessary to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest in work performed under EPA Superfund contracts. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective May 19, 1994.
