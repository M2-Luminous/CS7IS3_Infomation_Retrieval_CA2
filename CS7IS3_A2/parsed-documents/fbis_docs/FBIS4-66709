India has cautioned the U.N. Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] about the threats posed to sovereign states by across-the-border sponsorship of terrorism and urged the global community to take necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, reports PTI. "The need is to take cognisance of the urgency before it is too late. And to ensure that this recognition is made actionable without any delay," the Indian delegation has told the session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. Sharing with international community India's experience of the phenomenon of terrorism "which today looms as a spectre over the world and in its various forms and manifestations has come to signify a pervasive and organised threat to human rights in their widest form," Mr. Madhukar Gupta of the Indian delegation told the commission that "terrorism is now getting support from across international orders." Mr. Gupta asked: "Is the international community going to continue to look on as a mute spectator, even as human rights slogans and fora are being used to cover the sponsorship and practices of terrorism?" He said terrorism as witnessed in India was also a direct attempt to destroy the very structures and institutions of democracy, which alone provides the surest basis and foundation for civil society and the protection of human rights." Mr. Gupta said "we have witnessed direct and targetted attacks on a massive scale on politicians, the judiciary, the press and government officials." "These are the fundamental institutions of governance and the pillars of democracy. If these were to be destroyed, we could only have a situation where the law of the jungle would replace the rule of the law, where propaganda and disinformation on which terrorism thrives, would replace legitimate expression by the people through representative institutions and the media, and mechanisms for grievance redressal would become dependent upon the whims of those who promulgate dictats". He said terrorism is also being used for the blatant spread of fundamentalism and creation of social and religious cleavages and divides in countries and societies. This has resulted in examples of "ethnic cleansing" and large-scale displacement of people in Jammu and Kashmir [J&K]. "We have witnessed efforts to change the very demographic profile of one particular part of the state -- Kashmir valley." "Targetted and brutal attacks on members of minority community there have forced a massive exodus of thousands of people from their homes. All this has been accompanied by blatant attempts to whip up religious emotions and frenzy and to distort and radicalise religion, which has been resulted in the destruction of hundreds of schools providing modern, secular education, thus jeopardising the future of hundreds of thousands of children," Mr. Gupta said. Addressing the session, Dr. Shakti Bhan, a member of the delegation of All-India Women's Conference, apprised the international community of the plight of the minority community in Jammu and Kashmir. Dr. Bhan, a leader of the women's wing of Panun Kashmir, said "we are fighting a battle for freedom from terror, freedom from religious bigotry and fundamentalism which Pakistan is seeking to impose upon us, freedom from hatred and prejudice, and freedom from the fear of the gun which Pakistan is seeking to spread in our area." She said "we want our thousands of years old culture of human unity and dignity back from the clutches of those who want to enslave us and are trying to hold us in terror." Dr. Bhan urged the international community to "help us in this endeavour by pressurising Pakistan to stop proliferating terrorism, for on this depends the return of peace to our troubled paradise." Meanwhile, some pro-Pakistan non-governmental organisations (NGO) have stepped up India-baiting by raising the bogey of rights violations in Kashmir, as it became clear today that Islamabad may go ahead with its resolution on Jammu and Kashmir at the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) session here. Spearheading the tirade on Kashmir was the International Educational Development (IED), a U.S. based NGO known for its pro-Pakistan stance. The IED delegation raised the question of right of self-determination for the people of Kashmir.
