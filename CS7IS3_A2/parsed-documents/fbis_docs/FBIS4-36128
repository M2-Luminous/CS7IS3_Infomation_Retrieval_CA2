Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Nasr Yusuf also ordered to shut down the mosques after the last daily prayer, which usually ends at 2100. He also warned the imams against nonreligious activity in the mosques. The Islamic movement in the Gaza Strip has expressed opposition to and anger over Yusuf's directives and over the fact that the Palestinian police is hampering its activity. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 6 June adds: "Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police in Gaza, has been removed from his position as the Palestinian national security commander [as heard], apparently against the background of the sharp verbal clashes between him and Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement). He will be replaced by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Majayirah, who headed the Palestinian delegation for security talks with Israel. Recently there have been sharp clashes between Nasr Yusuf and extremist Muslims in Gaza against the background of Yusuf's demand to disarm Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, and also in the wake of the incarceration of Hani al-'Abd, an Islamic Jihad activist. This is reported by our Arab Affairs correspondent Oren Kohen."]
