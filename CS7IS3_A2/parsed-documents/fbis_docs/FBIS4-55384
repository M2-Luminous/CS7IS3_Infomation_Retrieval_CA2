The pact of European stability and security, based on a plan of French Premier Edouard Balladur and approved by the European Union (EU), counts on the participation of the EU "Twelve", the USA and Canada. The pact's main goal is to preventively settle problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former post-communist countries. Kukan confirmed that Slovak diplomacy "has hardened its position" and wanted to push through the inclusion of Slovak interests into the pact. Slovakia's main reservation concerns the provision that Slovakia and Hungary should settle mutual problems with EU assistance. "We do not want anybody third to dictate to us what to do about our bilateral relations. The pact clearly says that the agreement is to be concluded under EU sponsorship, and sets a concrete date. This would mean that we (Slovakia and Hungary) cannot negotiate on a bilateral level, but must ask a third side. We do not like this and want to change it," Kukan said. He added Slovakia was willing to accept a more compromising wording of the relevant document. Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik, who is to leave for a visit to France on Monday [16 May], is expected to hold talks on the pact. Kukan said he would like Slovak diplomats to push through an acceptable wording of the document before Moravcik's visit. Asked if Slovak representatives would attend a Paris conference on the project to be held later in May, Kukan said: "If the pact does not fully correspond to our interests, we will consider on which level we will take part in it."
