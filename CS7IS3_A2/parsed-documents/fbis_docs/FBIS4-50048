In China the poverty line means that people have an annual income of less than 200 yuan per capita and less than 200 kg of grain a year. A provincial official in charge of the aid-the-poor project said that Shandong has made progress in this field over the past decade and the number of poor people has dropped to four million at present. These people are mainly distributed in remote mountainous, beach and lake areas with adverse production and living conditions. According to the plan, the governor will be in charge of the overall work, while local officials' promotion will be linked to the project. While allocating more funds, the province will speed up the construction of infrastructure facilities in rural areas to ensure that every village is linked with roads, and supplied with electricity and fresh water. It will also popularize education and science, and launch publicity about personal hygiene and environmental sanitation in rural areas.
