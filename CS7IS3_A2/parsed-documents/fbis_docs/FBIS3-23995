Gnatkov, candidate in Technical Sciences (Soyuzmorniiproyekt): "The Development of USSR Seaports in 1981-1990"] [Text] It is no secret that a serious situation has formed in Russian ports today -- they are choking, failing to cope with the influx of cargo, particularly foreign trade cargo, which is processed only at 11 harbors. At the same time, the related enterprises of the former USSR republics are experiencing a shortage of freight flow, since the Russian commodity producers, because of the customs barriers and the high fees for transit through the territory of the Baltic countries and Ukraine, do not want to have anything to do with them, and are trying to ship or import the necessary products exclusively through Russian ports. In order to evaluate our overall losses, it will be of interest to become familiar with the development of the seaports of the former Soviet Union in the decade preceding the country's breakup. The national economy's growing need for marine cargo transport in 1981-1990 foreordained an increase in the throughput capacities of the seaports, both through building new ports and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing ones. In this case, some berths were adapted for intensive processing of large ships of new types. Transshipment of dry cargo was mainly provided by 35 seaports, particularly the ports of Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, Leningrad, Riga, Klaypeda, Novotallinn, Odessa, Ilichevsk, Yuzhnyy, Mariupol, Nikolayev, Novorossiysk, Izmail, Reni, Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Vostochnyy, Vanino, Kholm, Baku and Krasnovodsk. The length of the mooring front for dry cargo transshipping was increased by 15.5 percent, and the throughput capacity -- by 27.7 percent. A large amount of the bulk cargo was processed at eight ports, mainly at Ventspils, Novorossiysk, Odessa, Tuapse, Aktau and Nakhodka. The throughput capacities of their oil regions fully provided the existing cargo turnover with oil products, although the berth structures of the Port of Odessa's oil harbor needed rebuilding to take tankers with a deadweight of 50,000-60,000 tonnes, and the approach channel of the Port of Ventspils had to be deepened for the passage of tankers and combined ships with a deadweight of about 100,000 tonnes. The throughput capacity of the bulk cargo berths was increased by 45 percent, with only a 14 percent increase in the number of berths. In addition, they succeeded in partially eliminating the disproportion between the sizes of the ships and the depths in the ports. For example, the number of berths with a depth of 9.75-11.5 m attained 25 percent of the total number, but those with depths of over 11.5 m -- only a little over 6 percent, which was clearly inadequate. A large number of the berths (44 percent) have depths up to 8.25 m, and several of them need rebuilding. Transshipping complexes were developed both through creating new ones and rebuilding and re-equipping the existing material-technical base of the ports. As a result, the throughput capacity of commercial seaports rose by 15-16 million tonnes. The main direction in improving their activity was intensification of the loading-unloading operations, through improving the technology and organization of complete service of the fleet in the ports. Despite the widescale distribution of container transport of crated and piece goods, a tremendous products list of general cargo remains which is not subject to containerization. To increase the volume of its transshipment, methods of packaging, the use of roll-trailers and complexes with a computer-controlled system of belt conveyors and many others have been developed. Along with modernizing the transshipping units at seaports, it is very important, for increased efficiency of fleet operation, to improve its service -- supplying bunker fuel, water, foodstuffs, etc. -- for maximum reduction of ship idle times, above and beyond the cargo operations. Specializing the maritime transport fleet according to the nature of cargo being transported and type of transport packaging, combined with increasing the intensiveness of loading-unloading operations, has made possible a considerable increase in the cargo capacity of the ships and, as a result, a rise in their economic efficiency. The increased size of ships designed primarily to transport mass cargoes has required further intensification of loading-unloading work, based on setting up specialized complexes, equipped with a system of conveyor lines, railcar-tippers or other means of high-speed processing of railcars, powerful gantry cranes, reclaimers, container unloaders and other means of mechanizing and automating cargo operations. The development at seaports of high-productivity specialized units to transship mass cargoes and of deep-water berths, and the formation of the corresponding operational harbors and approach channels, cannot be effective unless these cargo flows are concentrated in a small number of ports. It is for this purpose that ports such as Yuzhnyy and Novotallinn, which now find themselves outside Russia's borders, were built. By the beginning of 1991, the fixed production capital of the seaports was estimated at 5,932 million rubles [R]. Here, the largest relative share belonged to the ports of the Black Sea-Azov and Danube basins -- 39.4 percent. The share of the Far Eastern basin was 28.8 percent, of the Baltic -- 21.9 percent, the Northern -- 7.3 percent and the Caspian basin -- 2.6 percent. The distribution of the ports' fixed capital among the republics looked like this: for the Russian ports of the Black Sea-Azov basin -- R388 million (16.6 percent), the Ukrainian ports -- R1,819 million (78 percent), the Georgian ports -- R127 million (5.4 percent); the Russian ports on the Baltic basin -- R454 million (35 percent), and the remaining R675 million (65 percent) -- the ports of Lithuania (11 percent), Latvia (22.5 percent) and Estonia (31.5 percent). Specialized Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargo The Port of Murmansk exports apatite concentrate and iron ore. The specialized complex to transship apatite concentrate can take ships with a deadweight up to 40,000 tonnes and its loading productivity is 2,400 t/hr. The industrial complex for the transshipment of apatite concentrate includes a railroad unloading gallery, an apatite concentrate warehouse, a shore-based loading gallery, loading machines, a system of conveyor belts and transfer stations and a central control post. The apatite concentrate is transported from the Apatity Station to the Port of Murmansk in special cars with an elevated body. A consist of 87 cars, with a total freight capacity of about 5,000 tonnes, is fed to the railroad tracks of the complex and then nine cars at a time go to a double-track gallery, where unloading is done as they move along it. Two hoppers with a capacity of 540 tonnes each are placed under the railroad tracks in the gallery. From here the freight goes by belt-conveyor feeder to the main belt conveyors and then, depending on the work variant, to the ship or to the warehouse. The apatite concentrate warehouse, made in the form of a longitudinal reinforced concrete hopper with two lower longitudinal outlet slots and a roof on top, accommodates 25,000 tonnes of concentrate. The iron ore berth at the Murmansk seaport can take ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The technical productivity of the gantry cranes is 2,800 t/hr. The Kandalaksha seaport specializes in transshipping iron ore which arrives at the port by rail from the deposits of the Kolskiy Peninsula, for further transport by river ships to the Cherepovetsk Metallurgy Combine. The special loading unit includes a system of belt conveyors, a railcar-tipper and loading machines at the berths and warehouse. The river ship loading rate reaches 3,000 t/hr. The Ventspils seaport transships potassium salt to seagoing ships by means of a specialized transshipping complex constructed at the rebuilt deep-water berth. This complex has two loading machines at the berth, with a total productivity of 3,000 t/hr, a pyramid-type storage warehouse and a system of conveyor lines in enclosed galleries, and can take and process ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. Its throughput capacity is estimated at a level of 2.5-3.0 million tonnes a year. The first section of the Port of Novotallinn. which includes complexes to transship grain and perishable wheat products, was put into operation on the Baltic basin in 1989. The grain complex is made up of a deep-water pier with two berths, which can take ships with a deadweight of up to 100,000 tonnes, is equipped with conveyor lines to feed the grain into a 300,000-tonne capacity elevator located on the shore, and has one berth (quay) to take bulk freighters with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes, at which grain can be both loaded and unloaded. The total throughput capacity of the grain complex is estimated on a level of 5-6 million tonnes a year. The Odessa seaport has a specialized berth to take ships with raw sugar transported in bulk. The berth is equipped with gantry cranes and conveyor lines in galleries to feed the sugar to the onshore warehouse. The technical productivity for unloading sugar is 450 t/hr. Modernization measures were carried out in 1985, making it possible to increase the raw sugar unloading productivity. Grain-carrying ships are unloaded at the Port of Odessa at a specialized berth, equipped with conveyor lines, cranes and pneumatic grain loaders. The pier was extended by 90 m, with the necessary increase in depth at the berth, to take large grain-carrying ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The Nikolayev seaport has a special unit to load ore onto seagoing ships, traveling to the ports of the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company -- Izmail and Reni, where the ore is transshipped to river barges for delivery to countries on the Danube. The special transshipping complex includes a car-tipper to unload the iron ore arriving by rail, a system of conveyor lines to feed the ore to the warehouse or to the berth, and also loading machines with a technical productivity reaching 3,000 t/hr. The Port of Yuzhnyy. Construction of the port was begun on the Adzharlykskiy estuary in 1974. Two berths were built on its western shore for dry chemical cargo -- carbamide, shipped for export (in bulk or in sacks) by means of special units. These berths can take large ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. Loading in bulk is done at a rate of 500 t/hr, and in sacks -- 300 t/hr. A Korgoveyer type loading machine was placed at the berth to load carbamide in sacks. Berths were also built for transshipment of liquefied ammonia and superphosphoric acid, as well as for methanol and nitrilic acid. A transshipping complex with a total berth front of 650 m was erected on the eastern shore of the estuary for transshipment of bulk cargoes, mainly ore and coal, and it can take three ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes at the same time. There is a possibility that two ships with a deadweight of 100,000 tonnes each can be accepted after the harbor area has been deepened. At the cordon and in the rear there are gantry cranes with a large hoisting capacity, the Atlant type -- 20/32 tonnes, and the Sokol type -- 16/32 tonnes, depending on the radius of the boom. Railcars with bulk freight arriving at the port are unloaded by means of car-tippers, and then it proceeds along the conveyor belt system at the rear or cordon-side warehouse areas for transfer to the ship by means of grab-bucket cranes. The throughput capacity of this complex is estimated at 5-6 million tonnes a year. In addition, two transshipping complexes were built here to take phosphorites off ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes, and then ship them by rail. Each of these complexes includes a berth, two transfer machines with a productivity of 1,200 t/hr and a warehouse with conveyor systems. Their total throughput capacity is estimated at 4 million tonnes a year. The Novorossiysk seaport transships the following bulk cargoes: grain and raw sugar for import and cement for export. The grain is processed at an elevator complex, which, since its rebuilding, can take ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes or 100,000 tonnes after they are unloaded in the roads to 60,000 tonnes. The gross rate of unloading ships with a deadweight of 30,000 tonnes is 16,200 t/ship-day. The port has a special unit with a productivity of 450 t/hr to unload raw-sugar from ships. One of the berths of the cement area loads bulk cement onto ships with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The Mariupol seaport specializes in transshipping coal arriving from the mines of the Donetsk basin to be shipped both for export (primarily to the countries along the Danube) and for coastal trading. The coal complex is equipped with a special unit, consisting of a railcar-tipper, a system of conveyor lines and two loading machines installed at one berth, which load coal with a technical productivity of about 2,200 t/hr. At other berths of the coal complex, the coal is loaded by grab-bucket gantry cranes. The port takes ships with a draft of 8.0-8.5 m. The Poti seaport ships about 2 million tonnes of manganese ore a year, both for coastal trading and for export. Its berths can take ships with a deadweight up to 30,000 tonnes. Bulk cargo in large quantities (mainly coal and ore) are transshipped at the ports of the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company -- Reni and Izmail. These cargoes arrive from the ports of Mariupol and Nikolayev in small ships (including ships for combined sailing) and in winter partly by railroad, and are then transshipped on river barges to travel along the Danube to ports in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The coal and ore are loaded by gantry cranes. The Port of Vostochnyy in the Far Eastern basin has special complexes to load coal onto seagoing ships with a deadweight of up to 100,000 tonnes and a complex to load industrial woodchips onto ships. The first section of the coal complex, put into operation in 1980, includes a deep-water pier with two berths, where, by means of a system of conveyor lines and two loading machines, installed at one pier, ships are loaded with a technical productivity of about 6,000 t/hr. After the second deep-water coal pier berth is put into operation, the throughput capacity of the complex will increase to 12 million tonnes a year. Construction of a complex to transship potassium salt for export, with a throughput capacity of about 2 million tonnes a year, has been planned and begun. Large bulkers with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes will be loaded here. Specialized Complexes To Transship Containers and Rolling Equipment The development of transport of containers and enlarged cargo pieces and of various wheeled and caterpillar equipment, as well as the increased size of specialized container ships and rolkers, has made it necessary to develop terminals equipped with various types of container transshippers, and storage areas with the corresponding dimensions and means of automated loading-unloading operation control. These terminals have been or are being developed at a number of major ports on all our country's marine basins. For example, the Port of Arkhangelsk built a new area, Ekonomiya, for transshipment of general cargo with larger pieces and special containers of the Norilsk Mining-Metallurgy Combine, as well as standard 20-foot containers. Large bulk container ships of the Mikhail Strekalovskiy type, and timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type, the draft of which should not exceed 9.0 m, will be moored in this area. Under reconstruction at the Port of Leningrad, is the port's third area, at which modern deep-water berths were built to receive and process large container carriers with a capacity of about 1,200 containers, and rolkers of the Kapitan Smirnov or Magnitogorsk type, with a capacity of about 60,000 m[.sup]3[/] and a draft of up to 10 m. This terminal includes two berths, equipped with container loaders, and a storage area to accommodate containers and wheeled equipment. Container loaders of the gantry type, installed at the berth, will process the ships and deliver the containers to the warehouse or to the berth, and truck-mounted container loaders will also carry out warehousing operations. The loading-unloading and warehouse operations at the terminal will be implemented by an automated control system. Its throughput capacity is about 150,000 units of containers and motor vehicles a year. The Port of Odessa has rebuilt the Karantinniy mole, in the process of which deep-water berths were built to take large ships. Berth and rear container loaders have been installed there, and the area has been expanded and equipped to store the containers. As a result, the mole's throughput capacity is about 1.5 million tonnes of containerized cargo a year. Two specialized berths are now in operation at the Port of Ilichevsk for container transshipment, with a throughput capacity of about 1 million tonnes of containerized cargo a year. A special new berth to transship motor vehicle equipment was put into operation here in 1980. The Port of Vostochnyy has three container berths. Another such deepwater berth is now being built. All four berths, each 300 m long, are designed to take (after dredging) container carriers with a 2,500 container capacity, but right now can take container carriers with a 1,200 container capacity and rolkers with a capacity of about 1,300 containers. Gantry loaders with a hoisting capacity of 30.5 tonnes each, with a rail width of 32 m, have been installed at the existing berths. Ten rows of containers are accommodated between the supports. The warehouses accommodate four rows of container stacks, serviced by gantry loaders. The total capacity of the warehouse areas at two berths is about 10,000 containers. Containers are delivered to the port and shipped from it by railroad transport. A cargo front, serviced by double cantilever gantry cranes with a rail width of 25 m, have been provided to process the consists. The containers are moved by truck-tractor, along the area of the complex between the basic commercial facilities, on the port's semi-trailers. The semi-trailer is designed to transport containers weighing up to 35 tonnes. The container complex is computer-controlled. A number of ports, including Vanino, Vladivostok, Nakhodka and others, are rebuilding berths to accept and process large container carriers. Two container berths have been built at the Port of Magadan. One of them has a special warehouse to store containers, and is equipped with traveling bridges. This warehouse makes it possible to carry out cargo operations in any weather, which, under the conditions of the long and severe winter, is very important. Special Berths To Transship Timber Cargoes Timber cargoes, mainly for export, are loaded at ports of the Northern basin (Arkhangelsk, Igarka), the Baltic basin (St. Petersburg, Vyborg, Kaliningrad), the Far Eastern basin (Vladivostok, Posyet, Nakhodka, Vanino and the port centers of the Amur estuary, as well as the port centers of Sakhalin and the Port of Ust-Kamchatka). All these ports take small and medium-sized ships with a deadweight of up to 7,000 tonnes, and ports such as Arkhangelsk, Igarka, Vostochnyy, Nakhodka and Vanino -- large timber-carrier-pallet-carriers of the Nikolay Novikov type, with a deadweight of about 14,000 tonnes. The following data characterize the rate of loading timber at the main ports: at the Port of Nakhodka -- saw logs in palletized form -- 1,700 t/ship-day, pulpwood (unpalletized) -- 1,230 t/ship day; at the Port of Vostochnyy -- saw logs, palletized -- 2,060 t/ship-day; at the Port of Vyborg -- pulpwood (unpalletized) -- 2,000 t/ship-day. Special Complexes To Transship Bulk Cargoes and Service Tankers The throughput capacities of the bulk oil complexes at seaports fully ensures the development of today's cargo turnover, with the exception of the oil-transshipment complex of the Port of Odessa, which needs to rebuild the berth structures, replace the pumping stations with more powerful equipment and deepen the access channel. The largest bulk oil complex at the Port of Novorossiysk, Sheskharis, has deep-water berths, including one berth to accept and unload supertankers with a deadweight up to 200,000 tonnes. This berth can load the largest tankers of the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, of the Krym type, with a deadweight of 150,000 tonnes (draft 17 m), and combination ships (bulk tankers) with a deadweight of 100,000-110,000 tonnes (draft 15-17 m). The pumping system of this berth is designed to perform the loading of crude oil tankers with a productivity of about 20,000 t/hr. The Tuapse seaport has six bulk berths, five of which can take tankers with a deadweight of from 10,000 to 40,000 tonnes for loading, and one -- tankers with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes. The oil-transshipping complex of the Batumi seaport is designed to take tankers with a deadweight up to 30,000 tonnes, and transships about 5 million tonnes of petroleum and petroleum products a year. The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of Ventspils includes three bulk-oil piers (two berths at each one of them), which can take tankers of varying cargo capacity (two piers -- with a deadweight of up to 50,000 tonnes and a third pier -- up to 100,000 tonnes). Liquefied petroleum gas is also shipped for export through this complex. The Klaypeda seaport has three bulk berths, through which petroleum products are shipped on small and medium-sized tankers with a deadweight of up to 25,000 tonnes, and the cargo turnover is about 6 million tonnes a year. The oil-transshipping complex of the Port of Nakhodka has four berths, two of which are for small ships and two for ships with a deadweight of 15,000 tonnes. On the Caspian Sea, bulk oil cargoes are shipped via the ports of Makhachkala, Aktay, Krasnovodsk, Baku and Apsheron. In addition to the two existing oil berths, the Port of Aktay has built two new berths with protecting structures, which has made it possible to increase the throughput capacity of the oil-transshipping complex from 5 million to 10 million tonnes a year. According to statistical data, in 1990 the total dry cargo export of the Soviet Union republics was 75.7 million tonnes, including: Russia -- 52.1 (69 percent), Ukraine -- 18.6 (24.4 percent), Belarus -- 1.58 (2.1 percent), Transcaucasus -- 1.59 (2.2 percent) and Kazakhstan -- 1.2 million tonnes (1.5 percent). Of this volume, 34.7 million tonnes (46 percent) were shipped through Russian ports, and, moreover, its own share was 31.4 (90 percent), the Ukrainian share 2.2 (6.3 percent), Belarusian -- 0.3 (1 percent); 29.2 (38.5 percent) was shipped through Ukrainian ports, and in this case Russia's share was 12.2 (41.7 percent), Ukraine's -- 14.9 (51.5 percent), Belarusia's -- 1.1 (3.9 percent), Transcaucasus' -- 0.4 (1.3 percent) and Kazakhstan's -- 0.3 million tonnes (1.1 percent). Of the total amount of Russian dry cargo export, the following commodities were transshipped through Ukrainian ports: coal -- 3.5 million tonnes, chemicals -- 3.4, metals -- 2.5, machines and equipment -- 0.44, ore -- 0.35 and other products -- 1.6 million tonnes. In 1990, about 8 million tonnes of dry cargo from Russia were exported through ports of the Baltic republics, including coal -- 2.7, chemicals -- 2.3, others, including metals and cement -- about 3 million tonnes. Of the total volume of dry cargo import in 1990, Russia accounted for 28.9 million tonnes (45.8 percent), and, moreover, 13.7 million tonnes were processed through its ports, 8.8 -- through the ports of Ukraine and 6.4 million tonnes through the ports of the Baltic republics. Predominant in the composition of Russian dry cargo import arriving through Ukrainian ports were grain -- 3.3 million tonnes, sugar -- 0.7, metals -- 1.6, chemicals -- 0.25, machines and equipment -- 0.56, combined feeds -- 0.5 and perishable goods -- 0.24 million tonnes. The import of dry cargo for Russia coming through Baltic ports consisted mainly of grain -- 3 million tonnes, perishables -- 0.4, combined feeds -- 0.4 and also metals, machinery and equipment -- 0.5 million tonnes. Because of the breakup of the USSR, to export these volumes of dry cargoes from Russia, the throughput capacities of the Black Sea Ports are lacking -- 12.2 million tonnes, the Baltic ports -- 8, and for import -- the Black Sea -- 8.8 and the Baltic -- 6.2 million tonnes. According to the predictions of Soyuzmorniiproyekt, the volume of Russian dry cargo import in the next few years should increase from 28.9 to 42.5 million tonnes, mainly due to grain -- 11.1, and sugar -- 3.2 million tonnes. No increase is envisioned in dry cargo export volume. Measures must therefore be worked out to develop the throughput capacity of Russia's ports, both in the near future and in the future up to the year 2000. In 1980, Russia exported 96.2 million tonnes of bulk cargo through its seaports, of which 42.5 million were transshipped through seaports on the Black Sea -- Novorossiysk and Tuapse, 21.8 million -- the ports of Ukraine, and 30 million -- the Baltic ports. According to predictions, a sharp cutback in the export of petroleum and petroleum products is proposed from both Russia and other oil-extracting republics. Because of this, there is no need to develop oil ports on the Black Sea. On the Baltic, however, the need obviously arises to build a bulk port or use the ports of Ventspils and Klaypeda under certain conditions. Photo Captions 1. p. 9: Far East.
