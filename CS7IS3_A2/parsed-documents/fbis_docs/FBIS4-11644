FBIS4-11644 "drnes062_m_94005" FBIS-NES-94-062 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 JORDAN Daily on U.S. `Seige' of al-'Aqabah Port Daily on U.S. `Seige' of al-'Aqabah Port JN3103082994 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic 31 Mar 94 pp 1, 18 JN3103082994 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B Arabic BFN [Editorial: "Jordan Is Committed to Comprehensive Peace"] [Text] Jordan responded to the U.S. call to take part in the Madrid conference because the conference was based on achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. The conference was also based on restoring all the occupied Arab territories, foremost of which is holy Jerusalem, and on fully restoring the national rights of the Palestinian people. However, the U.S. Administration abandoned its role as a full and effective partner in the peace process and forgot about the Madrid terms of reference. It began to encourage and support Israel in its attempts to fragment the peace process and to strike separate deals. It also gave Israel the liberty to maneuver and prevaricate. It went on to plant obstacles on the road to a just and comprehensive peace. The U.S. Administration bypassed UN Security Council resolutions and tried to impose its conditions on the Palestinian and other Arab parties. Furthermore, the U.S. Administration harshly pressured all the Arab parties in order to impose Israeli conditions on them. As a result, Israel succeeded in imposing the Oslo, Davos, and Cairo accords on the Palestinian side. Because Jordan is firmly committed to a just and comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242 and 338, the U.S. Administration, at Israel's request, strongly pressured and harassed Jordan to agree to sign a separate agreement with Israel. The U.S. siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah is part of this harassment, which has caused serious harm to Jordan's economy and trade. When His Majesty King Husayn visited the United States, he was asked to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel before the problems of water, occupied territories, and refugees are solved. However, His Majesty King Husayn, who has never submitted to pressure or harassment from any party, rejected the U.S. offer with courage, pride, and a firm Hashemite will. He stressed the need to restore Jordanian rights to the occupied territories and to the plundered waters, and the need to resolve the issue of refugees and evacuees. This spurred a U.S. desire to take revenge on Jordan. As a result of all this, the U.S. Administration began to tighten the siege on Jordan in order to cause more harm to it. Hence, the brave Hashemite response announced by His Majesty King Husayn when he linked continuation of Jordan's participation in the peace process with the lifting of the siege imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He stressed that Jordan is a difficult number in the equation and that it will not submit to pressures that are suspect in terms of causes and objectives.
