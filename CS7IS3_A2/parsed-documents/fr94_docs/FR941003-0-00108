FR941003-0-00108 FR941003-0-00018 Section 267.7, Appraisal standards, represents an extensive revision of proposed §267.4 on this subject. Specifically: (1) The proposed rule stated that the USPAP Departure Provision would not apply to FHA single family appraisals. The preamble to the proposed rule stated a concern that the Provision might be used to dispense with important information gathering. (See 58 FR 48560). After considering the matter more fully, we have decided that this concern is unjustified. Each of the appraisal forms permitted by HUD makes clear what information is required and any deficiency should be readily noticed by the review appraiser or underwriter. Also, the Provision will only be invoked under unusual circumstances, subject to mutual agreement of the mortgagee and appraiser, after obtaining consent from the local HUD office. Should appropriate circumstances arise and a complete appraisal not be required, the Provision gives HUD the administrative flexibility to save the parties needless expense. The Department expects that eventually, as experience is gained, a handbook addition or other directive will be issued with respect to Departure situations in single family programs. In view of the foregoing, the Provision is being given recognition for single family programs and reference to it (as being inapplicable) has been dropped from former §267.4(a)(1), now §267.7(a)(1). (2) Section 267.4(a)(3) of the proposed rule is being deleted as unnecessary and somewhat redundant since §267.7(a)(8) of the final rule covers the question of property valuation methods in greater detail. (3) Section 267.4(a)(4)(i) of the proposed rule described the appraisal report forms. That section has been revised in §267.7(a) of the final rule to extract the language pertinent to single family programs. Two Federal National Mortgage Association forms are also being added as acceptable for FHA single family purposes; these are somewhat more detailed than the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report and offer an alternative means of presenting the data. In addition, former §267.4(a)(4)(iii) required sufficient ``depth of analysis'' to reflect the complexity of the property. HUD has concluded that the data necessary for an appraisal which satisfies the other FHA standards will necessarily reveal whether the property is complex so as to require a certified rather than a licensed appraiser. Therefore, the need for this separate and rather vague standard is avoided and the language of proposed §267.4(a)(4)(iii) has been dropped from this final rule. (4) Proposed §267.4(a)(7) is being deleted as not really pertinent for single family programs. (5) Proposed §267.4(a)(11) is being deleted to simplify the appraiser's responsibilities. We agree with several commenters that the added burden of requiring the appraiser to check the property's legal description is not justified by the remote likelihood of a mistake in the address. (6) Section 267.7(a)(8) still requires the appraiser to certify that the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhood has in no way affected the appraisal determination. However, the phrase ``or socioeconomic'' has been dropped as part of this certification. The term was not susceptible to a clear understanding. It was, in fact, misleading, since the economic composition of the surrounding neighborhood, e.g., level of property maintenance, is a valid consideration in determining value, whereas any consideration of the social mix and demographics is precluded by the rule's explicit warning that the appraiser must not give weight to racial and ethnic aspects of the neighborhood 4 . A similar change has been made with respect to the certification for multifamily programs in §267.11(a)(9). 4 In addition to the certification requirement of §267.7(a)(8) it should also be noted that the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report Form states in bold type that ``[r]ace and the racial composition of the neighborhood are not appraisal factors.'' (7) Proposed §267.4(a)(12), now §267.7(a)(9), describing valuation methods, has been revised to extract the relevant single family provisions. Section 267.8(a)(1)(i)(A) of the rule contains a parenthetical phrase to make clear that a mortgagee selecting an appraisal organization may also select a particular employee within that organization to perform the appraisal.
