This "three one's" reform will have a major effect on the central banks' monetary policy and on the operation of foreign exchange-assigned banks. First, speaking of the central banks, because all foreign exchange income within the boundaries of China must be sold to foreign exchange-assigned banks, which, besides maintaining a certain foreign exchange circulating fund, must sell the surplus, if the foreign exchange taken in by the foreign exchange-assigned banks exceed the highest limit of the circulating fund, that foreign exchange must be sold to the central banks. Thus, under the past system, out of the foreign exchange held by each credit bank a very large part will eventually be put into the central banks, so obviously there will be an increase in the amount of foreign currency held by the central banks, a situation that will certainly have an effect on the central banks' monetary policy. Viewed from the angle of currency and banking theory, when foreign currency is held in different banks it will have a completely different effect; the funds held and used by the central banks are the basic currency to hold and use, and the funds held and used by credit banks are the gradually expanding currency to hold and use. On this point, the central banks' monetary policy must be appropriately considered and adjusted. Next, because the amount of foreign exchange held by the central banks increases, the efficiency of, and restraint on, the use of foreign exchange funds has become a major issue that the central banks must consider, and issue in which what is most important is the question of the structure of foreign exchange assets as well as investment and speculation with foreign exchange funds. This means that the central banks must increase its "business-type" operations with foreign exchange funds, doing business on the international currency market and gaining economic returns from the use of foreign currency. Finally, the foreign exchange transaction market between banks needs to be specially managed by the central banks with regard to the following points: First, how to determine well the size of each bank's foreign exchange circulating fund; second, how to intervene and control the application of foreign exchange funds to market prices; and third, what measures to use in control and regulation--all these problems need to be conscientiously studied and solved. From a look at the reform plan that has appeared, one sees that that this is a limited foreign exchange transaction market, and that the central banks try, through managing the foriegn exchange market between control banks, to regulate and control the rate of all foreign exchange. However, whether to use exchange rate measures to regulate, or to use changes in the supply and demand to regulate, is a question that requires study and finding out which is best. With regard to foreign exchange-assigned banks, the reform plan that has appeared shrinks the foreign exchange deposit business to the smallest possible size: Only enterprises and individuals carrying the smallest amount of foreign exchange will make foreign exchange deposits. Correspondingly, the foreign exchange loan business of foreign exchange-assigned banks will be almost completely eliminated, and there will also be a necessity for the existence of a foreign exchange fund for the capital formed by the banks that had made foreign exchange loans. Second, the foreign exchange-assigned banks' income from doing business in foreign exchange will only be the price differential of foreign exchange in over-the-counter business and the difference between "buying low and selling high" on the foreign exchange transaction market between banks, as well as the profit from the banks' own regulation of the structure of foreign exchange assets. Because the customer can use foreign exchange to buy directly corresponding "hard currency" at a foreign exchange-assigned bank, he no longer will need to have the bank buy and sell foreign exchange for him, and the bank will itself bear the risk in the aspect of the structure of foreign exchange assets. Viewed from this angle, we see that the foreign exchange-assigned banks are being pushed toward the market, where its risks in doing business will increase. Third, investment abroad by a foreign exchange-assigned bank entails a two-way restriction. Under the old system, with the approval of the investment abroad by a central bank, the foreign exchange-assigned bank could use its own foreign exchange capital, or directly use its own Renminbi funds, to buy foreign exchange for investment abroad. Under the new system, the investment plan of a foreign exchange-assigned bank must be approved by a central bank, and also the sources of the foreign exchange funds to be invested are required to have a central bank undertake to sell them before they can be formed; this selling of foreign exchange by the central banks touches on many aspects in regulating the foreign exchange market and in implementing the monetary policy. Therefore, the two-way restriction on the plan and the foreign exchange structure increases some systemic restraints on foreign investment by foreign exchange-assigned banks. At present, to link up with the world economy, the renminbi must as early as possible take the path of an exchange rate and in the end become a freely convertible currency, and China's foreign exchange control system must be correspondingly reformed. Today, the plan for reform of the the foreign exchange control system that we are promoting is essentially the choice to put into practice the socialist market economy. We should adapt to this choice, adjusting China's banking system and institutions, and ensuring that the course of China's overall reform is not adversely affected. This reform will add to the central banks' tasks in the aspect of monetary policy, but it will also provide the central banks with fairly appropriate means to solve difficult problems. This is only the nature of the foreign currency market, and the central banks should pay more attention to the influence and effect on monetary policy exerted by the foreign exchange transaction market between banks, and with relative flexibility use foreign exchange measures to regulate the foreign exchange transaction market and achieve relatively stable exchange rate prices. At the same time, the central banks' public market business should, as fast as possible, be put into substantive operation, in order to ensure an appropriate measure of currency supply, to prevent too-large fluctuations in currency supply from forming an enormous pressure on the foriegn exchange transaction market, and to help stabilize the exchange rate on the foreign exchange transaction market. With regard to intervention on the foreign exchange transaction market and the public market, I personally think that now it is appropriate to use simultaneously the dual regulation measures, both achieving a controlled interest rate and exchange rate system, and doing so by regulating the amount of supply and demand on the markets. In addition, the central banks should, at each large financial center in the world, set up a corresponding foreign exchange regulation and business operations organization, and, in line with the changes on the international currency and foreign exchange markets, adjust the structure of the foreign exchange assets that the central banks hold, thereby ensuring that the value of the foreign exchange funds they hold are not adversely affected, and under possible circumstances, striving to hold foreign exchange funds that increase in value. In fact, after reforming the foreign exchange management system, the central banks will be faced with two marekts: One is the domestic foreign exchange transaction market between banks; the other is the international foreign exchange and currency market. Only by operating with facility on these two large markets can the central banks ensure the efficiency in use and the returns on its foreign exchange funds, and ensure that the central banks' monetary policy attains the predesignated goals. As for the foreign exchange-assigned banks, the effect of this reform will really demand that each bank begin to change its past way and pattern of management, consider problems from the angle of the market, and by taking risks on the market get returns on the foreign exchange managed by the bank. Each bank must, as fast as possible, train fairly many foreign exchange counter personnel and fairly many foreign exchange transaction personnel. At the same time, we need to train a large number of specialists in business management and information processing on the foreign exchange marekt, and to set up a corresponding foreign exchange business management system and institutionalized system with a tight-knit organization, flexible operations, up-to-date information, and clear decision making. As for the dual restrictions on ivestment abroad with foreign exchange, this is a systemic change and it can, through systemic adjustments, lead to the best advantage for investment abroad by foreign exchange-assigned banks, taking into consideration whether it is an overseas investment fund set up by a central bank in each foreign exchange-assigned bank, with its funds source and foreign exchange capital held by the bank. After a central bank approves the overseas investment plans of certain foreign exchange-assigned banks, the problem of finding a source of foreign exchange will be solved by this fund. Without the slightest doubt, the reform of the foreign exchange control system will have an effect on the banking profession, as well as on the corresponding adjustment measures, and we need to change them in line with the changes in practice.
