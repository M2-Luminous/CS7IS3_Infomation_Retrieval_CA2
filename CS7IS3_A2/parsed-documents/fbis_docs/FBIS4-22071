Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that a leaflet to this effect was disseminated in the Gaza Strip today. It states that the two sides will halt acts of revenge against collaborators in order to enable them to dissociate themselves from their support of Israel. The two groups will also put an end to mutual acts of hostility and what they term unnecessary strikes. It was also decided to set up a committee to adjudicate conflicts between the sides during this cease-fire period. Our correspondent notes that Fatah leaders in the Strip have not reacted to the agreement, but a Palestinian source says it was reached with the knowledge of senior leaders in both organizations.
