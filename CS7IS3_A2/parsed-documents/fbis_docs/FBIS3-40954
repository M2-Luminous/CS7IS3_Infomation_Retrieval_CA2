According to numerous preliminary tatements by presidential aides and advisers, as well as by the U.S. press, the visit had not been planned. The press hailed Bill Clinton's intention to visit Minsk and Moscow and asserted that he was not going to visit Kiev because Ukraine was not behaving properly on the nuclear issue. They said that Ukraine would later be summoned to Moscow for negotiations. However, the boss of the White House changed his decision -- Kiev's airport was the first of those of the former Soviet republics to receive him. The president took a step backward, but now he wants to take two, three, or four steps forward. Against the background of the victory of Zhirinovskiy's party in Russia, the sensational reports on the total elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine do not only give rise to a series of questions, but also to the feeling of anxiety and uncertainty among the citizens of our, and not only our, state. One cannot fail to see the perfectly obvious contradictions between the decisions adopted by the Supreme Council on the reduction of nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian land and some statements in the agreement about to be signed by the presidents of the three states. For example, in accordance with the Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START-1, Ukraine takes upon itself an obligation to destroy 42 percent of its nuclear warheads over seven years. Before he arrived in Kiev, Clinton declared in Brussels that all the warheads would be removed from our territory in the coming two or three years. Therefore, if such an agreement is signed, a quite logical question arises: "Why should Ukraine fulfill all those extremely unprofitable procedures for destroying strategic offensive weapons as envisaged by START-1? It is known that its theses were elaborated more than 10 years ago, when the USSR, which manufactured nuclear weapons, was still in existence." The absence at that time of the effective mechanisms for control over the manufacture of nuclear warheads led to the elaboration of such operations for destroying strategic nuclear forces, which could be clearly pinpointed and controlled. It is precisely for that reason that, in accordance with the agreement, the account for destroyed strategic weapons is made in terms of dismantled launch vehicles and destroyed launch silos and not in terms of destroyed nuclear warheads. Incidentally, with regard to the latter, the practice of dismantling a training launch silo in Pervomaysk showed that the real economic and ecological losses exceeded the worst predictions. All those who saw the photographic illustration of this barbaric action in IZVESTIYA of 11 January 1994 could judge for themselves. Well, in view of the fact that Ukraine does not manufacture its own nuclear warheads, the removal of nuclear warheads from our territory also automatically signifies the elimination of the strategic offensive weapons. Even if entire strategic missiles remained in complete launch silos, with such a missile we would, perhaps, be able to launch, instead of a nuclear warhead, nothing more than nuclear waste from the Chernobyl sarcophagus. However, here a clear position is necessary -- either we pursue a stage-by-stage reduction of our nuclear arsenals in accordance with previous terms, or destroy nuclear warheads alone without ruining those things that may still serve our state, namely the launch vehicles and the launch silos. Yet another important issue with regard to new initiatives is the problem of compensation for nuclear disarmament. The sum of material assistance promised by Mr. Clinton cannot be compared to the losses that Ukraine has sustained. I will analyze just one aspect of this problem. The highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium are the most valuable materials of the nuclear warhead. It is impossible to determine the market price of these materials, because their sale is forbidden by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. At the same time, in accordance with some estimates, the known expenditure on the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium are, respectively, up to $100,000 and up to $1 million per kilogram. Together with the tactical weapons, Ukraine has already handed over to Russia more than 50 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, which, according to the minimum estimate, /is worth over $10 billion. This indebtedness of Russia to Ukraine would be enough to compensate for the deliveries of energy resources to us for more than a year./ As regards the new agreement, the proposals that the highly enriched uranium from the strategic missile warheads be processed at Russian enterprises and that Ukraine be repaid with low-grade uranium in the form of fuel for nuclear power stations are economically unprofitable for Ukraine. The low-grade uranium is worth about a hundredth of the highly-enriched uranium. On the other hand, in accordance with the concept of the development of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine, it would be economically expedient to manufacture our own fuel cartridges for the nuclear power stations. It would, therefore, be best to process highly enriched uranium in Ukraine. This is corroborated by the proposals from the well-known U.S. General Atomic Company, which proposed that a joint enterprise on manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations be organized in Ukraine. The cost of such an enterprise would be just $30 million. Besides, after completing the program for processing the highly- enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, this enterprise might be used within the technological cycle of our own capacities for manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations. Unfortunately, the leadership of our state ignored these proposals. It is necessary to return to this issue. One more commentary on the new initiatives. The fact that Ukraine is presently in a certain degree of international isolation is not due to nuclear weapons, as some people are trying to prove, but to the absence of any reforms. That is why, had there been conditions in Ukraine favorable for efficient entrepreneur activity and not stagnation with corruption and bribery, there would not have been such a thing as the so-called "Ukrainian syndrome," which allegedly scares away investors. Speaking about the nuclear weapons of the former USSR, Western entrepreneurs and politicians are not so much concerned about the availability of nuclear weapons, as about the possible coming to power in Russia of Mr. Zhirinovskiy.
