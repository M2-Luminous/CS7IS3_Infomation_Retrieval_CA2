It clarifies the president's duties under special circumstances. Illar Hallaste, a member of the Constitutional Commission, told ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency] that the aim of the law was to develop the idea of how and under what circumstances the president is to fulfill his constitutional duties. Most controversial so far has been the clause about presidential decrees, should the Riigikogu for some reason find it impossible to convene. According to Hallaste, the preliminary version of the draft law on presidency contained a clause allowing the president to issue decrees in the case of state of emergency or state of war. According to the adopted law, the president can issue decrees whenever the Riigikogu is convened for an extraordinary session but is irresolute, and the prime minister has notified the president of this being the case of urgent state requirements, Hallaste explained. He hopes that this solution is satisfactory to the president as well.
