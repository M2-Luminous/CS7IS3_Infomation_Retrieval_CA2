Fritz-Achim Baumann, chief of the North Rhine-Westphalian Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said that the Republikaner are relying on anti-Semitic instigation because, as a result of the tightening of the asylum law, the issue of foreigners' policy can no longer be used to polarize the population, in the view of the right-wing extremists. Constitutional Protection knows of so-called sample speeches, which "have obviously been formulated by the party's Executive Committee." In these speeches representatives of the Jewish communities are denounced as "chief German haters." One of these sample speeches says that Chancellor Helmut Kohl "put on the cap to satisfy Mr. Galinski." Heinz Galinski was Bubis' predecessor as chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
