Are you surprised, disappointed? [Vranitzky] There was some indication that our objections had been taken into account and that guarantees would not be provided so easily. I am certainly disappointed. [Edlinger] Do you think that the federal government's efforts were sufficient or that, maybe, you started your activities in the United States too late? [Vranitzky] This argument has long since been settled and it was refuted by all those who were there. So that is not relevant. The point probably was that the U.S. side was less interested in Austria's position and gave precedence to considerations of economic and industrial policy, which were more important for the Americans than our justified objections. [Edlinger] Will you continue the struggle or will you simply accept the decision? [Vranitzky] As far as I can see there is not much we can do about this decision. Still, I do not yet know the arguments used in favor of the credit. Still, it has been partly the result of our efforts that future nuclear projects will be subjected to stricter examination standards. Therefore -- and I have always said that -- in the future we will not sever any relations but maintain a dialogue on energy -- with the Czech Republic and others. Still, our basic position has not changed. Even when we do not have to hide our disappointment now, our arguments led to a rethinking process and to reflection on the part of many Americans. [Edlinger] Thank you very much for the interview, chancellor. [Vranitzky] Not at all.
