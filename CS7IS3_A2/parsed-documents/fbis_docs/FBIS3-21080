The new process is based on mechanically induced solid-state reactions between the oxide powders instead of the joint precipitation of heavy-metal oxides from dilute solutions, whereby highly polluted waste water results, as well as dust when calcining. In addition, the process presents the capability of reactivating spent catalysts. For this purpose the catalysts are again subjected to mechanical treatment after the organic refuse has been separated, in the process of which it has become apparent that fresh catalyst surfaces become available and contaminated surfaces are to a large extent cleaned. Specimens thus treated display activity almost equal to that of newly produced catalysts, it is further reported. The process, for which a patent has been applied for in the meantime, can be translated relatively easily to the commercial scale, because the plants required for the reaction are to a large extent available from other applications. A production plant having a daily capacity of a ton and more could also be built within a short time. The production costs are much lower than with conventional precipitation, the Cermet company emphasizes.
