FBIS4-54127 "dreas101__a94002" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan `Secret' Milk Accords Set With U.S., Australia `Secret' Milk Accords Set With U.S., Australia OW2505044294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2505044294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] An agreement was reached at the Uruguay Round (new multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT) to liberalize imports of milk products. In this regard, it has been disclosed that the Japanese Government reached "secret accords" with United States and Australia, in deciding to import amounts of certain products which the United States and Australia produce more of than do other countries, in the face of the liberalization. The accords will be linked to giving priority to actual purchases of certain milk products from both countries. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] denies the allegation, saying that "we did not promise that we would import the goods from both countries." However, it is believed that the secret accords are de facto "import guarantees." Therefore, it is expected that other milk-product exporting nations will voice opposition. So far the Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation [LIPC] has imported all types of milk products, including butter and skim milk, to satisfy domestic demand. Following the Uruguay Round agreement, importers will be able to freely import milk products starting in 1995 if they pay high tariffs. At the same time, the LIPC will be allowed to import 137,202 tons of milk products annually with low tariffs as part of minimum access. Of the LIPC's import quota, 20,000 to 30,000 tons will be allocated to a milk product called whey, which is used in bread and confections, according to the accord with the United States which was agreed to last year at the bilateral Japan-U.S. talks. Because the United States is strongly competitive in the production of whey, the agreement may become a de facto guarantee for its import from the United States. According to the MAFF, Japan has not imported whey from the United States since 1988. Japan promised Australia in March that it would import butter and skim milk from that country in amounts equivalent to at least three-fourths of the LIPC's total imports of butter and skim milk. Japan and Australia have exchanged an informal document that stipulates: 1) Japan will decide on the import volume of butter and skim milk every year after considering the domestic demand, and 2) Japan and Australia will hold governmental dairy product negotiations every year and exchange information on the milk products trade. It can be said that the informal document is a de facto guarantee for imports from Australia. The MAFF, however, has never made public the informal document. Commenting on the secret accord concluded between Japan and the United States, a Japanese official in charge of the Uruguay Round negotiations said, "Japan and the United States agreed at the end of their negotiations on opening the Japanese rice market to postpone implementation of rice `tariffication,' and Japan has conceded to the United States on whey." In principle, GATT bans country-by-country import quotas, but it permits the import quota system if all nations involved agree on the import quota system. As for the secret Japan-U.S. accord and the secret Japan-Australia accord, the MAFF has not notified GATT of them, and the MAFF says, "The accords do not constitute a country-by-country import quota."
