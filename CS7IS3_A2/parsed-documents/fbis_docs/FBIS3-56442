The first deputy prime minister's decision was already suggested by the mere fact that he was elected leader of the Russia's Choice parliamentary faction, he added. Touching upon accusations by some democratic parties that the government will be cut at the expense of its reform wing, Valentin Sergeyev stressed: "The government, headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, was, is, and will continue to be a government of reform."
