Elections"] [Text] Volodymyr Hrynyov and Leonid Kuchma, who have formed the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, held their first press conference last week. All the questions asked by journalists basically brought up three issues: The upcoming elections, the economic situation of Ukraine, and prospects for its relations with Russia following the victory of the Zhirinovksiy party in the elections for parliament. Strange as it may seem, the journalists first brought up the third issue. No doubt, Leonid Kuchma said, I would prefer to see a party supporting Yeltsin get the majority of the votes. There is nothing we can do about it. People who voted for the Liberal Democratic Party voiced in the first place their discontent with economic failures and general impoverishment. At the same time, stressed Mr. Kuchma, one should not dramatize the situation -- Zhirinovskiys come and go, but Russia will always remain. For all pledges of help, no country of the world community provided any tangible economic aid to Ukraine. So whether you like it or not, the success of our economic reforms is impossible without close ties with Moscow. In addition, the strong union of Russia and Ukraine would secure the geopolitical peace in the region. Mr. Hrynyov approached this issue from a different perspective. The worst thing for me, he said, is not that Zhirinovskiy won but that the centrist forces have failed. This should become a good lesson for us. We must seek to unite democratic forces. Another question was whether the Interregional Bloc would cooperate with Rukh in the elections, how close this cooperation would be, and if it was possible that both organizations might recall their candidates in favor of one another. We are ready to cooperate with all progressive forces, said Hrynyov, that put the individual above the rest of the values. The individual, society, and the state -- this is the order of preference that holds sway in civilized countries. Unfortunately, Rukh is currently cooperating with organizations that advocate quite the opposite principles. However, I do not rule out forming electoral blocs in the hinterland. Mr. Hrynyov noted that he firmly stands for a federative division of Ukraine. In his opinion, this presents sizable economic advantages for the country. As for regional authorities, it is easier for them to decide what enterprises should be privatized, put up for auction, sold, or simply shut down. Mr. Kuchma was just as specific on this issue. He prefers the German option of state division, where with a strong central power, local parliaments retain a considerable portion of power, which provides them with efficient economic leverages for the local economies. In that country, rights go along with responsibilities. Although local authorities there funnel substantial funds to the federative budget, they actively influence industry, agriculture, and trade in their regions. Otherwise, they would go bankrupt. In Ukraine, however, some of the oblasts live at the cost of their neighbors. Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov were pretty skeptical about government activities, seeing the main thrust of its efforts being -- to put it mildly -- misdirected. They also think that during a transition period, it is impossible to build a strong economy without a strong government. Unfortunately, neither the executive branch nor the president's actions can be called strong. In a usual straightforward manner, Mr. Kuchma made it clear that Ukraine is now facing the question: To be or not to be? Unfortunately, we are sharing the same oil bucket with Russia -- and if we fail to pay that country for energy sources, we are going to kick this bucket. Our correspondent asked why our living standards dropped ten-fold at a time when production decreased only by half. Leonid Kuchma said that production should not necessarily slump proportionately to the drop in living standards. There are some enterprises, for example, that could be closed without people ever noticing this. However, there are more difficult cases. As an example, he cited the Southern Machine-Building Plant [Yuzhmash]. While this enterprise manufactured up to 60,000 tractors per year, its present output is one tractor per day. Gas supplies to the enterprise were reduced by 90 percent. We used to say restructuring and reform. These are all merely words -- in reality, we were basically destroying the economy.
