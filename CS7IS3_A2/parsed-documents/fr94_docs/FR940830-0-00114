FR940830-0-00114 FR940830-0-00014 Paragraph (d) has been amended to show that the Act of August 10, 1993, does not affect the assessment work requirements starting September 1, 1999, and that the first FLPMA filing not affected by the Act is the one due on December 30, 2000. One comment asked if fees or charges should be returnable if the claims are still shown as active on BLM records but have been voided or abandoned by operation of law, but for which a decision has not yet been issued. The answer is yes, if for some reason payments are made on such claims. Two comments asked what the term ``docketed'' in paragraph (a) means. This word and other terms of art have been removed and replaced with other terms to clarify the point at which service charges cannot be returned. One comment asked if service charges for amended locations will also be returnable under paragraph (b). The answer is yes. One comment disagreed that paragraph (b) allows service charges to be returnable in such a case. Service charges must be returnable in this case because the charges were paid for a service that will not be performed. For instance, if a small miner submits the service charge with his or her annual assessment filing on a claim that is already abandoned and void by operation of law, the service that the charges are for (to process the annual filing submitted) will never be rendered. One comment asked whether paragraph (c) should refer to the time of ``submission'' of fees rather than the time ``fees were paid.'' The term ``time of submission'' is more precise and the final rule has been amended accordingly. One comment said that paragraph (c) did not cover all instances for which fees may be refunded. This paragraph has been amended to add overpayments as a reason for refund. One comment asked for a clarification of whether paragraph (d) means that BLM will only refund duplicate payments when requested to. The answer is yes, but the final rule regarding this process has been amended to give the claimant a choice between a refund or an application of the excess fees to a future year. One comment said that paragraph (d) should not apply to maintenance fees, but instead a new paragraph should be added in which application of the duplicate fees to a future year would be automatic unless a refund is issued. This paragraph has been amended to require that claimants who overpay their fee be given the choice either to receive a refund or to apply the fees to a subsequent year. Claimants will be notified in every case, because they have a right to direct how their overpayment is to be treated, and must know how much they have already contributed to the next year's payment in order to adjust their payment for the next year. One comment suggested that paragraph (d) should be reworded for clarity. This has been done in the final rule. 43 CFR 3833.2&hyph;3 Paragraph (e) has been amended to provide that fee payments under the Act of August 10, 1993, need only be made for new claims located on or before September 29, 1998. The time period that such a claim will be held in good standing by such a payment has also been clarified. 43 CFR 3833.2&hyph;6 One comment stated that the term ``mineral entry'' is inconsistent with terminology in 43 CFR 3851.5(a) and should be changed to reflect this. It is inappropriate to make this change because the term is used in this section as it is in 43 CFR subpart 3851. One comment challenged the statutory authority for this section. The comment stated that allowance of mineral entry is only an early hurdle in the patent process, and a claim at that point remains unpatented and thus subject to the fee. The comment also stated that associated regulations that allow assessment work to be excused in such a case are similarly erroneous. There is no specific statutory authority for this section, but there are significant numbers of judicial decisions supporting it. The end of the obligation to file proof of performance of assessment work is a part of the recognition of mineral entry, which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The similar treatment of the maintenance fee payment is also a recognition of this mineral entry. Two comments asked for the definition of when mineral entry begins. One comment urged insertion of the definition into the rule. When mineral entry occurs must be determined on a case-by-case basis. One comment said that this section should be reworded because a notice of intention to hold can no longer be filed on a mining claim. This section has been reworded in the final rule to reflect this. 43 CFR 3833.3 One comment stated that paragraph (c) in the proposed rule is misleading because it refers to transfers of interest ``being effective'' on the date of recordation with BLM and also refers to ``BLM record title purposes,'' which it said implies that BLM records reflect the true state of legal title for mining claims. This paragraph has been amended in the final rule to make it clear that the recordation date of a transfer of interest is merely the effective date for BLM record purposes. The paragraph is further amended by removing the phrase ``For BLM record title purposes'' to eliminate this confusion. Three comments asked for a clarification of paragraph (c). The paragraph means to say that a transfer is first officially shown on BLM records as of the date of recordation with BLM. The actual effective date of the transfer is determined by State law. 43 CFR 3833.4 Two comments stated that paragraph (a)(1)(i) does not make reference to annual filings as to mill sites. This inadvertent omission has been corrected in the final rule. One comment said that paragraph (a)(3), which deals with failure to perform assessment work on or before the date of the filing of a waiver statement, cannot result in forfeiture of the claim because this is not allowed under the Mining Law. The comment further stated that retroactive forfeiture of a claim for failure to perform assessment work once the waiver has already been granted should not be allowed. This paragraph is only referring to situations where a claimant would file a false statement which says that assessment work had been performed when it had not. In such a case, upon investigation, the claims would be declared void for failure to pay the maintenance fee, given that an invalid waiver certification was filed. One comment said that the current paragraph (b) had been incorrectly amended in previous rules so that complete cross references regarding the curability of the contents of a notice of intention to hold were omitted. The paragraph is amended by adding a cross reference to ยง3833.2&hyph;5.
