[Unidentified correspondent] Diplomats and military men from the two states are discussing clauses in the basic agreement on the legal status of, procedure for, and scheduling of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, as well as six attached agreements. According to the agreement, Russia will withdraw all its 50 units and formations, the core of which is the 14th Army, in addition to the 15 military units already withdrawn since November 1992. The troops' withdrawal should, according to the Russian delegation's proposal, be synchronized with political settlement of the Dniester conflict. This proposal met no objection from the Moldovan delegation. The main role in settlement of the conflict is, naturally, being given to the Moldovan and Dniester sides. Experts have effectively completed the talks on the handover of the remaining property to Moldova and on Moldova's participation in building housing for Russian officers, warrant officers, and their families. In essence, agreement remained to be achieved on just one issue: [Begin recording] [Unidentified Russian officer, in progress] ...to determine the precise schedule for the withdrawal of our troops -- either a calendar schedule, by some date or other, or an overall one, over a specific period. We are now proposing a period of three years. [Unidentified civilian] On this, we politicians should heed the view of the military, who decide the organizational and tactical processes, the scheduling, and so on. I think we'll find a compromise even on such a difficult issue. [end recording] [Correspondent] The progress of the talks is giving rise to hopes that the package of documents could be agreed tomorrow at the expert level and passed to the governments for consideration.
