FR940303-0-00006 FR940303-0-00002 The information collected on Form 3 is similar to the information collected on Form 8 described earlier, but pertains to rail car shipments rather than truck shipments. Again, this information has historically been utilized primarily for tracking and verifying shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, like Form 8, creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. Handlers are also required to submit similar information on rail car shipments on the weekly Form 4. As with size information pertaining to truck shipments, the committees plan on requesting size information from handlers for rail car shipments on a voluntary basis until the weekly Form 4 is appropriately revised. Like Form 8, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 3, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending §§907.71 and 908.71 of the orders and §§907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 3 will be discontinued. Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 265 handlers of navel and Valencia oranges who have been completing Form 8, taking about .40 hour to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on about 80 orange handlers who ship by rail at some point during a season and utilize Form 3, taking about 0.20 hours to complete each report. After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that the provisions detailed in the interim final rule, at this time, do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Therefore, this rule finalizes the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register (59 FR 1268, January 10, 1994). List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 907 and 908 Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
