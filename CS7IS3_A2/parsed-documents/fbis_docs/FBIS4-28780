A statement released following a 45-minute meeting between visiting Cambodian Minister of Public Works and Transport Ing Kiet and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday morning said Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the importance and benefits of the early establishment of the Mekong Committee. Both countries are also open to other Mekong countries -- China, which is the source of the Mekong River, and Burma joining the Mekong Committee after it is set up officially. Cambodia officially rejoined the three other riparian countries Thailand, Vietnam and Laos in their efforts to work out common grounds for the use of the river in February 1993. The four countries said a common framework would be completed within a year with each country setting up a working group to draft the framework with the United Nations Development Programme serving as coordinator. Sources said an agreement had still not been reached on the sensitive issue of the use of the water in the Mekong River. Ing Kiet, the chairman of Cambodia's Mekong Committee, said after meeting Science, Technology and Environment Minister Phisan Munlasatsathon on Friday that Cambodia was open to other countries joining the committee after a framework on the use of the Mekong is completed. "As soon as our authority finds a solution acceptable to all four governments, why not expand the committee to outside countries. We are open to that," he said. Ing Kieth is on a five-day official visit to Bangkok, Nong Khai and Maha Sarakham as guest of the Science, Technology and Environment Ministry. He is scheduled to leave Bangkok today. Bilateral cooperation and the current political situation in Cambodia were also raised during the meeting with Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong. The two ministers expressed the hope that tomorrow's talks between government and Khmer Rouge representatives in Phnom Penh would be successful. Both agree the development of Cambodia and support for the prosperity ot the Cambodian people are important to bringing about peace and prosperity in the region as a whole. Thailand could cooperate with its neighbour in the area of infrastructure development and energy.
