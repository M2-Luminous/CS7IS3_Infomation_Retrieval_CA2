Commission spokesman Mr Mukutulu Sinyani said in Lusaka yesterday that officers pounced on Salim Ally Bakari on his arrival from Bombay, India. Bakari was on his way to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and was to board a connecting flight tomorrow. Mr Sinyani said Bakari had swallowed the drugs in a bid to evade detection but the officers arrested him after a tip-off from international sources. The pellets of heroin with a street value of K24m were released in a lavatory after Bakari swallowed medicine he was induced to take. Mr Sinyani said among the people who had been arrested for trafficking by swallowing heroin, Bakari had swallowed most. Bakari was a courier who had been sent by a well-known drug baron in Tanzania and was promised a $2,000 reward.
