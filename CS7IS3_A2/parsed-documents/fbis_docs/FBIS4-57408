At approximately 1500 on Sunday, 15 May, it began to rain in Soledad de Mayari. This town, located 70 km north of Santiago de Cuba, could not imagine that only a few minutes later, the apparently inoffensive Soledad River would acquire such force. When things calmed down, it was possible to verify the effects of such rains. Antonio Pena Barrera, 41, died. Two other people were injured, and 62 houses were seriously damaged. Almost all families who live on the banks of the river lamented the loss of something. Risking his life, one man was able to rescue the yoke of his oxen. Moreover, 20 km of highway was damaged and a bridge totally destroyed. Damages to agriculture and to electricity lines were also reported. The El Cate dam could not resist the force of the waters. Only by listening to witnesses can one understand the scope of the damages. One man who lived here all his life said this never happened before. [Begin recording] [Unidentified first witness] I do not remember anything like this. [Leon Cabrera] There are others who go even further. [Unidentified second witness] I have never witnessed anything like this in the 45 years I have lived here. [end recording] The heavy rains lasted a little more than 30 minutes, which caused the river to overflow. In less than 30 minutes, the rains caused all this disaster. It is not difficult to suppose, then, what would have happened if these rains had lasted longer. This is an important lesson in this recovery stage.
