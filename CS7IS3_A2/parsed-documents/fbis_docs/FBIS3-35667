Georgia was represented at the talks, which lasted 16 hours, by Aleksandr Kavsadze, chairman of the Stet Committee on Ethnic Relations and Human Rights, Abkhazia by Andrey Dzhergenia, a special envoy of the parliamentary chairman. The negotiations were mediated by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov and a representative from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees. Dzhergenia and Kavsadze told Interfax the quadrilateral agreement had not been signed due to disagreements on one of its clauses, that on the refugees' safety. The Abkhazian side insisted that immunity do not apply to those refugees who had fought against "lawful Abkhazian authority." Kavsadze, however, said this formula would always make it difficult for refugees to return home and would legalize ethnic purges, for it "justifies those who fought against the Georgians and represents Georgians as criminals." Dzhergenia said the plan could begin to be carried out after the agreement was signed, but the date set for it by the communique on the results of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in Geneva on January 11-13 is February 10. Kavdsadze believes the plan should start to be put into operation as soon as possible, for he fears the refugees may start coming back by themselves, which, he said, might lead to new bloodshed.
