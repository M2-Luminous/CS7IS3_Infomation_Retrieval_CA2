The Japanese and U.S. Governments are to hold discussions to make a decision by July on whether to terminate the bilateral semiconductor agreement ahead of its scheduled expiration in July 1996. However, differences in opinion between the two nations have come into the picture, for Japan is calling for an early termination of the agreement while the United States insists that it remain in effect. At the news conference, Hidehiko Yoshida (vice president of the Toshiba Corporation), chairman of the Users Committee of Foreign Semiconductors, who represented the Japanese side, emphasized that "the situation between the Japanese and U.S. industries is satisfactory in terms of cooperative ties." Gil Amelio (president of the National Semiconductor Corporation), chairman of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), also pointed out that the "U.S. and Japanese semiconductor industries have become more and more mutually dependent." As for the bilateral semiconductor agreement, however, Yoshida said: "The foundation has been laid for the industries of both nations to continue cooperating. The private sector should be left alone to look after its own affairs." He thus indicated that the private sector wants the Japanese and U.S. Governments to promptly terminate the semiconductor arrangement. However, Amelio clearly indicated opposition to terminating the arrangement, saying: "The semiconductor agreement has brought progress in establishing cooperative ties between the U.S. and Japanese industries. Therefore, the arrangement should be continued." A "20-percent" share of Japan's market for foreign semiconductors has been designated as a target goal in the semiconductor agreement. Regarding this point, Yoshida said: "In the past, this figure has tended to take on a life beyond the purpose for which it was originally intended. I feel it is no longer necessary to set figures." In contrast, Wilf Corrigan (chairman of LSI Logic), a member of the SIA Board of Directors, stressed, "Figures are needed to measure progress."
