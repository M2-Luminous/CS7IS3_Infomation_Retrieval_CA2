FR940111-0-00087 FR940111-0-00019 In addition to these services fee difficulties, funeral provider groups asserted that the exclusion of a separate, non-declinable ``basic facilities fee'' from the required GPL listing misinforms consumers about the cost of funeral services. 167 167 R&hyph;M&hyph;9 (NFDA/NSM) at 128. Four witnesses expressed views on the facilities fee issue presented by the NFDA. The then-President of the NSM testified that a non-declinable facilities fee is a legitimate charge to inform consumers that they are purchasing the use of a facility to shelter and care for the remains. 168 Similarly, Wendell Hahn of the FFDA asserted that providers' inclusion of the cost of providing a special-purpose facility in other charges, rather than showing it separately, violates proper accounting practice and may be deceptive pricing. Mr. Hahn concluded that the Rule should permit a separate basic facility charge that is non-declinable. 169 Some funeral providers, in fact, currently include items on their GPLs that could be viewed as non-declinable facility fees, such as fees for ``parking lot use.'' 170 168 R. Johnson, Tr. Vol. I, 745&hyph;746, 759. 169 Tr. Vol. II, 671. 170 Starks, Tr. Vol. II, 424. The Commission agrees that the original requirements for the disclosure of the non-declinable and other service charges likely are causing compliance difficulties for some providers and informational problems for consumers. The evidence indicates that some providers on their GPLs may not be fully separating non-declinable services from services associated with providing other items on the GPL. To the extent that is occurring, consumers who decline other items may be purchasing more services than they actually receive. Other consumers may be ``double charged'' for some services if providers, confused about which services are declinable and which are not, include some portion of the services associated with declinable items, such as ``use of facilities for viewing,'' in that charge, as well as the non-declinable services fee. Still other consumers (or groups such as memorial societies that obtain and publish comparative price data) who attempt to comparison shop may not readily be able to do so. The Commission has concluded that the service disclosure requirements need to be clarified to implement fully the Commission's intent in permitting a non-declinable services fee. Amendment of the Rule, however, to permit a non-declinable ``basic facilities fee'' charge is not warranted by the evidence or the original Rule requirements. The Rule's core purpose is to permit itemization so that consumers may select only the funeral items they desire, and decline unwanted items. The Rule allows providers to recover overhead for facilities by allocating a portion of those costs to each item offered or by including them in the non-declinable services fee. A second, non-declinable fee would signal a return to package pricing, where all consumers would pay for the use of all facilities (and, presumably, other overhead costs) irrespective of the degree to which consumers choose to use them. Itemization permits consumers to decline the use of various provider facilities. The testimony of at least one funeral director suggested, however, that some providers currently may be imposing in some form a ``non-declinable'' facilities fee on consumers, in apparent violation of the Rule. Accordingly, the Commission has adopted the following amendments to clarify the Rule's intent and requirements with respect to service fees and non-declinable charges: (1) Revision of the ``services of funeral director and staff'' definition in §453.1(o) to clarify that these are the basic services that cannot be included in prices of other, declinable GPL categories, and that are furnished by a funeral provider in arranging any funeral, such as conducting the arrangements conference, planning the funeral, obtaining necessary permits, and placing obituary notices; (2) Addition of the term ``basic'' before the word ``services'' where the latter term appears in §§453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (1) and (2) and 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A), so that all GPL disclosures regarding the non-declinable services fee refer to ``basic services'' rather than simply ``services''; (3) Addition of the phrase ``and staff'' after the phrase ``use of facilities'' to §§453.2(b)(4) (H) and (I), to clarify that providers are required to disclose the prices for use of facilities and the services of staff associated with viewing and a funeral ceremony; (4) Replacement of the ``other use of facilities'' price disclosure requirement, §453.2(b)(4)(J), with the more specific disclosures ``use of facilities and staff for memorial service'' and ``use of equipment and staff for graveside service''; (5) Addition to §453.1 of the definitions of a ``memorial service'' and a ``funeral ceremony'' to distinguish those services for purposes of listing them separately on the GPL; (6) Addition of the express requirement to the disclosure requirements of §§453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C) (1) and (2) that, if the services fee cannot be declined, it must include all charges for the recovery of unallocated funeral provider overhead, and funeral providers may include in the required disclosure (and in the GPL disclosure required by 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A)) the phrase ``and overhead'' after the word ``services,'' so that disclosures regarding non-declinable services fees refer to ``basic services,'' and to ``basic services and overhead,'' if providers wish; and (7) Addition of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) to §453.2 to make clear that the Rule permits only one non-declinable fee for services, facilities or unallocated overhead, unless otherwise required by law. These amendments clarify the Commission's intent and providers' obligations in distinguishing non-declinable service fees from other service charges associated with providing separately listed, declinable goods and services. The changes are designed to promote industry compliance and consumer understanding of the services they must purchase and those they may decline, without substantially altering providers' obligations. The amendment permitting providers to add the phrase ``and overhead'' to the non-declinable service fee disclosure responds to industry's stated concern that consumers may be deceived by service fee price disclosures that fail to disclose a charge for overhead, 171 and clarifies for providers that the non-declinable fee can include overhead not allocated to other charges. 171 Funeral provider groups asserted during the proceeding that consumers should be informed that providers' non-declinable fees include a charge for overhead. Providers may do so under this amendment. See, e.g., P&hyph;37 (NFDA/NSM) at 240&hyph;242; P&hyph;30 (FFDA) at 2. The Commission further has determined, to reduce stated and potential GPL compliance burdens, to: (1) remove ``other automotive equipment'' (flower car/family car) 172 and ``acknowledgment cards'' 173 from the required GPL listing; (2) delete as unnecessary the required GPL disclosure that the GPL does not include cash advance items, §453.2(b)(4)(i)(D), and move from the GPL to the statement of goods and services selected the cash advance mark-up disclosure required by §453.3(f)(2); 174 (3) decline to adopt the required use of a ``standardized general price list,'' which the Commission finds is unnecessary in light of the relatively standardized GPL the Rule now requires, and the amendment, discussed below, prohibiting any language in any of the Rule-required price lists that alters or contradicts the information provided therein. 175 172 These items are not as frequently chosen by consumers in today's market as are a hearse or limousine, and providers, of course, may include the flower/family car on the list if they so desire. 173 To the extent that the Rule's listing provision has caused providers to charge for acknowledgment cards that were previously provided free of charge, as funeral provider groups suggested, the Rule may have had the unintended result of contributing, at least in some small sense, to increased consumer costs. To the extent that the costs are recouped elsewhere, those costs appear to be so incidental as to be tangential to the Rule's primary purpose. In either case, the benefits of requiring acknowledgment cards on the GPL appear to be outweighed by the harm to funeral providers' reputations and consumer satisfaction. The Commission thus has concluded that the better course is to remove the provision from the Rule. There is no record evidence to support, however, a general right for the provider to list any of the other items now required to be on the GPL as ``no charge'' items, as industry groups suggested. The Commission is concerned, for example, that if the Rule were to permit the listing of embalming or transportation as ``no charge'' items, their costs, which can amount to several hundreds of dollars, would be recovered in the prices of other items. As a result, consumers would, in effect, not have the opportunity to decline the costs associated with important items. Such a change could thus result in the diminution of itemization and the return of package-only pricing, which the Rule was primarily designed to prevent. See the discussion at R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR), 172&hyph;173. 174 See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 201. These amendments appropriately shorten the GPL and give consumers adequate notice of mark-ups. 175 The AARP and others recommended the adoption of a required format and disclosure language for the GPL more detailed than that required by the original Rule, because of potential provider non-compliance and consumer confusion. See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 169&hyph;172 for a full discussion of the standardized price list issue.
