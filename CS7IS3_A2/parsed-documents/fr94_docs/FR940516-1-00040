FR940516-1-00040 FR940516-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 4 RIN 1515&hyph;AB46 Filing of Export Certificates AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat-food products to be cleared before the filing of a copy of an export certificate by providing a statement regarding the shipment and the export certificate. The copy of the export certificate must then be presented within 4 days of the vessel's clearance. The regulations are being amended so that they will conform to revised regulations of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. DATES: Comments must be received before July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (preferably in triplicate) should be submitted to U.S. Customs Service, ATTN: Regulations Branch, Franklin Court, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, D.C. 20229, and may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., suite 4000, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Whiting, Carrier Rulings Branch, (202) 482&hyph;6940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In this document, Customs proposes to amend its regulations so that there will be consistency between regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and those of Customs regarding the timeframe within which an exporter must file a certificate certifying the wholesomeness of meat products being exported. Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), meat and meat products intended and offered for export and sale in a foreign country must be inspected. In addition, FMIA prohibits the clearance for departure of any vessel carrying meat and meat products for export to and sale in a foreign country until the owner or shipper has obtained from an inspector a certificate indicating that the products are sound and wholesome (unless the Secretary has waived certificate requirements for the country). In 1986, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the Department of Agriculture, which administers the FMIA, amended its regulations. Previously, the FSIS regulations required that exporters deliver a duplicate of the export certificate to the shipper for filing with Customs at the time the master's manifest or supplemental manifest is filed by the chief officer with Customs; that is, on the day of departure. Otherwise, the vessel carrying the meat or meat products would not be granted clearance. Because §4.75 of the Customs regulations allows shippers a delay of four business days in the filing of a Complete Cargo Declaration (manifest), the FSIS regulations were amended to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat products to clear in those instances where the duplicate export certificate is not available at departure time. In lieu of the duplicate export certificate, the shipper, shipper's agent or the vessel's agent must provide Customs with a statement under the shipper's or agent's letterhead signed by the shipper which briefly describes the shipment of the product, the number of boxes, the number of pounds, the product name and the USDA export certificate number that covers the shipment. Exporters must file the duplicate export certificate within 4 days of the clearance of a vessel carrying a shipment of meat products. In order to maintain consistency with Customs and USDA regulations, Customs is now proposing to amend that section of its regulations governing the clearance of vessels carrying meat products. Section 4.72(a) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.72(a)) currently states that no clearance shall be granted to a vessel carrying meat or meat-food product until copies of the export certificates issued by the USDA have been filed with the district director. Customs is proposing to amend this section so that clearance can be granted to vessels when documents complying with the requirements of 9 CFR part 322 of the USDA regulations are submitted. Shippers will still have to comply with the four-day time limit of §4.75 for submitting the actual USDA export certificate. Comments Before adopting the proposed amendment, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), §1.4, Treasury Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and §103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th Street, NW., Suite 4000, Washington, DC. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This amendment is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of E.O. 12866. Based on the supplementary information set forth above and pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. ), it is certified that the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Peter T. Lynch, Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.
