[Text] It would be worthwhile to hold parliamentary hearings on this subject with the participation of Boris Fedorov, the country's ex-treasurer. Or is no one in our government responsible for this as before? The budget is more important than any political argument to very many people -- no matter what position they occupy. The incomes of the different categories of citizens and the amounts of taxes depend on the state budget and budgetary policy. However, our liberal reformers have turned the budget into something secret and inaccessible. One can only explain with any distinctness the situation regarding the state budget in 1993 using truisms. It, as it were, existed and did not exist simultaneously. There were drafts of the budget (delayed, true, for at least a half year); however, no final portrait can be obtained from them. No one discussed and adopted it. Without a doubt, the entire year of 1993 was -- to put it mildly -- a strange one in a legal respect. Budget oddities were in no way fewer than constitutional legal ones. The budget in the hands of Russia's ultra-liberals is surprisingly similar to the celebrated clothes of the king in the well-known fairy-tale -- first of all, probably because it has the property of not retaining fingerprints due to the ephemeral nature of the subject itself. A clever tailor was able to convince the king and his associates that he had cut out beautiful or, as the specialists say, almost deficit-free clothing. Alas, the unsophisticated, like the fairy-tale infant, people incited by the vigilant "enemies of reform" were in no hurry for some reason to go into ecstasies over the stiff savings in their wages, pensions, subsidies, and other payments. The absence of certain essential -- from the viewpoint of social decency -- details in the budget clothing evoked among them an understandable wish to know where the more than sizable "pieces" of the monetary fabric had disappeared. The people will hardly be satisfied with the recent explanation by B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer. It seems that the agrarians, who punched through an "unrealistic" (too big, isn't it?) state order, and the prime minister, who confirmed a price for grain at the world level (but is it really at the world level?) are guilty of the wage underpayments by the budget people since the "breakdown of the budget began because money had to be taken from others." The entire essence of his economic policy's ultra-liberalism and insolvency were expressed in this reasoning of the retired (fortunately) minister. From the viewpoint of liberal financiers, the budget would look much better if the Russian agrarians had not produced anything in general, if agriculture had ruined itself completely, if all grain had been purchased from American and other farmers paying for it with earnings from selling natural resources to the West, etc., etc. This liberal logic is so absurd and so abnormal that language does not exist to discuss it seriously from a worldly and scientific viewpoint. Nevertheless, we agreed for two years -- based on some evil intuition -- to listen to the barren flowers of liberalism. Liberalism is back where it started but the deceived people are participating in these young people's gatherings. Only the fact that people are apparently no longer building on the liberal chaff is consoling. Liberal reformers will only be able to achieve the reverse effect -- intense attention on their affairs -- with reasoning similar to the one cited above. Citizens are continuing to remind the authorities about their legitimate interests and needs. Not trite reasoning by retirees but answers to simple questions interest them. For example, with the supposedly existing acute shortage of assets, how could B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer, admit that astronomic sums -- according to the estimates of experts, they exceed the state's annual budget several-fold --that have state-wide natural resources as their only source contrive by some incomprehensively devious way not to be in the state treasury but in private accounts in Swiss banks? Upon whom has wealth of such frankly planetary scales fallen and how? What, in fact, was the state's budget? On the basis of what considerations and priorities was it compiled? How was it implemented? Was everything here straightforward from a legal and, moreover, from a moral point of view? Peace and harmony in society cannot be based on deceit or a desire to close one's eyes to the abominations of life nor can they be built on vengeance. Only truth and the political morality based on it can be the basis of a civil harmony aimed at a just reorganization of life.
