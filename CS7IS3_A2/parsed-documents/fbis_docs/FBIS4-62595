He was met at the airport by his representative Yuriy Smyrnov and by Vadym Chufrun, chairman of the oblast council. Leonid Makarovych stressed that the Donbass is a special industrial region which together with the other industrial oblasts of Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, and Zaporozhye defines the state of the economy in our country. The president of Ukraine held talks in Yenakiyevo with the heads of the state administrations of these oblasts and also with directors of metallurgical, coke oven, and coal industries. First, though, the inhabitants of this town surrounded Leonid Makarovych. Obviously, people are primarily concerned with social issues: prices, wages, housing, and medicines. As the president noted, they may be fully resolved when our state's economy begins to work as it should. The directors asked the president to adopt decrees that would solve the problems of credits, exports, and mutual nonpayment. The miners alone owe their subcontractors more than 5 trillion karbovantsi. Ilyushenko, director general of the Donetsk Vuhillya production association, said that these are the results of the unsuccessful actions of Kuchma's government. Hrihoriy Pyatachenko, Ukraine's minister of finance, and Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, explained to the directors that the present government is tackling precisely these problems and invited them to come to Kiev as a group next Monday in order to adopt a final decision aimed at pulling the Ukrainian economy out of the economic crisis. [passage omitted] [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ukraine was one of the first countries in the CIS to suffer the biggest economic shocks, above all, with regard to prices of energy sources, taking into account the great dependency of our industrial sector on energy sources. At the end of 1993, as you remember, we simply had a terrible rate of inflation, prices increased, and everything negative followed from this. Because of these shocks, Ukraine's economy sank very low. Thanks to the steps that were taken by the government, regardless of your criticism of it, we succeeded in holding out, although I should honestly tell you that in December I had some terrible feelings that we could lose control over the economy and even the situation. This is not a positive aspect which one should be proud of but, nevertheless, we could say that Ukraine held out. And now we are standing on the ground. The time has come when we, standing here on this ground, should now start a new stage in our economic activity and should build a foundation on it. Well-considered steps and extremely radical steps are required. We must therefore combine considered actions with radicalism and executive activity, discipline, order, and organizational ability.
