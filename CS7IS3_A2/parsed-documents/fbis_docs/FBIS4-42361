FBIS4-42361 "drweu106_i_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-106 Daily Report 20 May 1994 FRANCE Poll Reveals Disinterest in EU Election Poll Reveals Disinterest in EU Election BR2605082394 Paris LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE in French 20 May 94 pp 20-23 BR2605082394 Paris LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE French BFN [Report by Michele Cotta on poll commissioned by LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE: "Is There a Cure for Euroskepticism?"] [Excerpts] We should call a spade a spade. France today does not have, or no longer has, any enthusiasm for Europe. French citizens' disinterest is growing from one poll to the next, as is the fear that European integration is running counter to national interests. The poll carried out by Sofres [French Opinion Polling Company] and LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE from 7 to 11 May confirms this trend. Just one month before the elections, to be held on 12 June, 44 percent of the French admit that they are only slightly or not at all interested in the upcoming elections. Even more significant is the fact that the proportion of French people which has decided not to vote is rising. In late April, 50 percent said they would abstain. Today, in the midst of the campaign, 53 percent said they would not. Only 47 percent of French people have decided to go to the polls. Women are more hesitant than men, and those under 34 years of age are more reticent than their elders. Workers and employees are among those most likely to ignore the elections, whereas farmers -- surprise, surprise -- are exactly in the average of their fellow citizens: 47 percent of them say they intend to vote. [passage omitted] The following poll was carried out by Sofres for LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE from 7 to 11 May 1994 on a national sample of 1,000 people representative of the entire population aged 18 or more.
