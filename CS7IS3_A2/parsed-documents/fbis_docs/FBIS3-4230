All this forcefully promoted the further development of the opening to the outside world. The contacts with the capitals of foreign countries and foreign cities are unprecedentedly vigorous. As of now, the municipality has established friendly ties with 18 foreign cities and government- level contacts with 96 capitals cities of 72 foreign countries. The number of persons entering and leaving the border increased rapidly. The foreign economic and trade volume increased by a big margin. The import and export volume reached $3.04 billion.

Districts and counties made great headway in developing foreign affairs. The mass organizations established closer contacts with the outside world.

Simultaneously, we must notice that we still lag behind in emancipating the mind and suiting the demands of reform, opening up, and modernization.

In his speech, Li Qiyan expressed thanks to the foreign affairs office of the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the central departments concerned for their support to the work of Beijing Municipality. He stressed: Beijing's foreign affairs work is related to the implementation of the central foreign policies and the image of the state. So, we must conscientiously and comprehensively implement to the letter the basic line of the party and define the line of foreign affairs according to the basic line of the party. The primary task is to serve the foreign affairs of the central authorities and to positively work in cooperation with the central authorities to fulfill various specific tasks. We should make the foreign affairs work serve the economic construction, further emancipate the mind, pioneer channels for attracting foreign affairs, promote the cooperation in the economic and trade and scientific and technological spheres, and promote the economic development of the municipality. The foreign affairs work should serve the capital's political and social stability. This is the primary task of the municipality. The foreign affairs work should serve this overall situation. Li Qiyan also urged the necessity to stress the unified and centralized leadership over the foreign affairs work and to guard against the practice of each acting according to its own way. The party committees and governments at various levels should pay attention to foreign affairs work. The party and government top leaders should personally engage themselves in the foreign affairs work. The newly elected district and county leaders should pay attention to studying the party's foreign policies, the knowledge of foreign affairs, and foreign etiquette. We should intensify the construction of the foreign affairs worker contingents, strengthen the improvement of administrative honesty and diligence, set strict demands, and grasp the study of politics, policies, professional knowledge, and foreign languages.
