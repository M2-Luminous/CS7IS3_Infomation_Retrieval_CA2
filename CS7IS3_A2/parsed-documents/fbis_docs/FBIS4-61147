In his opinion, the introduction of a new national currency, lari, is now highly questionable, since even a small stabilization of Georgian coupon is impossible. "It is impossible to exist on account of emission. We increase every quarter the money issue which is not secured by the real content, thus subjecting the people to hyper-inflation", said Djavakhishvili. He observed that "Georgian economy doesn't even compensate its expenses for gas". "If so, then we should not use gas at all. By the way, nearly 80 percent of Georgian population actually do not use gas. Only Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi and Kutaissi receive gas", noted the head banker of Georgia. He also suggested that the Georgian Government would finally make a decision: "In the case Georgia goes towards the ruble zone, rather than strengthens its coupon, the government needs a new chairman of the National Bank", said Djavakhishvili.
