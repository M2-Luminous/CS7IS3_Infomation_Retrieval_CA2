FBIS3-29445 "dreas034__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-034-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Motorola Request for Numerical Targets Rebuffed OW1802133494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 16 Feb 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1802133494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It is known that with Japan and the United States being locked in confrontation over automobiles and mobile phones, the U.S. firm Motorola has asked the Japan Mobile Communications Company [JMCC] to set numerical targets for the purchase of its mobile phones. In response, JMCC has rejected this request by claiming that "making any commitment to our future purchase of mobile phones runs counter to free competition." This is the first time that Motorola, Inc. has asked for numerical targets, in taking advantage of the recent Japanese-U.S. mobile-phone friction, which has its roots in the "1989 Japanese-U.S. agreement." It has become clear that Motorola, Inc. has a strategy of pressing Japan not only to increase the number of ground relay stations serving it but also to increase the purchase of its mobile phones. JMCC has decided to invest 30 billion yen in building more ground relay stations for Motorola's mobile-phone service in Japan over the next two or three years. The U.S. mobile-phone company expects the number of its subscribers to grow to 450,000 by the end of 1996. Motorola, Inc. has asked JMCC to place orders for 225,000 sets of Motorola-made mobile phones within 45 days after Japanese subscribe to Motorola's mobile-phone service. The U.S. mobile phone company also has asked JMCC to increase the ground relay stations available to it "two years earlier than planned." Motorola, Inc. is posed to press Japan for the simultaneous expansion of market access and purchases, but JMCC is resisting this pressure, asserting, "The Japanese mobile-phone market will be liberalized in April, and we cannot accept the request of Motorola, Inc." Motorola's request, which was made just before 15 February, which is the deadline set by the U.S. Government for a survey of the Japanese mobile-phone market, was an "ultimatum." For this reason, the growing opinion is that the breakdown of the Japanese-U.S. framework talks has influenced the United States to "confirm Japan's violation of the Japanese-U.S. agreement."
