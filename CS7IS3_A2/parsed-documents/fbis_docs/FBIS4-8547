FBIS4-8547 "dreeu072_p_94006" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 POLAND Pawlak Invites Unions to Government Meeting Pawlak Invites Unions to Government Meeting WS1304144194 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 13 Apr 94 p 2 WS1304144194 Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA Polish BFN [Article by PAD and B.I.W.: "Solidarity `Omitted' by the Government"] [Text] Roman Adamczyk, chief of the Prime Minister's Office, forwarded a letter to Solidarity ["S"], in which he stated that, "during its Tuesday [12 April] session, the Council of Ministers will discuss the motions resulting from the negotiations and the talks of government and union experts, and the talks with employees' organizations held so far." Similar letters were sent to the chairpersons of 17 other unions. At the same time, the prime minister invited the chairpersons of the unions to a meeting in the Office of the Council of Ministers that is to be held this afternoon. "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski announced that he will not participate in the meeting; however, the union will send an observer. On Tuesday, the Presidium of the "S" National Committee [KK], which had a session in Gdansk, waited for the government reply as to how it was going to implement the union demands. KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak said that "S" will wait for this reply only until the KK starts its session--that is, until this morning. The KK will make a decision concerning the further course of the "S" protest action. Unofficially, Pawlak's letter was interpreted as an attempt to bypass the deadline, set by "S" for 12 April, for forwarding the reply to the union. The letter does not say that the government has taken a stand on the "S" demands and that it will make a decision; it merely says that it will "discuss the motions." Despite the announcement made toward the end of March that the protocol of the talks between the government and union experts would be discussed at the nearest session of the Council of Ministers (incidentally, the nearest session was held earlier), such an item did not appear on yesterday's agenda of the session of the Council of Ministers. In the Government's Press Office, we were told that "it may be under the `various issues' item, and the `various issues' may include various matters of the last moment." The union spokesman announced that "S" will protest against the new version of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. The KK Presidium believes that the Sejm "should complete the proceedings against Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak, so that those responsible for imposing martial law can be judged by both the Constitutional Tribunal and general courts." "S" believes that the Sejm "should also represent the stand of the extraparliamentary opposition on this issue." The KK also criticized the work of the Selection Committee of the National Investment Fund [NFI]. According to the "S" leadership, most of the candidates for members of the Supervisory Boards of the NFI selected by the committee are people who have their roots in the former party nomenklatura. "S" believes that, in the Supervisory Boards, there should be room for delegates of representative unions.
