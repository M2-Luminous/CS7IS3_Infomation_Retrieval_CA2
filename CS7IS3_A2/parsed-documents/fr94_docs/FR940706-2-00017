Estimated Number of Awards: 1 to 5 per eligible State or territory. Note: The Department is not bound by any estimates in this notice. Project Period: Up to 60 months. Applicable Regulations: (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, and 86; and (b) The program regulations in 34 CFR Parts 364 and 366. It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations. However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30, 1994. The comment period for the NPRM ended on June 13, 1994. A total of 40 comments were received from centers (21), State agencies (11), Statewide Independent Living Councils and other statewide organizations (4), national constituent organizations (3), and an individual (1). The comments were generally favorable and constructive. The following is a summary of the substantive comments received on the NPRM and of the changes that are expected to be made, based on public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review and that may affect applicants under this competition. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. Only one commenter objected to the 30-day comment period. The Secretary considered a 30-day comment period necessary because a longer comment period would not have left enough time to publish this notice inviting applications for competitive awards for new centers under this program for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Secretary also considered a 30-day comment period adequate because of the extensive opportunity for input and comment that was afforded to the public prior to publishing the NPRM. The Secretary does not believe it is necessary to extend the comment period.
