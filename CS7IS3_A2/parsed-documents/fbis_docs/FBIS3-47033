Depending on future political changes, Russia may become an "unstable factor in the world." Consequently, moves have been observed within CIS member states, East Europea, and among Western nations to reexamine their strategies toward Russia. We asked Koji Watanabe, newly appointed ambassador to Russia who will assume his new post in late January, about Japan's policy toward Russia with which there exists a territorial dispute. [Kitamura] How do you evaluate the election results for the new Russian Federal Assembly? [Watanabe] The results were quite unexpected. The emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the ultranationalist leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, and the fact that the reformists did not make sufficient efforts to communicate with the people, were factors leading to such an outcome. [Kitamura] Could the results have any effect on Japanese policy toward Russia? [Watanabe] I do not think Zhirinovskiy's "diplomatic arguments" will be reflected in the Russian Government's diplomatic policies. However, it is also certain the dissatisfaction of Russians who are suffering because of their living conditions and their nationalistic feelings are reflected in Zhirinovskiy's remarks. Therefore, we must be cautious about this. [Kitamura] Could the results hamper progress in negotiations on the territorial issue? [Watanabe] I cannot tell. When President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last year, a basic framework for territorial talks was agreed on between the leaders of the two nations. What is important is to persistently negotiate within this framework to strive for concrete progress. [Kitamura] Moves have been observed among Western nations on reexamining aid to Russia. What is your view on this? [Watanabe] It is true some nations are on the alert, but basically there are two opinions. The first is that more active support should be provided to Russia, and the second is that a few changes should be made on how such aid should be provided. Japan maintains it should not change the basic policy on Russian aid which has been continued so far, provided President Yeltsin continue with his reform efforts. [Kitamura] Voices have also been raised in Japan urging caution regarding aid to Russia at this time. How do you feel about this? [Watanabe] It is very important, not only in terms of world peace but also for Japan as a neighboring country, that Russia develop into a stable and democratic nation. It is also of great significance for Japan to provide support toward such a goal together with other major industrialized nations. Of course, I also realize the importance of public support on this matter. [Kitamura] What is your view on cooperation between Japan and Russia regarding security in the Asia-Pacific region? [Watanabe] Although Russia's existence is very important for this region, we must discern Russia's moves in order to determine how we can actually cooperate with Russia, realistically speaking. After all, Russian politics is centered in Europe. [Kitamura] Russia has sought Japanese aid concerning its dumping of radioactive waste at sea. What is your view on this? [Watanabe] For its part, Japan must help Russia since bilateral relations would be seriously affected should such dumping reoccur. [Kitamura] Are there any plans for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to visit Russia? [Watanabe] I have heard a new Russian cabinet will be inaugurated around 10 January. Vice ministerial-level meetings are to be held in January to prepare for Foreign Minister Hata's visit to Russia. I hope Prime Minister Hosokawa will also be able to visit Russia soon.
