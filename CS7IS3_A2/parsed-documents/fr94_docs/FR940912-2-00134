FR940912-2-00134 FR940912-2-00093 The Applicants now propose to finance the acquisition, and hold the securities, of: (i) foreign utility companies (``FUCOs''), as defined in Section 33 of the Act, subject to certain limitations; and (ii) companies (``Intermediate Companies'') engaged directly or indirectly and exclusively in the business of owning and holding the securities of one or more FUCOs and/or exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32 of the Act, subject to certain limitations. Investments in and financings of FUCOs and Intermediate Companies will be subject to the $100 million limit authorized in the January 1994 Order. The financings and investments in FUCOs and Intermediate Companies may take the same form and will be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as set forth in the January 1994 Order. In addition, the Applicants propose to issue guarantees and assume the liabilities of FUCOs and Intermediate Companies in connection with development activities, including construction and permanent financing. Until such time as there is no possibility of a claim against Northeast or Charter Oak, the full contingent amount of any such guarantees and assumptions of liability would be included in the $100 million limit authorized in the January 1994 Order. The Applicants state that they have found that the ability to respond quickly to investment opportunities in FUCOs and finance the acquisition, and hold the securities, of Intermediate Companies to make such investments is necessary in order to compete effectively in this market in accordance with the principles set forth in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Applicants also state that the use of Intermediate Companies is often necessitated by business concerns such as foreign ownership requirements in countries where FUCOs are located or to facilitate investments via a consortium of companies where each member of the consortium has a consolidated subsidiary involved in the final FUCO structure for tax and accounting purposes and to ease subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among members of the ownership group. EUA Cogenex Corporation (70&hyph;8441) EUA Cogenex Corporation (``Cogenex''), Boot Mills South, 100 Foot of John Street, Lowell, Massachusetts, 01852, a non-utility subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates (``EUA''), a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 86, 87, 90 and 91 thereunder. Cogenex proposes to form and finance a new non-utility subsidiary, EUA Cogenex_Canada (``Cogen Canada''). Cogen Canada would consult and provide energy management and demand-side management services to institutional customers in Canada. Specifically, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1996 for (a) the organization of Cogen Canada under the laws of Canada and (b) the acquisition by Cogenex of all 100 shares of common stock to be issued by Cogen Canada for $1.00 each. Additionally, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1995 to provide equity and debt funding for Cogen Canada and for Cogen Canada to borrow from third parties in amounts not to aggregate more than $20 million outstanding. Also, Cogenex seeks Commission authorization through December 31, 1997 to sell certain equipment and services to Cogen Canada and for EUA Service Corporation (``EUASC'') to provide certain management, financial and other services to Cogen Canada. Cogenex would charge Cogen Canada for such goods and services on a fair market value basis. By order dated December 19, 1986 (HCAR No. 24273) (``1986 Order''), the Commission authorized EUA to acquire the predecessor corporation of Cogenex, in order to provide certain energy management services in New England and, to a limited extent, outside New England. By order dated September 17, 1992 (HCAR No. 25636) (``1992 Order''), the Commission authorized Cogenex to provide additional energy management and demand-side management (``DSM'') services and to develop cogeneration projects. The 1992 Order also expanded the area in which such services could be provided without limitation to New York (together with New England, ``Base Region''). By order dated June 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25839) (``1993 Order''), the Commission authorized Cogenex to borrow up to $50 million from EUA in short-term debt through December 31, 1995. The 1986 and 1992 Orders authorized Cogenex to provide energy management and DSM services without limitation to customers within the Base Region. These orders also authorized Cogenex to provide such services to customers outside the Base Region provided that the revenues for such services to those customers not exceed the revenues for such services inside the Base Region (``Fifty Percent Requirement''). The 1986 and the 1992 Orders imposed no restriction on revenues from consulting services. Cogen Canada and Cogenex would provide energy management and DSM services outside the Base Region, subject to the Fifty Percent Requirement. The application-declaration proposes, however, that revenues from such services in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick be included in the revenues of the Base Region and purposes of assessing compliance with the Fifty Percent Requirement. Cogenex also proposes that there be no restriction on revenues of Cogenex and Cogen Canada from consulting services and that Cogenex be permitted to market its consulting services worldwide. Cogenex seeks authorization through December 31, 1995 to provide EUA with debt and equity financing (``Cogenex Investments''). Such funds would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances and/or short-term loans. All short-term loans and advances by Cogenex to Cogen Canada would be made on the basis of the terms available to Cogenex on short-term loans from EUA under the 1993 Order. Specifically, these arrangements provide for borrowings at the prime rate or money market rates, together with a commitment fee of 1/4 of 1%. Each such loan or advance would mature in one year or less.
