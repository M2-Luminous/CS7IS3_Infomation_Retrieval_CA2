The western edge of the nonattainment area until it meets Remine Creek is defined as follows: A tract of land located in a portion of the west one-half of Section 28 and the east one-half of Section 29, Township 43 North, Range 9 west, of the New Mexico Principal Meridian, County of San Miguel, State of Colorado, described as follows: Beginning at the southwest corner of the said Section 28; Thence N 89 ○36 ’00 ’ ’ W. 292.70 Feet; Thence S 04 ○05 ’12 ’ ’ W. 538.63 Feet; Thence N 03 ○29 ’42 ’ ’ W. 780.19 Feet; Thence N 22 ○15 ’00 ’ ’E. 3344.16 Feet; Thence S 51 ○51 ’49 ’ ’ E. 570.44 Feet; Thence S 03 ○15 ’36 ’ ’ E. 1106.22 Feet; Thence S 45 ○24 ’42 ’ ’ E. 546.96 Feet; Thence S 28 ○41 ’12 ’ ’ W. 549.62 Feet; Thence S 29 ○40 ’09 ’ ’ E. 169.68 Feet; Thence S 44 ○30 ’03 ’ ’ W. 649.51 Feet; Thence S 85 ○54 ’00 ’ ’ E. 660.00 Feet; Thence S 04 ○06 ’00 ’ ’ W. 660.00 Feet; Thence N 89 ○56 ’00 ’ ’ E. 1318.68 Feet; to the true point of beginning containing 11249 acres as described above. lThen, at Remine Creek, the nonattainment boundary follows the service area boundary for 9.65 miles to the 9,200 foot contour line. The boundary then intersects Bear Creek. Here the nonattainment boundary diverges from the service area boundary (9,200 foot contour line). The nonatttainment boundary continues in a west, southwest direction for 0.92 miles from the intersection of the 9,200 foot contour line and Bear Creek to the top of ski lift number 9 in the Telluride Ski Area at an elevation of about 11,900 feet. The boundary then shifts and runs in a north-westerly direction for 0.83 miles from the top of lift 9 to the top of lift 7, which is located at an elevation of 10,490 feet. From the top of lift 7, the nonattainment boundary continues in a north-westerly direction for 0.5 miles to the intersection of lift 3 with the 10,000 foot control line. The nonattainment boundary follows the 10,000 foot contour line in a south, south-west direction for 3.2 miles, until it intersects Skunk Creek. Here the boundary diverges from the 10,000 foot contour line and follows Skunk Creek in a northerly direction for 2.25 miles. At the intersection of Skunk Creek and Colorado State Highway 145, the nonattainment boundary leaves the creek and follows Highway 145 in a northerly direction until it meets the service area boundary as it existed prior to changes adopted in 1991 * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22527 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;P&hyph;M
