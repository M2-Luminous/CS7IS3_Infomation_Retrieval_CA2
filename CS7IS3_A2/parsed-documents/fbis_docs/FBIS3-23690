Morozova, Geology and Geophysics Institute, Uzbek Academy of Sciences, Tashkent; UDC 528.871] [Abstract] An analysis of imagery from the NOAA 11 and NOAA 12 satellites (scale 1:25 000 000) revealed cloud anomalies over faults near the epicenters of earthquakes in Armenia in December 1988 and in Turkey in March-April 1992. No allowance is made for the possibility of influence of gravity fields. Two photographs showing the pattern of cloud cover at the time of these events are interpreted. The appearance of these cloud anomalies gives evidence of an intensification of tectonic activity in these regions. For example, the geometry of the cloud lineament accompanying the Spitak earthquake rigorously corresponds to the pattern of faults at the surface and therefore this lineament unquestionably is associated with crustal faults. Other cloud phenomena included ridges, corridors without clouds and sharply defined boundaries of cloud masses. Much the same was observed during seismic events occurring in Turkey. The fact that strong earthquakes in the Near East were accompanied by an atmospheric reaction registered on space imagery inspires hope that this phenomenon can be used in evaluating the tectonic activity of regions or, in a special case, seismicity. The interrelationship of the largest faults in the Near East, repeatedly generating catastrophic earthquakes, as revealed in the studied space photographs, further confirms the results given earlier by V. G. Trifonov, et al. in GEOTEKTONIKA, No 6, pp 46-60, 1990. Figures 2; references: 4 Russian.
