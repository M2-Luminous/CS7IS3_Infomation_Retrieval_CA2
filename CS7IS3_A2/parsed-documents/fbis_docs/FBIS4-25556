A reform package would be introduced only when it would benefit the overall interest of the general public, Mr Jiang, was recently quoted as saying. It would be put in place only when the overall economy and society could stand for it, Mr Jiang added. Mr Jiang appeared to be more reserved than other leaders about the reforms. Chinese sources said the leader's remarks were revealed by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua during an important speech to senior economic officials at a national meeting on price in Beijing earlier this month. Mr Zou said the remark by the party boss was the consensus of all senior leaders' views and should act as a guideline for future economic reforms. The guideline, initiated by Mr Jiang, was also discussed and agreed by the party politburo at a recent meeting, a Chinese economic source quoted the vice-premier as telling senior economic officials from central ministries and provincial authorities. China analysts and economists said the remarks were tantamount to ruling out any radical reforms, apparently highlighting the increasing concern among senior leaders with projected reform packages. Despite this leaders have been cautious about pushing forward reform packages, many of which were worked out late last year and expected to be put in place either this year or next, they appear to be striking what they call a "balance among growth, reforms and social stability". [sentence as published] "Now, Mr Jiang apparently rules out the possibility in pushing forward those more sensitive reforms as they could have by and large some impact on the economics and society," a Hong Kong-based mainland economist said. Mr Jiang said that as political and economic situations were much more complicated than a decade ago, they required officials responsible for reforms and the economy to be much more cautious. Mr Jiang added that although reform packages could be introduced, they should be implemented step-by-step. However, officials should watch the implementation of reform policy closely and review the situation and the effectiveness regularly after it was introduced, Mr Jiang said.
