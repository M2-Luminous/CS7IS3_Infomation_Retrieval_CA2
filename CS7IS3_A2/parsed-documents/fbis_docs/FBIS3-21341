Dr. Jamshidi said on Thursday in an interview with an IRNA reporter: Industrial goods in the area of exports have two advantages, the relative low cost of energy and especially low wages. He added: In some industries, including tiles, our country has the ability to compete with foreign countries. At the present time, Iranian tiles are exported to Kuwait and the Persian Gulf sheikdoms. Also, contracts have been signed to export them to Central Asian countries. He said: Subsidies for export goods are meaningless; goods must be produced to be competitive with similar foreign goods. Dr. Jamshidi said: After the foreign currency rate became a floating rate in an attempt to prevent the entry of foreign goods, tariffs and commercial taxes were increased. At the present time, however, on the whole they are still not sufficient.
