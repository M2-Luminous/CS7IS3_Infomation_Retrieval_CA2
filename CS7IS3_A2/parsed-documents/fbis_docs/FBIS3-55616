During the visit, Belarusian and U.S. officials are expected to specify their positions on the issue of security guarantees for Belarus, which has implemented its constitutional law to become a neutral and nonnuclear state. Although it is unlikely that such guarantees will be announced on 16 January, in a conversation with BELAPAN, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich said that he will present, within the framework of Bill Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, Belarus' strategy for establishing a belt of neutral countries in Central Europe. Problems connected with the protection of U.S. investments in Belarus will also be discussed during the negotiations.
