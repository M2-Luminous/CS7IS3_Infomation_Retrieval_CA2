Before their departure, Aydar and Kilinc, both from southeast Turkey, said that their objective was not to complain about Turkey. They said that they were to appear before the commission so that their friends, currently in prison, will receive a just trial. The DEP, which has 13 seats in the 450-seat parliament, has been the focus of angry public reaction in Turkey, especially because its members refused to condemn or criticize the bloody attacks of the separatist terror organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The PKK has been waging a bloody campaign against the Turkish state which has claimed nearly 11,000 lives over the last 10 years. [passage omitted]
