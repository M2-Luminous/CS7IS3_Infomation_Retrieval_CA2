FR940202-0-00006 FR940202-0-00002 Three commenters made drafting suggestions, such as (1) replacing the reference to ``buyer and seller,'' which is appropriate in a securities market, with the more generic ``participates on both sides'' of the market, and (2) clarifying that an institution may be active in one or more financial markets simultaneously. The Board has revised the rule to incorporate both of these suggestions. Under ยง231.3(a) of the final rule, a person meets the qualitative test if it ``represents that it will engage in financial contracts as a counterparty on both sides of one or more financial markets.'' Quantitative Test Fourteen commenters cited problems with the proposed quantitative test. Seven commenters noted that financial market participants will have difficulty verifying whether their counterparties meet the volume thresholds because publicly available financial statements typically do not present information in a format that would allow verification. Five commenters stated that small-volume dealers would be placed at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in concentration of trading at large dealers and barriers to entry. In addition, two commenters noted that the test would penalize business wind-downs, as financial institutions would cease to be covered as their contracts expired. Two commenters argued that counterparties could circumvent the test by engaging in reciprocal transactions to raise their outstanding principal amounts artificially. As a solution to the problems cited above, eight commenters suggested that the Board eliminate the quantitative test. These commenters stated that the qualitative test would be sufficient to guarantee coverage of parties with a material presence in the financial markets, so a quantitative test is unnecessary. The purpose of the rule, however, is to further the Act's objectives of increasing efficiency and decreasing systemic risk in the financial markets. The qualitative test targets institutions that are market intermediaries in order to restrict coverage to those entities that can reasonably be included in the Act's definition of ``financial institution.'' The qualitative test alone does not necessarily focus on those institutions whose coverage would help achieve the Act's objectives. The purpose of the quantitative test is to ensure that a covered institution engages in a level of business such that its failure to meet its obligations could create systemic risk. The Board believes that most institutions that meet the qualitative test engage in a volume of transactions substantially above the quantitative test thresholds. Although institutions entering the market may not be able to meet the quantitative test right away, the test would aid in reducing systemic risk by helping to ensure the creditworthiness of new market participants because they would have to achieve a certain level of market participation without the benefit of certainty of the validity of netting provided by the rule. In addition, the quantitative test tends to encourage active market participation by financial institutions by requiring them to meet certain volume thresholds within a set period of time. The netting contracts of institutions that are winding down their businesses would continue to be covered as long as the institution entered into the contracts while it qualified as a financial institution. (See discussion of timing issues below and ยง231.3(b) of the final rule.) For these reasons, the Board has retained the proposed quantitative test in ยง231.3(a) (1) and (2) of the final rule. The commenters also suggested changes in the event the quantitative test is not eliminated. Five commenters asked that the volume thresholds be reduced from $1 billion in notional principle to $500 million and from $100 million in gross mark-to-market positions to $50 million. As the Board does not believe these thresholds would be overly limiting, it has not decreased the threshold levels. The Board may reexamine the thresholds if it finds that these levels prove to be overly limiting. One commenter suggested that the Board establish one set of quantitative thresholds for dealers, but allow non-dealers to be covered at higher thresholds. As discussed above, the Board believes that inclusion of end users, even at higher volume thresholds, would be a stretch of the term ``financial institution.'' Another commenter suggested that the quantitative test measure average activity levels over a 24-month period to discourage short-run attempts to increase activity. Although using average volumes could help discourage artificial short-run increases in activity, it would also add more complexity to the determination of whether an institution meets the quantitative test. Rather than focusing on one day in a 15-month period, averaging would require surveillance of activity on a much more frequent basis. The final rule retains the proposed ``one-day'' test.
