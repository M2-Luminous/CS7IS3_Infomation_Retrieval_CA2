What was the cause of this trouble? [Hirano] The ostensible reasons for Prime Minister Hosokawa's sudden resignation were the improper management of his personal funds by one of his old friends and the Diet deadlock over the FY 1994 budget bills, which was brought on by scandal allegations against him. Prime Minister Hosokawa decided to step down from a sense of responsibility. However, behind the scenes, there was a more important problem. The Hosokawa administration, which was launched as a reform government, achieved its goal with the enactment of the political reform bills. Therefore, after the passage of the bills, it was indispensable to strengthen the coalition's unity by reviewing the previous agreement reached by the coalition parties, and by working out a new policy platform. Unfortunately, Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to strengthen the framework of the ruling coalition, and this was the real reason for his resignation. In my opinion, what brought about the collapse of the Hosokawa administration was the secret attempt by a certain group in the ruling coalition to form an alliance with the members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who favor preservation of the peace Constitution. [Shuto] Are you talking about Sakigake's [Harbinger] plan to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]? [Hirano] Yes. There are some indications that Sakigake has been pondering the plan since the middle of February. According to sources close to Prime Minister Hosokawa, at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting February, U.S. President Bill Clinton said to the prime minister, "When the Japanese Government has to make a decision about North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program, a certain key person in the ruling coalition might become a bottleneck." [Shuto] I guess that President Clinton was alluding to Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura. By the way, how did Sakigake carry forward its plan to create a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ? [Hirano] According to sources close to Prime Minister Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura had planned to submit his resignation to the prime minister on 13 April if the LDP's demand that the prime minister agree to summon his former aide to testify to the Diet about Hosokawa's personal finances had continued to hold up deliberations on the FY 1994 budget. I think that his resignation from the cabinet was part of his scenario to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ. Meanwhile, the heads of three parties--the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake--have stressed that the process to select a successor to Hosokawa should be handled by the heads of the parties rather than by the secretaries general. The call for a top meeting by the heads of the coalition parties in effect meant that they wanted to set up a completely new government. Sakigake's plan to create a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ was lurking in the background. According to the information available, those who had planned to create the grand alliance had already reached agreement on such issues as tax reform and a revision of the UN Peacekeeping Operations [PKO] Cooperation Law. I heard that they had agreed not to raise the consumption tax and to continue the freeze on participation of Self-Defense Forces personnel in UN peacekeeping forces [when the so-called PKO law was enacted in 1992, it was agreed that the provision prohibiting participation in PKO would be reviewed after three years]. [Shuto] I have one more question. I have heard that these people expected an early dissolution of the lower house so that the next general election would be held again under the old multiseat electoral system. Is this true? [Hirano] I suppose so. They should have planned the following scenario: win a majority in the lower house election held under the old electoral system, kill the new electoral system in a vote, or divide the nation into single-seat electoral districts in their own way, if it is not possible to kill the system. [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government from outside the cabinet. What do you think of this? [Hirano] Sakigake has been proposing its own policy goals, using fine language. To me, it seems that this party is only making irresponsible statements. It always says nice things, but it never wants to bear responsibility. Such an attitude could be seen during the debate over the rice issue and during the turmoil caused by the prime minister's plan to impose a 7-percent welfare tax. It seems to me that Sakigake is just trying to hold the deciding vote while advocating its policy goals. When Sakigake set out its basic stand on major issues, it pledged to respect the peace Constitution. However, its respect for the peace Constitution is qualitatively different from the SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace Constitution. Therefore, even if Sakigake tries to push its policy under the slogan of "respect for the peace Constitution," the public will probably give the party a frigid stare, although most Sakigake lawmakers are taking it seriously. [Shuto] Could you please explain the basic stand taken by Shinseito leaders, including Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa? [Hirano] Policy goals should be consistent with political ideologies, and this should be the basis of a government. It is only right for political groups sharing similar political ideologies to join hands in forming a government. Shinseito has always assumed that an alliance was possible, not only with Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, but also with other LDP members having the same aspirations as ours. Meanwhile, the Hosokawa administration valued cooperation with the United States above everything else. Our party is trying to follow this line, but those who wanted to form an LDP-SDPJ alliance have different beliefs. For instance, they think that Japan should not take a firm attitude toward North Korea, which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons. [Shuto] Parties in the ruling coalition have finally reached a policy agreement on which to form a new government, after a tense deadlock over different issues, including the question of how to deal with the DPRK's alleged development of nuclear weapons. [Hirano] The North Korean nuclear issue is really important because it directly affects Japan's national security. If worse comes to worst, and if the government is unable to take appropriate actions to cope with the situation, then Japan will fall into utter confusion. As for tax reform, if the government does not come up with a concrete plan before this summer, Japan will be isolated at the annual G-7 economic summit to be held in Naples. It is because these issues are so important that our party has insisted that the coalition members work out their differences before forming a new government. I believe that the public has understood why the coalition has put in so many hours on working out a new policy platform. Sakigake Wanted To Join Hands With LDP Members Favoring the Peace Constitution [Shuto] During the process to select a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa, Sakigake once tried to check the influence of the Shinseito-Komeito bloc by forming an alliance with the SDPJ and the DSP. What was Sakigake's real intention? [Tanaka] Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayawa, and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi were of the same opinion that many things had to be reviewed on the way that the ruling coalition had been running the government. The first point at issue is that some coalition members have made several attempts to do so in view of the next stage of the political realignment, under the pretext that these moves would support the coalition government. The Hosokawa administration, which was launched as a "political-reform government," gradually lost its uniting force after achieving its sole mission of political reform. Prime Minister Hosokawa tried to regain a uniting force by strengthening the framework under which the coalition government was formed. The problem was that some people had considered effecting the solidification of the framework in connection with the creation of a coalition-wide "new new party" in view of the next lower house election, which is supposed to be held under the new single-seat electoral system. Our party could not accept these two separate matters being treated in one lot. Meanwhile, those who considered the Hosokawa administration to be a non-LDP government before everything else thought that the problem would be settled simply by putting a new face in the prime minister's office. However, our party had a different view. The ruling coalition had been entrusted with a special mission to implement political reform. Now that it has accomplished its original duty, putting a new face in the prime minister's office was not enough. That was our opinion. [Shuto] Sakigake has unveiled its basic stand toward major issues, and it has advocated respect for the peace Constitution. Was this a message addressed to LDP members who are against revising the peace Constitution, saying that your party is willing to form an alliance with them? [Tanaka] Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, former Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda, and some other LDP members have inherited the pacifist policy that the so-called "mainstream conservative faction" has embraced since the LDP was formed in 1955. Our party always had a friendly feeling toward these LDP members, who have the same view that we do concerning the peace Constitution and the evaluation of the postwar period. If possible, we would like to join hands with them, and we still wish to do so. Sakigake thinks that Japan's peace Constitution should be preserved, at least until Japan can form a clear view of the situation on the Korean peninsula, a clear view regarding the prevention of nuclear proliferation. In this context, we can say that our statement was addressed to every political group that respects Japan's peace Constitution. [Shuto] The SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace Constitution is basically the same as yours. How far has Sakigake's plan to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ been carried forward? [Tanaka] It is true that some LDP members have approached me on the matter, because at that time, there was a story going around that Mr. Watanabe would leave the LDP to join forces with Shinseito and Komeito. Meanwhile, our party is giving the SDPJ credit for being a strong supporter of the peace Constitution. However, to tell the truth, we were far from reaching the stage of forming a new government under the framework of an LDP-SDPJ alliance for the protection of the peace Constitution. [Shuto] What was the meaning of the last political drama? [Tanaka] The most important result is that antagonism between LDP and non-LDP forces has decreased. This tendency should be welcomed. It has become clear that the LDP is neither able to stand as a powerful opposition nor determined to seize back the reins of government by solidifying its unity. In other words, there is no possibility of going back to the so-called "1955 order," the postwar political structure monopolized by the LDP. Metaphorically speaking, the non-LDP side has many new locomotives, while the LDP side has only railroad cars and unusable locomotives. There is no doubt that Shinseito constitutes a locomotive. As for Sakigake, it also wants to become a locomotive. In my opinion, the non-LDP side has been completely transformed into a new political force in the true sense of the word, and it is now clear that the new force will be divided into two groups in the near future. We have already entered the next phase of political realignment. [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government from outside the cabinet. Don't you think that this would mean the isolation of Sakigake in Nagata-cho? [Tanaka] We do not want to be isolated, but at the same time we are not afraid of becoming isolated. We had such a sentiment when we decided not to accept any position in the new cabinet. We do not feel isolated, because we do not think that Nagata-cho's political map corresponds exactly to the political map drawn by the public. On the contrary, we strongly feel that we have obtained a free hand, by staying under another framework of the ruling coalition. We can now speak with more freedom about political realignment and about the future of our country. Every move we make will no longer be perceived as being a result of a fierce power struggle within the ruling coalition. We have finally created a situation under which we can treat the question of political realignment and the question of maintaining a coalition government separately. We expect to set out our party platform in June. As a result, we now feel somewhat refreshed.
