Glassification of sodium-containing radioactive wastes requires non-alkaline or low alkali rock and slags or other materials. Specifically, basalt, datolite, quartz sand, fluorite, clays, and loams have been proposed. The advantages of loam are mainly that it is readily available throughout the Russian platform, contains all required glass-forming components, especially silica and alumina, low concentrations of alkaline oxides, and a large amount of clay particles of less than 1 micron particle size, which facilitates making a uniform paste or slurry having thixotropic properties and being capable of long term storage in closed containers as well as transportation by pipeline under pressure over long distances. In the present work a study was made of glass formation in systems Na[.sub]2[/]O (waste oxides)- Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]- SiO[.sub]2[/], encompassing glass compositions obtained from radioactive wastes and loam. Relationships between viscosity, specific electrical resistance, and chemical stability as functions of glass composition in a radioactive waste oxide-loam pseudo-binary system were determined. Infrared spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance indicated that at over 40 percent radioactive waste oxide content in the glasses, deep structural changes take place which are related to depolymerization of silicon-oxygen carcass manifested particularly as a marked increase in the leaching out rate sodium ions and cesium radionucleides.
