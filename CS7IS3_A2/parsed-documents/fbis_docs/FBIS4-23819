The aim is to search for a political solution to the Cabinda problem. So far, the meeting has gone well except that the FLEC-FAC [Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Cabinda Armed Forces] does not wish to cooperate. [Begin recording] [Tomas] As you know, efforts have been made over the past few years to reach internal consensus and make it possible for the government and Cabinda political forces to meet and find a peaceful solution to the Cabinda dispute. Yet, some of the radical wings, namely FLEC-FAC, have not responded positively. Right now, FLEC-FAC and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola are waging hostile actions against civilians. The residents have condemned such actions. [Unidentified correspondent] So, FLEC-FAC is the obstacle. [Tomas] Well, I cannot say that. FLEC-FAC is the political grouping that has been hindering a rapid solution to the problem in view of the interference by foreign forces opposed to the general interests of the people of Cabinda. [end recording] Tomas says FLEC-FAC's absence from the talks is not a major problem. Sooner or later there will be a solution to the Cabinda problem. What matters is for the provincial government to convey to the central government proposals that are endorsed by the majority of Cabinda residents. Those whom the governor has spoken to are for dialogue and reject war. [Begin Tomas recording] We are encouraged by the fact that all those we have spoken to believe that dialogue, instead of war is the way of resolving the Cabinda problem. Another important aspect is that leading forces living in Cabinda wish to play an active role in resolving the Cabinda problem. The idea is to mobilize intellectuals in Angola, whether they come from Cabinda or not, as well as men of goodwill who live in Zaire, Congo and elsewhere who are interested in a solution to the Cabinda problem.
