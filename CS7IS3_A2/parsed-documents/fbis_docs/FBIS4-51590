FBIS4-51590 "dreas084_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-084 Daily Report 2 May 1994 North Korea ROK, Japanese `Cooperation System' Denounced ROK, Japanese `Cooperation System' Denounced SK0205105194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1042 GMT 2 May 94 SK0205105194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Sinister Confab To Strengthen `Cooperation System'" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam reportedly called Hata, the new prime minister of Japan, on the phone on May 1 and agreed with him to strengthen the "cooperation system" between South Korea, Japan and the United States on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear issue". Abominable, indeed, is the act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam who ringed up Hata, who had consistently been engaged in the anti-DPRK campaign, as soon as the latter seated himself in the prime minister's office, to "congratulate" him upon his "assumption of office" and agreed with him to strengthen "cooperation system" against the DPRK. In the phone call the traitor Kim threw his weight behind the "unstable Hata regime" by saying "stability of the Japanese political situation is beneficial to Asia as a whole". And he ridiculously begged Hata to maintain the "foundation of diplomacy and cooperation in the international community" which had been agreed upon between South Korea and Japan while Hosokawa was in office. This eloquently tells that the Kim Yong-sam group is a group of special-class pro-U.S., pro-Japanese sycophant traitors who cannot subsist even a single day without the backing of the United States and Japan. Hata, taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear issue", said he would "maintain a steadfast stance" and "carry forward the Japan-South Korea cooperation system" established during Hosokawa's office as prime minister. This vividly indicates the Japanese authorities' insidious attempt to take an active part in the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. It is a futile attempt for the South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries to try to contain the DPRK militarily through tieup with each other. The Kim Yong-sam group must refrain from seeking a system to do harm to the nation, clearly mindful that the invocation of a "cooperation system" would finally result in ruining themselves. And the Japanese reactionaries had better discard their anachronistic daydream of harming others and act with discretion.
