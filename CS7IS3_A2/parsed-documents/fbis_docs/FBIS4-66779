FBIS4-66779 "jpnea027___94020" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 15 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Clinton Letter to Niranjan Shah Expresses Support Clinton Letter to Niranjan Shah Expresses Support 94AS0278A Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 15 Apr 94 p 19 94AS0278A Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Article by Abhay Vaidya: "Clinton's Step To Repair Ties With India"] [Text] Washington, April 14--In an effort to repair his relations with the Indian community in the United States, the U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, in a letter to Mr Niranjan Shah, a Chicago-based industrialist and trustee of the Federation of Associations, has expressed strong support for India's economic reforms. He also praised the cooperation between the two countries in science and technology, the United Nations' peace-keeping operations in Somalia and Cambodia, formulating the comprehensive test-ban treaty and the chemical weapons convention. Despite differences on some non-proliferation issues, we have worked together on a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a chemical weapons convention," Mr Clinton said in his letter of March 29. The tone and content of Mr Clinton's letter is significant in the light of recent fence-mending efforts by senior U.S. officials like the deputy secretary of state, Mr Strobe Talbott, and the assistant secretary, Ms Robin Raphel. Significantly, Mr Clinton refrained from making direct references to the Kashmir issue. He appreciated the efforts by private Indian organisations and the Indian government in addressing important human rights issues in the subcontinent, he wrote. "Our concern about human rights are part and parcel of a mature relationship between democracies," Mr Clinton said in his letter, adding, "We recognise the important work done by Indian private groups and individuals and the efforts by the government to address human rights problems." "We also encourage India to pursue peaceful solutions to problems at home and abroad that have posed threats to the security of that great nation," Mr Clinton said. The President assured Mr Shah that the ties between India and the United States "are solid and that there is great potential for further growth and cooperation between us." Mr Shah told TOINS [Times of India News Service] that he was concerned about the deterioration in Indo-U.S. relations after a series of provocative statements last year by Ms Raphel. In January he and some other prominent Indian-Americans from Chicago met Ms Raphel to express their concern over her remarks on Kashmir. On February 28, Mr Shah brought Ms Raphel's remarks on Kashmir to Mr Clinton attention when he visited Chicago in a re-election bid by the Congressman, Mr Dan Rostenkowski. During that meeting, Mr Shah said, the president made some positive assurances with regard to the Indian-American community. Interestingly, it was only a few months ago that the White House had provoked a strong protest from Indians over Mr Clinton's reply to a letter from a Washington-based Kashmiri secessionist, Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai. In a December 27 reply to Dr Fai Mr Clinton had said he was "looking forward to working with you and others to help bring peace to Kashmir." These words had prompted an intense reaction in India and among Indians in the United States. After that controversy, the White House appears to have restrained itself, seeking to prevent more controversies over the U.S. position on the Kashmir issue. This became apparent when Mr Clinton declined to reply to the Indo-American Kashmir Forum president, Dr Vijay K. Sazawal, who had written to the president about the tragic plight of Kashmiri Pandits in India. Mr Sazawal's January 7 letter was passed on by the White House to the U.S. State Department for a reply. Mr Ron D. Lorton, director of the office of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bhutan affairs, despatched a two-para reply saying: "I share your concern about the human rights situation in Kashmir, including the problems faced by the Kashmir Pandits. I hope that peace can soon be restored to this beautiful but troubled place."
