The daily paper RODONG SHINMUN affirms that the U.S. Government is exacerbating the situation by pressuring Pyongyang to accept a total inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, threatening to take the nuclear problem before the UN Security Council. North Korea has repeatedly denied charges that it is developing nuclear weapons on its territory and rejected the inspection by the international agency arguing that its installations are devoted to peaceful ends. The DPRK calls unjustified the position that has been taken by the White House and insists that a negotiated solution can be reached only through talks between Washington and Pyongyang, in order to reach a global agreement.
