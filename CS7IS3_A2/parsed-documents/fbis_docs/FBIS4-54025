The energy conservation projects will be handled by five firms including Nippon Steel, while the coal utilization projects will be handled by seven firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The respective firms have targeted fiscal year 1996 as the time by which they will demonstrate the commercial feasibility of technology for recycling heat produced as a by-product and removal of sulfuric contaminants, environmental technologies tailored for developing nations. The energy-conservation model project will involve the effective use of heat generated in the use of coal at steel plants to operate power-generating plant boilers. Japanese firms to participate in the project will include Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries and Chiyoda Corporation, in addition to Nippon Steel. Coal utilization technology will involve the development of low-cost sulphur removal systems and high-efficiency boilers to be installed in China, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
