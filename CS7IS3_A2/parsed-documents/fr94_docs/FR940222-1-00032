FR940222-1-00032 FR940222-1-00007 (i) HCFA has determined and announced that the NCD service meets the definition of ``significant cost'' in §417.401. (ii) The cost of that service was not included in the determination of the per capita rate of payment that HCFA pays the HMO or CMP. (iii) The NCD that established coverage of the service was issued on or after the date of the announcement of the per capita rate of payment for that contract year. (5) Examples. The following examples apply to NCD services of significant cost and show how the NCD announcement date (which determines whether the cost of that service is taken into account in calculating the per capita rate of payment) in turn determines when the HMO or CMP becomes responsible for furnishing or paying for the NCD service. Example A: An NCD is announced on September 1, 1993, effective on the date of announcement. Because this NCD was announced before September 7, 1993, the announcement date of the per capita rate of payment for calendar year 1994, a risk HMO or CMP is responsible for furnishing or paying for the NCD service beginning with calendar year 1994. Example B: An NCD is announced on December 1, 1993, effective on date of announcement. Because this NCD was announced after September 7, 1993, the announcement date of the per capita rate of payment for calendar year 1994, the risk HMO or CMP is not responsible for furnishing or paying for the NCD service until the beginning of calendar year 1995. * * * * * 4.

In §417.440, the section heading and paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) are revised to read as follows: §417.440 Entitlement to health care services from an HMO or CMP. (a) Basic rules. (1) Subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this part, a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP is entitled to receive health care services directly from, or through arrangements made by, the HMO or CMP, as specified in this section and §§417.442 and 417.444. (2) A Medicare enrollee is also entitled to receive timely and reasonable payment directly (or have payment made on his or her behalf) for services he or she obtained from a provider or supplier outside the HMO or CMP if those services meet either of the following conditions: (i) They are emergency services or urgently needed unforeseen services as defined in §417.401. (ii) They are services denied by the HMO or CMP and found (upon appeal under subpart Q of this part) to be services the enrollee was entitled to have furnished by the HMO or CMP. (b) Scope of services. (1) Part A and Part B services. Except as specified in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, a Medicare enrollee is entitled to receive from the HMO or CMP all the Medicare-covered services that are available to individuals residing in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area, as follows: (i) Medicare Part A and Part B services if the enrollee is entitled to benefits under both programs. (ii) Medicare Part B services if the enrollee is entitled only under that program. * * * * *
