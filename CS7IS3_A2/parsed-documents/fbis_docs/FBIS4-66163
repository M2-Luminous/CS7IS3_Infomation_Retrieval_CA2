Reform of the turnover tax system is this year's major item in financial and tax reform. Success or failure of this reform depends directly on the success or failure of the reform of the entire taxation system, and depends also directly on whether it will be possible to fully develop the very function of taxation. As we look at the objective demands with regard to taxation posed by China's socialist market economy, and as we look at the experiences and lessons gained in China and abroad in matters of reforming the turnover tax, China's thorough reform of the turnover tax system will have to be a matter of implementing the VAT. Specific Ideas for Comprehensive Implementation of the VAT Comprehensive implementation of the VAT means its fullest implementation in all areas of commodity production and circulation --excepting agriculture-- with due regard for the principles of fairness, neutrality, translucency, and universality, also having China's VAT conform to the standards of international practices. Specifically, it should comprise the following: 1. Abolishing the present product tax and business tax, combining the internal and external turnover taxes, abolishing the unified industrial and commercial tax, standardizing the current VAT, and having the VAT cover all the processes of commodity production and commodity circulation (excepting agriculture). 2. Thorough simplification of the VAT tariff, establishing a main tariff with no more than two brackets and a sundries tariff of one bracket. Once the comprehensive adjustment of the VAT will have been accomplished, it may be in order to levy a consumption tax, with different tax rates and within a suitable parameter, for commodities which require particular adjustments. 3. Implementing tax-excluded pricing, recording the amount of tax due on the invoices, and adopting the method of deducting tax according to the tax deduction law. 4. Demanding that all taxpayers separately report VAT due, and establishing a special VAT administrative organ, with modern facilities, for the collection and administration of VAT. After complete implementation of VAT, China's turnover tax system will have only two types of taxes, the VAT and the consumption tax. As soon as comprehensive adjustment of the VAT will have been completed, and as soon as the tax base and tax tariff will have been determined, it will then be possible to maintain a state of relative stability. The consumption tax shall undergo a special readjustment, the adjustment of its tax base and tax tariff may consider the economic circumstances. It is crucial for the comprehensive implementation of VAT that it cover the areas of commodity production and commodity circulation, and that there be an extensive simplification of the tax tariff, and also that effectiveness of tax collection and tax administration be ensured. The Necessity for Comprehensive Implementation of VAT In China's present turnover tax system there are three types of taxes: product tax, VAT, and business tax. The two kinds of turnover tax systems, the internal and the external one, and the current VAT have also been instituted on the understanding that the tax burden of the original product tax would be maintained. Therefore, no matter whether these taxes are named differently, all turnover taxes, including the VAT, show evident traces of the product tax; namely, they still levy taxes on the full amount from the taxpayers, without consideration for the taxpayers' costs. Although this will ensure revenue for public finance, there is here a serious problem of duplication of taxation, and this is detrimental to a fair equilibrium of tax burdens as between import commodities and domestic commodities. China's present turnover tax system is excessively complex, and there are too many tax brackets. The present system of unified industrial and commercial tax collected from foreign firms is excessively complex, and there are too many tax brackets. In the present unified industrial and commercial tax collected from foreign firms, there are 108 taxable items and 40 tax brackets, the highest 69 percent and the lowest 1.5 percent. The product tax has 96 taxable items and 21 tax brackets with different rates, and one fixed tax rate, the highest rate being 60 percent and the lowest 3 percent. The VAT has a tariff of 31 taxable items and 12 brackets, the highest being 45 percent and the lowest 8 percent. The business tax has a tariff with 14 items and 4 brackets, the highest 15 percent and the lowest 3 percent, while it is also prescribed that the temporary business tax may be adjusted to within a range of from 5 to 10 percent. This state of having too many tax brackets and a great disparity between high and low rates is causing an inconsistency between the nominal tariff and the real taxable tariff, imbalances of tax burdens as between enterprises, and impedes fair competition under the conditions of socialist market economy. It is also detrimental to tax collection and administration, as it results in serious losses of turnover tax revenue. The standardized VAT is a kind of turnover tax which takes as tax object the added-value components in the various links of commodity production, commodity circulation, and labor services. It has therefore very obvious advantages over China's current turnover tax: It makes it possible to thoroughly overcome the deficiencies of the product tax with its double taxation; it will benefit development of social production in its move toward specialization; it will benefit the improvement of productivity of social labor and the improvement of product quality; and it will benefit stability in the tax burden and in the economy. Under China's present conditions, comprehensive implementation of VAT will not only be able to overcome all deficiencies of the product tax, but will also have the following advantages: It will enable equitable competition among all types of enterprises; it will extensively simplify the tax tariff; it will benefit the strengthening of tax collection and administration and prevent loss of turnover tax revenue; it will benefit efforts to overcome the present state of too high a nominal tax tariff and a low real taxable tariff, and it will more easily gain the support of the taxpayers. Let Us Seize the Opportunity for Comprehensive Implementation of VAT Since the turnover tax accounts for over 60 percent of the revenue from the industrial and commercial tax, it makes up 50 percent of the central authority's fiscal income. In the interest of stabilizing its fiscal income and of stabilizing the commodity price system, the state has all along, since the beginning of reform and opening up, maintained a cautious attitude toward reform of the turnover tax. Repeated tax reforms of the past have been conducted, as far as the turnover tax burden was concerned, on the principle of always maintaining the preceding tax burden. This had been completely necessary during the transitional period when China's state-owned enterprises changed from turning over profits to paying taxes and when the pricing system had not yet been straightened out. Following the deepening of the reform and of opening up, especially since China has now for over 10 years experimented with the VAT and accumulated relevant experiences, also done very thoroughgoing studies on the theory and practice of VAT as practiced in China and abroad, the possibilities of this tax ever leading to a reduction in fiscal income, leading to harmful fluctuations in commodity prices, and to unfair tax burdens on the enterprises, will have been greatly reduced. Moreover, since the central authorities are now determined on a thorough reform of the public finance and tax system, the opportunity has therefore definitely arrived for a thorough reform of the turnover taxation system.
