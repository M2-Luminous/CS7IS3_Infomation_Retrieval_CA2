FR940323-1-00009 FR940323-1-00005 In recent years, a number of statutes have been enacted that established new eligibility groups, revised existing eligibility groups, or expanded services to certain low-income individuals. On October 21, 1986, Congress passed provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86), Public Law 99&hyph;509, that amended the Social Security Act to expand the Medicaid eligibility groups. States were given the option of providing Medicaid to certain needy individuals who had incomes up to a certain specified percentage of Federal poverty income guidelines and who previously were not eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy. These individuals included pregnant women, infants, and children (section 9401) and aged and disabled individuals (section 9402). In addition, section 9407 allowed States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women during a presumptive eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only. OBRA '86 also clarified Medicaid eligibility of homeless individuals who are residents of a State, regardless of whether or not they maintain a home at a fixed address or maintain it permanently (section 9405). In addition, section 11005 of the Homeless Eligibility Clarification Act (title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;570), enacted on October 27, 1986, requires that a State Medicaid plan provide for a method of making medical services eligibility cards available to Medicaid-eligible individuals who do not reside in a permanent dwelling or at a fixed address. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87), Public Law 100&hyph;203, enacted on December 22, 1987, made further changes in the Social Security Act to expand the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the mandatory eligibility group of qualified children under a certain age. OBRA '87 also allowed a State to impose a monthly premium on optional categorically needy pregnant women and infants with incomes between 150 and 185 percent of the Federal poverty level. In addition, section 4105 of OBRA '87 clarified Medicaid coverage of clinic services furnished outside of clinic facilities to homeless individuals. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100&hyph;360, enacted on July 1, 1988, also further amended provisions relating to the eligibility groups of individuals with incomes related to the Federal poverty income level. MCCA made some of the low-income pregnant women and infants mandatory Medicaid eligibility groups (those at or below 75 percent of the poverty level and then, a year later, 100 percent of the poverty level) and amended the eligibility criteria for others. The Family Support Act of 1988 (FSA), Public Law 100&hyph;485, enacted on October 13, 1988, made several technical corrections to the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. These corrections related to the description of the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89), Public Law 101&hyph;239, enacted on December 19, 1989, changed the mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants by increasing the income criteria to at or below 133 percent (instead of at or below 100 percent) of the Federal poverty income level; and added a new mandatory group of low-income children who are age one but have not attained age 6 who have incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. OBRA '89 mandated a percentage greater than 133 percent of the Federal poverty level for the pregnant women and infants groups if the State had such a greater percentage in its State plan (whether approved or not) as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89, or established under State authorizing legislation or State appropriations as of December 19, 1989, when it covered these pregnant women or infants, or both, as optional categorically needy groups. Low-income children who are age 6 but have not attained age 7, or at State option, age 8 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level remained an optional categorically needy group. These provisions were effective on April 1, 1990.
