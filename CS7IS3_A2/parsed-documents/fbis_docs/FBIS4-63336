Amendments to the law on banks grant a priority right to the state budget to collect money from bank accounts of enterprises, and only thereafter can banks collect their due amount of credits and credit interest. Thus far, it has been the other way round -- first, banks collected their dues from the creditor, and later the budget. "This law will facilitate better collection of taxes," said Andris Piebalgs, chairman of the Parliament Budget and Finance Committee. The law on the turnover tax envisions that products manufactured and sold by cooperative companies of farmers and fishermen, with their annual income not exceeding 30,000 lats, are exempt from this tax. Until now, only individual farmers and fishermen were exempt. Amendments to the law also ensure that school textbooks, scientific literature, first editions of works in the vernacular, and children's literature from a list affirmed by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, are free from the turnover tax. In his conversation with DIENA, A. Piebalgs emphasized that the limit of income -- 30,000 lats per year -- is very high. In other European countries, such reductions are granted, if the income does not exceed the equivalent of 7,000-10,000 lats. It must be noted that only those who themselves manufacture and sell their goods, can be freed from the turnover tax, so as to prevent dishonest utilization of this law, for example, in case a farmer would like to sell machines without paying the tax. The draft law submitted by the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction, which foresees that, beginning 1 June, articles of food are not subject to the 18 percent turnover tax, has been conveyed to the parliament commissions for consideration. A. Piebalgs predicted that this draft law will not be considered at the spring session, before the summer recess. Regarding reductions of income tax, property tax, and profit tax for social organizations, foundations, and enterprises, amendments have been introduced foreseeing reduced rates also in the first half of 1994. During the first reading, two draft laws on gambling and lotteries were also adopted. A. Piebalgs stated that after the adoption of these laws, the state budget will receive an additional million lats, but in this case the most important matter is to introduce order in the system of gambling and lotteries as a separate kind of business. This would allow the protection of gamblers, and at the same time the obtaining of data on the number of people dealing in this business in Latvia, as well as money for the budget.
