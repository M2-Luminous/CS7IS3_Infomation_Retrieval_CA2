A morning meeting of economic-related ministers reflected "an atmosphere that the effect from the yen's rise is extremely severe," Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a regular news conference. Terasawa declined to confirm that a monthly EPA report, delivered at the meeting, indicates an official view that the current economic slump is Japan's longest postwar downturn. The report repeated the previous month's "generally sluggish" assessment. "It's in an extremely severe condition," with the economy very difficult to predict, he said. The report, like others from the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan, reported some bright signs in such areas as personal consumption but noted continuing declines in capital spending. The central bank, however, has recently indicated that Japan's economic decline seems to be halting. But Terasawa said the EPA has not changed its overall view or its judgment of major economic factors. He repeatedly stressed concern over the effects of the higher yen, which pummels Japan's export-reliant economy. He said he told the morning economic ministers' meeting that rapid currency movements hurt corporate sentiment and "cannot help but have a minus effect on the economy." Terasawa quoted Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as telling the meeting that rapid exchange rate movements are "undesirable" and that rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Mieno noted the concerted dollar-boosting foreign exchange market interventions by the U.S., Japanese, German and other leading central banks in the past two weeks, according to Terasawa. Japan will continue to take "approriate steps at the appropriate time in close contact with" other major industrial nations, he quoted Mieno as saying. Terasawa, who has experience on Wall Street with a major Japanese brokerage, expressed hope that concerted interventions would have "a large impact" on curbing the soaring yen. But he cited political uncertainty as a big factor in the "speculative" movements that he said have characterized recent jittery foreign exchange trading. Until problems like Japan-U.S. trade friction are resolved, such uncertainty will continue to weigh on the market, Terasawa said. The recent interventions, especially one led by the U.S. Federal Reserve last Wednesday, lifted the dollar from within a whisker of its postwar record low of 100.40 yen, marked in Tokyo last August. But currency dealers wondered how effective the interventions will be and questioned Washington's commitment to supporting the dollar. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sharply reversed the U.S. tolerance for a high yen, saying the government does not want "an undervalued currency." Last year, U.S. officials repeatedly said the yen's rise would help curb Japan's trade surplus. On the Japanese economy, Terasawa quoted Mieno as noting that money supply growth remains slow and that despite recent rises of longer-term market rates, overall interest rates remain "extremely low."
