For this purpose, he even postponed a visit abroad. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen reports about a new emphasis emerging in Jerusalem: All those who have recently been closely following comments made by Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres regarding the price Israel will have to pay on the Golan Heights, could not avoid noticing that there was more in these remarks than a change in nuance. The previous statement according to which the depth of withdrawal will equal the depth of peace has now been replaced by much more explicit remarks. Several days ago, appearing before the Forum for Peace and Security, Rabin made explicit remarks which were published in the press and have not been denied so far. Rabin spoke about normalization of relations before Israel completes the withdrawal from the Golan Heights, rather than on the Golan Heights -- a withdrawal to which it will commit itself in the framework of the negotiations. The entire issue hinges on the difference in the preposition. Jerusalem sources speak about a positive atmosphere emanating from Damascus nowadays, but Rabin is saying that he is still awaiting a signal from al-Asad, after which the sky will be the limit -- or perhaps the international border. What is Rabin waiting for? Three things mainly: for the process to become overt, that is, public meetings at a senior level; openness toward Israel on the Syrian media; and pro-Israeli comments by Syrian leaders. The most recent developments, however, have occurred in Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who so far was the one with most reservations regarding Syria and who supported the Jordan option, has changed his position. Peres is extremely annoyed with King Husayn for not making any progress in his contacts with Israel, and has decided to invest all his efforts in the contacts with Syria. Peres is thereby joining the Syrian lobby, which includes IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence Chief Uri Sagi, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, and Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. For this reason he announced he is canceling a planned visit to Ethiopia and Eritrea, this in order to focus his efforts on negotiations with Syria.
