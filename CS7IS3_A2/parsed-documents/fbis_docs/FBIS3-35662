The negotiations proceeded in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 849 of 9 July 1993, 854 of 6 August 1993, 858 of 24 August 1993, 876 of 9 October 1993, 881 of 4 November 1993, and 892 of 22 December 1993. It was pointed out that the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding of 1 December 1993 were, in the main, being implemented. There has been an exchange of prisoners in accordance with the principle "all for all." Representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees have organized the first preparatory trip in order to discuss the possibility of the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons to their permanent places of residence. The number of international observers in the conflict zone is being increased. On 15-16 December 1993, a meeting of a group of experts working out recommendations on the political status of Abkhazia was held in Moscow in which representatives of the sides involved in the conflict, the UN, and the Russian Federation and a CSCE observer participated. At the same time, it was pointed out that, in separate rayons in the conflict zone, armed groups that were not subject to any control had carried out combat actions, which had brought renewed suffering upon a part of the population. Work has not yet begun on searching for persons missing without trace and reburying the dead. During the second round of negotiations in Geneva, the sides emphasized that efforts aimed at achieving a full-scale regulation of the conflict as soon as possible should be continued. 1. The sides again confirm that they will fulfill the obligations placed upon them without the use of force and the threat of the use of force against one another. 2. The sides have agreed that the creation of favorable conditions for the further promotion of the process of a political settlement and the practical implementation of the agreements that have been reached will contribute to the implementation of a full- scale operation to maintain peace in Abkhazia. They have appealed to the UN Security Council, requesting that, when it discusses again the activities of the mission of UN observers in Georgia, it widens its mandate accordingly, in particular, that this mission be entrusted with ensuring that there is no resumption of hostilities in the conflict zone. The sides have again stated that they support the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces or other forces sanctioned by the UN in the conflict zone. They have expressed their consent to the use of a Russian Federation military contingent in such forces. In accordance with a decision of the UN Security Council, following the deployment of additional international observers in the conflict zone and the arrival of peacekeeping forces, the sides will withdraw over the course of five days all armed formations along with their weapons and combat equipment from the Inguri River and other possible areas of active confrontation in the conflict zone that will be determined by the command of the peacekeeping forces and the mission of UN observers in Georgia in coordination with the sides and, at the same time, international observers and peacekeeping forces will enter the zone that has been created. Volunteer formations and individuals who have come to take part in the conflict are to be disarmed and withdrawn and international observers will be allowed to carry out inspections at crossing points along the Psou River. The sides request the UN Security Council to strengthen the international civilian presence in the conflict zone, which necessitates the deployment of appropriate civilian specialists there who will contribute to the resolution of the refugee problem and other humanitarian questions. 3. It is the view of the sides that a special voluntary fund created under the aegis of the UN will contribute to the accomplishment of the task of regulating the situation. 4. The sides will continue to elaborate a quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary return and repatriation of refugees and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia. The sides have agreed to create a special commission for refugees that will be made up of representatives of the sides, the UN, and Russia and that will begin work on 25 January 1994. The sides have agreed to start the process of the gradual return of refugees and forcibly displaced persons to Abkhazia on 10 February and Gali rayon has been named as the first stage [in this process]. The sides will make every effort to ensure the safety of the refugees, forcibly displaced persons, and the personnel taking part in this operation. The Abkhazian side is to bear primary responsibility for receiving and protecting the refugees and forcibly displaced persons and also the aforementioned personnel. In addition, the sides request the UN and the Russian Federation to assist in creating a safe situation, which will facilitate the return of refugees and forcibly displaced persons. The sides pin their hopes on the effective assistance of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees; in particular, on the temporary department of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees beginning work in the conflict zone in the near future. 5. The sides recognize that the main task is to achieve a full-scale political settlement of the conflict and every effort has to be made to this end. They have agreed to continue to discuss the problem of the political status of Abkhazia taking into account the interests of both sides. The next meeting of experts to discuss this question will be held in Moscow on 8 February. Their report will be heard at the next meeting of the sides and sent to the UN and CSCE. The UN, CSCE, and Russian Federation call upon the sides to be guided by the necessity of protecting the fundamental principles underlying the full-scale regulation of the situation: Protecting the territorial integrity of Georgia and completely safeguarding the interests of the entire multinational population of Abkhazia. 6. The sides have stated that they are interested in creating an international commission to promote economic recovery in Abkhazia with the participation of international and national organizations by 15 February of this year at the latest. Their primary task should be the reconstruction of vitally important installations, transport communications, airports, bridges, and tunnels. 7. The participants in the negotiations have agreed to hold the next meeting on 22 February 1994 either in Moscow or Geneva. [Signed] On behalf of the Georgian side -- J.
