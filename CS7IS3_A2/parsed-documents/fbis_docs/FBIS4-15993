The oblast UNA chairman, Andriy Shkil, told journalists that UNA-UNSO fulfilled its minimum program in the election and now has three representatives in parliament. Two of them, Oleh Vitovych and Yaroslav Ilyasevych, were elected in Lvov oblast, the other, Yuriy Tyma, in Ternopol. "Our deputies will not join permanent alliances in the new parliament, but will cooperate and align with certain forces on certain decisions and appointments. We will cooperate with all forces, including Communists and Socialists, on crucial issues of nation-building," said Andriy Shkil. A UNSO area commander, Ukraine People's Deputy Oleh Vitovych, said he believes that "one of the first issues to be raised in parliament is the division of powers. There will be disagreements regarding the need for a presidential election, the functions of the Supreme Council, its speaker, the president, and who will form the government. It is difficult to imagine what ideas or tactics can bring together people of different political views on these priority issues with respect to putting an end to the plundering of Ukraine, boosting production development, and, most important, preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity." Predicting the course of the future political struggle, the news conference organizers agreed that the main threat to the young state is posed by the "red directors", with their sights firmly set on Moscow. Oleh Vitovych also warned against excessive excitement over the western standards. In his opinion, neither the Moscow, nor the Western model of societal development is acceptable to Ukraine. It should rely on its own resources and potential. The news conference also noted that UNA-UNSO plans to be most active in the local elections. Andriy Shkil said that the UNA leadership will consult experts in the near future to determine its campaign strategy and tactics. All of the journalists' questions were answered, except one: "Will UNA-UNSO deputies come to the parliament session in the camouflage military uniforms they normally wear, or will they perhaps wear something more civilian?" This question is yet to be discussed.
