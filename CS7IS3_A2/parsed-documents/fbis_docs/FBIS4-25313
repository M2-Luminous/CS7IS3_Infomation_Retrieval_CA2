This is an event for celebrating. The founding of the CAE is a grand event in China engineering circles. Engineering is the summary of the great practice of mankind's application of scientific theories to transform, utilize, and protect nature. Over the past 50 years or so, the pace and scale of growth of engineering has been unprecedented, which, in turn, is an immense direct motive force pushing the economy forward. It has increasingly attracted attention of science and technology circles and policy decisionmakers of all countries. Over the decades, the broad ranks of engineering personnel have exerted their utmost efforts and scored marked successes in economic development and national defense construction. They have built a large number of key projects and basic facilities which developed as unique advantages in certain fields and enhanced the pride and unity of the Chinese nation. The founding of the CAE and election of a number of outstanding engineering experts who have made major and creative contributions as academicians will enormously encourage the broad ranks of engineering personnel and exert a positive, far-reaching influence on China's science, technology, and economic construction. Since its founding in 1955, CAS has rallied the nationally acknowledged best scientists, who play an irreplaceable role in laying down the country's major science and techology policy decisions and certain economic and social development strategies. The conference of academicians is the first of its kind since the title of academy member has been changed to academician in light of international practice. The first group of foreign academicians at CAS will be elected at the conference. This is one of the signs indicating that China's science and technology circles have opened their door wider to the outside world and have stepped on the stage of world science, which will play an important role in promoting international scientific and technological cooperation and exchanges and pushing forward China's scientific and technological development. Academician of the CAE and CAS is the highest academic title in China's science, technology, and engineering circles. These academicians are outstanding representatives of the 17 million scientific workers and engineers. Among the academicians of the two academies, there are masters of great learning and integrity of the elder generation as well as young talented people who have made outstanding contributions in their respective fields. The gathering of talents at the conference of the two academies manifests the prosperity of China's science and engineering cause. The reform of China's science and technology system is now developing in depth. Reform means emancipation of productive forces and, above all, rapidly developing science and technology, and swiftly converting it into real productive forces through all sorts of engineering. In the course of deepened reform, it is necessary to correctly handle relations between our own innovation and importing advanced technology and between science and technology and the economy, dialectically unite the two, and bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of China's economy. We should invigorate work which directly serves economic construction and concentrate picked forces to stabilize and support work which represents the Chinese nation in competing on the international stage of science. It is necessary to stress a sense and spirit of innovation in whatever work we do. Only in this way can we catch up with the advanced and gain a foothold in the sharp international competition. We hope that the academicians of the CAS and CAE will unite, guide the science and technology workers of the whole nation, and make new contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation.
