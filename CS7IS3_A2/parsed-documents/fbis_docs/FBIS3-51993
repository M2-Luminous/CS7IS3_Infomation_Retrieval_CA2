Eyewitnesses and security guards at the U.S. Embassy confirmed that at 2345 (0545 GMT), several individuals in a blue car fired several shots. The peasants, who are members of the Federation of Workers and Laborers [Federacion de Trabajadores y Obreros], early this morning are patrolling the area with sticks and machetes to ward off attacks. The Indians have been in front of the embassy for three days to request the mission's mediation with the "Penny Foundation" [Fundacion del Centavo], which charges them excessive interest rates on loans made to families to buy land and build houses. The attack is part of the wave of violence prevailing in the Guatemalan capital, where in the last four hours unidentified individuals set off explosive charges at electricity pylons. There is unease among the Guatemalan people 48 hours before a referendum is held to reform the Legislative and Judicial Branches and shorten the presidential term from five to four years.
