Until now, Britain and the Hong Kong administration had adamantly declared the door remained open to negotiation with China and that the British side was ready to fly to Beijing at short notice to resume talks. But yesterday, Chief Secretary Anson Chan conceded the time for negotiation on constitutional reform was over because of time constraints governing arrangements for the final elections under British rule. Mrs Chan also, for the first time, conceded the possibility that China might dismantle Hong Kong's political system in 1997. Mrs Chan cast doubts over her own political future saying she would find it difficult to preside over electoral arrangements which she did not consider fair and open if China dismantled Hong Kong's three tiers of government in 1997. "We've tried to give as much time as possible to reach agreement with the Chinese, that is the reason we decided to push ahead with the first stage first," Mrs Chan told The Hongkong Standard. "The first stage dealt with very simple issues which we did not think the Chinese should have too much diffi culty with and the whole purpose of that was to buy ourselves more time so we could continue talks with the Chinese on more complex issues. "At the moment there is a considerable gap between the Chinese view and the British Hong Kong view. It is unfortunate that there has been no agreement but now we have no choice but to push ahead." The Executive Council will on Tuesday endorse Governor Chris Patten's decision to push ahead with the remainder of his constitutional reform package, to be gazetted as early as next Friday and tabled on 9 March. While Mr Patten has called China's bluff over its threats to disband the three tiers of government in 1997, Mrs Chan is more pragmatic. She warned Beijing that continuity in Hong Kong was crucial to the transfer of sovereignty, both politically and economically. "I would hope that if we had in place arrangements that would ensure fair, open elections that in the interests of preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability they would not be dismantled after the 1st July 1997." Mrs Chan said she would personally find it difficult to remain in a government which presided over "unfair" electoral arrangements. However she stated, she was not expecting that to occur. Mrs Chan hoped she would not be regarded by the Chinese leadership as a subversive for supporting political reform which although enshrined in the Joint Declaration was implemented without Beijing's consent. "I find it very difficult to read the thoughts of the Chinese," she said. "I hope they will regard every single member of the civil service as doing what they regard as in the best interests of Hong Kong." She intended to serve in government until her retirement at 60 in the year 2,000. "According to the Joint Declaration, provided that we uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, I can't see any reason why serving civil servants could not continue after 1997. We don't want to see a wholesale replacement of senior officials on 1 July 1997." Mrs Chan however did not discount being a candidate for the position of Chief Executive of the post-1997 SAR.
