They plan to make leading-edge companies a core component of local area businesses. Led by prefectural public research institutions, a technical study will be conducted by uniting local manufacturing businesses, national research organizations, and universities. It was realized that local public research institutions, which play a key role in the technical support of local businesses, need to build a network in order to help effectively at the local level. In 1994, twenty-three prefectural institutions will participate in this project. They are requesting an estimated Â¥72.5 million. The name of the organization is ``Foundation for the Formation of Local Area Technical Networks.'' At a concrete level, each prefecture has its own vision for the promotion of industrial growth. An ``Area Technical Network Committee'' will be established at each prefectural level. Topics to be studied will be determined from an educational point of view. The focus will be on future technical fields important for small businesses. At the same time the national manufacturing policy will be adjusted to conform with the study. Furthermore, led by this committee, about five or so technical seminars will be held. These seminars will concentrate on the actual problems faced by local businesses. The technical power of the national level research institutions and public universities located in each prefecture will be harnessed. Exchange of ideas at local public institutions will take place, and the needs of local area businesses will be grasped. Solving technical problems and transferring the results to the businesses is also planned. Through network exchange, the results of study will be transferred to businesses, and education of area businesses, which is the core of local vitalization, will occur, and stimulate the local economy. Also the activities of the study group conducted at a prefectural level will be integrated. MITI plans to support the education of competitive business ventures as a vital and fundamental activity in 1994, and the formation of area technical networks this time has the implication of active support from MITI.
