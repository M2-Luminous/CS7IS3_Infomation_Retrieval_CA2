We should wait 10 days, and find the degree of similarity between the Syrian and our interpretation of the term full peace, which they have been using. Naturally, there will be the question of what it will demand as the price for full peace according to our interpretation. [Litman] You were quoted by the French media as saying that Israel can sign a peace agreement with Jordan, as far as you are concerned, in three weeks. What prevents signing a peace contract soon? [Rabin] Jordan prevents this. [Litman] Why? [Rabin] I do not believe that today it is ready to be the first of the three Arab countries with which we are negotiating to sign a peace agreement with us. We have no problems of security nor problems linked to essential territorial aspects with Jordan. Today, the issue of the Palestinians, the future of the territories, is being discussed with the Palestinians, the PLO, and not with Jordan. Therefore, when we speak of peace with Jordan, we are referring to the border that existed between mandatory Eretz Yisra'el and Jordan. There is another country with which we have no territorial problems, but have a security problem -- Lebanon. With it, matters are more complex. Also, its freedom of political maneuvering is more limited than that of Jordan. I am afraid that, apparently, Jordan also feels that it does not have enough freedom of political maneuvering to reach a peace accord with us.
