Such men had allegedly come from the former base at the state-owned farm in the Salamanga area. Confronted with the statements made by Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary to our newspaper last week, that Renamo soldiers were constantly involved in movements to South Africa, Capt. Nhancumba said: "That is false! It is true that our soldiers left the base and moved from one place to another, but they never crossed the border. It is likely that people have seen our men moving around and they may have thought they were crossing the border into South Africa." Asked about a helicopter that the DOMINGO reporters had seen overfly at a low altitude the Renamo base at the state-owned farm in Salamanga, our interviewee said that "Renamo controls no air space whatsoever. What is more, I think everyone knows that we do not have any helicopters!" Capt. Nhancumba also confirmed the complete withdrawal of his 900 men from Salamanga and added they had moved to the Chinhaguanine assembly area. He explained that not all men are carrying weapons because Renamo did not have weapons for all its soldiers, adding that "during the war, we used to rotate our weapons among the men." The Renamo team leader to the CCF also said that his movement is not removing weapons from assembly areas and taking them to the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, regional depots because there are still many weapons in the hands of militia and paramilitary forces. He said, by way of conclusion: "There has to be some sort of equilibrium between the government and Renamo concerning the arms collection process."
