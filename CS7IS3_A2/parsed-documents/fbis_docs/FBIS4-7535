Not only is it the only supermarket, but there also does not exist any building lot where a second supermarket could be built. There is not even room for small shops. The owner rents out the supermarket to its manager. Naturally, they conclude a lease contract. The contract concerns only the building in which the supermarket is located. The former manager of the supermarket thus becomes its lessee. The owner lets him keep all of the furnishings, some of which are older and some brand new, without asking anything for it. That is not all, however. Out of sheer goodness, he leaves in the supermarket all of the merchandise plus a full warehouse. The only thing the new lessee must do is hire shop assistants and start selling. For a while, he does not even have to buy new stock, of which he had received enough. The owner does not ask anything for it. He does not even have an idea how many millions or tens of millions [currency not specified] worth of merchandise he had donated to his former employee in this way. Nonsense? No, this is the style of the Army's economic management, only transferred into a different environment. This is exactly how the Ministry of Defense proceeds in relation to the Klinlab limited liability company (just a little reminder: this is the company that had administered those innocuous virus strains that were hastily destroyed on 25 February of this year). First, on 10 September 1993, the Municipal Military Accommodation Administration signs a lease contract with a still nonexistent company, which is signed on behalf of Klinlab by Army members Moravek, MD, and Choluj, MD, as Klinlab's statutory representatives and managing directors. At the same time, these gentlemen collect from the Army a lump-sum payment as compensation for not being engaged in private enterprise. Only a month later, on 21 October, the Klinlab partnership agreement is signed, and, another 11 days later, Klinlab is registered by the Municipal District Court in Prague-1. Certain activities are then set apart from the Central Military Medical Institute and transferred to Klinlab. Through Loss Toward Savings? However, the Army, whose motive for the entire operation, according to M. Kalousek, deputy minister of defense in charge of economic affairs, is to achieve savings in its budget, transfers to the private company Klinlab only those activities that were well established, lucrative, and profitable, such as diagnostics. Activities that are loss-making and that the ministry must continue to subsidize are left in its own facility, the Central Military Medical Institute. From the viewpoint of the private company Klinlab, this sounds logical. Why should anyone rush into a business that will cost him money? It is less logical, however, from the viewpoint of the "cost-conscious" Army. Setting the Wolf To Mind the Sheep? At an extraordinary news conference on 19 March, M. Kalousek even claimed that the Ministry of Defense would save 50 million korunas [Kc] a year thanks to Klinlab. This amount is equivalent to the annual overhead expenses of the entire former Central Military Medical Institute. It is peculiar that a deputy minister in charge of economic affairs operates with sums that include only expenditures and disregard revenues, such as payments from the Military Health Insurance for medical services performed, and so forth. He also "forgot" to mention that the Ministry of Defense must continue to subsidize the nonprofitable activities of the Central Military Medical Institute. In substantiating the savings, Deputy Minister Kalousek thus evidently did not speak the truth, the opposite of which is called a lie. Klinlab has thus taken over from the institute well-established activities, clients, and, within the framework of the UVN [possibly Ustredni Vojenska Nemocnice, Central Military Hospital], also a monopoly position. What did it pay for it? Nothing. It only concluded a contract on the lease of the six-storey building and undertook to pay annual rent of Kc760,123. Furthermore, the Army "leased to it free of charge" the appliances and equipment. True, the appliances and equipment have been leased for a definite period only. However, this definite period is defined very shrewdly. The formulation reads: "until a proper lease contract is concluded." The lease is set to begin on 23 December 1993. Apart from this, just like in the fictitious supermarket, the Ministry of Defense has left the working stock at Klinlab's disposal. Was this stock worth millions or tens of millions? Who cares? A pleasant way of starting a business, is it not? Good Personal Relations It is worth noting that, naturally, there was no competition. Another physician, an emigre who has returned from Canada, also showed interest in the privatization of the complex, a part of which was subsequently acquired by Klinlab, at the beginning of last year. He was told that these activities could not be privatized. In their analysis, the gentlemen from Klinlab also mention the reasons because of which the lucrative activities should be transferred to them. Apart from the "traditionally good personal relations" (between Moravek, Choluj, and the management of the Army's medical service), they also emphasize the fact that, when they acquire these activities, the entry of foreign capital will be prevented. Quite so. But did they not get the time wrong? And are the economic section of the Ministry of Defense and Deputy Minister Kalousek not getting it wrong? The beetle is lying on its back and does not react to prodding. You prod again but nothing happens. So you prod even more strongly, but the beetle still does not move. Could it be dead? The beetle perhaps, but Defense Minister Antonin Baudys is unquestionably very much alive, and still he does not react. Did he choose to act like a dead beetle?
