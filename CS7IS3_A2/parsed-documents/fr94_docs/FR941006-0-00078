FR941006-0-00078 FR941006-0-00020 This rule changes the status of Isotria medeoloides from endangered to threatened and formally recognizes that this species is no longer in imminent danger of extinction throughout a significant portion of its range. Reclassification to threatened does not significantly alter the protection for this species under the Act (see Summary of Comments and Recommendations). Conservation measures prescribed for Isotria medeoloides would proceed. The recovery program approved in 1992 prescribes continued efforts to_(1) protect known Isotria medeoloides populations and essential habitat; (2) develop habitat management strategies; (3) manage protected sites; (4) monitor sites and determine viability; (5) survey for new sites; (6) investigate population dynamics and species biology; and (7) provide public information and education. Many State and Federal agencies continue to monitor extant sites and search for new ones. The application of a predictive model should further assist in the location of new sites in New England. Investigations into the genetic structure of this species, the mycorrhizal relationships, and the development of habitat management measures have been targeted in the 1992 recovery plan as important tasks. These activities are either ongoing or proposed for the near future. Recovery activities are not expected to diminish as a result of this reclassification since the primary objective of the recovery strategy is delisting of the species. This action will not be an irreversible commitment on the part of the Service. Reclassifying Isotria medeoloides to endangered would be possible should changes occur in management, habitat, or other factors that alter the present threats to the species' survival and recovery. National Environmental Policy Act The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). References Cited Brumback, W.E., and C.W. Fyler. 1988.
