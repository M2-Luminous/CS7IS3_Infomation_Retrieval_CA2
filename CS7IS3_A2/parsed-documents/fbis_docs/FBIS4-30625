In its Technical Working Meeting at Cipayung, Bogor, the Functional Group [GOLKAR] proposed the establishment of a guaranty board and a loan fund ("guarantee fund") to channel bank credit to small and medium-sized businesses. The largest of the sociopolitical organizations also proposed that from 1 to 5 percent of the profits of state-owned businesses be set aside for small businesses and cooperatives. Naturally, this is good news for small and medium-sized businesses, which encompass about 34.4 million adults. GOLKAR's proposal represents a further concrete commitment to help small and medium-sized businesses. The proposal is probably not a coincidence and represents another of the steps taken by the government to strengthen the status of small and medium-sized businesses in the country. GOLKAR clearly was also awakened by the fact this these groups needing help are still having problems in getting credit from banks. Bank credits flow more easily to big businesses. In a seminar in Jakarta at the end of April, which was attended by operators of about a thousand small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country, complaints were heard about the stiff requirements imposed by banks. The businessmen feel they are treated as stepchildren, and they recognize the fact that bank credits flow more smoothly to big businesses. GOLKAR possibly was motivated by hearing those grievances. The government views small and medium-sized businesses as strategic groups. Through them, the government is expanding prosperity. These groups have special features. For example, they absorb large numbers of workers. Furthermore, they adapt better to economic recession than the big businesses owned by the "big shot" industrialists. They also more easily act as subcontractors to big businesses. For the takeoff phase, the government apparently is not depending only on big businesses but is counting on the role of small and medium-sized businesses. In some countries, there is controversy about who will be relied upon for the takeoff phase: Will it be big business only, or will small businesses be involved, too? In Indonesia, the government sees the role of small and medium-sized businesses as important. The government has taken a variety of steps to boost these groups. One of the steps was Presidential Decision No. 16/1994, which gave them opportunities for access to markets. It says that about 10 percent of the total value of government expenditures will be used to buy products from small-and medium-scale businesses. Total government expenditures are now estimated at 20 trillion rupiah. When this provision is carried out, these groups will be truly helped. Many countries have in fact established special institutions to channel credits to small and medium-sized businesses. Thailand, for example, has long had such an institution, and the results have been very satisfying. In other words, credit is obtained more smoothly by small businesses, without anyone exercising any effort to make it difficult. The recent reports of unpaid loans on the part of big businesses should open our eyes to the fact that big businesses do not always repay bank credits promptly. As far as we have observed, one of the reasons banks are reluctant to extend credit to small and medium-sized businesses is the assumption that big businesses, because of their strong capital positions, will more quickly repay the credits they obtain. Action against big businesses that abuse credit is a must, but it would be wise for us to use the moment to realize again the strategic role played by small and medium-sized businesses. In this connection, the words that Minister of Finance Mari'e Muhammad spoke at the GOLKAR technical working meeting at Cipayung are very relevant, namely that it would be "unthinkable" for the government to continue to give protection to big businesses. The minister of finance said, however, that it would be "objectionable" for small and medium-sized businesses to be given unlimited protection. The position of taking the side of the small and weak is a humanitarian law of ethics. To take the side of small and medium-sized businesses does not mean ostracizing big businesses. The sociological reality that the small constitute the largest group is a strong reason for taking their side. We welcome GOLKAR's determination to take concrete action to strengthen small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia.
