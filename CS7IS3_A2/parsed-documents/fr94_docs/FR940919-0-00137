FR940919-0-00137 FR940919-0-00017 Issue 4: One commenter recommended that the Service prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on this rule. He stated that a decision to list these five crustaceans is a major Federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. Service Response: For the reasons set out in the NEPA section of this document, the Service takes the position that rules issued pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act do not require the preparation of an EIS. The courts held in Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus, 657 F2d. 829 (6th Circuit 1981) that an EIS is not required for listing under the Act. The decision noted that preparing EIS's on listing actions does not further the goals of NEPA or the Act. Issue 5: One commenter requested that the Service conduct a Takings Implications Assessment under Executive Order 12630 for this listing action. Service Response: The Attorney General has issued guidelines to the Department of the Interior (Department) regarding implementation of Executive Order 12630. The Attorney General's guidelines state that Taking Implications Assessments (TIAs), which are used to analyze the potential for Fifth Amendment taking claims are to be prepared after, rather than before, an agency makes a decision upon which its discretion is restricted. In enacting the Endangered Species Act, Congress required the Department to list a species based solely upon scientific and commercial data indicating whether or not the species is in danger of extinction. No discretion is afforded and the Service may not withhold a listing based upon economic concerns. Therefore, even though a TIA is required, a TIA for a listing action is to be finalized only after the final decision whether to list a species is made. Issue 6: The California Department of parks and Recreation recommended that the four fairy shrimp should be listed as threatened species rather than endangered species. Service Response: The Service has determined that threatened status is appropriate for the vernal pool fairy shrimp. The proposal to list the California linderiella as an endangered species has been withdrawn. The rationale for these actions and endangered status for the two other fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is described at the conclusion of the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section. Issue 7: Several commenters expressed concern that it will be difficult or impossible to delist any or all of the crustaceans listed herein. Service Response: When the recovery goals for a species have been met, the Service may prepare a proposal to delist or reclassify it. The process for delisting or reclassifying a species, allowed for at section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, is the same process used for listing the species. Issue 8: Three respondents stated that compared to other federally listed crustaceans, the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp do not warrant listing under the Act. Service Response: The claim that the status of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp do not warrant listing under the Act when compared with other listed crustaceans does not address the full range of issues and complexities bearing on listing decisions. The multiplicity of factors and relationships that must be considered and interpreted in assigning the appropriate status to listed taxa is sufficiently complex that patterns of consistency may not be necessarily agreed upon by all parties. Issue 9: Several respondents stated that critical habitat should be designated for the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Service Response: The Service believes that the danger posed by designating critical habitat at this time outweighs the potential benefits. As discussed in Factors ``A'' and ``E'' under the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'' section below, all of the species included in this final rule could be adversely affected by acts of vandalism. The Service is aware of vernal pools that contained suitable habitat for these animals that apparently were destroyed to escape regulatory requirements. Designation of critical habitat at this time would increase the degree of threat facing these species. Issue 10: One commenter stated that there is not enough data on the species listed herein upon which to develop a recovery plan. Service Response: Section 4(f) of the Act directs the Secretary to develop and implement recovery plans for conservation and survival of listed endangered and threatened species. The Service intends to pursue the development of a recovery plan for the four species as soon as possible. Identification of needed research and acquisition of additional data are key components of most recovery plans. Issue 11: Several commenters stated that the California linderiella and the vernal pool fairy shrimp do not warrant listing because of their widespread distribution. Service Response: Species may be listed under the Act if one or more of the five listing criteria imperils the species with extinction or if the species is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future, throughout all or a significant portion of its range. These criteria apply for narrowly, as well as widely distributed species. As described elsewhere in this final rule, the vernal pool fairy shrimp is imperiled by habitat loss from construction activities and degradation to the extent that 28 of the 32 known populations face one or more of the various threats described elsewhere in this rule. Thus, even though this species has a relatively wide range in California, it is imperiled by one or more of five factors throughout a significant portion of its range.
