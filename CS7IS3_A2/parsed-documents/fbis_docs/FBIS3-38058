Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence Service, said in an interview with a CRIME-PRESS correspondent. After all, if one is to believe the FBI, the country the Ames started spying for was the old Soviet Union, and the surveillance over them began 10 months ago. Moreover, for the first time in the history of relations between our countries, Aleksandr Lysenko was, as it were, an official resident of the Russian intelligence in the United States. He was introduced to the director of the CIA and to the U.S. Administration in this capacity and was involved in "cooperation" between the two special services in tackling issues of global significance which override the rivalry between the two intelligence services, such as the fight against international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other issues. Now, as a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has announced, Russia is forced to take countermeasures and hence expel a CIA employee.
