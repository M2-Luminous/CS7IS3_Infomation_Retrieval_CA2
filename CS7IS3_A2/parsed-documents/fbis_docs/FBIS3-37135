Responding to the question on whether or not the NATO countries are ready to start bombing Serbian positions in Bosnia without the "silent consent" of Moscow, Clinton said one should bear in mind that NATO's actions are in line with U.N. actions. Russia, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, took part in the drawing up of the U.N. policy in Bosnia. Clinton said he had received a letter from the Russian president on Wednesday morning. He would like to use it as a basis for a telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin, but could not reach him by telephone. He hopes the Russian president will agree to help in promoting the process of a peaceful settlement in Bosnia. The U.S. President said he did not know what technical problems may prevent him from reaching Yeltsin by telephone for the second day in succession. However, senior officials of the two countries have been holding for two days active consultations on the situation in Bosnia. Specifically, such consultations were held by U.S. Representative at the United Nations Organisation Madeleine Albright and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering. According to Clinton, there is no reason to believe that some serious problem may hamper the joint advance of the two countries. Dee Dee Myers, press secretary of the U.S. President, said at a briefing in the White House that Clinton and Yeltsin had not been able to speak on the telephone for technical reasons and a considerable time difference. President Clinton tried to reach Yeltsin by telephone on Wednesday, but, unfortunately, they did not have a conversation, the press secretary continued. He repeated his attempt on Thursday. They have not managed to speak so far, and she hopes Clinton will make it on Friday.
