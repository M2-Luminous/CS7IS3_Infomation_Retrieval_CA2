Hata made the appeal at a meeting of rice dealers and consumers held by the Food Agency to hear views on imported rice. Hata told the session there will be no shortage in rice supplies and said there is no need for consumers to rush to buy rice in excess. Dealers and consumers asked the agency to bring down prices of imported rice and allow set sales of domestic and imported rice. Hata said the government is not making it mandatory for rice dealers to blend domestic rice with imported rice in delivering to consumers. Blending domestic and imported rice is simply an option, he said.
