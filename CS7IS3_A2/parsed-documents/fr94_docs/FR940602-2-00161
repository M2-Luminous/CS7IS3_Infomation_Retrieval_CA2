FR940602-2-00161 FR940602-2-00094 Agency policy on forest planning and NEPA evaluation does not allow a decision to remove recreation residences to be made by the Forest plan. The process for implementing a Forest plan, explained in FSH 1902.12, requires that any use that appears to be inconsistent with new management direction must be analyzed and evaluated before any decision is made to discontinue that use. In section 2721.23e, paragraph 1b, of the final policy, the agency has clarified this point by revising the heading to read ``Use Apparently Not Consistent With the Forest Plan.'' This revision is intended to reinforce the point that an inconsistency determination does not result in removal of the use, only that such action is possible. A decision on removal of the use cannot be made until a project analysis is completed. Project analysis should not precede forest planning. The overall direction contained in a Forest plan is the foundation upon which all land and resource activities of the National Forest are based. The Forest plan promotes more integrated consideration of all land and resource management activities. The direction in the proposed policy providing for project analysis following implementation of the Forest plan and identification of apparent inconsistency remains unchanged in the final policy. Respondents' concerns that permit holders would not be involved in Forest planning is unfounded. Overall direction in FSM 1950, FSH 1909.15, and 36 CFR Part 216 requires local Forest Service officials to seek the views of the public, including holders of authorizations to use National Forest land. Further, the direction in the proposed policy at FSM 2721.23h and FSH 2709.11, section 41.23b, paragraph 1 would require local officials to involve permit holders in activities involving Forest plan amendments and revisions, implementation of plans, and project analyses. The agency believes this direction is adequate to ensure holders' awareness of any action affecting their use. Thus, the proposed policy in this regard remains unchanged in the final policy. The guidance in section 41.23b has been selectively revised to recognize the suggestions of several respondents. The first sentence of the section has been rewritten to reflect that Forest plan amendment or revision does not necessarily make the recreation residence use inconsistent with new management direction. Rather, it reflects that continued use under the new management direction is uncertain and a site specific project analysis is required to verify the inconsistency. Paragraph 2 of this section of the proposed policy, titled ``Analysis Documentation'' and describing the content of the project analysis report and NEPA documentation, is revised in the final policy to require information on applicable resource conditions to be included in the report. Paragraph 3a(4), requiring a comparison of benefits and disadvantages of the proposed alternative public use and the recreation residence use, has been revised in the final policy to include consideration of the cost of removing the recreation residence. Paragraph 4 of FSH 41.23b of the proposed policy, describing the project analysis decision and documentation, has been extensively revised to clarify the process by which a decision is reached. Three possible decisions are outlined: (1) If the project analysis results in a decision to amend the Forest plan such that continued use will not be inconsistent with the proposed alternative use, a new term permit would be issued upon permit expiration; (2) if the project analysis results in a decision to amend the Forest plan such that the recreation residence use is in some degree inconsistent with the proposed alternative use but does not conflict with it, or the proposed alternative use can accommodate some or all of the recreation residence use, appropriate modifications would be made to the current permit and new term permits for the applicable lots would be issued; or (3) if the project analysis results in a decision that the recreation residence use remains inconsistent with the Forest plan and cannot be accommodated with the proposed alternative use, a decision would be made that the recreation residences are to be removed. This revision adds a third possibility to the project analysis decision where the use is in apparent conflict but can be accommodated with the proposed use. Paragraph 5 of FSH 41.23b, titled ``Decision Notification,'' presents the requirements to be followed in notifying holders and other interested parties of the project analysis decision. Two items are added to those listed in the proposed policy: (1) Notification of whether in-lieu lots will or will not be made available, and (2) notification that annual fees will be adjusted during the final 10 years of use. The remainder of the paragraph has been edited for clarity. d. Project Analysis Decision Review. The proposed policy at 2721.23e, paragraph 2c required the authorized officer to review a project analysis decision two years prior to permit expiration, if that decision was more than five years old. Handbook guidance at 41.23b, paragraph 6, described the procedure by which the project decision would be reviewed. The review would determine if changes in resource conditions required reconsideration of the decision. Holders and interested publics would be notified of the review. If the review indicated no change in resource conditions, the original decision would be implemented. If conditions had changed, a new project analysis would be made to determine use of the lot. A project analysis decision review would not be appealable. Comment . Few respondents commented on this provision although a similar provision at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 11, raised a concern among several respondents that the holder would not have an opportunity to be heard in this review. Response . The project analysis decision review is intended to ensure that the actions which resulted in the decision remain applicable when the permit is about to expire since 8 to 10 years would have elapsed since the decision was made. This could prevent removal of a recreation residence when there is no longer a need for the alternative public use. The agency intends that the review be undertaken with the full knowledge and participation of the holder. It emphasizes that the direction in 2721.23e makes it clear that holder involvement in the review is required. The proposed policy is considered to be fully adequate and is adopted as final policy. e. Permit Decision Process (Diagram). The proposed policy, in Exhibit 01, section 41.23c, presented in diagrammatic form the process described in section 41.23a and b by which a decision is reached to continue the recreation residence use or convert the use to an alternative public use.
