This was reported by Major Wlodzimierz Warchol of the Pomeranian department of the Border Guard. The drugs were incinerated by order of the Szczecin provincial court, in cooperation with pharmaceutical authorities. The cocaine, probably originating from South America, was seized by the border guards this April. It had been brought into Gdansk aboard a ship which has not yet been identified, and was to have been transported to Holland through Germany. The drugs were found in an automobile being used, according to investigators, by a 48-year-old Greek, Thomas M., traveling on a forged Dutch passport. He is currently being tried by the Szczecin provincial court.
