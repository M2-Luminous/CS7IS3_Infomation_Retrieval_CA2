Granma has not escaped the special period's rigors regarding tuber production. Perhaps it will have to change its production plans, 68 percent of which is dedicated to plantains, 50 percent of the province's total production. There are many problems, however; the province needs fertilizer for 24 of the 800 caballerias that have been sowed. It has 12 tons of fuel when it actually needs 36 tons, and it has less than half the manpower needed to tend this crop. Could the plan be responsible for a low yield and Granma's inability to meet the demands for tubers and vegetables? Well, since we are currently at a basic production unit, we will talk with agronomist Justina Reve. What do you think, Justina? [Reve] We must understand the situation. Production at our farm, meaning our enterprise, must be distributed twice to each consumer -- if we may use that expression. In other words, although we have to distribute the produce among the population, we must also send the produce to daycare centers, schools, and hospitals. This scant production must be distributed among all consumers. Likewise, we must realize a higher amount of produce than was previously available in the market and the [words indistinct] stands. Now we can produce only enough tubers and rice, of which there is very little, to send to market. Although we continue to produce the same amount of tubers, it is not enough because we have to supply more consumers. [Maso] Then you agree with what the report indicates -- that efforts are being made here in Granma, but that you fail to meet the demands? [Reve] Yes, I agree with that, but we must add something: The people hear that we have sowed many caballerias in Granma, but they must realize that not all of these caballerias are currently producing. Most of the caballerias were recently sowed with plantains, which need between three and four months to grow, so production has yet to begin. A small number of caballerias are currently producing, so we cannot produce more or meet the people's demands.
