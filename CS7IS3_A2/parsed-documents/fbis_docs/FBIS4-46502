Today, considerably more Kaliningrad-bound foreign ships have started passing through the main base of the Baltic Fleet, which has made the problem of ensuring safety even more complex. The Russian Maritime Transportation Department has recently certified the fact of the creation in Baltiysk of the oblast's first coastal system of shipping movements. Its base is the "Okean-SP" coastal radar complex which can automatically track 55 targets at once.
