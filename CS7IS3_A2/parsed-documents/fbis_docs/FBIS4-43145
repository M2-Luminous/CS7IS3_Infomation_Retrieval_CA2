Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, made the outburst in a Beirut courtroom where he is standing trial accused of assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut in January. "I personally blew up the Lockerbie plane," Sha'ban, a follower of terrorist chief Abu Nidal, told the court today. "I've told the investigating magistrate about it before, but my confession wasn't documented. I say it again now," said Sha'ban, of Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council. If Sha'ban's claim is to be taken literally, it would appear to question the Western case that the bombing was carried out by two Libyans who have yet to surrender for trial in Scotland or the United States. But British relatives' spokesman Dr. Jim Swire said today that neither he nor others involved in the tragedy had heard of Sha'ban before. "His claim should be regarded with grave suspicion," said Dr. Swire, whose daughter Flora was one of the 270 people killed when a terrorist bomb brought down the PanAm jumbo jet over Lockerbie. "It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists might regard as kudos for the Abu Nidal organisation, for all I know." Until a trial took place of the two Libyans, it was impossible to say who was involved, said Dr. Swire. "In the absence of that trial, all claims deserve to be looked at -- but they should equally be treated with grave suspicion." And the Foreign Office in London said: "As we have said many times in the past, we believe there is a case to be answered in a court in Scotland or the United States by the two Libyans. If anyone has further information which implicates anyone else, this could be brought to the attention of the Lord Advocate in Scotland or the U.S. authorities." In Scotland, a spokesman for the Crown Office said the Lord Advocate had seen no evidence relating to "the alleged involvement" of Sha'ban. "If anyone has any evidence relating to the case, they should make it available to the Dumfries and Galloway constabulary," the spokesman added.
