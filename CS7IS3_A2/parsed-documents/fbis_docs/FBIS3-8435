According to the new so-called Agents' Law [adopted on 8 March], the parliament's National Security Committee will have to select three judges whose duty will be to screen citizens. Let us start with the most interesting aspect of the law: It is backdated to 1 January 1994 and will be in force untill 30 June 2000. The relevant documents are closed to inspection until the year 2030. Well, this puts the whole affair in a different light. [passage omitted] [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Back in the autumn of 1990, right at the beginning of the parliament's tenure, Gabor Demszky, then deputy, and Peter Hack, an excellent lawyer, submitted an excellent bill, which could have settled the matter. The government parties voted down the proposal, it was not even put up for debate in the parliament. Then the government submitted several times a less well thought out and less clear bill that went on and on. Prime Minister Peter Boross participated in the debate of the bill in various capacities -- as a minister without portfolio supervising the secret services, and later as interior minister, and finally as prime minister -- and every time he voiced his doubts. So, perhaps the kind of behavior that characterizes this matter is hypocrisy. On the one hand, they were pushing the propaganda for this bill, on the other, the government and the government parties did everything in their power to see that this law should not be adopted until the end of this parliament's tenure. And here it is: The parliament adopted a law for the next parliament in the 11th hour, without sufficient preparation, and with the hastily thought out proposed amendments of the Constitutional Committee. And this is morally very objectionable behavior, and on behalf of my party I dissociate myself from it. [passage omitted] [Announcer] However, you personally will have to search for the judges who will carry out the task of screening. [Passage omitted] What does not come to light from the Agents' Law is how far the investigation goes back into the past. For example, there are questions about whether or not someone was a member of the Arrow-Cross Party. So how far are we going back -- 40, 50 years? [Mecs] [Passage omitted] It is rather a matter of principle. However, the law, in its opening paragraphs, lists the predecessor organizations it applies to and the PRO [Political Police Department -- Politikai Rendeszeti Osztaly] that was formed in February 1945, and thus its agent network and officer corps fall under the law. [passage omitted] However, on the basis of various considerations, the government confined the terms of the law to the activities and employees of the III/3 Department [reference to the Interior Ministry's secret police group during the communist regime] and its predecessors. Thus, the informers who worked for the Army or the military police are exempt, and so are those who were planted in the emigration abroad and who caused immense damage. [passage omitted] However, an even bigger problem is that, in effect, the implementation of the law will fail because, at the last minute, the National Assembly's Constitutional Committee smuggled into the law a provision that covers the editors and editor in chiefs of privately-owned papers with a circulation exceeding 30,000. This, we think, is unconstitutional on several counts. [passage omitted] [Announcer] [Passage omitted] Do you think that the reporting of suspected former agents by members of the public will now become a fashion? [passage omitted] [Mecs] It is very difficult to make reports like this because those in the know are former staff in the Interior Ministry, the officers of the III/3 Department, and a few leading former politicians. [passage omitted] However, there is no defense against slanderous accusations because the amendment that intended to create the possibility for any citizen to ask for a vetting against himself was rejected by the National Assembly. I fear that there will be many sly slanderous charges and people will not be able to clear themselves. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Are you sure that the documents of the reports survived? Some people doubt that the documents are authentic. We know that around the change of the regime there were cleansing and paper laundering at various departments. [passage omitted] [Mecs] [Passage omitted] Indeed, very many papers were destroyed but even more survived. The staff of Istvan Horvath, did not select properly, but panicked and had all sorts of things destroyed. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Did you expect, when debating the law, that people would confess voluntarily? [passage omitted] [Mecs] Look, this law is not, in effect, a penal law, it only exerts pressure on somebody to resign. He, who -- as a result of pressure regrettably became involved into the secret service and has since purified himself, having gone through a catharsis -- is a valuable person who is acceptable to society.
