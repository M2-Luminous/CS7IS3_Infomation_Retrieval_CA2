FR940719-2-00097 FR940719-2-00060 Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Professional Nurse Traineeships for Fiscal Year 1994 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Professional Nurse Traineeships funded under the authority of section 830, title VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Purpose Section 830 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award grants to meet the cost of traineeships for individuals in advanced-degree programs in order to educate the individuals to serve in and prepare for practice as nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse educators, public health nurses, or in other clinical nursing specialties determined by the Secretary to require advanced education. Federal support must be requested annually. Statutory Preference In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that: (a) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (b) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' A notice which announced this grant cycle was published in the Federal Register on November 3, 1993 at 58 FR 58703, and proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore, the percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed, except that a technical correction has been made in the definition for ``high rate.'' The final minimum percentages are shown below. ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990&hyph;91, 1991&hyph;92 or 1992&hyph;93 who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.
