The parents of chief culprit Wu Lihong [0702 3680 1347] returned home on the evening of 21 April. Wu's father is 58 years old this year, and his mother is 56 years old; both are farmers. There are five brothers and sisters in the family, Wu being the youngest son. He has an elder brother and three married elder sisters. His brother graduated from the Hangzhou Armed Police Corps Cadet School and is now an armed police corps officer. The Wus' house is located at Qianjiao village, Tongziwu township in Chunan County, by the side of Qiandao Lake. Six years ago, Wu's father spent some 10,000 yuan to build a new, six-room two-story house, with a floor space of some 170 square meters. According to Wu's father, his youngest son was an introvert in temperament, and had been good at his studies since he was young. Later, through an entrance examination, he was admitted to a local key high school, Qinghan Middle School. Later, he failed the entrance examination for senior middle school, being 10 points short. Consequently, he studied at home for two years and took the entrance examination again, but failed it once again. Last April, Wu borrowed 8,000 yuan from his elder brother, and another 2,000 from his father and a friend; in addition he took out a loan of 15,000 yuan. With this money, he purchased a 25-horsepower Shuixing-brand speedboat, thus starting his business of carrying tourists on the lake. Toward the end of last year, he sold the speedboat, and spend 68,000 yuan to purchase a 75-horsepower Yamaha 70-seat speedboat, in partnership with his good friend, Yu Aijun [0151 1947 6511], (another culprit in the same case), with which they continued the business of carrying tourists. Wu's father said that before the incident took place, Wu Lihong was doing business in the town of Qiandaohu, and seldom came home. He knew of his son's bad habit of gambling, but he knew nothing about his son's heinous crime. Wu's father said that a person should bear sole responsibility for his adtions, and he had a grasp of this truth. Now that his son had committed a heinous crime, it served him right to received a stern legal penalty. The old man had faith in the people's government. An accomplice of Wu Lihong was 23-year-old Yu Aijun [0151 1947 6511], a native of the city of Jiangde, in Zhejiang Province. He had been a soldier, and when apprehended, was wearing a worn Army uniform without insignia; he was a very handsome young man, at that. The other culprit was 24-year-old Hu Zhihan [5170 1807 3466], a native of Chunan County, Qiandaohu Town. He was small in physique. His father worked at the Chunan Agricultural Bureau. During the trial, he sat with his legs crossed, making a confession of his crime behind iron bars. He was very logical when he spoke, and was the most eloquent of the three culprits. The three culprits used to be schoolmates. During the trial, all of them looked and spoke with very clear train of thought. They told the police that they had worked on the plan for six months or so, and did not expect their case to be discovered; they expressed admiration for the police.
