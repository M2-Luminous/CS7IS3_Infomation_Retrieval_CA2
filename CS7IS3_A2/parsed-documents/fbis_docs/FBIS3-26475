Since January this year, six costly accidents have taken place in coal mines, much heavier than in the same period last year in terms of frequency and casualties. Each accident caused more than 10 deaths. In the latter half of January, four gas and coal-dust explosions took place in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hunan and Guizhou Provinces. Wang Senhao, minister of coal industry, attributed the frequent accidents to the chaos in management and inadequate equipment in coal mines as well as the poor quality of the employees. "The root cause for this is that some officials put profits before security," he said. He called on all coal mine operations to launch an inspection movement in February and March to avert gas and coal-dust explosions. Township coal mines and those small mines split from the major state-owned coal mines, the major accident-makers, should be rectified, he said. Li Boyong, minister of labor, also told XINHUA that 84 major accidents causing ten or more deaths at one time took place in China last year, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year. He said the situation this year allowed no optimism, adding that no efforts should be spared to ensure safety in production.
