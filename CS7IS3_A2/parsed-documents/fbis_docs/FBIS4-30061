FBIS4-30061 "dreas121_a_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition, SDPJ Nearing Agreement Coalition, SDPJ Nearing Agreement OW2306074094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0728 GMT 23 Jun 94 OW2306074094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- The shaky ruling coalition of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and the former partner Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] were nearing agreement in their crucial reconciliation talks Thursday [23 June], with speculation rife on the probability of Hata's resignation, political sources said. Jockeying among key political parties entered the last stretch amid a looming possibility of agreement on realliance being reached at a meeting later in the day between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama. The SDP, which split from the coalition in April in protest against maneuvering by its partners to create a new Diet bloc excluding the SDP, confirmed earlier in the day the party's policy of demanding Hata's resignation as a condition for its rejoining the fold. Murayama is expected to urge Hata, who leads the first minority government in four decades, to resign along with his ministers at the planned meeting, coalition and SDP sources said. Hata has so far rejected the call, but some coalition lawmakers Thursday voiced the view that he will announce his bowing out to pave the way for an early realliance. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition bloc, is poised to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after the budget passes the Diet later in the day. The SDP turned down the LDP proposal for talks to form a joint government in a clear signal that it places top priority on the bid to rejoin hands with the coalition. The SDP-coalition negotiations, based on the SDP's policy outline put forth Wednesday, centered on the bills for redrawing an electoral map in line with the political reform law passed in January and the proposed hike of the consumption tax. The coalition called for an extension of the term for the current Diet session, which expires next Wednesday, for the passage of the bills, while the socialists argued it should be delayed to the next session, the sources said. On the consumption tax, the coalition sought an SDP agreement to specify the size of the hike, but the socialists, who strongly objected to the introduction of the tax, rejected the request. Meanwhile, Hata expressed strong hope for an SDP return to his camp. "I would be happy if we can move toward a new politics along with the SDP. We have a seat open for them," Hata told a House of Councillors Budget Committee session. In the face of growing prospects for the SDP's return to the ruling camp, three small reformist groups decided thursday to refuse any overtures to join the coalition unless it is made clear that the SDP will supply the prime minister. New party Sakigake [Harbinger], which also broke ranks with the coalition, the Group Seiun, a splinter group from the Japan New Party (JNP), and Minshu no Kaze (Democratic Wind), another JNP defector club, also called for fresh policy-making talks among all the parties that have accepted invitations to join the coalition. A senior Sakigake legislator, Hiroyuki Sonoda, in telephone talks with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, said the SDP's policy outline is acceptable. ``Sakigake would respond positively if the SDP tries to create a new coalition with Murayama as its head,'' he told Kubo. Another Sakigake kingpin, Shusei Tanaka, told a press conference that the SDP's move to talk not only with the coalition but also with the LDP indicates the socialists have a radical realignment of the coalition in mind.
