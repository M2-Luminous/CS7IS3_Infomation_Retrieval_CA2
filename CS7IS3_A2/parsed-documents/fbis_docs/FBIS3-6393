The officials of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said the next regular telecommunication talks between the ministry and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission are slated in Tokyo this summer. They said, under the current legal systems in Japan, such services as telephones are regulated by telecommunication law, while services like cable television are controlled by broadcasting law. Legally, an organization can operate in both fields. Providing multimedia services -- a combination of both telecommunications and broadcasting -- is therefore allowed to any company except for organizations like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa] and Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). Yet, the officials said, new regulations have to be considered in actual multimedia services, including ways to control privacy. Meanwhile, the U.S. Government, pushing for an advanced communication technology called information superhighway, is apparently considering changing laws which now prohibit organizations to operate in both telecommunication and broadcasting fields, the officials said. Japan therefore wants to suggest that this issue be taken up in the next talks so the two nations can adjust respective legal systems regarding the advanced telecommunication field, they said.
