He made the comment at a press meeting soon after consulting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to confirm their remarks over the weekend indicating a revision of government policy. He said he complained to Takemura over his remarks and said they made it difficult for him to fulfill his responsibilities as finance minister. Fujii said he reiterated that under the government's basic policy of conducting the tax cut and hike as a single measure, a joint economic forum of the government and ruling parties is to decide on the tax issue "in two or three days." He said Takemura agreed and told him that news reports did not reflect his "real intention." He later saw Hosokawa, who also agreed with him. Takemura had hinted at a reception hosted by his party, Sakigake, on Sunday, that there was a possibility of separating the tax hike and of issuing deficit-covering bonds to finance the tax cut. Hosokawa told reporters Saturday that he was not considering a consumption tax hike. Meanwhile, Fujii repeated his strong opposition to the issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds, and called for the timing and other concrete details of a consumption tax hike to be stipulated in the same law as an income tax cut so as to guarantee repayment of bonds issued to cover the time lag between the tax cut and hike.
