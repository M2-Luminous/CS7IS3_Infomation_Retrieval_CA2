FR940826-0-00081 FR940826-0-00017 Friday August 26, 1994 Part III Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 82 Protection of Stratospheric Ozone; Final Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 165␣/␣Friday, August 26, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 82 [FRL&hyph;5057&hyph;3] Protection of Stratospheric Ozone AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of Acceptability. SUMMARY: This notice expands the list of acceptable substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the amended Clean Air Act of 1990 whereby EPA is required to evaluate substitutes for the ODSs, and regulate the use of substitutes where other alternatives exist that reduce overall risk to human health and the environment. Through these evaluations, SNAP generates lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major industrial use sectors. On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated its plan for administering the SNAP program, and issued decisions on the acceptability and unacceptability of a number of substitutes (59 FR 13044). In today's Notice, EPA is issuing decisions on the acceptability of certain substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. The intended effect of this action is to expedite movement away from ozone depleting compounds. To arrive at determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency completed a cross-media sector end-use screening assessment of risks to human health and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994.
