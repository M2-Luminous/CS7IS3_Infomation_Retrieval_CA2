FR941227-2-00076 FR941227-2-00051 The following is a brief outline of the steps for paying and billing by the GSA Kansas City Finance Office: 1. Invoices with copies of purchase/delivery orders will be accepted by GSA either through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or paper. 2. Proper invoices, with accompanying purchase/delivery orders will be entered into the Finance Information Network (FINET) data base. 3. GSA will pay proper invoices (check or electronic fund transfer (EFT), at negotiated contract terms in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act. 4. GSA will bill customer agencies for reimbursement. The amount billed will be the contractor's published schedule price shown on the customer purchase/delivery order. The price published in the schedule pricelist is based on adjusting the negotiated award price upward by 1 percent (of the awarded price.) This adjustment is accomplished by multiplying the schedule contract price by 1.01. (See attached example). 5. Some data captured by GSA will be available to contractors and ordering activities via a bulletin board. such data will include paying and billing data plus a scanned image of any paper invoice and order in the system. It will also facilitate communication with the GSA Finance employees via electronic mail box or telephone for any other assistance needed. Access to the system will require identification of the user by vendor Tax Identification Number (TIN), or ordering activity paying office Activity Address Code (AAC), and a unique password. 6. Ordering offices will continue to resolve delivery problems directly with the contractors. When resolution of disputes is not forthcoming, customers may charge back billings to GSA. GSA will offset claims from future payments to suppliers after notification. Dispute will continue to be resolved by the applicable GSA contracting officers.
