As reported by the Croatian radio, the deadline for reaching the agreement was extended until next week. The delegations headed by Bosnian Croatian leader Kresimir Tubak and Prime Minister of the Moslem Government in Sarajevo Haris Silajdzic set forth, as claimed by the same source, their pros and cons of the candidate for president, giving legal and political reasons. Invoking the Washington Accord on forming Moslem-Croatian Federation in Bosnia, signed earlier this year under strong U.S. pressure, the Croatian side sought to see a Croat as head of the first president of the Moslem-Croatian Federation. The same source set out that the Croats were prepared also for a compromise: This post they would yield to the Moslems, but on condition Silajdzic be named instead of the proposed Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, whom the Croats have no wish to see under any circumstances heading the joint federation.
