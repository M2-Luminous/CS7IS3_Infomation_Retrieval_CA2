Participants will include such prominent figures as Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid, former World Bank President Robert McNamara and Taro Nakayama, former Japanese foreign minister. The meeting is to be held under the cosponsorship of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN University and the Foreign Ministry.

Terada said Japan is by far the largest donor country for UNFPA, donating 59 million dollars in 1992 and as much as 63 million dollars in 1993.
