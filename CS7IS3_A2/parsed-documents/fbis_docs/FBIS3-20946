Private Conversion 94WS0163C Berlin INGENIEUR DIGEST in German, Dec 93 p 37 94WS0163C Berlin INGENIEUR DIGEST Language: German, Article Type:CSO [Article by Klaus Beumler, technology consultant at VDI/VDE-IT (Association of German Engineers and Association of German Electrical Engineers - Information Technology Ltd)] [Text] Privatization. With the help of business contacts, the Velox Automation Ltd is finding the direction to the profit zone in West Europe 1994. Established in 1990, this new technological enterprise employs already 13 workers. "Direction to profit zone has been found" say ex-officer Wunderwald. The family of products offered by the team of ex-officers includes special sensors for operation in intricate and extreme environments, also robust but efficient measuring instruments as well as control and regulation engineering devices. The new developments, registered under the trademark "Velomat", utilize the latest knowledge and experience concerning error-tolerant networks and simulation of complex sensor or actuator fields. The founders of this enterprise located at the Brauna in Saxony had previously worked in the Department of Scientific Instrument Design at the Officers' College in Kamenz. Reinald Wunderwald, the guiding spirit of the founding foursome, did not want to wait till others would decide his professional fate. He aroused in his friends enthusiasm for establishment of an engineering office: "We should be able to successfully apply our technical know-how and team spirit to production of civilian goods." The four of them plunged into preparatory theoretical work and then let an enterprise consultant help them with the financial concept. After the Velox Ltd had finally been established in spring 1990, there followed usual difficulties: aggrevation with hesitant bankers and attendance in many places at the same time. Simultaneously with the development of a salable product line, there also had to be built up a core of customers. During this difficult phase the Velox team made contact with the VDI/VDE- Technology Center for Information Technology. The offered TOU (Technology- Oriented Enterprise Establishments) assistance program was gratefully accepted and subsidies were quickly approved. Meanwhile, the Velomat product line has grown to include 20 items and more are being developed. Stimulation for this is now already provided by the expanding core of customers. This TOU assistance provided the foundation for dynamic evolution of the Velox Ltd from an engineering office into a manufacturing enterprise. "The program has helped us a great deal" says Wunderwald. He does not hide, however, that arriving so far has required quite a lot staying power. "We relied too much on the East German medium-size industry." The recession in machine manufacturing in the old (East German) States created gaps in the original conversion plan. The management team of this enterprises, which had already grown to a staff of 13 employees, was helped by business contacts in Austria, France, and the Netherlands in overcoming those deficiencies. "The present status of orders indicates that next year we will have reached the profit zone" joyfully announces Wunderwald.
