This was announced to the Financial Information Agency by sources in the Central Bank of Russia today. The same source said that initially the sum of currency interventions by the bank had exceeded the total volume. However, by the end of the quarter the Central Bank of Russia bought back a part of the hard currency on the currency market. Currently, the Central Bank of Russia is pursuing a moderately tough policy aimed at lessening the fluctuations of the dollar, the source pointed out. The same source suggested that more energetic or decreased influence on the currency market was determined mostly by economic reasons and the exchange rate of the dollar. In early 1994 the Central Bank of Russia officially stated that during the first three weeks in January it had spent more than one billion dollars for currency interventions. According to the Central Bank of Russia, the total volume of its currency resources sold on six Russian stock exchanges last year was 14.7 billion dollars (2.8 billion dollars in 1992). For late 1993 the resources of the Central Bank of Russia amounted to 4.4 billion dollars. At that moment the currency resources of Russian commercial banks were put at 12 billion dollars. Chairperson of the Central Bank of Russia, Viktor Gerashchenko, announced during the parliamentary hearings in the State Duma that the bank planned to increase its currency resources from 4.5 billion dollars to 9.5 billion dollars by the end of 1994. He stressed that the bank had begun to carry out moderate interventions on currency market instead of the intensive ones. Thus, the Central Bank of Russia intends to lessen the difference between the inflation rate and the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar on the stock exchanges.
