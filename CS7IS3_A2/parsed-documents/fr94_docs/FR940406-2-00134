Rules Standards & Instructions Application (RS&I&hyph;AP) No. 1092 Applicant: Southern Pacific Lines, Mr. E.P. Reilly, Vice President and Chief Engineer, Southern Pacific Building, One Market Plaza, San Francisco, California 94105. The Southern Pacific Lines (SP) seeks relief from the requirements of the Rules, Standard and Instructions, 49 CFR, Part 236, ยง236.307, to the extent that the carrier not be required to install indication locking for approximately 224 signal locations on the SP, the aspects of which are not controlled by line circuits so arranged that a single fault will not permit a more favorable aspect than intended to be displayed. The applicant's justification for relief is that the estimated cost of a program to achieve compliance is in excess of $700,000 and would take several years to complete the required work. Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of an application shall set forth specifically the grounds upon which the protest is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the protestant in the proceeding. The original and two copies of the protest shall be filed with the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 calendar days of the date of issuance of this notice. Additionally, one copy of the protest shall be furnished to the applicant at the address listed above. FRA expects to be able to determine these matters without oral hearing. However, if a specific request for an oral hearing is accompanied by a showing that the party is unable to adequately present his or her position by written statements, an application may be set for public hearing. Issued in Washington, DC, on March 30, 1994. Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation.
