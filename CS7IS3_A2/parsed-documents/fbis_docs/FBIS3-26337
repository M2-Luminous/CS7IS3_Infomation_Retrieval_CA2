During an inspection of the provincial capital of Fuzhou and Xiamen city from February 3 to 5, Zhu said the zone has made great progress in infrastructure construction since 1992. "This has laid a sound foundation for the zone's future development and construction, as well as for Xiamen's further development," he told local officials. As a pioneer in opening to the outside world, Fujian Province has undergone great changes and scored tremendous achievements in reforms and economic growth, he said. While visiting the Taijiang farmers' market in Fuzhou, he praised Fujian Province for paying heed to the farming sector and vegetable production. Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful supplies of non-staple food, especially vegetables, to the satisfaction of consumers, he said. "I think this will help create a relaxed environment for reforms and economic expansion in Fujian this year," said Zhu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. As a result of the taxation reform begun this year, about 28 percent of state-owned businesses have shouldered a slightly heavier tax burden, he told local government officials and business executives. He also expressed the hope that these businesses will further improve management, cut back on expenses and lower production costs, rather than raise prices of their products. While visiting the Haicang Investment Zone, the vice-premier extended Spring Festival greetings to all workers at construction sites. Speaking of the zone's development in the next phase, he called for faster construction of a power plant, a coal terminal and other facilities and for efforts to further improve the investment environment.
