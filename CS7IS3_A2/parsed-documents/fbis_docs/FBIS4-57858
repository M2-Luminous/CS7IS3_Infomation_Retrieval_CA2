This candidacy faces considerable difficulties. Quercia's image as a politician and administrator, which has been surrounded by doubts and suspicions for a long time, is now exposed to a still more serious threat resulting from the fraud charges filed against him by the Federal Prosecutor's Office. As if this were not enough, the Superior Court may decide to uphold the charges right in the middle of a campaign in which there will be more concern about ethics and honesty than before. Quercia is also facing problems inside his own party. Despite his power over the PMDB machinery, there is serious resistance to his candidacy in several states. The large number of abstentions during the voting in the party primaries and the party convention indicate that Quercia can hardly count on the party's overall support. In addition, the fact that the PMDB is still the largest Brazilian party will no longer be important if its members are not effectively devoted to ensuring the candidate's victory in the elections. The Democratic Social Party members' lack of interest in Cristiano Machado's electoral campaign in 1950, when most of the party decided to support Getulio Vargas' candidacy, gave birth to the term "Christianize." Ulysses Guimaraes' defeat as a presidential candidate in 1989, when he was abandoned by the PMDB during his presidential campaign, is the most prominent example of similar behavior in recent years. Quercia, however, is entitled to comparatively long, free electoral propaganda time on radio and television. Many believe he will use this time to involve the campaign in such an exchange of accusations that he will neutralize suspicions hanging over his head. An old-fashioned politician who is personal and addicted to the most traditional sort of political patronage, he has already started the campaign with a populist and aggressive attack against his adversaries. All that remains to be seen is whether this will be enough to reverse his weak performance in the electoral polls.
