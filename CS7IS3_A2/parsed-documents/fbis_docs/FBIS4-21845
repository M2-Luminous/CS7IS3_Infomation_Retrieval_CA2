Brig. Gen. Regino Lacson, Army 2d Infantry Division commanding general, said that last week alone, small teams of communist guerrilla terrorists attacked several groups of civilians in mountain barangays [villages] in three provinces. In Barangay Casay, Lupi, Camarines Sur, last 24 March, rebels fired a grenade from an M-203 launcher at a "pulong-pulong [gathering]" of residents who were planning a livelihood project in cooperation with the military. A barangay captain, a woman and her seven-year-old son were wounded during the attack while scores of other residents were injured in the stampede for safety. In a resettlement area in Barangay Caldon, Sampaloc, Quezon, three suspected NPA rebels sprayed another gathering of civilians, wounding a resident identified only as a certain "Boy" of the barangay last 20 March. Last 25 March, at Barangay Salipsip, Polilio, Quezon, rebels fired on a house during a heavy rainfall. Elements of the 236 PNP [Philippine National Police] Mobile Force who had taken cover from the rain in the house fired back at the rebels and a firefight that lasted for about 30 minutes ensued. Residents said that three dead rebels were carried away by their companions when they escaped and policemen recovered from the encounter scene one M16 Armalite rifle.
