In the first case the reason was clear. Losses occasioned by the caprices of the weather have added, in a completely unexpected way, to the enormous material costs connected with the unification of the country. Once again the state coffers are bare; German citizens have never understood the treasury as something abstract; for them it is closely bound up with their own pocketbooks. The second issue is far more complex. Germany is probably the only country in which the announcement of a victory for the "right-wing persuasion" in Russia could electrify the political atmosphere so completely. This topic has immediately come to the fore, opening up clear and -- we must suppose -- long-term work prospects for the multitude of experts on Russia. What is most staggering for the Germans is the appearance in the Russian political lexicon of the word "fascism," which used to be a dirty word for Russians. Without considering the extent to which voters who cast their votes for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] were genuinely linking that party with the possibility of fascism's coming to power in Russia, or whether they are pursuing this policy deliberately, certain circles in Germany are blatantly inflaming the German imagination. Moreover, their efforts are to a certain extent being helped along by some of the LDPR leader's statements and his behavior. Some people, for example, are already calling for the Western Group of Forces to be scrutinized more carefully. They are saying that the forces are a small piece of Russia, and that piece of Russia also contains Zhirinovskiy supporters. Are they not likely to make contact with German extremists and thus contribute to the cause of uniting Europe's right-wing radicals? These fears are not emerging just anywhere, but in the Saxony Land Department for the Protection of the Constitution. Department head Frau M. Keller said as much to a staffer from the Western Group of Forces Press Center: "The department is checking to see whether German right-wing radicals have any contacts with LDPR supporters in the Western Group of Forces." It seems that those who support unrelenting efforts in the military sphere will not miss this opportunity to exploit the situation and draw more attention to the Bundeswehr. The newspapers have instituted a trend of cursing the government for its "lack of concern" in the defense sphere. In the opinion of P. Wuerzbach, former under secretary of state at the Ministry of Defense, the federal chancellor "is doing absolutely nothing to resolve the financial problems facing the Bundeswehr" and he "should say once and for all what he can offer the armed forces." There is another curious point which may also be connected with events in Russia. One in three German citizens sees "nothing bad" about foreign troops being stationed in his country. This is the conclusion reached by specialists who consistently poll people on the issue. They claim that the number of Germans who support the preservation of a foreign military presence in the FRG is growing. The researchers attribute this phenomenon not only to the traditional unwillingness of inhabitants of specific regions to countenance the material costs that would inevitably arise from the loss of an additional reserve of jobs and stable consumers in the form of foreign servicemen. It also has behind it the "NATOization" of the consciousness of a population which has grown accustomed to linking its own security with the strength of the Atlantic alliance, and which particularly reflects on that strength at times when there are indications of a threat.
