In reports broadcast on television Saturday evening, a number of deputy ministers of commerce, agriculture, and foreign affairs, sought to study ways of handling the price rises and efforts to lift the multifaceted sanctions imposed on Iraq since the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait in August, 1990. Deputy Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz Khadduri confirmed that inflation was continuing in the markets, as were price rises, to a degree burdensome to citizens and society, despite all the measures the government has taken to fight high prices. Five days ago, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn asked government institutions to stop buying dollars from the local market, in an effort to halt the steep rise in the price of the dollar, which is considered the major cause of the price rises. Money exchangers in Baghdad say that the price of the dollar has stabilized in recent days, at 106 or 107 Iraqi dinars [ID], after having reached ID115 at the end of October. The drop in the price of the dinar in the parallel market has been linked to the rise--ranging from 20 to 70 percent--in the prices of basic commodities in recent weeks. The cost of Iraqi foodstuff imports is paid in dollars. He indicated that the Iraqi dinar is now officially worth $3.20. The recent drop in dinar rates is traceable to the suspension of talks between Iraq and the United Nations on the sale of Iraqi oil in early October. These talks dealt with the sale of $1.6 billion worth of Iraqi oil under UN supervision, to fund Iraq's imports of foodstuffs.
