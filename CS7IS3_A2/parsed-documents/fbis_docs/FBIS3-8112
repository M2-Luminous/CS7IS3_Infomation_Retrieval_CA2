To date, we have 2,959,100 registered unemployed. This means that, in January, employment offices registered in excess of 69,500 unemployed people more than during the previous month. Is it a seasonal phenomenon? According to Jerzy Szreter, labor and social policy vice minister, it is difficult to formulate an unequivocal hypothesis on the basis of the data available to us at the moment. The increase in the number of unemployed was registered in virtually every voivodship in the country, with the highest increment in Chelm (6.3 percent) and Krakow (5.3 percent) Voivodships. Things were bad enough before, but they are getting even worse now. The proportion of unemployed women is on the increase (51.6 percent), as is that of people who are not eligible for unemployment benefits. Of the newly registered unemployed, more than 64,500 are not entitled to receive unemployment benefits (compared with 48,500 in December). This is still the largest group among the total population of registered unemployed. The only optimistic accent in this situation is that there are a few more job vacancies on the labor market (in January there were 41,171 vacancies, compared to 28,000 in December). At the same time, there is still a tremendous differentiation in this index between different regions of the country. For example, the largest number of unemployed per job vacancy was recorded in the following voivodships: Ostroleka (953), Biala Podlaska (914), and Kielce (814). The best situation in the local labor market was reported in Warsaw (16 applicants per vacancy), Gdansk (37 applicants per vacancy), and Krakow Voivodships. More than 53,000 jobless were employed in various emergency operations and more than 15,600 in a range of public works. In addition, more than 13,600 people were being trained or retrained for new jobs. Close observation of the changes that took place in the labor market last year could lead us to expect that a further increase in unemployment figures is again possible in February, while March should see a stemming of the tide, and April should bring a stop to the seasonal surge in unemployment. However, all of these estimates are still based on speculation. The official announcement of a proposed introduction of a number of new legislative moves brought further confusion into the scene. For example, the announcement that the period of eligibility for unemployment benefits will be extended for people with dependent children in full-time education. A surge in unemployment registrations for a certain social group--namely, sole family breadwinners--has already been noted in employment offices in Lodz. What are the needs of the national labor market? To begin with, several hundred billion zlotys [Z] for regions under particular threat of unemployment, Z800 billion to finance restructuring projects for the regions of Lodz and Walbrzych, and Z2 trillion for intensification of projects promoting active forms of combating unemployment. "There is enough money in the kitty for unemployment benefits now, and there will be enough for the future," Minister Szreter assures us. "There is no direct danger that we will run out of funds. Even so, should the situation on the labor market continue to deteriorate sharply and result in an unexpectedly large increase in unemployment figures, we will have one other solution left: simply to curtail expenditure on schemes promoting active forms of combating unemployment (we are not, in any case, statutorily obliged to run them)." For the time being, the ministry has no available data that would enable experts to establish whether privatization causes increased unemployment. On the one hand, privatization certainly promotes rationalization of employment, and that means reduction in the numbers of work positions. On the other hand, it often poses a dilemma: Should the employer choose to salvage at least half of the existing work positions through privatization, or should he let them all go, thus throwing all employees out onto the streets? There are more mass layoffs in the state sector, although the time when the private sector forever employed new people and never laid them off is long gone. It is true that many new firms are being created all the time, but just as many are simultaneously collapsing and going bankrupt. Unfortunately, all attempts to press Minister Szreter to reveal whether the forecasts claiming that by the end of this year we would have, at most, 3.05 million unemployed were at all realistic, met with no success. He failed to answer the question clearly and unequivocally; indeed, he could not have done so because no one can know the answer. All too frequently, unemployment has made it plain that it is an elementary force that can easily defeat all attempts to control it....
