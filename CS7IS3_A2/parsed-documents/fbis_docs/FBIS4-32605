As for the members of Abdic's traitor phalange, there has been no change from the usual, despite the successive defeats suffered by that rebel scum. Last night they launched barbaric attacks straight after Fikret Abdic -- in the steps of his hero Radovan Karadzic -- announced some sort of a counteroffensive. From Liskovac, Rosic, and (Crkva), they have been shelling the newly liberated areas in the Cazin and Kladusa municipalities and, from the Kladusa area, they have been pounding with mortars and cannons (Golubovici), [words indistinct]. An entire sabotage group was captured during these attacks. Abdic's warmongering headquarters has continued to arrest citizens in Velika Kladusa, and to terrorize them. Another request has been sent to international organizations for help in their protection, since these are people who do not want war and who reject the insane ideas of the self-proclaimed Kladusa leader.
