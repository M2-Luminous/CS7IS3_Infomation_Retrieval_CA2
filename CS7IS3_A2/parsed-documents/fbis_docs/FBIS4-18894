[Speroni] There is also a tactical element, but the essence of the matter is the following: [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi cannot claim to be the only leader in the coalition, overshadowing [League Secretary] Bossi. We have reminded him that the League is the number-one political force, at least in the lower house. [Ballardin] Therefore, we are only at the preliminary tactical stage: You are raising your voice on the prime minister issue so as to make your partners swallow the federalist hot potato. [Speroni] Let me speak very frankly: Between the issue of the prime minister and that of federalism, I think it is more important to break through on the latter. We suggested to Berlusconi creating a governmental committee which would prepare a constitutional reform -- in a federalist direction -- within a two-month period. Then the government would approve it, and would submit a constitutional bill, which would have to be approved after a double reading in the two houses. [Ballardin] In brief, what competences would the central state have? [Speroni] Defense, foreign policy, monetary policy, and, partly, justice. Berlusconi listened to us and promised to reply by next Wednesday [13 April], after having consulted [National Alliance leader] Fini, who is continuing to send out contradictory messages: One day he is open to federalism, and next day he is against. [Ballardin] Fini is saying that he does not want to jeopardize national unity. [Speroni] We are not aware that in the United States, Switzerland, or Germany federalism has given rise to this sort of risk. [Ballardin] Let us consider now the senior institutional positions, in the upper and lower houses. For the Senate, [former President] Cossiga is being mentioned. [Speroni] Is Cossiga a League member? No. Is he a Forza Italia member? No. Is he a National Alliance [AN] member? No. Not only has he not won the elections, he also represents the old regime, having joined the government 20 years ago, under the DC [Christian Democratic Party] banner. As you know, I am standing as a candidate for the post of Senate speaker. [Ballardin] What about [Italian Republican Party (PRI) member] Spadolini? [Speroni] It cannot be that I win, and then find someone like Spadolini as the Senate speaker, just like before. Therefore, Spadolini must go home. [Ballardin] [Center Union member] Biondi for the lower house? [Speroni] Biondi is part of the winning coalition, but he is certainly not a new face. Still, he may pass. [Ballardin] What about the anti-Mafia commission? What about the services control committee? [Speroni] The same applies. Enough with people like [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Senator] Violante and Pecchioli [PDS member, chairman of the parliamentary secret services committee]! For the senior administrative positions, as well as for those in the state partnerships, we must partly introduce the "spoil system" in our own country. In the United States, when a new president takes office, over 10,000 civil servants, appointed by the previous administration, get fired. [Ballardin] What about the minister sweepstake? We have not yet discussed any ministers' names, except two cases, [Clean Hands public prosecutor] Di Pietro and [former Clean Hands judge] Parenti. In Di Pietro's case we decided "no." As far as Parenti is concerned, she will not have the justice portfolio. [Ballardin] What about [Radical leader] Pannella as foreign minister? [Speroni] We have not discussed this possibility. [Ballardin] What about [President] Scalfaro? [Speroni] Someone who has been president during the First Republic cannot be president in the second, unless he is himself the ferryman. [Ballardin] However, Berlusconi said that Scalfaro could retain his position, because he managed to stay "above the contending parts." [Speroni] We do not agree. Scalfaro is a conservative, and if everything changes, as we want it to change, he is the first who must leave. Perhaps not from one day to the next, among other reasons because the present Constitution does not provide for this situation, unless something new comes up on the [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti and company front. We hope that he will be sensible enough to leave of his own accord.
