This obvious premise leads us to a thorough analysis of the foreign policy we have implemented for more than three decades. We can say that Cuba has never been mistaken about the cardinal principles that rule its behavior in relation to other nations, states, or governments. Among these principles, as a basis of its policy, we can mention a respect for truth regardless of circumstance. Over the past few days, on 10 and 11 February specifically, certain incidents took place around the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, incidents of which our people are well aware, that seek to create artificial tension in an effort, through manipulation, to counterbalance the growing acceptance by international public opinion, governments, and institutions of the obvious truth that the blockade against our country is unjust, immoral, and not good for anyone's legal interests; that it is an obsolete expression of the Cold War, of arrogance, intransigence, and intolerance on this, the eve of a new century, and is a special challenge for all of mankind. This same behavior reflects the biased, unjust, and often extortionist attitude of imperialism toward human rights. Cuba has extensively revealed all details as well as its interpretation of the incident without any sign of arrogance, but on the contrary, with the composure and firmness with which it acts in this and other more tense, more complex circumstances. Cuba reasserts that the incidents reported and publicly analyzed by JUVENTUD REBELDE in its Sunday issue are a faithful reflection of the truth. It is not by fomenting violence, by violating the security of diplomatic or consular offices, or others of similar status, that differences or conflicts are solved, nor do we contribute to international peace and security. Cuba honors its commitments, and faithful to the principles followed by Marti, respects the truth. The facts are well known. Those, once against caught redhanded, responsible for these actions should reconsider their serious misconduct. If they believe they are even partly right, they should have no fear of admitting their ideas within the framework of equality and mutual respect with which international relations treated. On the contrary, they should at least have the sense of decency to remain silent, because in this case as in others, silence implies consent.
