Virtually without fanfare the Thai people have knuckled down to build an industrious economy. Concurrently they have nurtured a commitment, fragile but growing, to democratic principles and an open society. Bilateral relations with Australia have also grown steadily, especially in economic and political terms. Globally the two have acted together in common cause, notably as members of the Cairns Group pursuing free and open agricultural trade through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Today these links will be celebrated in a highly symbolic fashion when the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, formally opens the Australian-funded and constructed "Friendship Bridge" spanning the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos. The bridge completes a highway network extending for the first time from Beijing to Singapore. It has immense economic significance, and will entrench Thailand's status as a key gateway to Indochina. For Australia, the $42 million [currency further not specified] bridge symbolises efforts both in strengthening regional links generally and in employing Australia's technological capacity for the benefit of the region. Australia and Thailand have often taken their relations too much for granted, as officials on both sides of yesterday's talks between Mr Keating and his counterpart Chuan Leekpai, acknowledged last night. The talks aimed to change that, with new perspectives on how to lift bilateral trade and investment. From an Australian perspective Thailand has been the neglected power of South-East Asia partly because bilateral relations, compared with other parts of the region, have been so problem-free and untroubled. Yet it has the second largest economy in the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Though less than a quarter the size of Australia's, its gross domestic product has grown on average 7 per cent every year since the 1950s. Last year Australian exports to Thailand increased nearly 50 percent, to $1.2 billion. This makes it our 12th largest export market -- up from 20th only two years previously. Economic success has not come without cost. Most Thai industry is centred on Bangkok, which with only 16 percent of the population produces half of GDP. Pollution and exploitation in the labour market are serious problems. However, the gradual rise in prosperity has also created a large and politically activist middle class, which has come a metaphor for Thailand's capacity to make a lasting transition from military-dominated rule to parliamentary democracy. Mr Keating's visit to Laos, Thailand and Vietnam is a natural and consistent expression in the modern era of what he has termed Australia's "constructive engagement" with the region. These are not countries of first rank importance in terms of Australian foreign policy, but that does not diminish the value of regular high-level personal contact. It is 5 years since the last prime ministerial visit to Thailand. That was made by Mr Bob Hawke, who used the occasion to announce Australia would build the bridge Mr Keating is to open today. The importance of Thailand, with a population three times more numerous than Australia's, an export economy dominated by manufacturing and a stabilising political system, is growing. It is an influential force in ASEAN and a keen supporter of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. As resources-rich Thailand prospers, Australia should be confident about ensuring bilateral relations flourish along with it.
