This morning, Farida Ayari managed to get through to one RPF official, Emile Roua Massirabo. He is in Kampala, Uganda. She asked him whether his movement was considering negotiations with the interim government set up in Kigali: [Begin Massirabo recording] We hold this government responsible for everything that is happening at the moment. When one sees who is included in this government, one can easily see that this is the most extremist gang in Rwandan politics. Let us take the example of the incumbent interior minister, Faustin Munyazesa. You may have heard of what was called the death squad. He is a member of this death squad. He was cited in the international commission for human rights' report during the Buguesera massacre. How can you expect us to negotiate with people who are behind these killings? How can you negotiate with people who, over the last two or three days, slaughtered more than 10,000 people? It is beyond anything you can imagine. What they are doing now is marching on Kigali as quickly as possible and trying to save what can be saved. [end recording]
