FBIS4-10563 "drlat072_n_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-072 Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 Chile Government Issues New Capital Market Law Government Issues New Capital Market Law 94SM0296B Santiago LA NACION in Spanish 8 Mar 94 p 16 94SM0296B Santiago LA NACION Spanish CSO [Article by Patricio Peralta Zavando] [Text] Yesterday, with but a few days left to completion of its term, and after more than a year of processing in Congress, Patricio Aylwin's government promulgated the Capital Market Law. It is one of the Aylwin government's most economically important pieces of legislation and a far-reaching modernization of the financial system. The law will become effective with its publication in the DIARIO OFFICIAL on 16 March. The bill, which has now become a Law of the Republic, fundamentally modifies the current Securities Market, Pension Funds, Investment Funds, Mutual Funds, and Insurance Companies laws. The bill, it will be recalled, gave rise to intense debates in Congress, and prolonged negotiations between the government's Congressional supporters and members of the opposition, which finally culminated in a political agreement that enabled its enactment. The new law embodies a number of instruments designed to diversify investment options, and opens investment possibilities abroad for pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds. To balance the greater liberalization, the law introduces regulations that seek to prevent conflicts of interest and shady practices in the stock market. It also categorizes crimes and stipulates sanctions. Foxley In the promulgation ceremony held yesterday at the Government House, the minister of finance, Alejandro Foxley, said that "this reform will have a favorable impact on the efficiency of the savings and investments process, the size and security of the pensions the workers will receive in the future, and the openness and strength with which the capital markets will operate in our country." According to the minister, this reform represents an overall effort to revise and update the legislation relative to the securities market and institutional investors, especially the pension funds. With reference to the fundamental objectives of the reform, Foxley stated that it seeks "to develop mechanisms that enhance opportunities for financing investments in production, infrastructure, and housing." He said that this effort can be expected to have a positive effect on the country's long-term growth rate, and to reduce the Chilean economy's vulnerability to external factors, in that, "financing of the productive investment process will be able to depend to a greater extent on our national savings resources." The law is also aimed at enhancing the diversification of pension fund investments by increasing their returns and security. And lastly, it seeks to substantially improve the openness of capital market operations and reduce conflicts of interest so as to increase confidence in the equitable functioning of this market. Pension Funds Foxley pointed out that the most important feature of Pension Fund Law 3.500 is the capability it provides for pension funds to invest in new instruments, including refunding bonds, project financing bonds, securitization bonds, low-liquidity stocks, new foreign equity issues, and funds for the financing of development. He added that the modification of investment limits enables greater diversification in the pension fund's investment portfolio, expanding the opportunities for investment of funds, and reducing the pension fund's risk. In this regard, he pointed out that the easing and greater diversification of pension fund investments in bonds and other securities is accompanied by a set of regulations on conflicts of interest that could arise between the administering entity and the fund itself. Added to this are the regulations that govern the voting by pension fund administrators in corporations in which they hold shares. They stipulate that the administrators must vote for directors who are independent of the groups controlling the corporation. Securities Market The finance minister stated that one of the most important objectives of Capital Market Law 18.045 is to buttress the private-sector's rating of risk. "Knowledge alone of the regulations on the rating of risk, contained in the law on securities, has generated a rapid consolidation and internationalization of the industry of risk rating," he said, adding that for the development of a debt-securities-intensive market, the development of a solid, independent, highly respected risk-rating industry is essential. He emphasized that the establishing of new norms and mechanisms regulating the use of insider information, including criminal sanctions and the addressing of conflicts of interest, especially in the case of administrators of the funds of third parties, will enhance the openness of the securities market.
