Specialists from the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant reported that the work was satisfactorily carried out, which consisted of mainly a complete overhaul to the boiler, auxiliary equipment, and the pump. The most complex work carried out at the plant involved cleaning the sea water intake canal for treatment of the Czech units. Once maintenance work has ended at the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant in Cienfuegos Province, all efforts will be entirely dedicated to repairs at Unit No.1 -- currently underway -- for its subsequent synchronization with the system by year end.
