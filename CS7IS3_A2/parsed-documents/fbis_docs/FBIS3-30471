Articles 102 and 103, which were left over from the former Czechoslovak Federal Criminal Code, prescribe punishment for defamation of the state or its symbols or top representatives. Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, who informed journalists of the decision, said the government had based its decision on the views of the human rights organisation Amnesty International and Slovakia's committee on monitoring the 1975 Helsinki human rights agreement. Article 102 is the basis for the current prosecution of Ivan Lexa, head of the Government Office and state secretary of the Privatisation Ministry, as well as a strong supporter of Premier Vladimir Meciar. Lexa made allegedly defamatory remarks about President Michal Kovac after Kovac refused to name him minister of privatisation. In the Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel has called upon the government and the Constitutional Court to abolish or amend the two articles.
