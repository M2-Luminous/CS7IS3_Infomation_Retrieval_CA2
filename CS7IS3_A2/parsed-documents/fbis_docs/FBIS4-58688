Aden, Sanaa, and all of Yemen have been dragged onto a path different from that chosen by the Yemeni people on 20 February. We hope that we will find our way back to the right path. [Manjunah] Brother 'Ali, does this mean that you believe that you have arrived at a point of no return, or is there still room for a political solution? [Al-Bid] By God, my brother, Yemen has chosen its path and will adhere to it. All the Yemenis will stand by the Pledge and Accord document, by dialogue, and by peaceful solutions. We will stand up against the gangs, the warmongers, and those who lead the Yemenis on a ruinous path. May God grant us success. [Manjunah] The state of emergency declared recently by Sanaa -- does it apply also to southern areas, or is it confined to northern areas? [Al-Bid] We have not learned anything about this in the southern provinces. The state of emergency was declared by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April. Currently, he is following a path of partition. He is doing what he pleases and forgets or ignores the interests of Yemen and the Yemenis. [Manjunah] How true is the news that Aden's airport and other strategic areas have been seized by northern troops? [Al-Bid] [Words indistinct] Everything that happened today is sad for all Yemenis, all Arabs, and all people. We have been forced, like someone who is wrecking his own house, unfortunately... [Manjunah; interrupting] Now that the military situation has reached this stage, how do you see the situation in Yemen in general? [Al-Bid] We should listen to reason, resort to dialogue, abide by the interests of the Yemeni people and homeland, honor the Pledge and Accord document, whose legitimacy is derived from national consensus, and rid ourselves of diseases, arrogance, and the military mentality. I say to the al-Ahmar clan: Yemen is bigger than any clan and any individual. Yemen will remain long after we are all gone. [Manjunah] Brother al-Bid, thank you very much. [Al-Bid] Thanks.
