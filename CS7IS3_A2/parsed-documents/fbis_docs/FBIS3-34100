These people congregated on Khayyam Avenue in Zahedan to agitate and disrupt things when the avenue's vendors and residents tackled them violently. The agitators got into a brawl with the people but were overpowered by the Law Enforcement forces and dispersed. Pir Mohammad Abubakr, who threw stones at the disruptive elements, told an IRNA correspondent: The elements affiliated with foreigners are seeking to instigate differences to detract from the people's dazzling presence on the revolution scene and to project the Ten Days of Dawn celebrations as lackluster. He said: Whatever the plot the powers of world arrogance hatch against the Islamic revolution, the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran become more determined to safeguard the revolution's values. Amanollah Ama'i, 42, said that the tearing up of flags, breaking of colored lights, and attacks on stores were only a sign of the arsonists' inauspicious intentions to disrupt the grand celebrations of the Ten Days of Dawn. He said: We ask the Law Enforcement officials to combat such insurgents with force. Despite the rioters' efforts to disrupt the Day of God [Yawm-Allah] celebrations on 1 February, the people continued to participate in the ceremonies at the 17 Shahrivar Stadium in Zahedan after the agitators were dealt with and the fracas ended.
