The approval of the 73.1 trillion yen state budget at the House of Councillors committee followed passage at the House of Representatives on June 8, 70 days overdue and three months after its was tabled in the Diet. Diet debate on the budget, which was submitted to parliament on March 4, became snarled in a political squabble over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's personal financial affairs. Hosokawa stepped down in April because of the turmoil. The nation's full spending budget includes 5.5 trillion yen for cuts in income and residential taxes to stimulate the economy. Despite tight fiscal conditions, expenditures for public works projects were increased by 29.8 percent from the previous year to 11.1 trillion yen. Public works spending accounts for 15.2 percent of the 40.9 trillion yen general operating expenditures, the core part of the budget that includes most outlays other than debt-servicing costs and tax allocations to local governments. Defense spending, in contrast, was raised by a scant 0.9 percent to 4.7 trillion yen.
