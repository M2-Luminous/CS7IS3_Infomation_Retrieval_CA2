However, the sources denied reports published by the U.S. NEWS AND WORLD REPORT magazine that "thousands" of scientists and technicians from the former Soviet Union work under contracts in China and help design and produce modern weapons. "I do not rule out that there may be contracts under which our technical specialists go to China. But I doubt it very much that there are so many of them. All the more so because so sensitive spheres of cooperation are involved. I think that if such cases exist, there are only a few of them," a Russian Foreign Ministry top official said. "`Thousands' is an absurd figure. Until lately we did not have facts that someone worked in the sphere of arms production," an official with the Russian foreign intelligence service said. However, other sources said that China has certain interest in Russian specialists, particularly in the sphere of aircraft building. Those who go to China are either of no interest for western countries, or know too much to be allowed to go to the west. In China they earn about 1,000 U.S. dollars a month on the average. This is much less than they could make in the west, but much more than they earned in Russia, the sources said.
