But [RPR -- Rally for the Republic President] Jacques Chirac is saying that the single list is not in question. It must be said that the RPR did resign itself easily to abandoning the leadership of the majority list in the European elections to a UDF member. Jacques Chirac had to exert pressure on his "comrades" for them to agree. He only did so because it was anticipated that the list would be headed by Jean-Francois Deniau. Giscard's former minister is not extremely pro-European. It has not been forgotten that during the campaign for the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, Deniau hesitated for a long time before finally coming out in favor of the "yes" vote. He could therefore be regarded as an acceptable list leader. The need not to spark off a division in the parliamentary Right one year before the presidential election justified this sacrifice. With the obviously unexpected selection of Baudis, everything could be called into question again. The mayor of Toulouse does not have the Gaullists' support to say the least. For the majority of them, who opposed the Maastricht Treaty, the selection of Baudis, whose commitment to Europe is extremely determined, looks like a provocation. For the time being, Chirac is adhering to the status quo. He has not commented in person. But he has delegated some of his close aides in making it known that he does not think that his partners' choice called into question the principle of the single list. The whole question is whether he will succeed in imposing this viewpoint. While it was thought that the UDF would choose Jean-Francois Deniau, Bernard Pons and Philippe Seguin had reaffirmed that the liberal federation's decision should be ratified by the RPR. What has happened will not encourage them to remain silent. Jacques Chirac cannot ignore that. But what solution can be found? Aware that the discontent is no less within the Republican Party, some are proposing alternative solutions which could be accepted by a section of the UDF. Jean-Jacques de Peretti is reviving the idea of selecting Alain Juppe. Pierre Mazeaud is suggesting that the RPR appoint its own head of list and that the two parties then meet to make a choice. Others are already envisaging the possibility of an autonomous RPR list which Philippe Seguin could head. Whatever happens, the parliamentary group in the National Assembly met yesterday evening. The movement's political office will meet today. The discussions are likely to be lively.
