During this critical period marked by the collapse of the economy and financial system, the impoverishment of the working people, the wild outburst of organized crime, and the manifestations of separatism that threaten the very existence of our state and realizing the whole burden of responsibility for the fate of Ukraine, we Communists called upon all factions of the Supreme Council to constructively cooperate in order to extricate the state from the impasse. As the most numerous deputies group in the parliament, we have a moral right to claim the highest posts in the parliament. However, in order to avoid bitter confrontations in the struggle for the seats and to proceed, as soon as possible, to resolving painful economic jumbles, the Communists have not become preoccupied with their party ambitions. They acted in an optimal manner, something that is attested to by the quite concerted election of the Supreme Council chairman. Quite naturally, we also expected mutual understanding from our opponents. However, as early as on 19 May, when the question of electing first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council was discussed, the right-wing forces declared that their representative alone had to become first deputy chairman. Even without starting a normal parliamentary discussion, they disrupted the work of the session. Having applied known methods of the old parliament, they simply failed to register, having thereby disrupted the normal work. They are those same people who sowed dissent in the preceding Supreme Council. Voters must know the names of those deputies for whom power, and not the state, is all that matters. Particularly alarming is the fact that some representatives of the "power party" and power structures have united with national extremists. Using their official position, they resort to putting pressure upon the left-wing forces. Almost all mass media have taken their side and are assailing the left-wing forces in an organized manner. They employ well-tested methods of juggling with facts, which is also attested to by today's statements by the groups "Statehood" [Derzhavnist] and "Center" [Tsentr]. The most dangerous thing is the fact that this assault by the right-wing forces is taking place in the context of Crimean events, which have recently become particularly exacerbated. In this connection, the communist faction calls upon its supporters in the Crimea to do everything possible in order that peace and harmony would prevail on the peninsula for the benefit of all of Ukraine's peoples. We state unequivocally that those forces that are presently disrupting the work of the parliament are supporting the cause of separatism. Standing up, firmly and consistently, for the interests of the voters, we will do everything we can in order to achieve peace and harmony in our society. However, the public must also know about those who oppose this. That is why we reserve the right to efficiently inform the voters about the events in the parliament.
