FR940826-0-00064 FR940826-0-00016 II. Auction Design A. Bidding Procedures 5. In the Third Report and Order, the Commission noted its earlier findings: (1) That licenses with strong value interdependencies should be auctioned simultaneously, (2) that multiple round auctions will generally yield more efficient allocations of licenses and higher revenues than other auction methodologies because they provide bidders with information regarding other bidders' valuations of licenses, and (3) that simultaneous multiple round auctions become less cost effective as the value of licenses decreases, because they are relatively time-consuming and expensive to implement. 4 The Commission stated that where the licenses to be auctioned are interdependent and their value is expected to be high, simultaneous multiple round auctions would best achieve the Commission's goals. 5 We stated, however, that we might use methods other than simultaneous multiple round bidding in cases where license values are expected to be relatively low, where bidder participation is expected to be limited, or where the interdependence of licenses is less significant. 6 We stated that in selecting the auction method for each narrowband PCS auction, we would balance the advantages of more sophisticated auction methods, such as simultaneous multiple round bidding, with the greater complexity and cost they might entail. 7 4 Third Report and Order at ¶12. 5 Id. at ¶13. 6 Id. at ¶20. 7 Id. 6. In the Third Report and Order the Commission decided to auction the 12.5 kHz unpaired MTA and BTA response channel licenses in a single round sealed bid auction because the value of those licenses is low relative to the cost of conducting more complex auctions. We also stated that because only incumbent paging licensees already serving the license area are eligible to bid on these licenses, sealed bid auctions might help to reduce the likelihood of collusion. We further stated that information about license values from earlier narrowband auctions would also be available to assist bidders in valuing these licenses. Moreover, because under the sealed bid approach bidders cannot be certain that they will be the high bidder on the licenses they seek to obtain, we allowed bidders to bid without risking a default penalty on more than the two licenses in each service area, provided they specify in advance the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses if they are the high bidder on more than they are permitted to hold. 8 8 Id. at ¶29. 7. Petitions. Paging Network, Inc. (PageNet) and Tri-State Radio Co. (Tri-State) seek reconsideration of the decision to use single round sealed bid auction procedures for assignment of the 12.5 kHz unpaired licenses. 9 PageNet and Tri-State assert that the Commission has underestimated the likely value of the response channel licenses. 10 PageNet and Tri-State also assert that great value interdependence exists among the response channel licenses. 11 They state that there are likely to be numerous bidders for most licenses. 12 In this regard, PageNet claims that collusive behavior is no more likely for these licenses than for other narrowband PCS licenses. PageNet and Tri-State question whether bidders for response channel licenses will obtain useful information about license values from previous narrowband PCS auctions. PageNet asserts that license values will vary from one provider and area to another, and that bidders may have no realistic idea as to the value of the licenses. 13 PageNet claims that the single sealed bid mechanism will require exorbitantly expensive market research on the part of bidders, and the result will still depend on chance. 14 Further, PageNet states that it is important to choose an auction method which provides useful information on license values to bidders during the auction. Therefore, PageNet supports adopting an alternative auction method that is streamlined to minimize cost and complexity, and recommends an ascending bid multiple round methodology. 15 9 PageNet Petition at 2; Tri-State Petition at 3. 10 PageNet Petition at 2; Tri-State Petition at 7. 11 PageNet Petition at 5; Tri-State Petition at 3. 12 PageNet Petition at 10; Tri-State Petition at 8. 13 PageNet Petition at 5. 14 Opposition of PageNet at 3. 15 PageNet reserves comment on more specific procedures pending conclusion of the nationwide narrowband PCS and Interactive Video and Data Service (IVDS) auctions. Id. at 6. 8. Tri-State claims that the rules mandating single round sealed bidding are deficient from an auction design perspective. Tri-State asserts that these rules are poorly structured to allow bidders to obtain a common frequency across regions, and that under the rules bidders cannot know how to prioritize their bids. Tri-State further claims that the sealed bidding procedures require exceedingly complicated bidding strategies, which necessitate the adoption of a clear reallocation mechanism for defaulted licenses. Alternatively, Tri-State recommends a procedure in which bidders submit sealed bids for a given MTA or BTA without specifying which of the available frequencies the bidder is bidding on. Under Tri-State's recommended approach, winning bidders would be ranked for purposes of frequency selection according to the total amount they bid for all the channels on which they hold winning bids. Tri-State claims that this procedure maximizes the number of multiple MTA/BTA bidders who can obtain a common paging response channel in all markets in which they bid. 16 Tri-State argues that its proposed auction procedures will level the playing field between bidders for paging response channels and those for regional and nationwide narrowband PCS authorizations, who do not need to aggregate a common frequency across geographic areas. 17 Tri-State includes a 25 percent bidding credit for minority- and female-owned businesses and small businesses, and states that its plan could be refined by providing that winning bidders pay the highest losing bid for a license. 18 Tri-State asserts that its proposed auction procedures will ensure that the Commission maximizes revenues from paging response license auctions and allow bidders to set priorities more accurately and to adopt relatively simple bidding strategies. 19 AirTouch recommends multiple round simultaneous auctions, and suggests that bids for the response channels be in pool form, such that the highest four bidders would receive a license and could agree among themselves as to the licenses to be held by each. 20 American Paging, Inc. (API) supports multiple-round ascending simultaneous bidding methodologies, at least for the MTA response channel licensing. 21 16 Tri-State Petition at 12&hyph;16. 17 Id. at 17. 18 Id. at 18&hyph;20. 19 Id. at 21. 20 Opposition of AirTouch at 7&hyph;8. 21 Reply of API at 2. 9. Discussion. Petitioners have convinced us that paging response channel licenses may have more value interdependency, and higher value, than was apparent at the time of the Third Report and Order. We also recognize that alternative auction methodologies proposed by petitioners may offer a low-cost auction method with desirable characteristics for auctioning interdependent licenses, and thus may prove superior to the sealed bid approach set forth in the Third Report and Order. In addition, the recent nationwide narrowband auction demonstrated that simultaneous multiple round auctions are easier and less expensive to implement than we earlier anticipated, and thus they may prove to be an appropriate procedure for auctioning the response channel licenses. However, we will defer our decision regarding the auction design for the 12.5 kHz MTA and BTA paging response channels until we have gained further experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions. We will announce our final choice of auction design and procedures for the response channels by Public Notice prior to the auction.
