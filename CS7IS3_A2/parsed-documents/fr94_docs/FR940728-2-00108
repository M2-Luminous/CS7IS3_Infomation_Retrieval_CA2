The United States Army Corps of Engineers has determined that no waters of the United States including wetlands will be impacted by the proposed gas well and related features. 2. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that federally listed endangered or threatened species are unlikely to be adversely affected by the proposed gas well and related features. 3. The Texas Historical Commission and Department of Antiquities Protection have determined that no survey is required and the project may proceed. 4.
