The history of the emergence of the Russian cities in northern Kazakhstan shows that this territory cannot be called Slavic in its origins. At the same time, the advocates of Russia's historical possession of northern Kazakhstan have their own arguments. After falling under the influence of Moscow almost a century earlier than its southern oblasts, this region was actively settled by Russian colonists, primarily Cossacks. But the Kazakh clans bordering with Siberia and the Ural rayons, experiencing a continuous threat on the part of the Dzungarian Khanate, saw joining Russia as more of an advantageous diplomatic step than "a natural desire..." The dissatisfaction with the situation, developing among Slavs of northern Kazakhstan, however, is also easily explained. Many of them have been living on this land for more than one generation, and they see it as a small part of Russia. Finding themselves abroad in no time at all, it is difficult for them to grasp the argument that several centuries ago the only masters here were nomadic clans--the ancestors of the present-day Kazakhs. But, it is necessary to understand the latter as well: As a result of various kinds of migratory movements and numerous "resettlements," the number of aborigines (indigenous people) does not exceed 40 percent. But now, after the collapse of the USSR, the Kazakhs, perhaps for the first time, have felt themselves to be the masters of this very large former Soviet republic that is second in size after Russia, and they are striving to change the ethnic proportions that are unfavorable for themselves. However, as before, the rates of the natural growth of the native population remain very low, and the "invitations" to countrymen from Mongolia, Iran, and even China to return to the aboriginal homeland is also not changing the situation. Therefore, one hears the popular slogan on the streets of Kazakh cities more and more frequently: "If we cannot be increased, then you must be decreased." However, in the opinion of one of the Western correspondents in Almaty, "...the local Russians are subordinating themselves to the new 'Tatar yoke' with stunning readiness." This observation was made, it is true, in the autumn of 1993, and it characterized a "special period" in the development of Kazakhstan--a "sovereignty euphoria" and a hope for maximum "nationalization" as a panacea for all problems. `Boomerang' In a word, only yesterday considering themselves "vassals of Moscow," the Kazakhs in one way or another are trying today to "cure" their old national complexes. For, to be a Kazakh is not just to have slanting eyes and to speak in one of the Turkic languages. Belonging to the people also denotes "participation" in thousands of family ties--family and clan that, as before, play an essential role, enveloping all of society with invisible threads. The Kazakhs succeeded over many years in establishing a structure in which belonging to a specific social group right at the moment of birth apparently determined the course of future life. Dozens of concepts were "established" in the language and expressions about mutual relations in the family and the place of each in its hierarchy. But, inasmuch as a "taboo" against marriages with members of other nations is observed more and more of late, the fact becomes apparent of the creation--little by little and not hurriedly--of a new, big, and closed clan that is functioning on the level of an ethnic group. Not everyone today can even get into a university. And marks here do not have any real significance. It is important to be "wellborn." One of the main points on a job application questionnaire is something akin to the "fifth item." The employer, as a rule, does not read beyond this item of the submitted questionnaire--education or the possession of specific professional skills are secondary "details." ...Without blinking an eye, Tulenbek, a Kazakh lad with whom I became acquainted, replied to the question of why he was studying history, which he "does not like," that he was "not in a position to enroll" in the prestigious juridical department. But, he would soon certainly transfer there, for "the family promised to help." Knowledge of laws in significant measure was an opportunity for him, after defending his diploma and arranging a "cushy job," to return the money "invested in it" as quickly as possible. Including also not without the help...of bribes. And there is nothing surprising in this: "They take" everything. Which, however, goes without saying, and it not only does not evoke censure, but even the opposite--understanding and respect. "Passing through" all of the "vital chains," bribes create their own kind of second, unofficial monetary turnover. Exodus Society was divided distinctly into two groups--"ours" and "not ours," the antagonism between which was so strong that the elements of communal life were practically obliterated. And, although the "Concept of the Sociocultural Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan" was published on 1 December 1993, which not only noted "the unquestionable priority of Kazakh culture," but which also declared a ban on "oppressing citizens on the basis of language and the guarantee of a broad space of language goodwill"; nevertheless, both the Kazakhs and the Russians are now two closed ethnic groups. In addition, they are mutually accusing each other: The Kazakhs are accusing the Russians of enslavement and the destruction of their eastern culture, and of the forced inculcation of pseudo- Europeanization; the Russians are accusing the Kazakhs of wildness and an unrestrained character. In a word, until now living in peace and harmony, neighbors suddenly started "to quarrel with each other." And not only through the "fault" of history; propaganda also plays a large role. Although no one would probably even pay any particular attention to it, if everyone lived more or less tolerably. That is why in certain cases the demonstrative behavior of representatives of Russian communities is the result not only of "quiet" discrimination against them on the part of local authorities, but also of the sharp worsening in the standard of living. Especially after the unified "new ruble zone" departed this life in October 1993, and, starting on 15 November, the Kazakh national monetary unit--the tenge--was introduced. But, it is not only economic necessity that compels Russians to leave Kazakhstan (annually, about 100,000 leave just from Almaty alone), or, let us say, Germans (300,000 persons out of 700,000 officially living in Kazakhstan did this in 1993 alone). The reasons are far more important. For example, Konstantin Erlikh, chairman of the republican society "German Revival" (Deutsche Wiedergeburt), also explains the "great exit" with the "country's Kazakh fixation," which does not promise national minorities a political future. With the adoption of the constitution of 28 January 1992, Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Everyone who would like to remain in the civil service must now speak Kazakh, but there are very few such people among the local Russians and Germans. And, as a consequence: In a short time, the number of representatives of ethnic minorities was reduced noticeably in the management structures and staff of the ministries. For, according to the words of a former civil servant from Pavlodar, Petr Kranzbueller, a German by nationality, not having influential people "of your own kind" at the top, it is unbelievably difficult to fight with all-powerful officials in a corrupt swamp (we recall Tulenbek) in which God forbid that you should utter a "foreign" word. Moreover, up until the end of 1995, every "non-Kazakh" will have to declare whether he wants to become a Kazakh citizen or not. The one who makes a positive decision to acquire a Kazakh passport should take into account that it will then be far more difficult to leave the country. The one who makes a negative decision will become a person without citizenship in Kazakhstan. Germany, it is true, annually authorizes entry for a maximum of 230,000 persons of German origin from the former USSR (including from Kazakhstan). But, simultaneously, Bonn is trying in some way to hold back the continuously mounting wave of immigration, in particular, by also rendering economic assistance to Kazakhstan. Most of all for the development of an infrastructure of rayons that are densely populated by Germans. Since 1990, about 80 million German Marks have already gone there. Hope At the same time, national minorities continue to rely on President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who in one of his interviews told the press on 4 January 1994 that the departure of every person is an economic loss for the republic, assuring that "...we do not want to divide our people into ours and theirs. Kazakhstan is our common motherland, and it will see to it that no one is harmed." Such statements are understandable: The republic will hardly be able to do without the Russians and the Germans. Thus, according to data from American sources, the outflow of just the Russians from Kazakhstan will denote an annual loss on the order of $24 billion during the next seven-eight years, which inevitably will lead to the actual bankruptcy of the republic. The departure of "only" 45,000 Russians in 1992 was a serious loss for it. Especially if the fact is taken into account that a large part of the Russians belong to the intelligentsia. But, to develop a new professionally trained generation of specialists from the native inhabitants cannot be accomplished in a day. Almaty also needs the Germans--industrious craftsmen, disciplined workers, and hard-working peasants. However, the matter has not gone any further than official declarations until now. The assistance being allocated "is disappearing" somewhere in the depths of the local bureaucratic apparatus. In December of last year, Kristian Keller, a professor at Berlin's Humboldt University, told me that the Goethe Institute has not been opened in Almaty to this day, although the money for it was allocated a long time ago by the German side. ...The election on 7 March of this year of a new Kazakh parliament, to all appearances, will also not introduce any clarity to the question of national minorities. Since most likely all of it will be loyal to the president (in the course of the election campaign, 20 percent of its staff was actually proposed according to "his" list, which roused the censure, in particular, of the observers of the CSCE parliamentary assembly) then, obviously, it will not be able to adopt the law on dual citizenship for the Russians, because Nazarbayev himself is against this idea. His words: More than 120 nationalities live in the republic, and the priority of just the Russian minority alone means an "infringement of the rights of the others." As for the elections themselves, their standard, in the opinion of the president, corresponded to the "standard of Kazakh democracy, which has still not reached the European standard. And, therefore, we have to be satisfied with what there is..." Economic Activity Apparently, the Kazakh economy is also guided by the very same "principle." For it stood on losing positions already at the time that Stalin created a Union "raw materials appendage" out of the republic. All of the minerals mined from the rich deposits here went to Russia and to the other republics. However, this had no significance in the united, "great state." It is another matter now. It has been calculated that 94 percent of the commodities being produced in Kazakhstan are connected with "Russian middlemen" up to the present time. But this "foreign" state is already demanding hard currency for its services, and not the ephemeral tenge, but it is exactly the former that there is none of in Almaty. However, it also does not have its own exits to the sea. And, this means that expensive ground transport makes the export of Kazakhstan raw material practically unprofitable. In a word, it quickly became clear that one of the main symbols of Kazakh independence--the tenge--is only a beautiful piece of paper. But "capitalism" is developing in its most wild form, in essence being a more modern form of yesterday's speculation. Now proudly calling themselves businessmen, speculators are driving in splendid cars that are in such contrast to their "possessions"--shabby kiosks and booths filled with Western "delicacies" (mainly alcohol and sweets) with obviously fake firm trademarks. `Snickerization' And this, however paradoxical it may seem, is yet another one of the characteristic features of today's Kazakh market. In Almaty, for example, it is the practice to "translate" wages into "candy bars" that are very popular here: The professor of a higher educational institution, in particular, "earns" the equivalent of 25, and a chambermaid, the equivalent of 11 "chocolate sticks..." And, nevertheless, every newcomer here is surprised by the practically ubiquitous opinion that "all the same, everything will be better," and that "these are only the difficulties of the transition period." Although there also are the pessimists who maintain that the tenge--the basis of the stability of the state-- will already fall this year. That all of Nazarbayev's attempts to "create" a Eurasian community are doomed to failure. And that, in the final analysis, the Kazakhs on their knees will ask Moscow (an example of which is seen in Belarus and Tajikistan) for a "new reunification with it." The optimists, of course, give a longer period. Meanwhile, the deep stratification of society, galloping inflation, scarcity in the market, and, finally, the ethnic tension, however, give one and the other more reason to think that the question raised recently in the headline of the popular Almaty weekly KARAVAN--"Will We Last Until Monday?"--is becoming less and less rhetorical. Although, perhaps, the Kazakh Gordian knot problem can be solved by the legendary Sudzhinbay, who is depicted on the 3-tenge bill, and, in the opinion of informed experts, is a direct ancestor of today's Kazakh leader. Who knows?
