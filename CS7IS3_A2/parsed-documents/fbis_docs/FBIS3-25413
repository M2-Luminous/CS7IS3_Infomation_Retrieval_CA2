However, this euphoria should be "tempered by an awareness of the platform on which the Minister stands. His public pronouncements have one eye on the upcoming election and another on the need to reassure foreign investors that the ANC's [African National Congress] Leninist leanings are designed solely to drum up voter support, and that the danger to stability posed by the Freedom Alliance is no more than a temporary phenomenon. That such reassurances are needed underlines the potential hazards facing the embryonic economic recovery." At the same time, Keys's "stress on a positive outlook highlights the economy's considerable incipient strength, the potential of which (if realised) would serve as a major boost to the standard of living of all South Africans." BUSINESS DAY Revised ANC Position on Constitution `Attractive' -- "The revised ANC position on regional powers, self-determination and a volkstaat [homeland] may be attractive both to Buthelezi and to the more rational elements of the white right," declares a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 17 February. "It will certainly help show whether they are still serious negotiators." "What is needed now is not just hard bargaining, but the determination to reach agreement." BUSINESS DAY says "constitutional and electoral changes seem certain through renewed negotiations and a brief parliamentary session." SOWETAN Township Facilities `Falling Apart' -- "When the Greater Soweto rent boycott ended officially earlier this month residents thought the condition of their townships would improve," notes Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 17 February in a page-8 editorial. But this seems like "a forlorn hope" as the trash heaps grow larger and the roads "are all but impossible to navigate." "While it is not clear who is in charge these days the facilities generally are falling apart." "Until residents are convinced their facilities have been improved they will not pay." BEELD Difficult Choices on IFP-AVF Actions -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 14 February points out in a page-8 editorial: "At this point it seems fairly certain that the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] will not participate in the April election. The question is, what are the government and the other participating parties going to do about this? The harsh reality is that there can be no quesiton of postponing or cancelling the election; that would cause immeasurably greater problems than those caused by the IFP-AVF boycott." "The problem with the boycott is not that these parties' supporters will remain outside the election. Ten to one they will go and vote. The problem is the ability of these two parties to cause disruption and bloodshed. And how the authorities should react to it. The government/Transitional Executive Council are faced with difficult choices. Should the IFP-AVF and the other borderline groups opt for disruption, the state does possess the muscle to ward off their efforts and defend the process. But it could be a bloody business, which may upset the country's brittle psyche. Naturally ruthless action by the state to protect the political process would have to be the last option. It is, however, a decision which must not be reached hesitantly. Exceptional determination will be demanded of political role players and others involved. They will have to do what must be done, knowing full well that if the present problem is not neutralized effectively, far greater disaster and misery could be waiting around the corner."
