The Defense Agency and the Self-Defense Forces, having failed last year to promptly confirm North Korea's test-firing of a Nodong 1 ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan, recently succeeded in rapidly detecting Pyongyang's firing of another ballistic missile. One intelligence official, however, said Japan's capabilities remain quite limited when compared with satellite reconnaissance capabilities of the United States. The main actors in the ongoing operation are some 10 electronic data-monitoring posts spread throughout the country, from Japan's large, northernmost island of Hokkaido to the southernmost island of Kyushu. The facilities have already proved themselves, such as when in 1983 they successfully intercepted communications between Soviet fighter planes that downed a Korean Air jetliner over Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. Today's operations also make use of modified YS-11 and C-1 transport aircraft and EP-3 electronic warfare data-collection planes, which fly daily runs over the Sea of Japan. Maritime Self-Defense Force ships are also on alert status, officials said.
