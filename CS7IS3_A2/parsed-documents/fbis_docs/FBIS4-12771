On the second day of his official visit to Syria, Mentese had a two-hour meeting with 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, first assistant to the Syrian head of state. In a statement afterward, Mentese said that during their meeting with ranking Syrian officials since yesterday, the Turkish delegation stressed that Ocalan was living either in Syria or Lebanon. `For us, the PKK is the most important problem,' he said. 'We insist on the fact that PKK leaders are based in Syria and Lebanon. They claimed that Lebanon was a separate state. Since we are aware of Syria's influence in Lebanon, we asked them to intervene into the situation. All these talks proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.' `They also told us that they condemned the terror actions of PKK and it was out of the question for them to cooperate with these terrorists,' Mentese said.
