The afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA reported today that the strike was called for by the Rapa Nui Elders Council and conveyed in a letter addressed to island Governor Jacobo Hey. The peaceful strike will continue until a direct dialogue is held with the Chilean Government to solve a number of conflicts affecting the island community, according to a note released by the strikers. Easter Island, in a tropical climate, lives on tourism generated by the presence of 867 statues that represent gigantic figures of up to 20 meters high called "moais," placed in ceremonial temples called "ahu," which make this territory look like an open-air archaeological museum.
