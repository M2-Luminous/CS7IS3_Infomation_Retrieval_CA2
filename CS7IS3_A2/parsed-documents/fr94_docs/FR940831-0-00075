ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is amending its Noxious Liquid Substances (NLSs) regulations to include substances recently authorized for carriage by the Coast Guard or added to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Chemical Codes and is making minor technical and editorial changes and corrections. This action updates the current lists of oil-like and non-oil-like NLSs allowed for carriage. EFFECTIVE DATES: September 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Curtis G. Payne, Hazardous Materials Branch, (202) 267&hyph;1577. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Curtis G. Payne, Project Manager, and Ms. Helen G. Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Related Rulemakings On April 11, 1994, the Coast Guard published a final rule (FR) entitled Noxious Liquid Substances Lists in the Federal Register (59 FR 16985). That rulemaking added new entries, or removed existing entries, based upon the entry's Pollution Category. In that same edition of the Federal Register , the Coast Guard published another FR entitled Bulk Hazardous Materials (59 FR 16999), updating its chemical tables to reflect the IMO's final and provisional determinations regarding entries currently in the IMO Chemical Code. Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register , the Coast Guard is publishing a final rule concerning bulk hazardous materials tables in 46 CFR parts 30, 150, 151, and 153 (CGD 94&hyph;900). Also in this edition of the Federal Register , a notice and request for comments is published concerning cargo entries which the Coast Guard has reason to believe are obsolete (CGD 94&hyph;902). Background and Purpose The Coast Guard is revising its lists of Category D NLSs and Category C oil-like NLSs by including in these lists entries that have been ``upgraded'' by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). An ``upgrade'' means that a commodity is assigned additional carriage requirements, a higher Pollution Category (Pol. Cat.), or both. These additional requirements bring the carriage requirements for these commodities appearing in table 30.25&hyph;1 of 46 CFR part 30 and tables 1 and 2 of 46 CFR part 153 in line with the requirements in Chemical Codes of the IMO. The upgrades assigned by this final rule were determined by the IMO and are included in the IMO Chemical Codes (``International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC Code), and ``Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (BCH Code)). Adoption of these upgrades in the Coast Guard regulations is necessary to ensure consistency with international law. These upgrades were listed, for informational purposes, in an appendix to the Bulk Hazardous Materials NPRM published on May 24, 1993 (58 FR 29937). At that time, the upgrades had been determined by IMO, but were not scheduled to become effective until July 1, 1994. Other chemical names are modified in accordance with IMO terminology. This rulemaking is largely administrative in nature and is intended to update Coast Guard chemical lists in 33 CFR part 151. Discussion of Amendments The objectives of this rulemaking are to: (a) Modify names for certain chemicals as part of the Coast Guard's continuing program of adopting IMO terminology where applicable, and aligning usage throughout Coast Guard regulations. These modifications are listed below:
