This will help us to have a correct stand in the current politico- ideological struggle. For this reason, our party has encouraged systematic studies on achievements and failure of the international communist and worker's movement, especially the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Through these studies we will clearly understand the real concepts of Marxism-Leninism to be able to renovate our thought to bring the doctrine into full play, thus catching up with developments of the era. At the same time, we will be able to uphold the Ho Chi Minh thought and promote socialism to formulate measures and orientations for our revolution in the current stage. Our party's basic lines and policies are to renovate thought and concept while striving to oppose opportunism and revision and overcoming conservatism and dogmatism. It is necessary to say that we are facing numerous difficulties in the politico-ideological struggle. As a result, we must strive to maintain and develop all favorable conditions to win in the struggle. The most fundamental favorable feature of our just cause rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. Although efforts are being made to study and overcome weaknesses in socialist concepts, achievements of the renovation process have testified to our correct application of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought, especially in the current complicated changes at home and abroad. Today, in commemorating great Lenin's birthday anniversary, we recall a foreign scholar's expression: Amid crises, there existed persons of genius who created historical events, such as Lenin and Ho Chi Minh. Indeed, they have written an unforgettable history despite changes and developments.
