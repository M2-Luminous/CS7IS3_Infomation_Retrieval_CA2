He was commenting on the statement by the opposition leader, in which he had criticized the dissolution of local bodies. He said during the 1988 and 1990 elections, the funds for local bodies were used to run the election campaigns of the Muslim League and its allied parties. On both the occasions, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz group used local bodies' funds for personal purposes, which forced the caretaker government to dissolve the local councils before the 1990 elections in order to ensure free and fair elections were conducted.
