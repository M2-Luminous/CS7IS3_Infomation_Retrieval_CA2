Under the contract, Malaysia will receive 16 MiG-29 combat aircraft and two MiG-29UB training planes, as well as auxiliary equipment and munitions worth 550.5 million dollars. There is also a provision for the training for Malaysian servicemen, for which purpose Russian specialists will be seconded to Malaysia. Malaysia is expected to pay 65 per cent of the contract value prior to the delivery. MiG-29 jets will be souped up and will have an in-flight refuelling feature. They will carry extended-range air-to-air missiles with infra-red and active homing devices. The missiles can detect up to 10 aerial targets and lock on two targets at a time. The aircraft's bomb load will be increased from 2 to 3 tonnes. The angle of attack will be increased from 26 to 28 degrees. The operating range of the aircraft will grow from 2,100 to 2,900 kilometres thanks to additional fuel tanks. The parties also signed a contract under which subsidiaries of Russian aircraft-making factories will be built in Malaysia. It is also intended to set up a joint Russian-Malaysian maintenance centre to service MiG-29 supplied to that country. With that in view, the Russian Federation will lease to Malaysia two aircraft (MiG-29 and MiG-29UB) free of charge for ten years. During the visit, an agreement on counter purchase of palm oil was signed. Under the agreement, 25 per cent of the price of the aircraft will be covered by exports of Malaysian palm oil to Russia. Initially, the Malaysian side insisted that palm oil should account for 400,000 dollars of the contract value, but the Russian representatives managed to lower the figure to 95.4 million dollars. Importantly, Russia will have the right to re-export that oil to other Commonwealth states, Eastern European countries, Cuba, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
