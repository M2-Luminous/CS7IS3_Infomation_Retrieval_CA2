Those running on the ADP list included Petr Lucinschi, the speaker of the present parliament, and Andrey Sangeli, the prime minister. In all, 73 percent of Moldovans took part in the elections. Parties of leftwing orientation, running in the Socialist Party-Movement For Equal Rights and Unity bloc, scored an unexpected success, gaining 23 percent of the vote. The Popular Christian Democratic Front and the bloc of peasants and intellectuals, whose main aim is unification with Romania, gained approximately 14 percent of the votes. In fourth place, according to as yet preliminary figures, was the Social Democratic Party, which received 13 percent of the votes. Political specialists in Moldova believe that a constructive majority will be formed in the new parliament which will favor the further strengthening of Moldovan statehood - in particular, the implementation of a balanced foreign policy - and closer economic integration with all republics of the Commonwealth.
