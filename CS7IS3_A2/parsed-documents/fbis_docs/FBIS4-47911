No plausible and conclusive progress was made at this afternoon's meeting. The two negotiating teams will return tomorrow to the Mulungushi International Conference Center for direct talks to try to resolve the differences. Consensus is expected to be reached tomorrow. This evening the two delegations will try to improve on their ideas. Should this happen, the talks will only need to deal with national reconciliation issues. An official source has told us that Blondin Beye leaves Lusaka for South Africa tomorrow to attend president-elect Nelson Mandela's inauguration.
