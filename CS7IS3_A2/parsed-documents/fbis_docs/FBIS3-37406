In addition to 15 members of the Security Council, the floor was also taken by representatives of 57 other countries. As on the previous day, the deliberations focused on the NATO Council's decision to deal air strikes in Bosnia. Algerian delegate Ramtane Lamanra urged the United Nations "to pursue a tough policy" in Bosnia, while Jordanian representative Fu'ad Batayinah reiterated the Western thesis that the "NATO decision to deal air strikes is in full accordance with resolutions of the Security Council". Contrary to this, Ukrainian delegate Volodymyr Handohiy said that NATO air strikes in Bosnia were fraught with unpredictable military and political consequences for all the world, that such decisions should be adopted by the U.N. Security Council and not by individual states. "Ukraine is deeply disturbed by the fact that U.N. forces could become targets of reply blows from radical Serbian field commanders if air strikes are launched even on a limited scale," Handohiy stressed. "Taking this into account, the United Nations may find itself deeply involved in a military confrontation with unpredictable military and political consequences not only for the region, but for the world as a whole," he added. The Ukrainian representatative stressed that he did not rule out the use of all the available means, including armed forces, in reply to hostile actions in areas where U.N. forces are deployed, and also when there is no other way to stop the killing of innocent people. "However, such actions should be taken only when there is a clearly expressed decision of the Security Council," Handohiy stated. "NATO air strikes in Bosnia will not help achieve a lasting political settlement of the Bosnian problem. They will merely cross out everything that has already been achieved during the peace talks," permanent delegate of the United Republic of Yugoslavia on the United Nations Dragomir Dzekic stated. "The United Republic of Yugoslavia bluntly objects to this decision," he stressed. "It will make the prospects for overcoming the crisis even more uncertain. Any attempt to deal air strikes will signify direct involvement in a civil war in behalf of one of the sides involved in it. Those who advocate this, will bear responsibility for the inevitable consequences and for the possible escalation of the conflict." After the open debate, Chairman of the Security Council Roble Olhaye (Djibouti) told journalists that no decision would be passed on the results of the discussion. "We simply gave everybody a chance to express their view on the problem," Olhaye noted.
