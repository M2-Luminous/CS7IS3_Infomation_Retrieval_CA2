Where will they receive their training? "Australia," said one source at the ABRI headquarters. "Australia is not only closer, but it also offers more areas of studies," added the source. The efforts to shift the officers' education to the continent of kangaroos are made in anticipation of the U.S. Congress' move. Last month, the U.S. Congress endorsed a clause in its Foreign Assistance bill stipulating that ABRI officers will not be allowed to attend U.S. military academies. This means that if the bill becomes law, ABRI officers will no longer be allowed to study in the country with the most powerful armed forces in the world. The ABRI has sent its officers to the United States since the 1950's. The trouble started with the outbreak of the 12 November 1991 Dili incident. Following the incident, the U.S. Government decided to stop the International Military Education and Training [five preceding words in English] program for Indonesia. Before that, the U.S. Government spent 4.5 billion rupiah annually to pay the scholarships for ABRI officers studying there. [passage omitted] Navy Commodore Yuswaji, chief of the Defense and Security Department's Public Relations and Foreign Relations Bureau, said that there are alternative countries to send ABRI officers for training. "If we cannot study in the United States, there are other countries like Australia and Britain," he said. Is military training in the United States better? A high-ranking officer said military training in Australia is adequate because overseas training is basically aimed at widening one's horizon and doing comparative studies. "The pure military science taught in the United States is hard to be applied here because they use sophisticated military equipment," said the officer, who has studied in the United States several times.
