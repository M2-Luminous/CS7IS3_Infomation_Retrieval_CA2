The Defense Ministry has rejected accusations that Defense Minister Ruehe was keeping quiet about the number of garrisons to be closed. A ministry spokesman explained yesterday that matters concerning deployment of Army units would be considered "at the appropriate time." But this can only happen after the completion of talks on the basis of guidelines set down by Ruehe concerning the future development of the Bundeswehr. SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] defense expert Erwin Horn told BILD AM SONNTAG that Ruehe was not going to evade the question of closures; nevertheless, probably as a result of pressure from the coalition, smaller Bundeswehr garrisons will be kept intact. Ruehe's concept is also based on the assumption that some barracks consist of mere "janitors in uniform" who maintain the facilities in poor condition. Appearing on Sender Freies Berlin, FDP [Free Democratic Party] general secretary Werner Hoyer warned against creating unnecessary fears with the debate on garrisons. He called for a statement as soon as possible about the number of garrisons to be closed. A working committee of the ruling parties will examine Ruehe's concept, a very controversial one among the coalition, on 17 May at the very earliest. Hoyer said he hoped "a tangible preliminary result" would be achieved before parliament's summer recess at the beginning of July. During the working committee's talks, the FDP general secretary also wants to discuss Ruehe's planned military service period of 10 months for the main defense forces and 12 months for the crisis reaction forces. He said he is ready to "broaden his mind." Recruits undergoing basic military service should belong to the crisis reaction forces only on a voluntary basis. Only after receiving "top-class training" should they be sent on front-line missions. Therefore it is quite sensible to encourage them to serve longer than the statutory 12 months in return for higher pay. During the weekend, Bundeswehr chief inspector Lieutenant-General Hartmut Bagger also made it clear that he had not criticized Ruehe's suggestion of cutting military service down to 10 months. It is not true, he said, that he considered 12-month military service "absolutely necessary." Meanwhile, FDP deputy Guenter Nolting insisted that the Bundeswehr should set up units that would react to critical situations involving German hostages abroad just as fast as the GSG-9 (border protection police) can react at home. The FDP chairman of the parliamentary defense committee and chairman of the FDP faction's working group for security policy told the MITTELRHEINISCHE MORGENPOST that the Bundeswehr's current reaction time of three days to events such as Rwanda is definitely too long. This would affect German hostages abroad, who are entitled to be liberated as quickly as possible.
