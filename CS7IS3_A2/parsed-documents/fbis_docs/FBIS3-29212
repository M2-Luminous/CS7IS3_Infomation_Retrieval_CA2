This decision still needs the approval of the House of Representatives before becoming effective. The BBC held that this is the policy of certain rightist and extremist U.S. circles who wish to use Radio Free Asia to propagate American thinking and lifestyle and carry out the peaceful evolution strategy. This decision of the U.S. Senate has resulted in strong protests in Asia and even in the United States. On 28 January, when interviewed by a ITAR-TASS correspondent on this issue, the spokesperson for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said: The news about the U.S. Senate decision to set up Radio Free Asia has not been welcomed in Asia. The Asian people are aware that the purpose of this move is to impose the political views of a foreign country on them and this amounts to interference into the internal affairs of Asian countries. Not only will this move harm the socioeconomic development of Asian countries, but it will also adversely affect the relations between the United States and these countries. This is an erroneous decision that runs counter to the current trend of development in the international situation. A Chinese Government spokesman stated that by deciding to set up Radio Free Asia, the U.S. Senate has trampled on the standards of international relations and interfered in the internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This decision must be overturned. The DPRK's KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY issued a statement condemning the U.S. Senate decision to set up Radio Free Asia. Myanmar [Burma] also expressed its indignation at this move by the U.S. Senate. Even the American people have protested this action. Many people believed that the establishment of Radio Free Asia in the Cold War format is no longer useful and suitable, especially when economic relations between the United States and Asia are on the rise. During the Cold War period, the United States used Radio Free Asia, Radio Freedom, and Jose Marti Radio and Telvision Stations as lethal ideological weapons against East European social countries, the (former) Soviet Union, and Cuba by disseminating distorted propaganda and inciting antagonistic feelings, thus grossly interfering in the internal affairs of these countries and causing tension in the relations between the United States and these countries. The people in these countries and in the rest of the world have protested strongly against this U.S. act of interference. Cuba was noted for its success in jamming the vicious U.S. radio broadcast signals. Since the Cold War, the situation in Asia and the rest of the world has experienced substantial changes. Asia has emerged as a region of relative peace, stability, cooperation, and dynamic development. It is the general desire of the people in the region to broaden their multilateral and diversified relations with the goals of protecting peace, security and socioeconomic development on the basis of mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, without interference into each other's affairs, and cooperation for equal benefit. Looking at the prospect of Asian development, many developed, industrialized countries, including the United States, are attaching importance to its relations with countries in the region. Therefore, the U.S. Senate decision to set up Radio Free Asia runs entirely against the trend toward peace, stability, and cooperation, violates international law, and therefore amounts to gross interference into the internal affairs of Asian countries.
