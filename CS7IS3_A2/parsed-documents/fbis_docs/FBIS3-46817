The official added that removing differences over minor issues was the only procedure remaining. The official said that the two sides differed on the title for inspection of the North, but that the two sides agreed late last year that "inspections will be carried out so that the IAEA's safeguards measure in North Korea and its continuity are ensured." Thus, he indicated that the only remaining point of dispute was the venue for discussions between the IAEA and North Korea on resumption of inspections. Observers believe that North Korea may agree on sites other than Pyongyang as the venue for discussion of resumption of inspections. Another government official said that "suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will also be announced when North Korea officially expresses its will to accept inspection." He added however, that the announcement of the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise will be made with the proviso that IAEA inspections should be carried out successfully and that the exchange of special envoys of the North and the South should be realized.
