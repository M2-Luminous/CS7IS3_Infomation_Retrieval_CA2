The project is being developed by the Center for the Development of Agricultural Machinery of the scientific hub in Holguin Province. The new machine includes a trailer or cart and its basic mechanism is similar to that of the KTP. The new harvester uses tracks [esteras] instead of tires and is much lighter than the conventional harvester to prevent damage to the cane stumps when the water content of the soil exceeds the normal limits. This project is one of the four tasks assigned to the scientific hub of Holguin in view of a need to equip the country with machinery capable of continuing the harvest during rainy seasons.
