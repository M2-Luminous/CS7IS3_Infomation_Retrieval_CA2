The tactile feedback you get lets you adjust your grip to the resilience of the object. A rock you can really grab, while a cotton ball you need to nab gingerly so it doesn't get crushed. A human's tactile system is sensitive enough to deal with most objects, but for something really small, say a millimeter in size, feedback is lacking and we have no control. This poses a problem for engineers designing tools for precision manipulation, like during microsurgery or during the handling of individual cells in a biotechnology lab. A group at Tokyo's Hosei University has developed a master-slave robot hand designed to overcome this problem. Its prototype consists of a V-shaped master control shaped like a grip strengthener, and a slave hand shaped like a set of pincers. When the user grips the control, the pincers close to grasp a small object. At the same time, a strain gauge built into the pincers conveys information back about the resilience of the object. Through a computer interface, the resilience of the V-shaped handle is changed so the user can ``sense'' that the object has been grasped and can adjust the amount of force applied. The prototype manipulator is 10cm long. In tests, users were able to grasp objects ranging in size from 15mm to 2mm, and they were also able to discriminate differences in softness between objects of the same size. The group aims to combine the robot hand with a manipulator table and a microscope in order to develop a tool which can be used to grasp microorganisms and other small objects.
