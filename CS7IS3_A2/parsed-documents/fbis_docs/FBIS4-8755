The letter reads: The news I have received from Gorazde says that the town is in agony. For 20 days Karadzic's Serbs and units of the Yugoslav army have been attacking the town -- besieged for 10 months -- with unabated intensity. The strange game, in which the obvious things are not seen, loud voices are not heard, and mechanisms have become impotent, has also been going on for 20 days. The so-called protected zone has become the most unsafe area in the world. The organization which you head proclaimed the free territory of Gorazde a UN-protected area almost a year ago. Security Council resolutions 824 and 836 refer to this protected zone, but they have remained only empty phrases. Neither you nor your personnel have done anything, or hardly anything, to use the mandate of all those resolutions in order to protect the people of Gorazde and the credibility of the United Nations. The result is obviously tragic. Mr. Secretary General, my people hold you responsible for this situation. This [words indistinct] is bleeding, and there is not much room for diplomatic hesitation. If Gorazde falls, I think that the feeling of moral responsibility would command you to leave the post of UN secretary general. This is the least you can do for this (?suffering) people whose two years of suffering the world has watched with so much indifference.
