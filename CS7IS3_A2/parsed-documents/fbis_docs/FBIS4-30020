Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan talked to a VOFA [Voice of Free Asia] correspondent about the ARF. [Begin recording] [Surin] July the 25th will be a historic day for the region, or even the world. Eighteen foreign ministers or their representatives will participate in a forum on security, stability, and mutual confidence in Southeast Asia. The forum is called the ASEAN Regional Forum, which will stress security cooperation and confidence building in order to jointly develop the region into an area which is peaceful and permeated with an atmosphere conducive to cooperation. This will lead to economic prosperity. The theme is: whoever has an interest in this region is invited. Whatever issues regarding the concerns, anxiety, or lack of confidence that anyone has can be aired at the meeting in order to create a frankness in the process to transform the region into the most peaceful and stable zone. The aforementioned is the philosophy set by the government from the beginning. It is the use of preventive diplomacy [two previous words rendered in English]. Regarding this philosophy, problems are prevented from worsening to disputes through dialogue and opportunities for dialogue available in the ASEAN arena in order to eliminate misunderstandings. The 25th of July will be a historic day for the region and new-style diplomacy in Asia and the Pacific. [Unidentified correspondent] What will be the issues discussed in the upcoming ARF? [Surin] The first currently hot issue is the situation in Northeast Asia -- the Korean Peninsula. The meeting will discuss how it can contribute to defusing the situation. Our belief is that a dispute anywhere in Asia and the Pacific will have repercussions upon the whole region. Therefore, we do not want to see an occurrence of disputes in Northeast Asia because it could create a lack of confidence and security in other regions, especially Southeast Asia. We want the ARF to be a forum for dialogue between countries, such as Korea, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia which may have a direct part in the stability and security in Northeast Asia. That is the first point. The second point concerns the problems in Southeast Asia that worry countries outside the region. These problems include investment and stability in Indochina, problems in Burma, cooperation between ASEAN and countries outside in security, arms buildup, and making the region nuclear free and politically and militarily neutral. These issues will be discussed in the ARF. The smaller issues such as human rights, arms buildup, and territorial disputes will probably be brought up as well but they will not be points dominating the discussions. The meeting will likely talk about cooperation to prevent future disputes, or the use of preventive diplomacy, to gain prompt involvement of the United Nations or its organizations in solving the problems instead of solving them as were the case in Cambodia, Somalia, and Bosnia.
