I had just completed secondary schooling and had, with some luck, done well and made my parents very happy. The German attack on Poland and the declaration of war by Britain and France on Germany fired my youthful patriotism. I volunteered to join the Royal Air Force. My application was accepted and I was in uniform and under intensive training soon after my 16th birthday. I served my country throughout World War II and until I came to Hong Kong in 1951. In a different sense and certainly in a different service, I continued to serve my country when I joined the Hong Kong Government in early 1954 and until 1975. During all of that time my love for my country was not simply based on blind patriotism nor on any sense of superiority over any other race or country, although I did think Scotland produced the best footballers. I certainly had the deepest feeling, based on study, observation, participation and example that the system by which Britain was governed was relatively fair and open and accountable to the people. I was taught and I never forgot that all men should be equal before the law and that the law must be fair to all men. I was well aware, however, that the system and the law did not always work fairly and that some people were more equal than others. Improvements were always necessary. But I also learned that within a democratic system of government, the rights of the people were established and sacrosanct. These were the rights that World War II enshrined forever and for which millions died and countless millions more suffered in varying degrees. These are the human rights which, since my years in the Royal Air Force, I have treasured and which I will with all means defend. At the heart of them lies the dignity and sanctity of the human spirit. How strange then that I should become a civil servant in a colonial government which denied at least one of the basic human rights to the citizens for which it was responsible -- the right to vote. By denying that right it also meant the right to participate in the government of their own affairs was never granted to Hong Kong citizens in my 22 years in the Hong Kong Government. Yet I was conscious of the many rights that were taken for granted by Hong Kong people -- rights that made them free men and women in a society that rewarded personal and family initiative. I have therefore been happy during the last 10 years that political rights were at last gradually added to the others, even if imperfectly and too hesitantly. I have always been very conscious of the looming might of China. Nothing that is done in Hong Kong by the Government or in the private sector can disregard the power of China over Hong Kong. No government policy during the last several decades and no doubt long before that could be complete without an assessment of the impact on China, or its likely reaction. Great care has always been taken by the Hong Kong Government to do nothing that will provoke a hostile response from our mighty neighbour. In fact, many things that might have been done to improve Hong Kong were not done because China's reaction was feared. We have had great times and very bad times. We have undergone terrible stresses and strains as China herself has writhed and groaned under the calamity of revolution and violent change. Through it all, the Hong Kong people have remained essentially Chinese patriots, loving their mother country despite being at odds with the political system which governs it. Hong Kong people have also learned to judge human rights in comparative terms. Where Hong Kong has been found wanting, the people have demanded improvement. The Government has increasingly listened to the chosen representatives of the people and has acted accordingly. Steadily and perceptibly, Hong Kong people have been drawn into protecting the rights they now clearly treasure. They will not be content unless and until they have the same rights as citizens in other advanced societies enjoy. But what do they feel about these human rights and freedoms when they consider 1997 and beyond? Hong Kong people know that China, with its different kind of government and with a different set of priorities when it comes to human rights, is not likely to take kindly to a future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government that insists on retaining laws and practices which irritate or frustrate the authority of the central government and its many branches. The Chinese assurance that Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong may begin to crumble if, for example, the Hong Kong media persists in criticising the SAR or bringing Beijing policies and actions into disrepute. Non-intervention by Beijing will encourage Hong Kong people to continue to speak out for what they espouse, even in support of liberal and democratic political systems. Intervention by Beijing, on the other hand, may stifle the freedoms which give life and vitality to the Hong Kong system and society. Any serious intervention by Beijing, before or after 1997, will certainly have a sobering effect on those who believe Hong Kong can best prosper under a democratically elected government. Many democrats in Hong Kong look hopefully north for signs of a change in attitude. They seek evidence that the dream of a Hong Kong ruled by Hong Kong people with a high degree of autonomy is realisable. They listen carefully and assess anxiously the statements by Chinese leaders and the actions taken by the Chinese Government to extend improvements in human rights to the people of China. They have been encouraged many times and just as often have suffered disappointment and even despair. China moves in fits and starts with human rights. Two steps forwards, one step -- sometimes two steps -- backwards. It is as if the Chinese leadership itself is wracked by doubt, being led this way or that way, unsure how far or how deep or how quickly some improvement or change of policy should go. The immense problem of carrying China forward in economic terms is sometimes too great to allow Chinese consideration of political moderation as well. Yet one element cannot move forward without impacting the other. Chinese leadership must every now and again bear down on some unfortunate miscreant with great harshness and cruelty to provide others with the kind of lesson that will never be forgotten. Recent Chinese history is littered with such examples -- Wei Jingsheng, Wang Juntao, Chen Chiming and now Xi Yang provide sad and terrible evidence of the treatment that can be meted out by a totalitarian state seeking to silence opposition and punish these who do no more than seek information. This treatment, applied extensively over a long period of time with severity and often with the utmost disregard for human feeling and dignity has created fear and loathing in Hong Kong. It cannot have improved confidence in the long-term future nor in the promises which have been solemnly provided by the Chinese Government. All my personal background, education, training, experience and human instinct cry out at the severity of the sentence of 12 years on Xi Yang. I will protest to the Chinese authorities as best I can and I pray that the voices of all those who seek his release will be heard in Beijing. China must move forward, not backward. Excessive punishment is a sign of fear not maturity. The freedoms enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong, including a free press, will be adversely affected if fear replaces confidence. I urge the Chinese authorities to reconsider the case against Xi and release him.
