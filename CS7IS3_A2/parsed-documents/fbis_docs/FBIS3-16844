He said that Mr. Perry's visit to Russia focused on bilateral relations in the military/political sphere. In particular, the two sides discussed the implementation of the air-defense treaty, ban on nuclear testing and non-proliferation of nuclear arms. "Russia and the U.S. are particularly responsible for non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they are two major nuclear powers. We should not focus all of our attention on the NATO program Partnership for Peace. It is just "an element" of relations between Russia and the West. Partnership For Peace should be understood in a broad sense," Kokoshin said. In his opinion, "one should approach Russia's entry in this program very seriously." "The interests of Russia and its allies under the CIS treaty on collective security should be fully taken into account," Kokoshin said.
