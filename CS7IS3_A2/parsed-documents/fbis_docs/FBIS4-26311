Chang hijacked a Boeing 737 with 63 passengers and nine crewmembers on board to the island on June 24 with a toy gun and a knife. He immediately surrendered to police upon landing at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Chang was sentenced to 12 years in jail but had his prison term reduced to nine years in his first appeal to the High Court. Taiwan is currently holding 15 mainlanders who have forced airliners to Taiwan since April 1993. Fourteen have been given jail terms of up to 13 years. The 15th is still on trial. Twelve mainland Chinese airliners have been hijacked to Taiwan since April last year, with the latest occurring when a man forced a Boeing 737 with 131 passengers and eight crewmembers on board to Taiwan on June 6. Taipei has charged Beijing of deliberately allowing the hijackings to take place, likely in a scheme to test Taiwan's air defenses.
