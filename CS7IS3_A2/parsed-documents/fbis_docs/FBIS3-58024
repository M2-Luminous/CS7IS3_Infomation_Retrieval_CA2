In the future, two channels concentrating on information and culture will be broadcast on VHF and medium-wave. Deutschland Radio is an amalgamation of three stations and will be based in both Berlin and Cologne. The new public broadcasting corporation will receive more than 300 million German marks annually from radio licence fees (75 pfennigs per month). Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk, which has been financed by the federal authorities, will change very little. In Berlin, however, RIAS, which was financed by the United States and then by the Ministry for Intra-German Relations and the former GDR station DS-Kultur, will merge. The Berlin part of Deutschland Radio will be based in the RIAS building. The directors of the new radio will be based in Cologne. The ZDF director Dieter Stolte is currently in temporary control until a new director is appointed. The most likely candidate is Ernst Elitz, television chief editor at Sueddeutscher Rundfunk.
