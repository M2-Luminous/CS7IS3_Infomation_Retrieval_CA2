When Premier Li Peng inspected the Three Gorges project toward the end of last year, he explicitly set out requirements on a series of issues, including building of Yichang's Huanglongsi airport, the Yi-Huang highway, and telecommunication undertakings that have a direct bearing on the Three Gorges project. At the very beginning when he started work, Governor Jia Zhijie put it bluntly that the Three Gorges project is located in Hubei, and the province is duty-bound to do a good job concerning the project. Regarding the several issues Premier Li Peng showed concern for, they must be implemented and launched immediately. [passage omitted] It was decided at the meeting to handle official business that the provincial authorities would invest 23 million yuan in the Huanglongsi airport project, and have it completed by the end of 1995. New channels for investment should be enthusiastically opened so the Yi-Huang highway is completed by the end of 1995. [passage omitted] The meeting made clear-cut decisions on improving Yichang's environmental quality, moving key enterprises that have pollution problems out of the city, and building the Yunci deep water harbor. Governor Jia Zhijie said, the six major issues related to the Three Gorges project were resolved in only half day. This showed that all departments have grasped the Three Gorges project as a top priority for the whole country and province, and embodied the spirit of breaking conventional rules and resolving specific problems in specific ways. In this spirit, the whole province from top to grass roots should make still greater direct contributions to the building of the Three Gorges project.
