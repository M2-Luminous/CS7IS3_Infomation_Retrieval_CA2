He stressed there are various options within the KPN leadership, adding that he even believes the differences are too small as similar views result in similar proposals of solutions. The KPN leader also said that if Lech Walesa does not sign the 1994 budget, KPN will support this decision. "We are the only parliamentary caucus which asked the president not to sign the budget law," he added. In the opinion of its members, KPN is a uniform political force whose isolation has been caused by the KPN decision not to be engaged in alignments which would be incompatible with the KPN programme. While addressing the meeting, Political Council Member Krzysztof Kaminski sharply criticized the press for reporting on the alleged split in the KPN. Moczulski is the unquestionable KPN leader and a candidate for president, Kaminski said. The KPN leader confirmed he would run in the next presidential elections. At the end of the meeting, heads of the KPN regional organizations presented reports concerning preparations for local government elections. They said the KPN was setting up coalitions with centre-right parties in numerous provinces. Leader of the KPN parliamentary caucus Krzysztof Krol stressed that members of regional chapters of centre and right-wing parties were much more responsible than their leaderships, and added that this provided a chance for winning the common struggle.
