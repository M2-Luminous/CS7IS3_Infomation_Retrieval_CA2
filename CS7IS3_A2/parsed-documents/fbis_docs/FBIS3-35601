It Will Not Be Easy To Secure Democratic Majority"] [Text] The "personnel fluidity" that had worried leaders of the Russia's Choice Duma faction even before the new parliament went to work seems to have reached critical mass. Reconciling themselves to the inevitability of a micro-split, Russia's Choice leaders decided to speed up the process artificially -- as the Duma resumes its sessions, the faction is establishing a "rigid membership," i.e., a ban on crossing over to other parliamentary associations. Potential defectors have been ordered to make up their mind as to their "propiska" [party affiliation] before 1 February. According to Russia's Choice functionaries, the current strength of the faction (78 persons) is quite sufficient to take care of two or three groups. Most probably, the majority of those who leave Russia's Choice will follow the example of Andrey Makarov and Boris Fedorov, and settle down in the Union of 12 December group. Despite the Russia's Choice statements, they so far are not managing to have peaceable relations with the Union of 12 December. Russia's Choice has hard feelings against the Union of 12 December because the latter willingly grants "political asylum" to victims of intrigues inside the faction, or simply deputies disaffected with some of the leaders. The Union of 12 December has hard feelings against Russia's Choice because the latter supported the "package" agreement on the election of Duma leaders and committees whereby it denied the nascent group any posts in the parliament. There is also a chance of an organized split, engineered by the leaders of Russia's Choice. One more faction would get them one more vote in the Duma Council. At any rate, the parent faction is in for a "toughening of discipline." Not so long ago the Russia's Choice leaders declared: "An identity of opinion is not a must with us; the more stances there are, the better." In actual fact it appears to be worse. In the future, in the idea of the "rigid membership" organizers, the roll-call voting list of Russia's Choice will consist, like those of the Communists, Agrarians, and Liberal Democrats, of the uniform "for" and "against" column. "We hope for cooperation with the other democratic factions and democratic groups of the Duma including the Union of 12 December, and expect that we will vote in the same manner on questions of principle," Kirill Ignatyev, Russia's Choice press secretary, told INTERFAX. Russia's Choice members who maintain that they will always be able to cooperate with "union factions" and secure the required one- third of all votes to back the president's veto on any law passed by the Duma, may be disappointed. The main danger lying in wait for Russia's Choice leaders on the "tough discipline" road is the obstinacy of those who would opt for a "St. George's Day" ["Yuryev Den" -- in old Russia a day on which serfs were free to change masters] and refuse to pay for their upkeep. New deputy groups forming in place of Russia's Choice may also not back it on some votes. Which would further worsen the situation in the none too unified "democratic bloc." For example, a clause-by-clause discussion of the budget may result in serious disagreements among the democratic factions and groups. Such a question as no-confidence in the government, with which Russia's Choice could threaten the premier as long as the present cabinet of ministers lasts, may not especially enthuse some Democrats. There is also no telling what would be the reaction from the unpredictable president, already thought to be unable to engage in conflicts with the parliament, to laws passed by the Duma majority -- the right of veto may remain uncalled-for. In this event attempts to secure the necessary votes to block the work of parliament would prove absolutely senseless. The "stagnation of reforms," Yegor Gaydar's phrase to describe the present situation, would fundamentally be replaced by finally rolling them back. In the Duma, one would see Russia's Choice trampled upon by the Communist majority which would no longer want compromises like the "package" handing out of parliamentary positions. Such are the disciplined remnants of the former, already now quite modest, greatness.
