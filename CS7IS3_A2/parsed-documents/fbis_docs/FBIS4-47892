The harsh and weary course lasted for 10 weeks. The battalion consists of 31 officers, 62 noncommissioned officers, and 252 troops. A total of 116 men was excluded from the course. The UN Operations in Mozambique says it is looking for an area where the battalion will be stationed. The battalion is supposed to be the embryo of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces' [FADM] Special Forces. The commander of the Portuguese training team noted that the battalion requires special weapons and modern equipment, as well as a sound logistics system. He said it is important that the battalion is correctly used, and its responsibilities clearly defined. He added: Mozambique's armed forces requirements should consider quality first instead of quantity. Generals Tobias Dai for the government and Herminio Morais for the Mozambique National Resistance attended the ceremony. Aldo Ajello and the Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique were also present. Dai said the training of FADM is an irreversible process, noting that the establishment of nonpartisan, career, and competent armed forces is a fact. He pledged greater government assistance to the new battalion, while Herminio de Morais asked the Mozambique Government to provide suitable logistical conditions for the new army. In addition to the special forces battalion, the course also trained Mozambican instructors who will train new recruits in future courses. They will be assisted by Portuguese instructors.
