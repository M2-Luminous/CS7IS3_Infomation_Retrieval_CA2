The unprecedented report from the Public Accounts Committee said recent failings represented a departure from the "standards of public conduct" established during the past 140 years. During heated exchanges in the Commons, Mr Major denied there had been any decline in standards, while Mr Smith the Labour leader described the report as a "devastating catalogue of incompetence, mismanagement and waste of public money." The all-party committee of MPs outlined 26 cases of financial failures and mismanagement in Whitehall departments and official quangos [quasiautonomous national government organization]. These ranged from inadequate financial controls in the Foreign Office in 1989 which created a climate "conducive to fraud and theft," to the expenditure by Wessex Regional Health Authority of up to 1 million pounds more than necessary on a computer. It was the first time the committee -- a watchdog on Government spending -- has published such a report in its 133-year history. It was compiled against a background of radical reform in the National Health Service and other public bodies, with officials under increasing pressure to adopt a more businesslike approach to the provision of services. The committee's criticisms have intensified Mr Major's difficulties in restoring the Government's reputation after a series of political and financial scandals involving Tory politicians and the disclosures of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair. Earlier this week the crossparty Commons Foreign Affairs Committee decided to investigate the award of 234 million pounds of Government aid to the Pergau dam project in Malaysia against the advice of senior civil servants . Mr Major will underline the Government's commitment to high standards of public life in a keynote speech tonight setting out his priorities for the coming year. But there is concern that the report will give the Labour leadership valuable ammunition in its campaign to highlight governmental "sleaze" and broken election promises on taxation. There was laughter from Labour MPs when Mr Major said he welcomed the report because it provided a "useful checklist" to help public bodies to avoid wasting money in future . He denied there had been a decline in standards, and was visibly annoyed when Mr Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said people were being asked to pay unprecedented levels of taxation only to see the Government and quangos throw money away on "waste corruption and fraud." Thumping his notes down on the Dispatch Box, Mr Major challenged Mr Ashdown to substantiate his allegations . Earlier, Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton under Lyne and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the situation they had uncovered was getting worse. The gravity of the report was underlined by a Conservative committee member, Mr Richard Page, who said it should not be a party political issue. "Because there have been frauds, because there have been misdemeanors, this is a clear shot across the bows for every Government department and every Government agency," he said. Labour MPs immediately., seized on the report to attack Government reforms. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's spokesman on the public services, blamed the failings on bringing outsiders into public office and the prevalent "business culture and political climate of greed and self-interest." Mr Waldegrave, the minister responsible for public services, acknowledged the report had shown up some "very bad examples." But he said the committee did not believe there was a contradiction between the Government's changes and the maintenance of proper standards. It said: "Some allege that the drive for economy and efficiency must be held back to some extent because of the need to take specific care with public money. Others argue that if economy and efficiency are to be forcibly pursued, then traditional standards must be relaxed. We firmly reject both claims." The report noted that sweeping reforms of the Civil Service, intended to improve efficiency through greater delegation and a more entrepreneurial approach, had been accompanied by serious failures in financial and administrative control and accountability, as well as a collapse in traditional public sector values. "Apart from the important moral and other aspects involved, we consider that any failure to respect and care for public money would be a most important cause of a decline in the efficiency of public business," it said. At a time of great change honesty should not be neglected in the effort to maximise economy and efficiency. It demanded effective systems of control and accountability and "above all responsible attitudes on the part of those handling money." It called for the National Audit Office's powers to be extended to enable it to examine all bodies that received most of their income from public funds. The report includes a checklist of procedures for Government departments, including systematic checking of bills; making sure no ex gratia payments are made to staff who should have been dismissed; tighter rules on the provision of cars; ensuring effective personal accountability; avoiding conflicts of interest in awarding contracts; regular assessment of expenditure programmes and greater openness.
