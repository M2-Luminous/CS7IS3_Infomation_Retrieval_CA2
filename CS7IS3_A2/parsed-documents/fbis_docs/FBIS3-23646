American, European, and Japanese firms have attempted to resolve this problem by rendering the antenna flat and unnoticeable. Alas! The laws of physics relentlessly dictate a definite shape, such that antennas continue to assume the configuration to which we have become accustomed. The above brief introduction should make it clear why the European press ("The Times," in particular), not the Russian, was the first to report the successes attained by domestic electronics specialists. It was the latter, if one is to believe that press, who were able to "trick" the laws of physics to create flat antennas of any configuration which can be easily "camouflaged" to blend with the color of a building. The newspaper accounts were marred by inaccuracies, lacked any mention of the sources of the information, and failed to name the manufacturer. Perhaps that was due to fear on the part of each country that her competing neighboring countries would be the first to get to Russia. Another reason could be that what was reported was nothing more than a false rumor. Nonetheless, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondents did manage to obtain a confirmation in the Russian Ministry of Communications: "Yes, something like that was done in the Urals." They were provided an explanation of why the sensational invention was not reported by the domestic press: The antenna was made for military purposes; it is simpler to both transport and camouflage in a combat situation. Although the Urals are a large area, a single telephone call to the editorial office of VECHERNYY CHELYABINSK was sufficient to "ferret out" the hero of the day: "Yes, it was done here in our city. There has been no need to advertise, since as yet there is nothing to sell." "We lack the means to tool up for production of the antenna," was an admission made to the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent by Sergey Ponomarev, who experimented with flat miracle antennas over a long period of time in a laboratory of the Chelyabinsk NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Measurement Technology. The Institute had been contacted by specialists from the USA, Great Britain, Germany, and South Korea who wished to purchase the antenna or acquire patent rights with the intent of undertaking its manufacture. Ponomarev proceeded to speak at length in glowing terms of the unavailable antenna, finally asking surprisingly: "When will it show up here in Russia? Well, round antennas do not harmonize with detached buildings in our country, also."
