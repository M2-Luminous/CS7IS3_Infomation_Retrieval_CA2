FR940505-1-00042 FR940505-1-00012 Finally, for purposes of the 1999 attainment date option for Sacramento, EPA is proposing a restriction on the use of on-road vehicles such that each vehicle in the Sacramento nonattainment area would be prohibited from being driven on one day out of five weekdays. This is, of course, one of the least desirable of mobile source options available to EPA, but, as is described in detail in III.B.3.d.(3), it appears necessary in order to meet the 1999 attainment deadline. It is also one of the main reasons why EPA is recommending the 2005 attainment option. D. Role of State and Local Agencies 1. SIP Responsibilities EPA has every intention of using the FIP process to propose and promulgate real solutions to the ozone problems in Sacramento and Ventura, as well as both the ozone and carbon monoxide problems in the South Coast. EPA will implement these solutions as it becomes necessary. However, under the CAAA of 1990, nothing in the FIPs proposed today or to be finalized in February, 1995 releases the state and local governments from their independent legal responsibilities to meet all requirements of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, failure to meet any of these requirements will subject applicable areas of the state to the mandatory sanctions required by section 179 of the Act. One of the most important responsibilities that any nonattainment area has under the Clean Air Act is to adopt and submit to EPA in November 1994, comprehensive plans to attain the ozone standard by its applicable attainment date. Regardless of the FIPs, the state must still implement plans sufficient to demonstrate attainment. Nothing in the FIP can relieve them of that responsibility under the law. As discussed earlier, EPA is requesting comment on whether there should be an exception to this requirement. Specifically, comment is requested on whether, as a legal and policy matter, states should be allowed to take credit for emission reductions associated with FIP controls applied to sources over which EPA has sole jurisdiction. 2. State and Local Opportunities EPA hopes that state and local agencies will take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the FIP development process. EPA believes that the emission reduction strategies proposed today, together with the public involvement process described below, can be used to leverage support for state and local emission reduction strategies. EPA has purposefully chosen to maximize the number of strategies in this proposal that could be adopted wholesale by state and local agencies. In other cases, the necessarily blunt EPA strategies should provide support for better tailored state and local regulation of the same emission sources. Finally, state and local agencies have the ability to adopt innovative emissions growth management, transportation control and land use strategies that EPA cannot propose. These types of strategies adopted at the local level could displace the more onerous strategies in the FIPs.
