The meeting examined and adopted, in principle, the "Detailed Rules for Implementing the PRC State Security Law (Draft)," and discussed other issues. The meeting maintained that, since the 30th session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee adopted and promulgated it on 22 February 1993, the "PRC State Security Law" has played an important part in maintaining state security, in defending China's people's democratic dictatorship and socialist system, and in safeguarding the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. It maintained, however, that detailed implementation rules should be drawn up on the basis of the State Security Law so that the law can be implemented more effectively. The meeting decided that the State Council will promulgate the detailed implementation rules (draft) after they have been further amended.
