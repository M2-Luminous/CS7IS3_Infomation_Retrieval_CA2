What is its goal? Dr. Susan Fiyad, one of the center's founders and a specialist in psychological and nervous disorders, says: "The idea was formulated during my extended practice in several government psychiatric hospitals. During that time I treated many victims of torture whose missteps cost them a mixture of torture, abuse of dignity, and psychological humiliation, from which they emerged broken in body and spirit. "One of the things that affected me strongly was that 80 percent of these people were basically honest citizens. They were true victims. Therefore, I personally found that they had lost much of their confidence, either in themselves or in others. They came to us to receive the treatment they required for any nervous disorder. As for psychiatric illnesses, which are feelings of confusion, debility, low self esteem, depression, and inability to fight or overcome the crisis, these disorders continue to lurk and strongly impede their internal equilibrium. "One example that I was involved with, and that I'll never forget, occurred when one of those patients who had been tortured in a police station sensed an air of trust between me and him, and began to tell me his bitter experiences. "The young man had been working as a karate instructor. He resigned from his job in a national organization and opened a mechanic's shop. One day a dispute broke out between him and a police officer. The latter induced some of his colleagues to arrest the young man. He was tortured in a police station with the most repugnant forms of degradation and attacks on his dignity, in front of his wife and children. In only four hours, the life of this young man collapsed completely and his situation was completely reversed, especially when he was unable to restore his honor and dignity by any legal means. "He suffered from depression, dissociation, chronic pains, sexual debility, feelings of guilt, and loss of confidence in himself. He said: `I used to lump you together with those who tortured me, but now I don't.' That case required three years of medical and psychological treatment until I was able to rehabilitate him." Dr. Susan Fiyad continued: "This is one example out of hundreds of shocking cases of which we know little. They live among us like time bombs, and we know nothing about them. They are cases of mental and nervous disorders, to whom the general practitioner, or even the experienced psychiatrist, is unable to offer real, effective help. "Moreover, they require very special methods of therapy, over the short- and long-term, by a specialized medical team that is qualified to deal with these disorders. This is precisely what cannot be provided in the government hospital. "Therefore we as doctors are aware of the dire need for such a specialized center to rehabilitate victims of violence and torture without restriction or conditions as to the identity of the victim, the reason for the attack, or its source." I asked Dr. 'Abdallah Mansur, one of the center's founders: Do you have statistics that indicate the number of torture victims we have? "No, they are not available, but it is certain that the victims number in the thousands, because we don't mean just torture victims in detention camps or police stations, but rather those who are subjected to family torture and abusers, including men, women, and children. However, at the present time, the concentration is on shock cases [al-halat al-sarikhah], in view of the project's newness. Dealing with those types of victims began only six months ago. Despite the newness of the specialty and the center, the number of patients exceeds 50 cases. Most of these people were subjected to torture in Egyptian police stations, or are Palestinian or Sudanese detainees, who were released and who came to use of their own accord or through Amnesty International." What are the methods of treating torture victims? Dr. Susan Fiyad replies: "The primary goal of the treatment is to rebuild the personality, so that he can again become responsible for his life. Therefore we keep the patient from recalling his previous experiences as much as possible. The therapy is both physical and mental at the same time. Natural therapy also forms an important part of the physical treatment. The patient's social situation is taken into account, as our treatment also includes members of the victim's family to share in getting through the crisis safely without complications. Before the therapy starts, the patient is asked in for an interview during which a general evaluation of the case is made. We then acquaint him with the elements that will be included in his treatment. At the same time, together with proceeding with the evaluation, a three-part therapy program begins, comprised of psychological and physical treatment and social guidance. We have prepared a team of doctors to treat each of these phases. "Meanwhile, the patient is treated with respect and caution. The therapist must remember patient reactions in certain cases. The therapist always obtains the complete background as to the types of torture that the patient has endured." Is the al-Nadim Torture Victim Rehabilitation Center under any governmental agency or organization? Susan Fiyad says: "The center cannot be subordinate to any governmental or other agency, or its purpose would be lost. The center was established on the basis of being a private, civilian, nonprofit company. It was registered on this basis on 28 August 1993, under No. 2668/1993. The project comes within the scope of welfare services, and a part of the project's funding comes from Denmark through the Center for Research and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen. This is a center that was opened for the same purpose in 1982. "The al-Nadim Center in Cairo is the first center of its kind in the Arab and African region. Therefore, we accept torture victims through organizations concerned with this matter, either from inside Egypt or elsewhere, in order to offer these unique and modern services. We also exchange data through 60 similar centers around the world that surpass us in experience." Are there set fees for patient treatment? "No material compensation is required for services offered, testing, and rehabilitative therapy. The only stipulation is having the total agreement of the victim of violence. The center is obligated to maintain complete secrecy and total respect for the patient's privacy. "Moreover, the patient may also be referred to other specialists if required, for examination and action as determined for any accompanying physical disorder. This can be arranged in accordance with the initial visit with the patient. Accordingly, tests required to begin therapy and rehabilitation are determined. "The center also accepts those who come on their own accord or who are sent by their family or friends, or by various organizations and agencies that deal with violence victims. The center also assists and supports tactical and practical efforts expended by local and international organizations with the aim of stopping violent practices and torture. The center offers short- and long-term psychological rehabilitative therapy to those who have been subjected to any form of physical or mental violence. "Through the therapy of those who were tortured, we are told the facts of torture, beginning with the oppression of police stations to the torture in Sudan and detention in Israel. Let us begin with a case from the center and reports of the Public Prosecutor's Office." - Mirfat 'Abd-al-Hamid, airline stewardess. She was tortured in the Nasr City precinct by the chief of secret police and two of his aides in order to force her to confess to theft, despite the fact that the Public Prosecutor's Office acquitted her. This led to her attempting suicide by jumping out of the window of the secret police's room, especially after being threatened with being stripped of her clothes. She suffered a concussion, and broken teeth and collarbone. - Zakariyya al-Shami, professor in the Suez Canal University. He was punched and beaten in the face. He was transported in the trunk of a police car to the Ismailia second precinct, where he received additional abuse. The reason for this was that he scraped a police officer's car. - Salim Ibrahim Salim, an accountant in a well-known bank. He says: "I was subjected to savage torture by secret policemen, though I had committed no offense. They only wanted to do a favor for a friend of theirs who works for the same bank where I work. They lured me to the Cairo security directorate on the pretext of ending the dispute between me and their friend. From there they took me to the Nasr City precinct and severely tortured me. They hung me by my arms until they nearly snapped. Their hands also touched sensitive places of my body. There are medical reports regarding my case in the International Peace Hospital. Their torture resulted in my permanent disability. The Public Prosecutor's Office investigated but did not get anywhere. The dossier is now in the prosecutor general's office." - We shall leave these files and move on to Palestine. One Palestinian in the treatment center relates his story: "During 12 full years of detention, I was in most Zionist prisons and detention camps. Naturally, I witnessed all shades of torture, to such an extent that over the last five years I have had no awareness of torture both physical and psychological, as if I were a dead being or a living dead man. I am receiving treatment from a team of doctors, including specialists in endemic diseases, surgery, and physical therapy, in view of the fact that 90 percent of my limbs are affected by fibrillation in the joints and rheumatism, in addition to psychological treatment." - As soon as Mrs. Jamilah, one of the victims of torture in the occupied Arab territories, was released and allowed to leave, she was sent to one of the Cairo hospitals to obtain intensive physical and psychological treatment, in view of her ill health. She continued under medical supervision for more than a year until her situation improved. However, what does she say about her personal experiences in Zionist prison camps? Jamilah says: "My detention was terrible and frightening. How could I forget or explain it? There are no words for what did--and still does--go on in those slaughterhouses that they call the abominable Zionist prison camps. Everything in them is barbarous, brutal, and indescribable. The torturers are inhuman, as if they have no religion or faith. I could describe them as legions of bloodsuckers, killers, rapists, sadists, and deviates who came from the Dark Ages. It began when I was arrested by an official of the Civil Administration in Gaza. I was held in a tent on the beach, Shaykh 'Ajlan Street, in the army camp, for three hours. They tied my hands, feet, and head, and I received more than 300 blows and kicks from their hands and feet on every part of my body, thereby heedlessly violating my dignity and honor. Later, I was taken to 'Asqalan Prison. "In the cell with me were two criminal prisoners. They crushed seeds and inhaled them up their nose. I was shocked that they asked me for sex; they were dressed only in their underwear. They were Jewesses of various nationality, who work as prostitutes. They were in prison because of criminal cases. The authorities put us with them to humiliate and debase us. "I resisted and hit one of them in her face several times. I was hit on the head from behind. Because of this, I became unconscious. When I came to, I found that they had completely stripped me of my clothes. "I was unable to tell how long I had been in this condition. My body was broken. After four months of brutalization and torture of various kinds in the prison camp, violating my honor in barbaric ways, I was left broken and in pain. I was in agonizing pain, because of a lack of calcium, nutrition, and sustenance. My sound teeth were extracted without drugs. I was restrained in shackles. Three teeth fell out without anyone's assistance. I felt extreme pain in my right foot and hand, and pain in my head that is indescribable. I also suffer from lack of control in the joints of my foot. I suffered a psychological crisis and a nervous breakdown. As soon as I was released, after a year, they allowed me to leave, and I came to Cairo for physical and mental treatment." It is difficult for one Sudanese journalist to remember escaping from the grasp of the Islamic Front. She was subjected to several medical examinations as a result of her enuresis, bowel problems, and nightmares that haunt her as long as her eyes are closed. "After two years in Sudanese prison camps that we called ghost houses, I was able to flee and come to Cairo. "For four months my eyes were bandaged, and I was stripped of my underclothes. My skin was .......... They dropped me down into a deep well, filled with foul odors, almost like corpses, either animals or human. They were not content with just torturing me physically, but rather they made me watch others being tortured to death. "They sowed seeds of fear, terror, and anxiety in my soul. I had not imagined such barbaric, merciless torture. I had never imagined watching the torture of others, even more painful than what I was subjected to. I wanted to die. They were intent on stopping me from fainting so that the torture could continue. "I asked myself: What did I do? What are the real reasons for this torture. Why didn't they kill me at once? I asked myself that, until the day came when I was able to escape by a miracle. "I responded to the treatment after more than five months in Cairo."
