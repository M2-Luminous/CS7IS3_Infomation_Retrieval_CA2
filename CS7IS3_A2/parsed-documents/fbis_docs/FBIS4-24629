Many people believe that this has something to do with Deng Xiaoping's recent state of health. There are many indications that Deng's health is deteriorating and that he has further detached himself from state affairs, though Chinese official quarters and his relatives repeatedly dismiss such reports as groundless. This is a recent development which warrants attention. All intra-party factions are trying to keep the situation under control to capitalize on Deng's still being alive. In the meantime they will take the opportunity to consolidate their strength. Therefore they can reach a consensus on the question of maintaining stability and even on pursuing a tough policy to suppress civilian rebellious activities. The situation in the period immediately before Mao Zedong's death in 1976 is a case in point. At that time both "the gang of four," and Ye Jianying and Hua Guofeng were loath to see disturbances created by civilians for fear that such disturbances would affect their plans and the Communist Party's position as the ruling party, so they could unanimously agree to suppress the "5 April Tiananmen unrest." The present situation is similar to that in 1976. Deng Xiaoping's Health Is Really in Question The discussion of Deng's state of health may remind many people of the television pictures of Deng's public appearances in Shanghai during the last Spring Festival period broadcast by Chinese Central Television. According to a reliable source, the Shanghai Television crew responsible for shooting Deng's activities had intended to take as good pictures as they could so that they could fulfilled the task assigned to them by Chinese Central Television, but they found it difficult to accomplish the task because they could not even record a complete sentence by Deng. In the end Shanghai Television could not but deliver all the pictures they took to Chinese Central Television, which in turn submitted them to the Deng Xiaoping Office for inspection. So the pictures shown by Chinese Central Television were actually those selected by the Deng Xiaoping Office. From this people can imagine what Deng's state of health was like at that time. The source continued: Deng's family members emphasize that Deng is in good shape and that he is not in hospital. This is correct, because even if Deng fell ill, doctors would stay at his home to take care of him, as was the case with Mao Zedong. The reports about Deng's health began spreading in early March. The source added: However, that Deng is in poor health does not mean he is as good as dead. Chinese leaders have excellent methods of keeping fit and prolonging their lives. Chen Yun has survived serious illnesses three times over the last five years. Is he not still kicking now? Having had his blood changed (it is reported that Deng also suffers from cancer of the blood), Deng will also increase his life force. Nevertheless, it is certain that the opportunities for Deng to take personal care of state affairs will decrease considerably. The Deng Xiaoping Office led by Deng Rong and several persons trusted by the office have in fact taken over a lot of Deng's workload. Jiang Zemin Steps Up His Efforts To Draw the Military Over to His Side In Deng's few remaining years, his health will certainly affect the several inner-party factions' struggle to consolidate their positions. In fact people in Chinese political circles are aware that the big shots in the CPC hierarchy have defined their focal points of work to expand their influence over the last six months. This tendency has become more evident recently. Jiang Zemin placed his stress on the military. He was clearly aware that he must obtain the support of the military before he could have the situation well in hand and that he badly needed such support at present. Therefore, he made arrangements several years ago and obtained the gratitude of Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen by, together with Liu, squeezing out Yang Baibing and his followers. A military officer must perform military exploits before he can have a secure position in the military, but how can he perform military exploits in times of peace? Under the circumstances, Jiang considered it military exploits to obtain economic interests, or interests in the form of promotion [wei jun fang qu de sheng qian li yi 3634 6511 2455 0648 1779 0581 6692 0448 4135], for the military. Hence, after helping Liu displace Yang and his followers, he paid close attention to personnel arrangements in the military. According to a reliable source, Jiang examined any promotion of officers at division level and above and interviewed those officers of army level and above recommended for promotion. During the second session of the eighth National People's Congress [NPC] held last March, Jiang frequently attended the group discussions of the People's Liberation Army delegation to listen to their demands. He supported the argument that the state must increase military expenditure by a big margin mainly for the purpose of improving servicemen's living conditions (the relevant proposals were adopted by the last NPC meeting). When other delegations which had demanded that he attend their group meetings made veiled criticism of his refusal to do so, Jiang put on airs, saying "whoever has opinions can express them to me directly." It is safe to say that Jiang has recently reshuffled the military leadership to a certain extent. Though he is still unable to get absolute support from the military (partly because those who were sacked remain unconvinced of his leadership and partly because he has made fairly few contributions), he is still supported by those military officers in power (including Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and the retired Zhang Aiping), and again his move did not cause serious concern to Deng. That is how Jiang has pursued his line by enlisting support from the military. Qiao Shi Expands the NPC's Authority Qiao Shi has also worked actively in his own interests. He has devoted his energy to the NPC and to procuratorial, judicial, and public security organizations, which had been under his leadership for many years. Since he was appointed NPC chairman, he has proposed improving the NPC's operation at every meeting. To this end, he recently tabled four specific measures: 1. Gradually grant legislative power to local people's congresses. Local people's congresses should be allowed to enact laws which have not been enacted by the central government when they consider it necessary to do so on condition that they do not go against the principles laid down by the central government. The Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has set such a precedent. 2. Change the present legislative procedures. Many laws and regulations are now first drafted by government departments and then submitted to the NPC for examination and approval. This practice concentrates the concrete contents and actions of the administration of justice in the hands of the government system. There is no supervision to speak of in this regard. The government departments will legislate according to their own needs. In Qiao's view, the people's congress should be responsible for future legislation, and civilian experts can be invited to draft certain laws, subject to the NPC's examination and approval. The drafting of the "Securities Law" under the leadership of Li Yining has provided such a precedent. 3. Change the practice of "enforcing regulations on a trial basis before passing them into law" into the practice of "making laws before enforcing them." The past practice is equivalent to "groping our way across the river by feeling the stones on the bottom." If regulations are not passed into law beforehand, the regulations will be distorted or have their nature changed in accordance with the government's actual needs. Therefore, Qiao is trying to consolidate the NPC's authority. 4. Train law-enforcement personnel. In the past, there were no laws to go by in China, but at present there are difficulties in enforcing laws, or the law is not strictly enforced. This has everything to do with the quality of law-enforcement personnel. Therefore, Qiao stressed the need to intensify training for law-enforcement personnel. Ding Guangen Stops the NPC From Publishing a Newspaper Apart from the four measures, Qiao has also constantly tried to reinforce the NPC's position. Earlier, a number of scholars and staff members of the NPC proposed setting up an organization to study the people's congress system. This was subject to the approval of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department because it involved ideology. But unexpectedly, the department rejected the application. Consequently, Qiao was forced to concern himself with the matter. Again, the NPC so far has no newspaper of its own (the party has RENMIN RIBAO as its mouthpiece; the central government JINGJI RIBAO; and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference RENMIN ZHENGXIE BAO). Earlier, some people suggested making FAZHI RIBAO an affiliated organ of the NPC. But the Justice Ministry, which owns the newspaper, declined the suggestion, because the newspaper has been bringing in a handsome profit to the ministry. Therefore, the NPC Standing Committee pressed for publishing a newspaper, temporarily called RENMIN ZHI SHENG BAO [PEOPLE'S VOICE], as its mouthpiece. This had to be approved by the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, but the application was turned down by Ding Guangen, head of the propaganda department. Only after Qiao called Ding directly was the application approved. It is still unknown when the newspaper will come off the presses. Wang Xiaoyun, a NPC staff member, is planning the work. All this indicates the effort Qiao has made to intensify the NPC's position. What were Qiao's intentions in doing all this? Consolidating his own position or really reforming the NPC? His present efforts will actually serve to strengthen the NPC's functions. But how to prevent the NPC from degenerating into a tool of power struggles remains a matter warranting attention. Zhu Rongji Dismisses Sun Weiben From His Post Zhu Rongji has shown little ambition in his work (as he is appraised by his subordinates as well as subordinates of other senior officials). As he is mainly responsible for economic matters and is decisive in handling matters--it was Zhu Rongji who decided to remove Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee, from office and Jiang Zemin had no objection to his decision--he will be able to strengthen his position and I will say no more about him. Li Peng has received little attention from the CPC hierarchy. He is now responsible only for foreign affairs (he is also responsible for Hong Kong affairs, so a fairly hard-line policy is being pursued. He is Zhou Nan's strongest boss). The view shared by members of the CPC hierarchy is that if Li Peng does not disappear from the political arena after Deng's death, he will step down like Hua Guofeng with the change in the situation. No matter what will happen to the present pattern of power in the future, the present reality is that all factions are trying to reinforce their positions while Deng is still alive and that they are reluctant to see any destabilizing factors affecting their time and opportunity for reinforcing their strength. The poorer Deng's health and the less he concerns himself with state affairs, the more opportunities there will be for them. Therefore, the CPC hierarchy has almost reached a consensus in employing hardball tactics to maintain political stability.
