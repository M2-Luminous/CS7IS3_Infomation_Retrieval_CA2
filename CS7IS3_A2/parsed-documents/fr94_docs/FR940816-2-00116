The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicant's Representations 1. Applicant, a New York trust, is an open-end management investment company. On October 6, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A pursuant to section 8(b). Applicant never registered its securities under the Securities Act of 1933. 2. Applicant was organized as a master fund in a master/feeder arrangement with Yankee Funds, another registered management investment company. Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B, a portfolio of Yankee Funds, invested in applicant and owned substantially all of applicant's units of beneficial interest. 3. On February 22, 1993, the boards of trustees of Yankee Funds and applicant approved a plan of reorganization whereby all of applicant's assets would be transferred to Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, a portfolio of the Galaxy Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8, the trustees of applicant and The Galaxy Fund determined that the reorganization was in the best interests of each trust, and that the interests of the existing shareholders of each trust would not be diluted as a result. 1 1 Applicant and the Galaxy Equity Growth Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and common officers. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a), rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. 4. A combined proxy statement and prospectus was sent to Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B's shareholders on April 11, 1993. Definitive copies of such materials were filed with the SEC as part of The Galaxy Fund's registration on April 23, 1993. A majority of the shareholders of Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B approved the reorganization at a meeting held on May 6, 1993, and Yankee Tax-Exempt Income Fund B, as holder of a majority of the units of beneficial interest of applicant, approved the reorganization by written consent dated May 6, 1993. 5. On May 7, 1993, applicant transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund in exchange for shares of that fund. Thereafter, applicant distributed the Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund shares to its shareholders. Applicant's shareholders received shares of the Galaxy Tax-Exempt Bond Fund with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of their respective interests in applicant. 6. In connection with the reorganization, applicant incurred expenses such as professional fees, custody and administration fees and expenses totaling $25,252. The expenses were paid by applicant. 7. Applicant has no outstanding debts or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant has no shareholders and is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
