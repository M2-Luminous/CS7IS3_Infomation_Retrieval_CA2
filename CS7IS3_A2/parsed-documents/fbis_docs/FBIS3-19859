Today, specialists in large and small commercial banks and securities dealers are busy monitoring it. Whoever assesses well the monetary strategies and measures can make much money for his firm. For in the international trade with foreign currencies, shares, bonds, and precious metals, prices usually react strongly to changes in monetary and currency policy. For some weeks now, individual large central banks have been a cause of worry for traders and analysts. While in February it was the U.S. Federal Reserve ("Fed") which upset market participants with its albeit slight, yet unexpected, raise in short-term interest rates, these days the German Bundesbank is the center of attention. Since publication of a 20.6 percent growth rate of the money supply for January--evidently distorted by some special influences--banks and stock exchanges are questioning whether the money supply figures are still a valid indicator for the future attitude of the Bundesbank. And not a few contemporaries are advising the Bundesbank to act as other central banks, such as the Fed, are doing and to finally give up the attempt to regulate the money supply. From the viewpoint of a trader or capital investor acting in the short term, this conclusion is not illogical. Market participants, who on occasion do transactions in a matter of seconds, want reliable information whose significance does not depend on subsequent long explanations in the media. A trader is hardly served by the statement that the money supply figures at the beginning of the year are basically less important than those at year's end, but that nonethless one must not neglect the figures at the beginning of the year. He wants to know unequivocally: Is this figure correct and important? But the approach to a money supply policy is not of a short-term, but rather of a long-term nature. The doctrine of money supply policy, the so-called monetarism, is based on two tenets: There is a long-term, parallel connection between the money supply of an economy and the inflation rate. This is largely undisputed and proven by a great number of examples. That it is usual for prices to rise if the bank note press had previously rotated too fast, is also not particularly surprising. The practical difficulty for a central bank is to define precisely what is to be included in the money supply in view of the speed with which ever new products are being created in the financial markets. In Germany, in addition to cash, are included sight deposits, time deposits with a life up to four years, and savings deposits with three-months' withdrawal notices maintained in domestic banks and savings banks by private households and enterprises. This demarcation has proven itself all in all. But in other countries, such as the United States, this has not functioned nearly as well. The second basic tenet of the monetarists, according to which a central bank can reliably control the money supply, is therefore very controversial. Many monetarists have evidently underestimated the complexity of modern financial markets. Nevertheless, a farewell to monetarism would be premature for two reasons. Namely, the most important reasons for the sometimes strong short-term fluctuations in the German money supply can be found in a misguided policy by the governments. This thesis is permissible: With more appropriate actions by governments, money supply statistics would send less confusing signals. The crises of the European Monetary System have sometimes inflated the German money supply. But the currency crises occurred only because the governments of the EU members previously had not been in a position to make the adjustments of the exchange rates which, from an economic aspect, had long been overdue. A sad chapter, not only for monetary policy, is the tax chaos following an interest discount. Among other reasons, the money supply grew so strongly in December 1993 and January 1994 because irritated investors, primarily for tax reasons, sold shares in investment funds and stashed them--probably only temporarily--as bank deposits. Furthermore, the government's tax policy promoted increased use of cash--actually an anachronism. And lastly, a change in the rules of the already totally overdrawn subsidy of the housing market set off a rush on building loans, which further inflated the money supply. A further strength of the monetarist money supply policy consists in tying the central bank to a long-term policy orientation. Economists have shown in a great number of works that a long-term orientation of monetary policy can produce better results than measures motivated by the short term. And lastly, one must also ask the critics of a money supply policy what then should take its place. Now and then, it is being proposed that the Bundesbank manipulate the interest structure, i.e., the ratio of short-term and long-term interest rates. True, this idea has theoretical merits. But in practice, the recently observed fluctuations of long-term interest rates, effected by enormous capital movements, make such an idea appear not very practicable. And it is also not possible to return to a global currency system with the U.S. dollar as the key currency, in which the other central banks are only concerned with keeping the dollar exchange rate stable. The money supply policy is a concept with strengths and weaknesses. It may be quite possible that, due to changes in the financial markets, it will suffer further damage in Germany also. For the time being, however, there is no alternative to it. It is uncertain whether one will ever be found. For, as economist Juerg Niehans once wrote, money supply policy after all is not a science, but an art.
