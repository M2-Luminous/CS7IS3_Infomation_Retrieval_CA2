In fact, we are lucky because the damage was very limited, concentrating on electricity lines that extend from the station to feed the capital, Sanaa. [Al-'Ayzari] This means the [words indistinct] lines? [Al-Junayd] [Words indistinct] In the station itself, the damage is very minor and concentrated on the lines, [word indistinct] the lines extending from the Dhamar station to the capital, Sanaa. The brothers [words indistinct] took a position in favor of the constitutional legitimacy. Teams moved and the brothers from the General Electricity Corporation, with their equipment came and they defined the damage and began repair work. The lines extend from the Dhamar transformers to Sanaa through two circuits. The teams in the area repaired the first circuit. A great effort was made and they were able to restore electric current to Sanaa. The day before yesterday at 8 or 9 o'clock [am, pm not specified] they completed their task successfully, restoring power to Sanaa in a very normal way. Repair work on the second circuit, which is really a reserve circuit, continues. It was hit harder. The brothers at the site [words indistinct] brother Ahmad al-'Ayni also present to have a firsthand knowledge of the situation. The repairs will be carried out and today, and tomorrow they will be able to repair everything and the electric power would be completely restored. We tell the citizens that the electric current is available in the capital and there are no problems and their will be no cuts, God willing. [passage omitted]
