[Shakhray] Every intelligent person in Russia knew already on 12 December -- the first day after the elections -- that there would be a decree on amnesty in Russia. The text was discussed several times. Representatives of the presidential administration attended the meeting at which the last variant was discussed. Therefore, President Boris Yeltsin knew precisely about the text and the attitude of the parliamentary forces. The 18 affirmative votes of the PRES could not change anything. The reaction and confusion show that, as before, at the federal level, there is no coordination between the president, the government, and the prosecution. [Popov] Do you think that the amnesty would also have been adopted had it been outside the package of documents? [Shakhray] Without any doubt. This amnesty was not a goal in itself, but a step toward civic peace. However, I would like to draw your attention precisely to the package of documents. I do not understand why people only speak about the amnesty decree. First of all, there is the memorandum. On the basis of this memorandum, political forces must sit together, negotiate, and reach certain agreements about accord, which will guarantee that those who have been released will not provoke civic clashes. Then, there are certain judicial guarantees that sound as a warning, namely, that each of the released could be imprisoned again. Only afterward were they allowed to leave their cells. However, even in itself, the political amnesty is an element of civic peace. We bear responsibility for our decisions and for not allowing any bloodshed. [Popov] Your party congress has just ended. How do you view your place in political life and your party's influence? [Shakhray] We are one of the five leading parties and perhaps even more than that. We are trying to construct an all-national party. We have 64 active regional organizations and several dozen are in the process of registration. This is a conservative party based on traditional values -- the state, family, property, and morality. Our formula for Russia's renewal contains a socially oriented market economy, federalism, and local self-government. Our main task is not only to represent the regions in the federation center but also to influence the formation and implementation of all-state interests. [Popov] Do you expect a reshaping of the Russian political space and what direction will this take? [Shakhray] We think that two or three all-national parties are needed, and one of them is our party, which represents a conservative regional idea. Sooner or later, an all-national social democratic party will emerge. It could have various names, but its prospects are promising. It is more difficult to speak about the third party because Zhirinovskiy already uses a popular name for his party [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. However, conservative, social-democratic, and liberal ideas will crystallize in the form of three major parties. The emergence of those three economic and political currents depends to a large degree on election legislation. If the percentage barrier is raised, such blocs will emerge sooner. In any event, elections remain the only way for these parties to emerge.
