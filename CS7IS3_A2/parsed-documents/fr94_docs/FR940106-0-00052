FR940106-0-00052 FR940106-0-00017 42 CFR Part 493 [HSQ&hyph;210&hyph;FC] Medicare, Medicaid and CLIA Programs; Personnel Requirements for Cytotechnologists AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and Public Health Service (PHS), HHS. ACTION: Final Rule with Comment Period. SUMMARY: This rule amends certain personnel requirements for cytotechnologists that perform testing in laboratories subject to the requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). We are providing an adequate period of time for individuals to gain the necessary 2 years experience performing cytology testing which is currently included in two of the provisions for qualifying as a cytotechnologist. Also, we are extending the time for individuals to either meet the educational qualifications by virtue of completing training in an approved cytotechnology training program or be certified by an approved organization. We are making these changes to prevent the loss of qualified personnel in the field of cytotechnology. DATES: These regulations are effective on January 6, 1994. Comments will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided below, no later than 5 p.m. on March 7, 1994.
