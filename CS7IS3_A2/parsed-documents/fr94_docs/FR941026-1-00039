FR941026-1-00039 FR941026-1-00014 IV. Procedural Matters Federal Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule does not require Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of the Interior has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although OSM does not have data on the number of coal mine operations or the number of landowners and amount of land that would be affected by this rule, data obtained from OSM Field Offices on 14 States indicates that only 3 of those States do not notify participants as to the outcome of informal conferences, and that only 6 out of 18 States for which data is available allow land in the permit area of an approved permit for which the applicant does not have right-of-entry authorization. However, to notify the participants to a conference of the outcome of that conference is a procedural type of action entailing minor economic consequences comprised of the cost of mailing notices to the participants, and to require that an applicant have right-of-entry authorization to all lands included in the permit area of an approved permit does not take any economic rights from the applicant, nor does it impose significant additional costs on the applicant. Therefore, the proposed revisions are not expected to be of economic significance. National Environmental Policy Act OSM has prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA), and has made a tentative finding that the proposed rule would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The EA is on file in the OSM Administrative Record at the address specified previously (see ADDRESSES ). An EA will be completed on the final rule and a finding made on the significance of any resulting impacts prior to promulgation of the final rule. Civil Justice Reform This proposed rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of this proposed rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? The proposed rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that the proposed rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264 (1981). B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified. This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden reduction? The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics covered and the mandates of SMCRA. D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the exhaustion of administrative remedies required?
