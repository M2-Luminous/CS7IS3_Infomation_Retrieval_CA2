The well-known politician and member of the State Duma, Sergey Stankevich, analyzes the reasons for Sergey Shakhray's resignation from the post of deputy prime minister. [Begin Stankevich recording] I am convinced -- and this is not simply because I am in the same party, I have long been convinced -- that he is one of the most professional and hard-working members of our political and government team. Any departure by him from the government is undoubtedly a loss and undoubtedly signifies a weakening of the government and, incidentally, is a loss for Russians as well, because he acts calmly, sensibly, circumspectly, clearly, and, as a rule, quite effectively in so far as results can be achieved. As far as his resignation is concerned, there is an economic component here as well as a political and a kind of group-personal component. Let's start with the economic one. This year Shakhray's department was allocated quite a considerable sum for the implementation of regional policy. Specifically, preferential government loans worth approximately seven trillion rubles were allocated for the regions of the North alone, and it was Shakhray's department that was to decide how these colossal funds were to be distributed, via which banks they would pass, and on which programs they would be spent. Before taking this very responsible decision, Shakhray inquired how this had been done previously and how trillions in government loans had been spent. I do not rule out the possibility that Shakhray's scrupulous and over-careful approach -- justifiably careful -- to this subject, could have made those who are used to not expending particular concern over very serious state loans nervous. I would like to mention the political component. I am afraid that the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] has now become the object of very jealous and malevolent attention. It looks as though someone is trying very hard to squeeze it out of the positions that it has occupied. Six key posts in the cabinet, four ministerial and two deputy prime minister posts, belonged to PRES, and, evidently, this was regarded as excessive by those political groupings that are also laying claim to a significant share of power. I do not rule out that it was their influence that was brought to bear here. Finally, as for the personal issue. Shakhray is extremely sensitive about such aspects as professional ethics, human dignity, and the dignity of a political and state figure. When a minister is appointed to a ministry of which he, as deputy prime minister is supposed to be in charge, and he is not even consulted about the matter, that is something he could not ignore.
