FR941130-2-00012 FR941130-2-00007 [Project No. 2493&hyph;006&hyph;WA] Puget Sound Power & Light Co.; Intent To Hold a Public Meeting in Snoqualmie, WA, to Discuss Staff's Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for The Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project November 23, 1994. On November 15, 1994, the Commission staff mailed the Snoqualmie Falls DEIS to the Environmental Protection Agency, resource and land management agencies, and interested organizations and individuals. This document evaluates the environmental consequences of operating the applicant's existing 42-megawatt (MW) hydroelectric project, located on the Snoqualmie River, approximately 25 miles east of Seattle in western Washington. The applicant proposes extensive structural modifications of the existing project facilities and construction of additional project facilities needed to expand the project from 42 MW to 72 MW; hydraulic capacity would increase from 2,500 to 3,620 cubic feet per second. The subject DEIS also evaluates the environmental effects of: additional flow options and supplemental measures with the applicant's proposal; a minor upgrade; decommissioning the project; and the no action alternative. The public meeting on the Snoqualmie Falls Project, which will be recorded by an official stenographer, is scheduled from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 15, 1994. The meeting will be held at the Mount Si High School in Snoqualmie, Washington. At the subject meeting, resource agency personnel and other interested persons will have the opportunity to provide oral and written comments and recommendations regarding the Snoqualmie Falls DEIS for the Commission's public record. Written comments may also be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments must be filed by January 17, 1995.
