However, it will increase many times with games in the future." Mutsuo Miyake, director of the Computer Division, Matsushita Electric Industrial, who attended a product announcement gathering in Tokyo on 11 May, expressed strong expectations with confidence in the work before him. Matsushita estimates that they have only a 15-percent share in the world, even including word processors, with 2.44 million units in 1993 on the Japanese personal computer market. For that alone, they are expecting that "latent demand is in the home" (Miyake). Toshiba director Shoichi Koga, who attended the announcement of "EZ Vision," also emphasized that "Personal computers and television are products that will be the multimedia nucleus for family use. The big task is how to fuse them." EZ Vision is a simple mechanism that connects a personal computer to a television, but the function is said to be the same as multimedia. Multimedia personal computers carrying CD-ROM are becoming the mainstream stand-alone type personal computer for home use in the United States also. They are used for various purposes, such as games and music entertainment and personal information management, and it is said that "by 2000, the world personal computer market will grow to $130 billion, and half of that will be for home use" (Eckhard Pfeiffer, president, Compaq Computer Corp.). The fusion of television and personal computers, however, means fighting between the personal computer division and the AV [audiovisual] division. In October 1993, Toshiba reorganized its personal information equipment division and video media division under the same group. The objective was "to aim at a multiplier effect for development of multimedia" (Koga). However, Matsushita, whose computer division has embarked on television personal computers, emphasizes that "the AV division will also probably put out television personal computers in the future" (Miyake) and "the early bird gets the worm." Such fighting applies also to home electronics manufacturers and computer manufacturers. An officer of IBM Japan forecasts a battle without honor, saying, "The fence between home electronics and computers will collapse with the appearance of television personal computers, and personal computer manufacturers will come to fight in the home electronics arena. To home electronics manufacturers, it probably gives the impression that their own market is being devastated by a stampede." It cannot be overlooked that behind the possibility of television and personal computer fusion are the popularity of the basic "Windows" software, which is premised on CPU (central processing unit) high performance and graphics processing, and the provision of a hardware environment such as low price and large-capacity memory storage. Sharp also trial-manufactured a personal computer incorporating a television in 1982, but it seems that the point now will be whether they can effectively propose what can be done with the fusion of television and personal computers.
