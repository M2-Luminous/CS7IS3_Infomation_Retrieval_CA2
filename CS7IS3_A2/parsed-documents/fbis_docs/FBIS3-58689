Air Strikes"] [Text] Rome, 10 Jan (ANSA) -- Italy stands ready to provide logistical support in the event of an air strike on Bosnia, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said in a radio interview to be aired Tuesday morning [11 January] but excerpts of which were released here tonight. With reference to the ongoing NATO summit in Brussels, Fabbri said that the Atlantic Alliance must be ready to intervene energetically in Bosnia if called upon to do so, however he noted that the final decision rests with the United Nations. The defense minister voiced satisfaction with the fact that the Bosnian question was being debated at the summit and recalled that NATO has on several occasions stressed it was willing to intervene with air strikes to protect humanitarian convoys and to break the Serbian stranglehold on Sarajevo. In any case, there is no contingency plan to send Italian soldiers to Bosnia as the United Nations rightfully insists that the participation of troops from neighboring nations is undesirable, Fabbri added.
