"Mutual understanding on differences has been deepened," an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a press conference, adding the atmosphere at the talks was "cordial." The officials of the two countries met Monday and Tuesday and then extended their talks for a third day Wednesday, to discuss measures to improve the U.S. access to the Japanese auto market and criteria to evaluate implementation of the measures, the MITI official said. "The Japanese side fully understands the U.S. position, including a proposal on the most critical issue," the official said. But the official declined to disclose further details of the talks, saying both parties agreed to keep quiet. He said issues that have yet to be settled during the latest talks will be put on hold until the next round of working-level talks, expected to be held in Washington in the second half of next week. The latest working-level gathering followed last week's subcabinet-level meeting in Tokyo where both parties failed to bridge difference over objective criteria, the thorniest issue under the bilateral trade "Framework" talks.
