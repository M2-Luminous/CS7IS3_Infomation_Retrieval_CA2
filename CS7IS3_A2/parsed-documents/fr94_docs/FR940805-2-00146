FR940805-2-00146 FR940805-2-00073 Appendix L, Release into the Environment of Certain Plants, be deleted in full: To see the full text of Appendix L, reference the background information and decisions on actions under the NIH Guidelines (Section I&hyph;C). OMB's ``Mandatory Information Requirements for Federal Assistance Program Announcements'' (45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the official government programs contained in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. Normally NIH lists in its announcements the number and title of affected individual programs for the guidance of the public. Because the guidance in this notice covers not only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every Federal research program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could be used, it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the public interest to attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likely require several additional pages. In addition, NIH could not be certain that every Federal program would be included as many Federal agencies, as well as private organizations, both national and international, have elected to follow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the individual program listing, NIH invites readers to direct questions to the information address above about whether individual programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance are affected. Effective Date: July 28, 1994. Harold Varmus, Director, National Institutes of Health. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19078 Filed 8&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4140&hyph;01&hyph;P
