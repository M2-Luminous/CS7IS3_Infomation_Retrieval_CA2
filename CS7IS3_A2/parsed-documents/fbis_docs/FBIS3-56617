Shushkevich said he would have stepped down of his own accord if given assurances that the new Speaker would be able to get the parliament to set the date for an early election. For his part, coordinator of the large Belarus faction uniting more than 120 deputies, Gennadiy Kozlov, told INTERFAX that on a motion from regional groups, more than 100 signatures were collected in support of demands for a no-confidence vote against Shushkevich. Kozlov says his faction is opposed to the Speaker's "gambling around the CIS collective security agreement or his interpretation of a monetary union with Russia." He said that despite his verbal declarations of support for a full scale economic union with Russia, Shushkevich "starts raising concern about a possible loss of the country's independence when it comes down to business." In his words, the key issues facing the second round of the parliamentary session include the ratification of the CIS founding agreement until January 23, the adoption of a new constitution and election law and a concept of the country's foreign policy. If the session fails to adopt the new basic law, says Kozlov, the Belarus faction will insist its main provisions such as presidency and the status of the Russian language be put for a nationwide referendum. The faction also wants a national verdict on the legitimacy of the Belovezh accords overhauling the former Soviet Union, which is a highly sensitive issue on the ground, he said. In the meantime, the morning session was focused on the ratification of the CIS Charter. State Secretary for CIS Affairs Vladimir Zalomay, presenting the paper, said its ratification "will be of huge importance for shaping the country's foreign policy and become one more step by Minsk on the way towards beefing up the Commonwealth and raising its efficiency." For his part, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, also supporting the ratification of the document, spoke of the prospects of relations with Russia and a monetary union with Moscow. He said that despite all difficulties, Belarus had an economic potential enabling it to negotiate with Russia on equal terms. He said "some of the Russian politicians who consider such a union as a handout to Belarus are mistaken." Kebich said Belarus had never lived at the cost of others. Although the union will not solve all of the country's problems, it will help create an economic environment clearing many of the stumbling blocks on the way towards bilateral cooperation, he said. The Prime Minister mounted strong criticism of opposition leader Zenon Pozniak, who accused Russia of imperialism in an article carried by the parliament-sponsored newspaper, NARODNAYA GAZETA. Pozniak called Russia "a country of God's fools building its relations with other states on the traditions of Mongol hordes." For his part, Kebich said that an overwhelming majority of Belarusians were opposed to the country's self-isolation preferring a union with Russia instead. Shushkevich himself in a televised interview on Monday said that a monetary union with Moscow could help towards a dramatic improvement in the country's economic plight. At the same time, he warned that such a union should not be seen as a panacea against all troubles. "It is up to us, not Russia, to reform the country's economy," Shushkevich said. In his view, to make the union work, the two countries must establish equal prices for fuel and raw materials and sign a custom union. On the possibility of forming his own party, Shushkevich made it clear he had pondered over the problem but there was no need for one at the moment. "Some politicians in Russia formed their own parties, but they did so in the run up to general elections," he said. Shushkevich stressed that he would be "physically unable" to lead a party because of the huge amount of work he was having to cope with as Parliamentary Chairman. It is now known that the Belarusian parliament has ratified the CIS charter by a vote of 238 votes for and 7 against. Opposition leader Zenon Pozniak said his faction had abstained.
