"The agreement is the result of close consultation and coordination between South Korea and the international community," said a Foreign Ministry official. The DPRK agreed to allow the IAEA to conduct inspections on all seven reported nuclear facilities at a working-level contact in Vienna Tuesday. But the question of inspecting two unreported nuclear facilities is still pending, presumably for the two sides to discuss later, according to reports reaching here Wednesday. The two sides reached the agreement after two months of see-saw negotiations to resume inspections which was stalled since February last year. The South Korean official said that since the agreement "leaves unsettled the question of special inspections of two major suspected sites, the international community will continue its efforts to resolve this matter." The IAEA is expected to send a team of inspectors to Pyongyang before February 21, the date on which the IAEA convenes a board of governors meeting. Meanwhile, the DPRK and the United States reportedly resumed working level meeting in New York Tuesday to negotiate follow-up measures on IAEA inspections.
