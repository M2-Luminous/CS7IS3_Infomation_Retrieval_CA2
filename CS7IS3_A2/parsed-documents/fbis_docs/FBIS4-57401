FBIS4-57401 "drlat095_a_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 15 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Minister on Shortage of Medicines Minister on Shortage of Medicines FL1605181394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 15 May 94 FL1605181394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Text] Between the last half of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, Havana has experienced the greatest shortage of medicines ever remembered by health authorities. This was stated on 15 May by Public Health Minister Julio Teja in referring to the need for and advantages of the medicine distribution program: [Begin Teja recording] We continue hoping to find the ideal, perfect method where there is an explanation for everything and everyone understands everything. What are the risks we run? The products and raw materials are arriving now, following the efforts made by the government, and we are able to increase the production of medicines a bit -- not to a level that tomorrow will provide medicines of every type, but enough to conduct a recovery process. Thus, the term, even in GRANMA, is recovery. If we do not implement these measures now, we would have used up these medicines we are now getting; by mid- year, when we would have to implement the plan, we would have none because they would have once more ended in the black market. That is the reality. In other words, medicines are ending up in the hands of three or four people. We cannot engage in a criminal act and hold back medicine until we have the perfect program. We have waited enough. We have worked with Havana hospitals to ensure the supply of the priority medicines. I say this because I believe that one of the things we have to do is to make the doctors understand. That is the truth. The document states that this is the opinion of the government and party leadership. The struggle has to be won with the health workers, the doctors, pharmacists, everyone in that field. We believe that this battle is being won. I want you to know that it is not only the doctor issuing unwarranted prescriptions, knowing full well that the medicine is not available. There was the question put by Comrade [Carlos] Lage about the doctor who comes -- I was told this by several professors and doctors -- to the neighborhood and tells everyone that beginning tomorrow, they can forget asking for prescriptions because he can only give prescriptions to be filled in the area where he lives, 42 km away. This is a way of damaging the Revolution. We have to work against this. We have asked the help of the party and the unions. We have visited every hospital. Briefings have been given to every doctor in the Armed Forces, in every military unit. The Interior Ministry has hosted meetings with doctors who work in prisons, jails, etc. We have tried to inform most. As the banner reads: We will continue to conduct classes and reevaluation tests. However, this is a battle. This is combat. We have to gain awareness and support; if we had plenty of everything, these measures would not be necessary. [end recording] Health Minister Julio Teja participated in the meeting of presidents of the People's Councils of Havana. Politburo members Carlos Lage and Ricardo Alarcon are also attending the meeting. Transportation, local industries, and telephone industry issues are also slated for discussion.
