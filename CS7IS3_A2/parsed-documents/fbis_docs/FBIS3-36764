Gorbachev knew that Boris Yeltsin, as President of the Russian Federation, had no intention of signing the Union Treaty on August 20, 1991, and that he was about to liquidate union structures, Shenin told the Military Collegium of Russia's Supreme Court on Tuesday. According to the former Central Committee member, Gorbachev informed him of this in a telephone conversation on July 29, 1991. "The Soviet Union's disintegration could have been prevented had Gorbachev imposed a state of emergency himself, instead of letting others do it," Shenin said. However Gorbachev preferred to sit it out in Foros, and refused to be flown to Moscow, Shenin declared. According to Shenin, Gorbachev had nothing against the imposition of a state of emergency. "The wrong people are now charged with high treason," he said. The court adjourned until Friday morning.
