FR941012-1-00035 FR941012-1-00006 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 1 [CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93; FCC 94&hyph;211] Informal Complaints AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopted this Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) to make minor modifications to its procedural rules governing informal complaints against common carriers and to seek comment on the proposed rules. The NPRM proposes rules that would modify certain filing and notice requirements and clarifies the role of carriers in informal complaint proceedings. These proposals are intended to help the general public in preparing written informal complaints, improve the procedure by which informal complaints are handled by the staff, harness staff resources to resolve informal complaints more efficiently, and eliminate unnecessary filings of formal complaints prior to the disposition of informal complaints. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before October 24, 1994, and replies must be filed on November 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roger J. Hertz, Enforcement Division, Common Carrier Bureau, (202) 418&hyph;0960. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93 (FCC 94&hyph;211), adopted August 11, 1994, and released September 2, 1994. The NPRM is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Room 239, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, D.C. The complete text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcript Service, Inc., 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, D.C. 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. On August 11, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in CC Docket No. 94&hyph;93 (released September 2, 1994: FCC 94&hyph;211) in order to make minor modifications to our procedural rules governing informal complaints against carriers. 2. The NPRM proposes to amend ยง1.716 to clarify that informal complaints may be filed against common carriers for violations of the Commission's rules or orders as well as the Communications Act. This proposal is intended to conform ยง1.716 to Section 208 of the Communications Act. The NPRM also proposes to amend ยง1.716 to require specifically that informal complaints include factual allegations that, if assumed to be true, would support a finding that the subject carrier has violated a provision of the Communications Act or Commission rules or orders. This proposal should provide helpful guidance to the general public in preparing written informal complaints, enable FCC staff to assess the merits of complaints more quickly, and aid carriers in their efforts to answer or satisfy informal complaints.
