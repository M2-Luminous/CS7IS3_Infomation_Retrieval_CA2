[Hammam] Several months have passed since the Yemeni crisis started and we are working with all the parties in Yemen to contain the situation and to prevent it from erupting We want to continue with the process of protecting Yemeni unity and with implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document prepared by all the Yemeni parties that took part in the dialogue committee. The document sets the single course to be pursed by Yemen toward building the unified state the Yemenis want. There are incidents along this course, including the military clash in 'Imran, about 60 kms to the north of Sanaa. It goes without saying that the tension in this crisis is bound to put the ordinary citizen and the Yemeni Armed Forces on edge because they care about Yemen and are worried about their country's future. Anxiety is normal is such crises. But the use of the Yemeni Armed Forces in a political contest, even if this contest reaches the level of struggle, is impermissible and brings many dangers to Yemen, its people, territories, unity, present, and future. I believe that the Yemeni leaders are aware of these dangers. I also believe that they are aware of the dangers of involving the Yemeni armed forces in this partisan political competition that arose because of differences in views over the ways to achieve a unified state. We are clearly and firmly drawing their attention to these dangers. [Al-Aswad] Ambassador Hammam, you have met with the Yemeni leaders, particularly President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid. What are your impressions from these meetings and what are the obstacles impeding the implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document? [Hammam] My impression is that all the leaders are aware of the dangers, are keen on Yemen's unity, and have the desire to implement the Pledge and Accord Document. But there are different views over the manner of implementation and of the crisis factors. This is normal. But involving the Yemeni Armed Forces or using them in this political competition is impermissible and should not be undertaken. This involvement is a very grave matter. I met with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Aden and also met with 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al- Ghani, member of the Presidential Council. We discussed the means of containing the current situation and of regarding the armed clash between two Yemeni Armed Forces' units in 'Imran as an isolated incident that we should not focus on. We should not forget the main course we have started, namely the implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document and protection of Yemen's unity, territorial integrity, and the safety of its people. I believe that all the Yemeni leaders are fully aware of this fact. I find that all of them have good intentions and I hope that this will get us what we want, God willing. [Al-Aswad] You mentioned the broad context of the agreement but how can this be transformed into action and how can Yemen emerge from its current crisis? [Hammam] The problem, as is the case the world over, is how to unite the state's agencies and institutions that are entrusted with implementing the Pledge and Accord Document and how to keep the Yemeni Armed Forces from being involved in this political conflict. Struggle for power is normal and happens in many countries, but Yemeni unity is a great deed and achievement and cherished by all Yemenis and Arabs. Maintaining this unity requires further patience and effort. It is no small venture that can be completed overnight; it is a great task that necessarily faces problems and impediments. It is wise and useful that we be patient and take care in finding solutions for them. [Al-Aswad] How do the brothers in Yemen view Egypt's clear role in the efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis and bring a fraternal united Yemen to the shore of safety? [Hammam] What I encounter and hear here from officials and average citizens I meet is a sincere and conscious welcome for Egypt's efforts and role because we are sincerely and seriously working to preserve Yemen's security, interest, and independence. I believe they fully realize Egypt's sincere intention and President Mubarak's personal interest in, and regular follow-up of, what happens in Yemen. Therefore, President Mubarak gave instructions for me to return to Yemen on the 28th [April]. I had returned to Cairo for only a couple of days, but the flare-up of the military situation between two units in 'Imran prompted President Mubarak to return me to Yemen at once so that I could follow up the situation, propose, according to his directives, possible solutions to contain this marginal crisis, the crisis of the military clash, and pursue the path to settle the Yemeni crisis through objective solutions satisfactory to all parties.
