The IAEA has "not concluded that the DPRK has one or more nuclear weapons, and we have not even concluded that their nuclear program is used for non-peaceful purposes," Blix said. After briefing the Security Council and meeting with the U.N. secretary-general on the nuclear issue in the DPRK, the IAEA director-general told reporters that the IAEA is not "saying that material is diverted, material has been used for plutonium production or indeed for bomb making." On the disputed issue of nuclear rods discharge at the DPRK's five-megawatt reactor, the IAEA chief said that his agency is able to monitor the present situation, but is running into obstacles in determining whether the material had been diverted in the past as the DPRK has discharged most of the fuel in the reactor. According to a press release issued here today by the DPRK permanent mission to the U.N., a spokesman for DPRK's General Department of Atomic Energy said in a statement on June 2, "We are doing the core refueling operations in such a manner that we fully preserve technical possibility for later measurement of such fuel rods as requested by the Agency (IAEA) in a token of good faith."
