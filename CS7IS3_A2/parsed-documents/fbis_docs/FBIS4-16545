The Russian interpretation of the present situation and a new initiative from Russia to settle the crisis was set out in an exclusive interview to "Itogi" given by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who returned to Moscow from Belgrade several hours ago. [Svetlichnyy] Are we talking about a sticking plaster job or some new initiatives from Russia? [Kozyrev] We are talking about an initiative from Russia, which, unfortunately does resemble a sticking plaster job, when, after provocations from a Muslim warring group in Gorazde, the Serbs started using heavy artillery against the town, including the site where UN observers were deployed. The next step toward worsening the situation was made by NATO, which, in an equally inappropriate and uncalculated manner, and I would say, with the same level of responsibility as the warring sides, carried out two air strikes, which was obviously tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. It is possible that the fighters there were just waiting for something like that to happen in order to have a free hand and escape from the control of the political leadership. And so for a week Vitaliy Churkin -- but I must add that he was together with Charles Redman, the U.S. special envoy...[pauses] The French are now also actively involved. We are maintaining constant contact with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Fortunately, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was, in essence, willing to accept the range of measures that we had proposed. This is an initiative by President Yeltsin -- I mean my trip to see Slobodan Milosevic. And the range of measures has been precisely determined and coordinated. They include the lifting of the blockade of Gorazde. Then, there must be an agreement on the cessation of hostile actions along the entire front line to avoid having to jump from one crisis to another -- Sarajevo today, Gorazde tomorrow, and there will be plenty of other towns after tomorrow -- so, an agreement on a cease-fire along the entire front line. This will create a situation conducive to further negotiations on a political settlement. Therefore, Russia will put all its political weight in favor of this option. But I would like to note that every step by the Serb side will be accompanied by appropriate, decisive pressure on our part about the lifting of sanctions. And both this plan, the process and the plan to lift the sanctions are fully coordinated and are well known. And I think that our Western partners have a better understanding of the need for such a consistent approach. [Svetlichnyy] This week, both in the State Duma and in various political circles here in Moscow, there has been discussion concerning Russia not having been informed about the bombing. Could you perhaps say now that such actions on the part of NATO, without prior notification to the Russian side, are completely ruled out? And the second question, as I said, after Russia was not informed, in Bosnia and in Yugoslavia, some circles, generally speaking, started to adopt a pretty skeptical attitude toward the role of Russia. Has this action also not had an effect on diminishing Russia's influence in this conflict? [Kozyrev] Well, first, I want to reply that we are acting in close contact with the State Duma and the Federation Council. Yesterday, at our request, and as a result of joint work, both Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, and State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin sent a message to the leaders of the parliaments of Yugoslavia, both of Serbia and of the Bosnian Serbs. The Russian Orthodox Church also put forward an initiative of this kind. So, I think that Russia has in fact become almost the only powerful player on this stage that is not stained with irresponsible actions, and it is for this reason that Vitaliy Churkin is right there where the issue is being decided. Now, with regard to notification about the strikes, then on this occasion we were au fait with events. We are aware that Yasushi Akashi, the deputy UN secretary general, who is managing the operation in Bosnia had asked for air support -- yesterday at about 1700, after the Bosnian Serbs -- and this must be made clear -- mounted another artillery attack on Gorazde -- which is of course impermissible -- and after about 150 UN servicemen found themselves blockaded. Things went so depressingly far that in Sarajevo area the Serbs, Serb fighters threatened our subunit of Russian peacekeepers with weapons. In other words, I think this shows with utmost clarity the degree of irresponsibility of Serb fighters. But as a result of these consultations we were able to persuade both the United Nations and our NATO partners to stay cool this time. After all, consultations are needed not simply to say: Well, bomb them if you like, provided you have consulted us. Consultations are needed in order to exhaust all possibilities. If NATO has no other alternative but to send a fighter aircraft or a bomber, we, rather, have a possibility -- in any case, we do not mind taking a flight in the evening in order to have night talks with the political leadership and to try to find a different solution, after all. Well, each has his own way, but that is exactly why we say that Russia must be consulted and that we should act together.
