Judy Lotz met two of them, who declared they will disobey the orders: [Begin recording] [Lotz] What does your order say, David? [David Axelrod] My order says that I may not enter Hebron and Qiryat Arba' for three months, starting yesterday. [Lotz] Did you have to turn in your gun? [Axelrod] I did not receive this order, but I heard it exists. [Lotz] Did they come to take away your gun? [Axelrod] They left notice that I should turn it in. [Lotz] Did you? [Axelrod] I did not, and I have no such intention. [Lotz] You are violating the law, are you not? [Axelrod] Am I? Forsaking Jews to be murdered is a violation of our beliefs. [Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana] I do not believe people will turn in their guns. I find this hard to believe. I believe people will rather sit in jail. [Lotz] Will you turn in your gun? [Kahana] I will turn in nothing. I find these orders insignificant. They are illegal, immoral, and unreasonable. [Lotz] Will you travel to Hebron and Nabulus, in defiance of the orders? [Kahana] I will go anywhere I please in this country. [end recording] The police arrested today Eyal Noqed, another Kakh activist, who is one of the five the police are seeking to place under administrative detention. Our police affairs correspondent Uri Kohen-Aharonov has learned that Noqed was captured in an apartment in Ra'anana, following intelligence information. Currently, there are two Kakh members in police detention. Qiryat Arba' residents fear that exile orders will be issued this evening.
