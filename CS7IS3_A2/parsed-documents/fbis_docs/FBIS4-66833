This process will subsidize production opportunities for small projects and provide new job opportunities, in order to contribute to a solution for the unemployment problem. This was stated by Dr. Husayn al-Jamal, the Social Fund's secretary general, who pointed out that the initiatives include lowering the interest rates on loans for new youth projects to 9 percent instead of 10 percent. These are projects financed by the Arab Fund, for which the sum of 550 million Egyptian pounds has been allocated. So far, 160 million pounds of this amount have been used, with 390 million pounds remaining. This is being done through five national and private banks. Negotiations are being conducted with the World Bank to lower the interest rates that are currently being applied to the manufacturing community's loans. This rate is currently 10 percent, with 68 million pounds allocated through three banks. About 32 million pounds have been used, benefitting 30,000 individuals. In an agreement between the fund and the Ministry of Social Affairs, it was decided to allocate 1 million pounds to establish a joint center, for the purpose of developing products, improving their quality, and promoting marketing. The Social Fund's secretary-general added that in view of the youth's difficulty in obtaining information and determining the best investment opportunities within industrial, engineering, agricultural, agricultural processing, services, and handicraft fields, guidance programs have been prepared for them. This was done after it became evident that 80 percent of the projects were for the readymade clothes industry, tricot, spinning, and weaving. The committee has finished preparing 65 programs, embracing land survey, materials, labor, employment expenditures, and the economics and profitability of the project. A committee will also be formed, composed of Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim Sulayman, the minister of state for new urban communities, and Zafir al-Bashri, vice president of the National Investment Bank, to draft implementation regulations to transfer ownership of units in new cities and urban communities to young people at token costs and on long term installment payments of up to 30 years, similar to housing projects. Dr. Husayn al-Jamal indicated that the maximum loan for an individual project ranges between 35,000 and 50,000 pounds. If there are multiple partners, the loan could go to 200,000 pounds, in order to ensure that it would cover the project's costs of purchasing equipment, machinery, and production requirements. The secretary-general said that a republican decree has been issued to exempt small projects from paying taxes on commercial profits during the period of the loan, for a maximum of five years. To solve the problems of marketing the products of young graduates and craftsmen, the Executive Committee of the Social Fund, chaired by Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy prime minister and minister of planning, decided in its recent meeting on a strategy of marketing subsidies to end the problems that small projects face in participating in local and international exhibitions. It was also decided to establish permanent exhibitions and create a center of marketing studies for small projects. This center would include an information unit, a unit for marketing studies and research, and a quality improvement unit. An agreement has also been reached with governmental organizations to help the youth in marketing their small projects' products by giving priority to their purchase.
