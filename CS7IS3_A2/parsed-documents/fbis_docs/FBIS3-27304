The poll, prepared in time for today's Legislative Council [Legco] debate on the bill, casts doubt on claims by the Governor to have widespread support for his political reforms. Conducted on Monday and released yesterday, the poll also shows an overwhelming majority of people -- 78.8 per cent -- either know "very little" or nothing at all about the bill before Legco today. According to the poll, a small majority of people support the retention of ex-officio seats in the Legislative Council for members of the Urban and Regional Councils and the district boards. Yesterday the Executive Council gave the go-ahead for the publication of the second and more controversial stage of the political reform legislation. The bill, designed to widen the franchise, will be gazetted on Friday. The first stage of the reforms, covering the less contentious issues, paves the way for the lowering of the voting age to 18, the scrapping of appointed seats on the district boards and the establishment of the single-seat single-vote system for the municipal and Legislative Council elections. This is expected to be passed into law today. Legislators are braced for a marathon debate, likely to last late into the night. The Government is confident that any attempt by conservative forces to derail the bill will be defeated. According to today's Oriental Daily News [TUNG FANG JIH PAO], 256 district board councillors out of a total of 411 are pressing the Governor to withdraw the bill from Legco. Despite the vigour of the politicians' interest, the Eastern Express poll, undertaken by the Social Sciences Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong, shows most people have either lost interest, or have never been interested in the political reforms. Only 12.1 percent said they were either very clear or resonably clear about what was going on. The survey shows that neither of the amendments proposed by Liberal Party and the United Democrats has been well received by public. Only 21 percent of those questioned agreed with the Liberal Party's amendment that arrangements for the 1995 Legco election should not be included in the bill, compared with 35.9 percent who did not agree. Only 32 percent supported the United Democrats' amendment to abolish all appointed or ex-officio seats of the Regional Council and district boards, compared with 38.8 percent who did not. There was an even split of opinion over the amendment raised by one legislator, Eric Li, who favoured a fixed ratio of one appointed seat to every three elected seats in the Urban and Regional councils and district boards. Fractionally more people supported than opposed the tabling and passage of the original version of the reform bill as proposed by Patten in autumn 1992 -- 27.6 percent against 26.9 percent. According to Robert Chung, the research officer in charge of the survey, none of the bill's proposals commanded the support of more than half of those questioned. "It shows an overwhelming indifference by the public with what's going on between Beijing and the Governor," Chung said. "Most of those interviewed have either shown no interest or no opinion at all." The poll provides further evidence of an erosion in public support for political reform compared with the high ratings for it seen after the measures were introduced by the Governor in 1992. The Executive Council [Exco] yesterday endorsed the disclosure tomorrow of the Foreign Office's account of the 17 rounds of fruitless talks with China on political reform. The disclosure will take the form of a United Kingdom White Paper. Yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), said China had never objected to the publication but stressed that it had to be done through diplomatic channels. Although Exco has approved publication, the final decision rests with Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary. There has been disagreement over whether the second political bill should be published in their original form or watered down as an olive branch to China.
