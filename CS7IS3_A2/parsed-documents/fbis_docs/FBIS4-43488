The forecasts then were for growth of just over 1 per cent and inflation of about 4 per cent at the end of 1993. That was not the worst that forecasters have ever achieved. To be fair, they got the nominal growth of output right, but the inflation-output split wrong. But it has reinforced the intention I already had, to treat forecasts with considerable caution and not to become too mesmerised by them. We have actually seen in the past 12 months a strong recovery, with a better split between real growth and inflation and an earlier fall in unemployment than would have been expected, based on British experiences in earlier recessions. I do realise there are still concerns in some quarters that we in Britain will throw away all these hard-fought gains again and that yet another recovery will not be sustained. I can assure you that as far as the Government is concerned, we will do no such thing. We have not created the conditions for the strongest recovery in Europe in order to throw it away by creating yet another boom followed by a bust. I believe our economy is now strong enough to sustain the growth rates that everyone knows I would like to see. But the concerns are only too understandable, given our economic history since the war. I believe that we can avoid these problems of the past. Tonight I would like to explain why I am confident history will not repeat itself and why I see the prospect of recovery being sustained. The threats are all too clear. In my opinion, three major problems have derailed recoveries in the past: unsustainable public borrowing, which eventually required a sharp tightening of fiscal policy, a failure to keep inflation under control and prevent recovery turning into boom, with much the same result; problems on the supply side, reflected in bottlenecks, shortages of capacity and skilled labour, and burgeoning current account deficits. If I am right and if history need not repeat itself, we have to face and to avoid all these risks in the present upturn. First, public finance. The public finances were put on a sustainable footing in the 1993 budgets. The issue now is to stick to that prospectus and, above all, to maintain tight control of public expenditure. I set out the limits for the "new control totals" in my Budget. Those totals are ceilings, and my medium-term aim is to see general Government expenditure falling below 40 per cent of GDP once again. The new control total approach allows us to keep much better control of public expenditure than we used to as the economy recovers. Low expenditure is the key to lower taxes. We will cut taxes again, but only when we can afford to do so and not before. The public are usually more sensible than politicians or the press. They will not put their confidence in a government that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control. I am also determined that my second spectre of inflation does not return to haunt us. Three times in our recent history a burst in inflation has destroyed a recovery and taken us back to deep recession. The effects of inflation are insidious and affect us all. We should not lose sight of them. Inflation breeds uncertainty. And uncertainty distorts business decisions, discourages investment and unsettles savers. That means a less efficient economy, less investment and less prosperity. Inflation is a silent thief that robs the elderly and cheats the saver. Low inflation is not an optional extra. It is the necessary condition for the steady and sustained growth that I want to see in the 1990s and beyond. I often hear, sometimes from people in the City, the fear that politicians might still secretly hanker after a little inflation. After all, a little inflation leads to higher interest rates for savers, higher wages for workers and higher house prices for home- owners. What a temptation to ministers who need a "feel good" factor to go with the recovery. Speaking as a politician, I say that would be very bad politics. A little more inflation is simply not an option for this Government. A little more inflation will not make savers, workers or home-owners feel good for long. A fraudulent inflationary "feel good" would soon turn to "feel very bad" as the bust followed the boom. As I have already said, our masters, the public, are usually more sensible than their politicians or the press. They feel good when they have recovery that is going to last, with low inflation. I shall continue to set monetary policy to keep underlying inflation within the 1-4 per cent range, and to reduce it to the lower half of that band by the end of the present Parliament. I decided that my prospects of success in achieving that target could only be enhanced by a properly informed, open debate about the causes of inflation, and the policy measures required to control it. In my opinion, the most important decision I have made in monetary policy so far has not been either of my interest-rate moves, but the decision to publish the minutes of my monthly meetings with Eddie George, the Bank Governor. You will see it every month, with only a short lag to allow the Bank time to carry out any operations I decide on. On top of the Bank's quarterly inflation report, and the point- by-point explanations of interest-rate changes that we have also introduced in the past couple of years, that will add to the credibility of our monetary policy. I have deliberately created a system of decision-taking about interest rates in this country that is one of the most open and transparent in the world. I have given todays politicians and tomorrows politicians no choice but to pursue the path of low inflation to which we are so clearly publicly committed. My Lord Mayor, long-term bond yields have been rising all around the world this year, but they have risen by more in the UK than in most countries. But, the markets seem to be schizophrenic. They appear to believe I am going to put up interest rates, but they also believe that inflation will rise out of its target range regardless. The traders and investors who are demanding these high yields seem to be paying no attention to the analysts in the next office, most of whom are forecasting inflation to stay on target. I think it is the analysts who are right. And I am determined to prove that to the traders, and to others such as wage bargainers whose suspicions of higher inflation might themselves add to inflationary pressures. I do not pretend that the increase in credibility will happen instantly. It will require proof that I can justify any decision I make on objective economic grounds alone. But the changes I have made to the conduct of monetary policy will help to ensure that nobody will be able to sell out our strong anti-inflation strategy. But though low inflation and sound public finances are necessary, they are not sufficient conditions to achieve what we really want to see. My aim is a long period of healthy, balanced growth, which creates jobs and sees gradually higher living standards for all. Our ability to sustain satisfactory growth rates will depend on supply-side considerations. We have to ensure that increases in demand are translated into more growth, not more inflation. That means tackling our third historic failure and eliminating the skills shortages and bottlenecks that have blocked progress in the past. It Is now a commonplace that the world is becoming an ever more competitive place. Given the pace of change in technology and business organisation, none of us can predict, with any confidence, the new industries of the future, nor where the new jobs will come from, nor what skills will be required to fill them. The most successful economies will be those that respond quickest and most wholeheartedly to new markets and new competition. Within economies, the most competitive companies, and the most successful individuals, will be the most flexible and adaptable. I believe this recovery will last because we are adding to the measures that created a modern dynamic economy in the 1980s, and are creating an ever more adaptable, better, real economy for the 1990s. My Lord Mayor, this Government believes in the need for ongoing improvements to the supply side of the economy. This is why we place so much importance on the recent White Paper on competitiveness. One area that I believe is particularly important to the future strength of our economy is education and training. The UK entered this recovery with a workforce that is being far better educated than in the recent past. Thanks to the supply-side reforms, Britain is also well placed to see growth this time balanced between consumer demand, investment, and exports. There has already been strong growth in consumer demand and retail sales are at record levels. But there are now an increasing number of signs that this pick-up in consumer spending is being supported by exports and investment. Export growth is proving resilient to recession in continental Europe. And exports to non-EC countries are on a firm upward trend. Investment activity has also picked up, with the modest recovery seen in the second half of last year being sustained this year. Forward-looking surveys show that this upturn in investment looks set to continue. But the volume of investment is not of itself the key indicator. Structural policy must aim to create the conditions for profitable investment, and I would like to see the improvements in capital productivity seen in the 1980s built upon in the 1990s. More effective use of capital and labour will help us unplug the blockages that have resulted in high inflation and balance of payments problems, and ultimately derailed the economic recovery. My Lord Mayor, in some ways, the most heartening feature of this year is that businesses have recovered their self-confidence. The ingredients and policies are in place for lasting success. That lasting success means our firms outcompeting and outfighting those of our friends and trading partners in Europe and elsewhere.
