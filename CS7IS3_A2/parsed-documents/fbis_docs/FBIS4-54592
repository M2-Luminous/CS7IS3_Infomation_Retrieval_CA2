Under the amendment political groupings are forbidden to run businesses. The dominant role in funding political parties and movements will be played by the state which will allocate 162 million crowns (about $5.4 million) annually from its budget providing the Senate is not filled. If it is filled, state subsidies will be 40 million crowns (about $1.3 million) lower. In addition to this, parties and movements can acquire money through membership fees, from the lease of movable property and real estate, from loans, credits and gifts. Reports on the financial management of political parties and movements, submitted to parliament and the Supreme Inspection Office annually by April 1, will include a list of gifts, their amounts and donors. If the value of a gift or the sum of the gifts' values from one donor exceeds 100,000 Czech crowns (about $3,333) a year then parties and movements must include basic personal data on the donor.
