FBIS3-34987 "drnes033dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 Palestinian Affairs PLO Radio Urges Unity, `Collective Work' JN1602200294 Baghdad Voice of the PLO in Arabic 1700 GMT 16 Feb 94 JN1602200294 Baghdad Voice of the PLO Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Text] Brothers: The Palestinian arena is rife with fabricated defects and contradictions, as if those who paint these pictures of future disputes are trying to depict in advance the situation that will prevail in the territory from which the Israeli enemy will withdraw. The Mosad has begun to assassinate nationalist symbols and strugglers in the occupied territories, just like the racist regime did in the South Africa by assassinating the struggler (?Hanker), and by sparking bloody confrontations that claimed the lives of thousands of blacks. The same experience is being repeated on Palestinian territory. The occupation could not spark bloody disputes between the resistance factions, so it resorted to assassinations. Thus, Palestinian strugglers of all the revolution's factions were subjected to killing and detention, as happened in Gaza and the West Bank against the strugglers of Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and other factions. The Israeli occupation also aimed at creating chaos and lack of security on the eve of the supposed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and Jericho on 13 December. However, when these attempts failed, it postponed withdrawal and started to maliciously sow disputes and provoke sensitivities, blowing them out of proportion. Some of us have fallen victim to this black propaganda. Also, international and hostile press contributed to the great exaggeration of Palestinian developments, thus predicting an imminent, devastating explosion in the territory from which the enemy will withdraw. Thus, this propaganda has robbed many people of their feelings of joy and created a black cloud of fear and anxiety hanging over their heads. This led to internal developments and nationalist and factional disputes, using the media and press as an arena to spread these unjustifiable differences. The people's fears of a possible loss of security and safety were doubled. Thus, we heard more outcries and warnings of what is to come. Newspapers became full of articles, and the Palestinian leadership was severely criticized, without anything happening so far. The awareness of the masses is required, so that the masses will get prepared for a national self-reconciliation after a long expatriation during the occupation. Also, the leadership cadres will prepare for this mission through their deep understanding of the nature of the next stage, which requires disciplined conduct, calmness, and a show of self-confidence and satisfaction with the future mission. This way the masses will be satisfied and feel safe and secure. We are all aware that the Israeli occupation is [words indistinct] and caused us to starve and robbed us of the freedom of expression and speech. Its removal means the end of these diseases that spread because of the occupation on our Palestinian territory for many years. The removal of the occupation from part of our territory must restore us to our natural situation and prompt us to work seriously and freely to build a free Palestinian society in the future. This assured conduct is a test of the awareness of the factions, cadres, and masses, which should not now run after authority, but after enhancing cooperation between everybody to launch reconstruction. This is because the authority has not yet come. The traces of occupation are still visible before our own eyes. We advise every policeman and security officer to be a faithful servant of the people's security and to safeguard their property and protect their freedom of expression. The masses, through the conduct of the policemen and the security, should remove from their heads the notion that those people are coming to impose a coercive order. They should know, right from the very beginning, that those people have come to maintain humanitarian relations between the people and to provide a suitable climate to help the masses return to their normal life, which they have been denied for a long time. Thus, the people will cooperate and start holding celebrations, meetings, seminars, set up social, cultural and economic institutions, and do everything that one does in a stable community. This is the responsibility of every member of any faction, movement, or political party, because democracy cannot thrive, as an expression of human rights and freedom, unless all Palestinian organizations have good relations between each other and with the masses in general. The factions should not cause disputes, create chaos, or dig up the past that causes factional, family, or religious disputes. This will make every citizen feel that the liberated homeland is his to live in, in freedom, security, and stability. We are now facing an experiment. The world is watching and will judge it by our good or bad performance and administration of the liberated territory. The reaction of the friendly world, or that which gives aid, will be good or bad in line with our good administration and the national relations that we weave between the citizens and the resistance factions in their relations between each other and their performance of national duties on the ground. No community is free of social, political, or economic problems. However, advanced communities study these problems objectively and try to resolve them through collective work after identifying successful solutions. Rival groups steer clear of disputes and clashes and provoking regional problems so that the national authority agencies and the resistance factions can perform their duties satisfactorily without clashing with the masses and serve the masses' daily interests faithfully and honestly. Our past hard experience has disheartened us. In spite of the many negative manifestations that have surfaced in Palestinian society, it would be better for us if we go back to what is part of our nature, in terms of national cohesion, collective action, and the care we give to serve the masses and offer them all they need during this transition period where an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety prevails, an atmopshere the enemy seeks to spread throughout the entire Arab region. The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for the entire Arab region. The Palestinian cause is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and its developments directly reflect on the Arab state of affairs. We should be a good example in the way we behave and perform when building our future society. We recommend, as of now, the formation of voluntary groups for building in every walk of life. Let us also give women a major part in social and economic work. Women should learn in economic, social, and cultural institutions. We should also open for them training schools so that they become qualified to work, participate, and share. Had there been groups in the camps and quarters to carry out a comprehensive survey of the people's needs and requirements, it would have been possible to expedite economic development. We also must teach young people, find jobs for them, and train them in all cultural, social, and economic fields. Let a school be opened every day so these young people can join to make our society one that is replete with qualified people who can build. As the saying goes: The voice of work is stronger than the vociferation of words. We must take into consideration that this stage is a transition stage, during which we will notice some confusion between criticism and the freedom of speech, slander, and defamation; between chauvinism and mature political affiliation; and between those who are content with just raising national unity slogans and those who work to translate these slogan into facts. We also note that confusion will take place between what is possible, now, in the transition period and what is not, between the phased objectives and the general strategic objectives. We do not have a magic wand that achieves for us all that we want. We must constantly struggle to realize small achievements which add up day after day and one year after the other. We must not search for positions now. We should resort to work, as it is what will lead us to the positions and locations that befit us. We are not now at the stage of dividing the bounty, as some who have little experience imagine. We now are in the process of taking stock of our capabilities, of developing them, and having them assume their practical tasks within the framework of an arduous struggle where means and methods will differ to attain our national objectives. The enemy, with all the evil it represents, is still present among us with all the sufferings, the signs of backwardness, and social ills it has left behind. We should eliminate all these in time through our persistent work and our social and political maturity. We must not punish those who committed mistakes. We must seek to rehabilitate and redress them, and make them become good citizens. We also must nurture the spirit of cooperation among all the militant forces, without exception, and act as tutors and counsellors, forgive mistakes, and tackle them with peaceful means, devoid of hatred and rancor. The homeland is for all and all have participated in its liberation. Therefore, they should participate in building it.
