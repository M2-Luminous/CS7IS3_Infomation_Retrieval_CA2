Certainly we have made great strides in this direction and have realized achievements that enable us to renew confidence in our future and to confront the challenges with the hoped-for level of national solidarity. [passage omitted] Mr. Speaker, deputies: The delicate phase through which Lebanon is passing requires the highest degrees of vigilance and solidarity. We are facing fateful challenges that are first and foremost connected to liberating our land from the Israeli occupation and standing on a equal footing with the states joining us in the race toward the future in the Middle East. Therefore, I find myself obliged before your honorable chamber to underline the following points: 1. The liberation of our land from Israeli occupation is not subject to any kind of diplomatic debate. Therefore, it is not subject to bargaining with any regional or international body. Lebanon views the negotiations held in this connection as a means to achieve its liberation and not as an objective in itself to be used to cow Lebanon to go along with the Israeli objectives of controlling our land, water, and resources. In the past few weeks Lebanon has received several messages through security, diplomatic, and media avenues. It has been and is still being subjected to repeated Israeli attacks aimed at undermine its national strength and jeopardizing its relations with its big sister Syria. However, Lebanon can only take stances chosen by the people, stances compatible with its sovereignty, dignity, and its rights to land and resources. I must stress here--in the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies--that Lebanon will not submit to Israeli pressures, regardless of their intensity. It reserves the right to use all means to liberate its land and impose its legitimate authority over all its territory. The Lebanese Government has shouldered its national responsibility in protecting Lebanon's principles on the issue of liberation. It reemphasizes today its rejection of any approach intended to make the Lebanese state a policeman for Israeli occupation, nor will we allow Israel to shrug off its responsibility for the occupation by clashing with the resistance, which is the natural outcome of the continuation of the occupation. All Lebanese have behaved with complete vigilance and responsibility regarding their right to resist the Israeli occupation, because this resistance is an inseparable part of the Lebanese national interest and results from the Lebanese consensus to end the occupation and safeguard our sovereignty. In any circumstance, the government can only be in a position to defend this interest and affirm this consensus. The Lebanese state is not a tool in Israel's hands. Accordingly, it rejects any offers that aim to use it as a weapon used against its people. Resistance is not a target to be aimed at, but a right embodying the genuineness of the Lebanese people and their love of their land. We uphold our right to liberate our land. We uphold our right to resist the occupation. We uphold our right to restore our sovereignty and freedom on all our national soil. We will not be deflected from this course by pressures, messages, or warnings. Nor will we be deflected by the straying of some Arabs from the circle of Arab solidarity, or by others resorting to separate solutions. The Lebanese Government will not depart from the line it has chosen toward the Arab brothers, even if some of them depart from it. Together with sister Syria, it will continue to negotiate when negotiations are a way to end the occupation, and to boycott when boycotts are in the national interest and are our duty. It is futile to call for us to return to peace under the threat of the sword's edge; it will crush peace, not achieve it. Therefore, we warn against the possibility of the failure of peace under the blows of Israel and its maneuvers. We address our warning to all those concerned with the issue of peace and who believe in the need for a just and comprehensive solution to the region's crisis. 2. The external dangers resulting from the continuation of Israeli occupation and attacks places on all of us--government, chamber, and people--the responsibility to stand in solidarity in the face of these dangers and not give those who would trample our security and sovereignty a chance to achieve their aims of dividing the domestic front. Lebanon is facing the new regional storm by cooperating and coordinating with sister Syria and with its leadership, which has shown extraordinary courage in confronting crucial issues; it has displayed a responsible attitude toward Arab issues in general and toward Lebanon and its struggle for national peace in particular. Syria's support for us and its pan-Arab commitments to Lebanon and its people do not absolve us from our responsibility to our homeland and must not become a reason for weakening this responsibility. Therefore, the Government wishes to reaffirm some principles that were mentioned in its last statement to this honorable chamber. These principles deal with the need to elevate political life to the level of civil peace and national detente. This is a very difficult task in a country which has suffered so long from chaos and sectarian and religious strife. Lebanon is trying to perform political miracles and to introduce the necessary legislation to emerge from the vestiges of that stage. [passage omitted] 3. The issue of media freedom is not the subject of a political argument, nor it is the subject of deep differences among the Lebanese or between the Government and any political party in Lebanon. The Government does not dispute the principle of this freedom at all. It does not allow itself to contest the issue of freedoms and their limits. However, it is natural for the Government to work to protect media freedom with a legal cover that will safeguard it and define the rules of the game. Before this Government, several governments tried to create an objective and responsible framework for the broadcast media. It was natural for all the debates and dialogues which accompanied these attempts to disagree on some points and agree on other points. It was not possible for the experiment to ripen quickly. Months passed before our Government settled this issue once and for all yesterday when it approved a broadcast media law which we hope your honorable chamber will discuss in a democratic and positive way. The broadcast media bill approved yesterday is the first of its kind in Lebanon's legislative history and perhaps the first of its kind in the Arab world. As much as we wanted it to express the genuine relationship between freedom and Lebanon, we also wanted it to truly express the strong relationship between freedom and the law. [passage omitted] 4. The process of national reconstruction, which has proceeded along two parallel lines--completing the return of the refugees and restoring public services--will continue to be sponsored by the Government until it achieves its desired objectives as set down in the declared plans. We have given the issue of returning the refugees priority for our Government. The Ministry of Refugee Affairs has been able to take impressive steps both on returning lands and properties and paying compensations and in the area of promoting reconciliation among the inhabitants and enabling thousands of Lebanese citizens to return to their places of birth and residence. [passage omitted] In the name of the Government, allow me to commend here in the honorable Chamber of Deputies the extraordinary effort made by His Excellency the Minister of Refugee Affairs Walid Junblatt and to put on record his responsible personal and public stand in protecting progress of the return and pushing it several steps forward, especially in the mountain area, which these days is witnessing blessed measures taken by the Lebanese army in Upper al-Matn, 'Alayh, and Al-Shuf. We hope that these measures will bear fruit in the coming months and will consolidate the march of national cohesion among all Lebanese in general and among the inhabitants of the mountains in particular. Parallel to this, the government has mobilized its moral and material resources in the south and in the western al-Biqa'. It has earmarked the necessary funds to face the consequences of the Israeli attacks and to pay compensations to property owners and farmers who are targets of daily shelling. [passage omitted]
