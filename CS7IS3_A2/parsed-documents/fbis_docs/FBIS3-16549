The new company has now held its launch. What prompted the president and the government to embark on the centralization of military-technical cooperation and to concentrate the entire Russian arms trade virtually in one pair of hands? First and foremost, of course, the desire to establish -- as is generally accepted in the entire civilized world -- a strict state monopoly on the export of weapons and military hardware. It is no secret that a situation had come about of late whereby state specialist exporters, in an attempt by hook or by crook to win the right to conclude contracts, were competing with each other in the foreign market and duplicating each other -- which, with a single producer, inevitably led to a dissipation of effort and dumping prices. For instance, five Russian specialist arms exporters tendered for a 1992 munitions delivery to India. They were all offering products from the same plant. As a result, the unit cost of the ammunition was knocked down from $700 to $450. Or take the following example: In the space of a single year the Malaysian and Bangladesh defense ministers were visited by representatives of 24 Russian firms, who unanimously stated that they had exclusive rights to sell our weapons. With the formation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, which is directly subordinate to the Russian president, the situation will change fundamentally for the better. Now all our foreign partners will have a clear idea of with whom they are dealing. As for the weapons manufacturers, in the opinion of "Rosvooruzheniye" General Director Viktor Samoylov, their rights will in no way be infringed upon. As before, all major Russian defense enterprises will actively participate in foreign economic activity. Only the producers can determine what each country needs, what modifications to the weapons need to be made for each country, how best to organize servicing, and so forth. The state company intends to act as a representative, providing state monitoring, helping to process documentation, and so forth. At a meeting with journalists, Viktor Samoylov stated quite definitely that Russia has not lost its traditional markets at present. The process of incorporating "Rosvooruzheniye" into the market has been evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and this has meant that it has been able to ensure complete continuity and to maintain all the links which the "Oboroneksport" All-Russia Association, the "Spetsvneshtekhnika" State Company, and the Main Administration for Cooperation and Production Sharing previously had. According to forecasts from "Rosvooruzheniye" specialists, this year there is every reason to expect an increase rather than a reduction in the volume of military-technical cooperation. Not least in markets that are new to Russia. The company intends to take an important step in this direction at the FIDAE '94 airshow, which opens in Chile Sunday. In the opinion of Pavel Trishin, deputy general director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, our display at the exhibition will stand out from all the others to our advantage.
