The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the implementation of the ruling will open up a new era for Africa. Observors believe that the wide international commending of the stance of the Great Jamahiriyah which responds to all international conventions and decisions did not come out of vacuum but it showed the firm and principled commitment which became clear through the way the Great Jamahiriyah dealt with some issues between herself and other countries including the continental shelf case with sisterly Tunisia and the republic of Malta and recently with Chad through the implementation of the ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding Aozou.
