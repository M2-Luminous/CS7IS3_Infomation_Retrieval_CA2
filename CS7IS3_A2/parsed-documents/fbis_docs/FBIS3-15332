Vello Saatpalu told Interfax on Thursday that the last round of negotiations at which Russia said it might go back on the previously proposed deadline for its troop withdrawal from Estonia, had shown the senselessness of further talks on the same lines. Saatpalu said he was in favor of parliamentary as well as governmental contacts. "The Estonian ambassador to Russia has been given instructions to discuss in Moscow the possibility of a meeting between the parliamentary commissions on foreign affairs," he said. Saatpalu said he objected to the proposal, made by the Estonian delegation at the last round of talks with Russia, that the two countries take their border dispute to the International Court in The Hague. He criticized the idea, advocated by some Estonian politicians, that the Estonian-Russian border is immutable since it was established by the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 and is formalized by the present Estonian constitution. "Those who make this assertion are either uneducated or lazy and don't want to read," for the Constitution says Estonia's land frontier is established not only by that document but also by international treaties, he said. But he rejected any compromise on social security for retired Russian military officers living in Estonia, an issue Russia links to a deadline for its troop withdrawal. "Residence permits can only be issued to elderly pensioners, the rest must leave the country unconditionally," he said.
