There is nothing surprising in the fact that the same people still surround him now and that some of them are members of the president's team. They all helped to found the current ruling party, the Armenian National Movement; the Karabakh Committee flowed smoothly down into it. Observers usually include parliamentary Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, Interior Minister Vanik Siradegyan, and, until recently, Chief National Security Adviser to the President Ashot Manucharyan in the circle of people closest to Ter-Petrosyan. Public opinion gives Siradegyan a special place among those closest to the president. The interior minister's almost unlimited freedom of action and independent conduct and opinions make these comments convincing enough. Levon Ter-Petrosyan has repeatedly expressed public satisfaction with the work done by Vanik Siradegyan's department. In turn, the interior minister categorically rules out the possibility of any difference of opinion with the president. The president is helped in forming and implementing domestic policy by members of the Armenian National Movement, his loyalty to which he never tires of reiterating. It is Armenia's most liberal political party and favors cooperation not only with Russia and the West, but also with the East -- with Turkey and Iran. According to people in the know, Levon Ter-Petrosyan's economic views were formed under the influence of Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan and his predecessor, now Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan. As far as the well-known businessman Artem Atalyants is concerned, foreign economic issues are his sole responsibility as chief adviser to the president. Some observers assessing the situation in this sphere make no secret of their skepticism; this, incidentally, applies equally to the economic situation in the republic itself. The average age of the president's closest entourage is 40-45. It is widely held in Armenia that the president's team is virtually entirely made up of his former fellow students from the Yerevan University Oriental Studies Department, as well as his work colleagues from the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts, the Matenadaran. In actual fact his team includes lawyers, economists, mathematicians, even musicologists, and, of course, orientalists. A recent adviser, Vagan Papazyan, now heads the Armenian Foreign Ministry. This appointment is seen as a logical continuation of the president's cadre policy, as he earlier assigned another of his advisers, U.S. citizen Zhirayr Liparityan, to the same department. Continuing to work as first deputy minister, according to well informed sources, he is still one of the president's most trusted consultants in the foreign policy sphere. Vazgen Sarkisyan, the president's chief military adviser, was a journalist until recently. According to many military specialists, he has quickly mastered military matters and no one in Armenia doubts his personal courage. The opposition accuses Levon Ter-Petrosyan's closest associates of being incompetent, of being out of touch with the people's real problems and concerns, and of having totally forgotten their promises. The president's team does not outwardly respond to these attacks, although some members assess the results of their activity fairly soberly. But they stay with the president and, according to one of his comrades, if anyone were forced to leave it would only be "because of incredible physical exhaustion." It is extremely rare for one of the president's closest entourage to leave on his own initiative, and in this sense the departure of former chief adviser Ashot Manucharyan is the exception. "He only left because he wanted to leave," is the official comment on the resignation of one of the most influential members of the president's closest entourage. Few people in Armenia believe that Ashot Manucharyan has left the political scene for long.
