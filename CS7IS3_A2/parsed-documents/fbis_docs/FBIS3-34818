Resigning Health Minister Hayim Ramon is the first to arrive. Down at the reception they notified him that in view of the recent events and due to their sympathy for him, this time he will be awarded the presidential suite, room No. 2014. The other members of his group slowly gather -- Avraham Burg, Hagay Merom, 'Amir Peretz, Ya'el Dayan, Nawaf Musaliha, Shmu'el Avital, and last and late as usual, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. Ramon told them of the thousands of letters and cables that arrived at his office, and they all sat there basking in the light of his last, successful, trick. As usual, Burg warns Dayan, Musaliha, and Avital that they may not smoke. This has become a ritual in their meetings: He makes a threat, and they cling to the balcony door and blow their smoke out to the Jerusalem skies. Burg pulls out his laptop computer on which he documents each of their meetings and they start talking. This is a very tight gang. They are friends, and have similar ideas on both social and political issues. They have been together for years. This togetherness is the source of their power within Labor. They make up the only Labor circle that holds eight Knesset members, which can be a decisive factor in any of the Knesset faction decisions. They also attract a lot of hatred and envy. One is a minister; two (Beilin and Musaliha) are deputy ministers; three of them chair Knesset committees -- Education and Culture (Burg), Labor and Social Welfare (Peretz), and the House Committee (Merom). Ya'el Dayan used to chair the subcommittee on women's rights. The group has undergone changes. Once, it was made up of 17 members; this was toward the end of 'Uzi Bar'am's term as Labor director general. Some of the group conspired against the establishment of a national unity government. The group broke up and a septet was created: Ramon, Beilin, Burg, Peretz, Musaliha, Nisim Zvili, and Merom. A clear and unequivocal political line held them together. The archrivals of today -- Ramon and Zvili -- were once brothers in arms. The cutoff started when five of the six [as published] were elected to the Knesset while Zvili, who really did not want to, chose to stay with the Jewish Agency. Working at the Knesset, however, brought the five closer together, which began to cast a shadow on Zvili. Also, Ramon was chairman of the Labor faction and coalition whip, hence he was able to hand out benefits to the Knesset members -- mainly podium time. Zvili had nothing to offer. At the same time, Ramon began to be noticed and spoiled by the media. Today, Hagay Merom says that all those years, until the absolute rift between them, it was clear that the group was headed by Ramon and Zvili. It was clear to all that someday, the two would face each other in the struggle over party leadership. Incidentally, Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer is not just waiting in the corner. Presently, he earnestly crisscrosses Israel, gaining incredible strength. Burg, who, contrary to Ramon, did not hesitate to back Zvili in the struggle over the role of party director general, says: "Zvili is extremely talented. He never tells a lie. He keeps silent if he does not want to say something. Ramon, on the other hand, will tell me in response to my question: `You better watch television on such and such date; I will screw you there.'" "All of us," Burg continues, "have no problem with paying the political price for our concepts. The only difference is that we feel we have a duty. After all, if Ramon, Beilin, and I should start up a business of political counsels, we would be the best in Israel. Each one of us has an alternative. Beilin once said that he wants to leave the political life as a person whose stands are clear and well-known." [Doweq] You are so talented, and yet you fail the big tests. [Burg] We fail in every narrow-based public test. We will be beaten every time when we take on the establishment and fight it with our hands tied behind our back. In the primaries, however, this group will score very high." [Doweq] All of you? Peretz hardly made it to the Knesset and Dayan was moved forward only because she was a woman. [Burg] Okay, not all of us. There is natural selection; even Darwin said that. [end Burg] Since the rift with Zvili, there have been no personal clashes in the octet. It would seem, Merom says, that each of us has found his field of operation and political advantages. Ramon and Beilin are our yuppies. We have a red-neck moshavnik, a kibbutznik, a woman, a resident of a development town, and an Arab. "They are trying to say we are an elitist group, but the fact is that our group best represents the Israeli society. Often we joke about the fact that we have three oriental Jews among us -- 'Amir Peretz, Shmu'el Avital, and... Nawaf Musaliha." Merom also speaks of personal friendship among the group members. They all visited each others' homes. In their meetings they speak freely. They also distribute the roles: Ramon will be prime minister; Peretz is to head the Histadrut labor federation; Burg is the only one willing to run for head of the Jewish Agency; Musaliha, deputy health minister, will be the first Arab minister; Hagay Merom is seen as the next Labor chairman; Beilin is and will remain in foreign affairs. Avital and Dayan's roles are not clear as yet; they are newcomers with the group, and have no clearly defined areas of operation. In 1991, before the Labor convention, they spoke of quitting the party and joining up with the Citizens' Rights Movement. They spent nights talking about this. One night they even flew to Cairo for political talks that Beilin initiated, and continued to debate the issue there. They almost decided to quit. Merom says that Zvili then brought them classified information -- which cannot be revealed yet -- which proved to support their stands. Eventually, they decided to stay in the party. Zvili reminded Ramon of that night on the first day of the party conference. I have a feeling, he told Ramon, that you decided to return home only to destroy it from the inside. Before the previous conference, they drafted a 10-point document and presented it as one to the Party Secretariat. Burg hoisted the banner of separating religion from politics; Merom advocated primaries; Musaliha had a resolution passed, though not implemented, to set up an Arab district in the party; Ramon and Peretz then started throwing rocks at the Histadrut building. In a fierce speech, Ramon presented his opinion of the Histadrut. He was representing a negligible minority in the party, but scored enormous public sympathy. Seeing the size of support Ramon is gaining, Zvili stood up against him, his group, and his paper on the very occasion. He shook the group. The rift, which according to Zvili started much sooner, has turned into a fact. Today, Zvili says that he had warned them not to make such remarks. The next day, Zvili seemed better positioned. The group suffered a blow and nearly broke into pieces, while he was appointed head of Peres' election team. During the struggle between Rabin and Peres, Ramon went swimming. Later on, he jumped on Rabin's wagon, befriended him, became closer, did a god job in the public relations campaign, and was appointed minister. Zvili also wanted to be minister, but Ramon spoiled it for him. Zvili fought back. His big opportunity came when he decided to run for Labor secretary general against Rabin's candidate, Yuval Frenkel. Peres backed Zvili. The octet split. Burg, Merom, and Beilin supported and promoted him. To Ramon's dismay, Zvili won. Ramon lost again when he wanted to appoint Hagay Merom as chairman of the Labor faction and coalition, and again when the group ran 'Amir Peretz for Histadrut secretary general. The group takes pride for scoring 35 percent of the vote, but Zvili says that even if they were represented by a scarecrow, they would have scored the same support because of the built-in hatred of some of the voters for the Histadrut. The octet now considers adding members. There are several candidates: Avi Yehezqel, Efrayim Sne, Dalya Itzik, Rafi Elul. At the same time, Ramon launched a move that would bring in Shim'on Sheves, the Prime Minister's Office director general. There is a serious problem with Hagay Merom, who hates Sheves. He still remembers how, speaking from the Knesset podium, Merom called on Rabin to shut Sheves' mouth. Ramon's move is calculated and careful. Sheves gains power in the party thanks to his proximity to the prime minister. He is also well situated in the United Kibbutz Movement, Merom's constituency. Ramon: "Sheves has a large group in the party. We share views on many issues and we can cooperate. Personal problems exist on both sides, but I believe they can be handled." Merom: "Ramon knows I am the key figure in this move, which is why he is careful." Ramon considers Merom a cunning man. He is said to have a short fuse and blows up quickly. The number of Labor party circles will soon beat the number of Knesset members: the Next Generation, the Mashov Circle; Hakfar Hayaroq Circle, the Hofit Circle, the Ef'al Circle, the New Direction Circle, 'Amir Peretz' new circle, and the camp Finance Minister Shohat plans to establish. The octet is made of the Mashov and Kfar Hayaroq Circles. They are mostly talented, intelligent, well spoken, and media favorites. Burg: "We represent a novelty in Israeli politics. This is scary. Our friendship is threatening. There are not many bodies from whose meetings nothing leaks." Once every week or two they meet in a place set by Ramon. Ronit, his bureau chief, notifies them of the time and place. Usually, the meeting takes place on Monday night. Ramon always arrives at the end. Often he breaks up the forum in the very last moment because of some television appearance. No meeting is held without him. He always opens the meeting with a review of the recent cabinet session. Yosi Beilin will later brief them about "the way things stand," and present his evaluations. Then they will exchange views. For years, Burg took notes in a notebook which Merom handled when Burg spoke. Now he uses the computer. According to him, he reserves the material for a book he will write one day. In the meantime, the minutes are being kept in Jerusalem bank safe. Only Burg has the key. Burg is the joker of the band. In their last session they discussed the results of Ramon's resignation, and marked their next struggle: Open primaries in the Labor Party. They know that in open primaries they stand a better chance than inside the establishment. Zvili: "They are a nice group. Most of them are talented; not all. The fact that they are together makes them a source of power. Yet, they have never faced a real test. I am sorry they opted for total destruction. That is why I could not stay with them. Their hatred for the Histadrut has changed into an obsession."
