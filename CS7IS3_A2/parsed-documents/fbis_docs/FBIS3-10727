They were pardoned yesterday by President Aylwin, a decision about which they have not yet been officially notified. [Begin Alberto Espinoza, lawyer for the pardoned inmates, recording] I know nothing besides what has been published in the newspapers or broadcast on radio. This morning I spoke with Justice Ministry officials, and they did not tell me anything about the resolution. [end recording] The four inmates pardoned by the president are Hector Figueroa, Oscar Ordenes, Hector Maturana, and Miguel Angel Colima, the latter having been sentenced for participating in the attack against the Los Quenes Police Garrison in 1988. The four men could travel to Belgium, but this has still not been confirmed. The Army is distressed, Army Deputy Commander Lieutenant General Jorge Lucar said upon learning of the president's decision to pardon the terrorists who participated in the attack against Gen. Pinochet. [Begin Lucar recording] Our institution is distressed in light of the sacrifice, the murder, of four of its members and a Carabinero. We are faced with a presidential decision, and the Army will always obey the decisions of the government, without a doubt. [end recording] [Begin Brigade General Fernando Torres, Army prosecutor general, recording] Regrettable. The more so when we all know the manner in which these people acted. It was a premeditated, open attack. Armed Forces men were murdered in cold blood. It was a frustrated attack against the president of the Republic, which is a very serious thing. [end recording] Regarding the moment chosen by the president of the Republic to grant the pardon, Gen. Torres said: [Begin Torres recording] It took him a long time because he had doubts for some time about the fairness of this decision. [end recording]
