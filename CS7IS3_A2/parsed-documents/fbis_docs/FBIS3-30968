During the talks, both sides confirmed that the coalition will continue, they said they would jointly support the government's budget draft, and they also said they decided the Finance Ministry will remain in the SLD domain. The conditions which had been set earlier by SLD will probably be the subject of further talks and negotiations. The name of the new finance minister (who will also be a deputy prime minister for economic affairs) will be announced by SLD prior to the second reading of the budget draft, that is to say next week at the latest. It seems that SLD leaders' serious fears concerning the chances for maintaining the governing coalition, were caused first of all by the prime minister's television appearance where he was critical of a straight, liberal continuation of economic policies, and at the same time he stressed the need to include social needs in the budget to a greater extent. The second reason was Lech Walesa's involvement in the crisis. He reminded everyone of his constitutional powers and of a possibility of presidential rules. SLD was relieved to see the compromise with PSL, despite Marek Borowski's exclusion from the government being the price for the compromise. According to SLD Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, the president's involvement at the last moment proves that if there was anybody to gain from the crisis in the government, it was the president. Andrzej Zakrzewski, chief of the president's Political Service Bureau, when asked to comment on the view that the president--by his signing of Borowski's resignation--had an impact on the speedy signing of the new agreement within the coalition, said that Lech Walesa "does not get involved in the coalition's affairs, but he simply takes note of what the coalition and the government 'produce.'" When asked whether he thinks the president accepted Borowski's resignation very fast, Zakrzewski replied: "The president is always fast...." Apart from three fundamental issues--the coalition's stability, support for the government's budget draft, and leaving the finance minister and deputy prime minister in the domain of SLD--no other topics were discussed. But SLD hopes it will be able to return to talks with PSL concerning the conditions that had been set earlier which--among others--pertained to defining the powers of deputy prime ministers, consultations within the coalition concerning appointments of new local governors, and establishing the post of government spokesman. According to SLD, the most important thing right now is to enact the budget in the form proposed by the government; Marek Borowski--who after his resignation will return to work as a Sejm deputy in the Sejm Economic Policy, Budget, and Finance Commission--will "protect" the budget draft on SLD's behalf. In its contacts with the mass media, SLD decided to apply PSL's method. SLD says it was a bad idea to be open in supplying information to journalists during the most recent conflict. "Right now, we will talk less and do more"--SLD decided. While recognizing the efficiency of PSL's silence, left-wing politicians intend to closely watch the political scene and wait for PSL's next move. Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of SLD, refused to give any information to journalists yesterday. PSL politicians say he was full of bitterness. According to unofficial information, a joint principle of commenting on the recent events as little as possible, was adopted during the evening coalition talks. There are probably no chances for establishing a post of press spokesman for the government. Government circles say that establishing such a post would mean that the prime minister's information policy is different than the government's.
