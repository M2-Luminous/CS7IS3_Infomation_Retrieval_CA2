Flying to Greece today, where a sitting of the European Union will take place, Boris Yeltsin told journalists with satisfaction that henceforth discriminatory measures vis-a-vis Russia "when we were not given quotas for the export of goods have been overcome." In the Russian President's view, the agreement between the Russian Federation and the European Union notes the transitional nature of the Russian Federation's economy. The President added that in the United States the transitional nature of the Russian economy has not yet been recognized and therefore for the time being obstacles for Russian goods have not been abolished. The President said that the agreement would create a favored treatment for Russian goods in Europe. It could already be said now that the new parameters of cooperation and partnership will make it possible to expand the export of goods from Russia to Europe. First of all Boris Yeltsin stressed that the Agreement specifies "how much uranium and aluminum Russia will be able to sell on the European market." "Previously we were not allowed into Europe with these commodities". In this respect the President regards his visit as extremely useful for the Russian economy.
