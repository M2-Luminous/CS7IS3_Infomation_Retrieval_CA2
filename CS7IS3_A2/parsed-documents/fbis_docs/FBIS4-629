FBIS4-629 "drafr071_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Cameroon Plan To Lay Off 23,000 Civil Servants Denied Plan To Lay Off 23,000 Civil Servants Denied LD0704142794 Paris Radio France International in French 0630 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704142794 Paris Radio France International French BFN [Text] In Cameroon, the government has given a clarification: civil servants' jobs will indeed be cut, but it will not be anything like the 23,000 layoffs announced by the press agencies and RFI. The whole operation will be carried out over four years and will be accompanied by a social plan described to us by the Civil Service Minister Sali Dairou. He is speaking to Chantal Lorho: [Begin Dairou recording] We are in the process of thinking about reducing staff numbers, but by this we do not mean layoffs in the pejorative sense of the word, as the man in the street understands it. Cameroon in fact plans to reduce staff numbers progressively by encouraging voluntary early retirement and by creating a reintegration fund to finance the plans of certain civil servants and state employees who would like to retrain to work in the private sector. If these plans are considered viable and feasible, it is possible that they will be financed by those funds. Moreover, since 1987 we have kept recruitment frozen, which means that those who leave at normal retirement age and those who retire after 30 years service form a means of reducing the numbers of staff in the civil service without this being a constraint -- as a certain sensationalist section of the press wishes to believe, saying that we are laying off 20,000 civil servants. The Cameroonian Government has never intended to lay off 20,000 civil servants. No agreement has been reached with the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to that effect. [end recording]
