Before fielding questions at this news conference, I would like to say one thing. Former Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his resignation on 8 April and I do not want to mention what has happened since he made that announcement. I was elected prime minister at sessions of both houses of the Diet on 25 April. Looking back at the past eight months, I believe that the coalition government created a new politics in Japan, and I have taken pride in creating such new politics in our nation. Therefore, I have called on the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to join my coalition government and cooperate with it. This morning, I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo, but regrettably, we failed to reach an agreement on together forming a new coalition government. I would like to apologize to the people for delaying the formation of my cabinet. In any case, I have now assumed important duties as prime minister at this difficult time. What is more, my cabinet is a minority coalition government and I anticipate that my cabinet will face many difficulties. I think that I and my cabinet members will cooperate with each other and do our best to move Japan forward. In that sense, I would like to ask all of you to give us guidance and understanding. [First dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister. [Hata] Yes? [First dean of the press corps] First, the deans of the press corps will ask questions, and then other reporters will ask their respective questions. I would like to hold this news conference that way. As the prime minister just said, it was regrettable that the SDPJ broke away from the coalition government. With the SDPJ staying out of the coalition government, the Hata cabinet will become a minority coalition government for the first time in 39 years. I anticipate that the Hata cabinet will encounter many difficulties in the future. I also anticipate that the Hata cabinet will find it difficult to run the Diet, and to get the Diet to pass bills. The instability of the Hata government will have an impact on Japan's politics and the people's lives. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask your resolve, intention, and strategy to cope with these difficulties. [Hata] As you just pointed out, with the SDPJ breaking away from the coalition government, my cabinet has now become a minority coalition government. I believe that my cabinet will face many difficulties in the future. With regard to the budget for fiscal 1994, when I met with SDPJ Chairman Murayama and the secretary general, they said that since they worked with us in mapping out the budget draft, they would cooperate with us as much as possible from the viewpoint that such cooperation is good for our nation. As for the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], members of the LDP are my colleagues who ran the government for a long time. Our coalition government will be at odds with the LDP over some issues. Although the SDPJ quit the coalition government, my coalition government will carry out policies on the basis of a set of agreements previously reached among the ruling coalition parties, and I think that I will be able to ask the LDP to cooperate with my coalition government in carrying out policies. I will seek such cooperation from the LDP at every opportunity. [First dean of the press corps] I have heard that the LDP and the SDPJ have announced that they would cooperate with each other in confronting the coalition government. If those opposition parties do as they announced, the coalition government can only get the budget to pass in the Diet, but it would not be able to do anything without their cooperation. I think the coalition government will be reduced to a cabinet charged with only handling the budget, and then general elections will be held after the House of Representatives is dissolved. Mr. Prime Minister, you have taken pains to introduce the combined system of proportional representation and single-seat constituency while promoting political reform. Mr. Prime Minister, do you anticipate a situation where a bill on the demarcation of constituencies is shelved and then the House of Representatives is dissolved? How are you going to deal with such a situation? [Hata] As for your question, during today's meeting, SDPJ Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me the SDPJ will not back away from reforms. The Hosokawa coalition government initiated the political reform for the first time in 70 years, and the people have supported the initiative. In the past, the SDPJ cooperated with us in promoting political reform while overcoming truly painful and tough difficulties. If political reform is set back, Japan's politics would be made to look ridiculous and there would be no genuine politics in Japan. Originally, the Diet was a venue where politicians with varying positions held debates. Policy debates are held to move forward our nation and people. Many of the LDP members take the view that political reform should be promoted. As for the political reform bill, almost all LDP members supported it, and the bill was passed in the Diet. Given this history, I am convinced I will be able to obtain cooperation from each political party in getting the bill on reforming the current tax system to pass in the Diet. I believe we are not in a situation where the House of Representatives needs to be dissolved. [Correspondent] A conclusion will be drawn on how to reform the current tax system in June, and I think that reforming the current tax system will become the most important task for the coalition government. With the SDPJ breaking away from the coalition government, however, the ruling coalition parties would have difficulty pushing for reform of the current tax system. The coalition government also would find it difficult to raise the consumption tax. Mr. Prime Minister, how will you take political responsibility if and when a bill on reforming the current tax system is rejected by the Diet? How are you going to cut taxes next year? [Hata] I would like to answer your last question. The ruling coalition parties have decided to cut income tax for only one year in the course of discussing how to reform the current tax system when the Hosokawa government was in power. I believe that the people and the coalition partners invariably feel the need to continue cutting income tax forever. Cutting income tax will incur a fall in the fiscal revenues. The prolonged recession has resulted in a fall in fiscal revenues. If the income tax continues to be cut, it will cause other major fiscal problems. It is impossible to deal with the fiscal deficit by issuing deficit-covering bonds. In any case, the budget for fiscal 1994 will register a deficit of more than 200 trillion yen this summer. While Japan is becoming a senior-citizen society, nobody wants taxes increased to deal with such a society. When we think that we will have to practice responsible politics, we have to discuss how to reform the current tax system by the end of June. I think the coalition government needs to do its best to get a bill on reforming the tax system to pass in the Diet. I would like to refrain from predicting whether the bill will be passed or not in the Diet. In order to make Japan stable in the future, debates should be held on how to increase the people's tax burden. I believe that if such debates are not held, the issue of reforming the current tax system will be deferred until later. As I said in my statement, I intend to seek the people's understanding of the need to reform the current tax system while appealing to them. I also think I need to indicate to the people that reforming the current tax system will improve their lives. [Correspondent] This is not related to the previous question. Under the current circumstances in which tension has been mounting regarding the issue of suspected DPRK nuclear arms development, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been thinking about Japan's defense and has undertaken efforts to have his ideas reflected in the fiscal year 1995 budget during informal meetings on defense issues. Mr. Prime Minister, do you intend to continue along this line? [Hata] Yes, I do. Regarding this issue, the problem of what to do about national security in the post-Cold War era is being discussed by people from the private sector in the informal meetings which you have mentioned. Broad discussions on the entire issue should of course be conducted, but I feel we should have second thoughts about deciding to do one thing or another without first arriving at a conclusion. In any case, we will deal with the issue of the budget while having thorough discussions, on the results of which we plan to place great emphasis. [Correspondent] Concerning the currently stalled Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks, what is your outlook regarding resumption of the talks? Do you have any plans toward breaking the impasse, such as you yourself visiting the United States or sending the foreign minister? [Hata] As for breaking the impasse, I recently held a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech. We agreed to keep our doors open at all times and mutually acknowledged our problems. Therefore, we now plan to consider taking advantage of such opportunities to be able to always conduct debates in a calm manner. In any case, the biggest reason that we started the framework trade talks was the fact that Japan had a huge trade surplus. This does not merely concern Japanese-U.S. relations, but, for example, it also means Japan has a huge current account surplus with the EU and other countries. Therefore, when the framework trade talks broke down in the early hours of 11 February, I told members of relevant government ministries and agencies that this does not mean Japan and the United States would do one thing or another because matters have been settled, but rather that even though negotiations have broken down, Japan, after all, needs to open its markets. This is what the Hosokawa administration has advocated since its inauguration. Japan should then be invigorated in the process, resulting in improving the livelihood of the Japanese people. Therefore, we should take the initiative to carry this out. It has been decided that we will include in the outline of the economic reform, which was announced on 29 March, plans designed to ease or remove the government regulations in June and plans to form a committee on administrative reform that would include members from the private sector. In the process of carrying out such plans, we must of course hold discussions with the United States. The time is not right for me to visit the United States. Anyhow, I would like to study this in the future. After all, Japan and the United States must understand each other regarding economic issues. The two nations have been cooperating on political and security issues and global issues, such as the environment and AIDS. However, if they fail to get along on economic issues, the peoples of both nations will become frustrated. The exchange of harsh words between the two nations have given rise to anti-American or anti-Japanese sentiments in the past as well. Therefore, no matter how well the two nations may seem to be getting along, we feel it is necessary to promptly work toward bringing about a situation where both nations can cooperate with each other regarding economic ties. This will not only be beneficial to our nation, but it should also serve to indicate one possible direction to the peoples of other countries of the world, who are anxiously watching the situation. I would also like to confirm that what Japan and the United States talk about will not only be beneficial for the two nations, but that the results of such talks should be spread equally among other countries of the world. [Correspondent] Regarding the situation on the Korean peninsula, I think it is basically understood that the issue would be settled through dialogue. However, when U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry visited Japan recently, he indicated the possibility of imposing sanctions against the DPRK through multilateral efforts under a framework other than the United Nations in case this cannot be carried out by the United Nations. Do you intend to endorse this idea? [Hata] Regarding this issue, as you may now be well aware, I regret to say it has been reported to the United Nations that the International Atomic Energy Agency was unable to conduct a thorough inspection. Even under such circumstances, the United Nations discussed the matter primarily within the UN Security Council. It decided that, at this stage, instead of adopting a resolution for imposing sanctions or other measures, it would issue a statement urging the DPRK to first of all allow thorough inspections of its nuclear facilities and calling on both the DRPK and the ROK to exchange special envoys and declare the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. Therefore, I believe that at this time, it is of utmost importance that we ask the DPRK to respond to the international community and open its heart to erase such suspicions. For this reason, we naturally would like to continue urging other nations to try to maintain holding adequate talks with the DPRK. Generally speaking, however, if the United Nations makes a certain decision, I feel Japan should offer to cooperate within the limits of the Constitution. Regarding the last part of your question, this is not the appropriate time to discuss such an issue. [Correspondent] In that connection, regarding the revision of laws within the framework of the Constitution in case of emergencies, to what extent do you intend to deal with the issue of enacting emergency legislation? [Hata] This does not concern only the issue of DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development. There naturally may be discussion of issues such as our country's security and stability or contingency plans in the event that something should happen. At this time, however, we have no plans about what to do immediately in such a case. [Correspondent] That concludes questions by the deans of the press corps. Other correspondents may feel free to ask questions now. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister. [Hata] Go ahead. [Correspondent] Regarding the formation of a unified parliamentary group which triggered the breakup of the coalition, we feel that was a very clever move. We also believe that it runs counter to the political stance you have taken thus far. Were you not able to restrain such moves after you became prime minister and were you not angered by them? Can you tell us about this? [Hata] Concerning this problem, I have frankly told members of the SDPJ that I regret that this has happened after they had cast their votes for me, particularly when I was in the midst of selecting cabinet ministers. Since there are many parties in the coalition alliance, I have always felt it would be better if there could be improved mobility in dealing with various problems and if everyone could conduct debates in as few places as possible. Frankly speaking, however, I did not know it had gone this far. At the time I learned about it, I was in the midst of carrying out official duties instead of being involved with the affairs of my party. In that sense, there was a problem. However, by the time I heard about it, I was told that the SDPJ had already approved of the idea, and that Komeito [Clean Government Party], too, had approved it. Moreover, there were rumors at that time that the SDPJ would be joining the upper house parliamentary group Shin Ryokufukai. Under such circumstances, I felt at that instant that it was wonderful that things were proceeding so smoothly. In reality, however, as talks proceeded, I became aware that there were misunderstandings. I regret to say that by that time, things had already gone too far. Regarding this point, I felt it necessary to make sincere apologies to the SDPJ, and that is exactly what I tried to convey to the SDPJ today. [Correspondent] In that regard, I believe a lot of public confidence in the political system was lost due to such falterings. What do you intend to do to regain the people's confidence? [Hata] All right. Concerning this point -- naturally it must be about the fact that this is a coalition government. Frankly speaking, I feel the difficulties facing a coalition government have been exposed. However, I do not feel that those who came up with ideas or put their ideas into action did so with evil intentions. I wonder why talks could not have been held in such a manner that everyone could understand each other within the framework I have mentioned earlier. On this point, I have made sincere apologies to the SDPJ, as I already mentioned. Therefore, such misunderstandings should be avoided from now on, although people always have misgivings about many things. Being obsessed with something can often lead a person to make mistakes. Regarding such points, it is thus necessary to create an environment in which frank discussion can be held, particularly in case of a unified parliamentary group. It is more so when it comes to supporting a minority government. In that sense, I strongly feel we need to strive harder to create a place for conveying our thoughts to each other. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister. [Hata] Go ahead. [Correspondent] It seems Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and the SDPJ pulled out from the coalition alliance because of the ruling coalition parties' decision-making process. In the future, do you have any plans to reconsider the current decision-making process centering around the party representatives' caucus, or do you have any new plans to replace this process? [Hata] Well, it is true that we disagreed during the process of reaching policy agreement. However, I think we felt we disagreed because we had candid arguments expressing what each party or individual felt. Those who, we thought, were at loggerheads with each other, were beginning to form fiduciary relations or friendships among themselves. It is true that we were not in accord. However, I think it appeared very clear to the people what we were arguing about. Every one of us has a different background and different beliefs. Therefore, it was natural for us to argue with each other. After the arguments, however, we felt for sure that we could find a new direction. We are all politicians who are responsible for guiding the country. I strongly felt that I had to do what I had to do even at the risk of sacrificing my private feelings When I was talking with American officials, they told me that they had frequent arguments with European and Canadian officials. They told me not to take it too seriously even if I had heated discussions with others. Despite heated discussions, they mutually feel friendship when they meet next time. Therefore, I think it is important to have freer arguments. [Correspondent] The coalition became a minority immediately you were elected for the post of premier. I think the people remain unconvinced of the fact that your administration is supported by the minority coalition. I think many people feel it is a matter of course for your administration to dissolve the cabinet immediately after approving the budget, and to seek the judgment of the people. What do you think of such an opinion? [Hata] As I have been explaining, the discord was created by mutual misunderstanding. When I met them, I told SDPJ Chairman Murayama and Secretary General Kubo that we still have not given up hope of having the SDPJ in the coalition again. We mutually crossed the barriers and cooperated with each other during the past eight months. The SDPJ was not the only party who made compromises. We made concessions too. We are beginning to use words which we hardly ever used when we were members of the Liberal Democratic Party. For example, a company building becomes big as the company grows bigger. However, its employees may still spend two hours or two and a half hours, or some people many spend four or five hours, for commuting. Among other things, we realize that we have to deal with such issues. Therefore, needless to say, our door is still open as I told the SDPJ leaders today. I told them we will continue our efforts to help them understand us better. I also told them we will continue our efforts to form a new coalition. We will not carry out state affairs by taking the decision, which we have been discussing, as the final conclusion. We would prefer to try to seek a chance to join hands once again. As I look back at the things that have happened during the past eight months, it is true that we did some things which angered the SDPJ. However, we need to forthrightly apologize to the SDPJ for the mistakes we made, and to realize the significance of the coalition we had in the past eight months. We also should realize that Japan's new course is about to be formed as a result of our mutual concessions. While explaining this point, we will try to assume a stance which will enable us to somehow gain cooperation from the SDPJ. For that purpose, I will do my best. [Correspondent] Certainly, the formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin" helped lead to the departure of the Social Democratic Party of Japan from the coalition. But this was only one reason. For the past eight months, the SDPJ's distrust of other coalition partners has deepened, and the formation of Kaishin made the party decide to secede from the coalition. This is what SDPJ members and many people have said. Thus, I believe differences in opinion on the formation of the parliamentary group are not the only reason that the SDPJ had to secede from the coalition and the Hata cabinet has become a minority ruling government. There were many cases in the past in which the SDPJ and other coalition partners failed to reach an agreement. I think the coalition government should have a sense of remorse about this. [Hata] We have a sense of remorse over our acts. But I do not think that we failed to reach an agreement on everything. Among SDPJ members who have agreed to support the coalition government, some are very angry about the formation of Kaishin. We should take this fact seriously. We have to reflect on this fact. We have faced many difficult issues for the past eight months. When we faced these difficulties, strong leadership was required to overcome them. SDPJ Secretary General Kubo said that it was very tough to tide over one problem -- the difficulty of achieving tax reform -- after all of the other difficulties. I fully understand his comment. I think it is important that while reflecting on past mistakes, we should create an environment wherein decisions can be made through negotiations. I still have not given up. We have achieved many things in the past eight months, although it was a very short period. This will be historically acclaimed in the future. I believe other people also think this way. [Correspondent] In describing your relations with Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, you recently said that Ozawa is the person who draws up scenarios and you are the one who acts on them. Mr. Ozawa commented on the formation of the new cabinet this afternoon, saying [words indistinct]. Does this division of roles still exist? Or since you have become the prime minister, will you draw up scenarios by yourself? [Hata] Maybe because of the news media's access to a large amount of information, you all tend to report as truthful everything people say, as if their statements were always a reflection of reality. When I was asked by correspondents about my relations with Ozawa at a time I was about to ride on a bullet train after canvassing, I told them that you cannot do things by yourself. You can draw up scenarios, but actors do not always act on scenarios. Actors may choose their favorite scenarios and sometimes ask writers to rewrite them. I said this to them. It seems that you have taken what I carelessly said the wrong way. At least, I have been in the political world for 25 years and have been faced with problems in completely different fields. I have had much experience with role-playing based on scenarios of my own design. When I was foreign minister, I could not do anything but attend to my official duties. You must have someone to take care of party affairs. My relations with Ozawa are something like that. Somebody said that I consulted with him over the issue of the cabinet lineup. In former times, a prime minister, when forming his cabinet, always consulted with the party secretary general. You cannot do things by yourself. A rumor has it that we yelled at each other in a bathroom. We did not do any such thing. However, since we have been friends for 25 years, we can actually help each other by yelling at each other. He does not interfere with the things I do. On other occasions, he may ask me to help him out. I would like you to understand that our relations are like this. [Correspondent] The new cabinet is supported by a minority ruling coalition, and you yourself said earlier that the situation was very severe for you. Some of the people are worried that your administration may be short-lived. How would you respond to that? [Hata] Well, I do not believe that people are saying that. I know the news media have said that the new cabinet will not last long. Anyway, if we steadily implement our policies, and if the people think what we are doing is right, we will be able to gain the people's understanding. At the same time, I strongly hope to create circumstances in which the Social Democratic Party of Japan can agree on our policies and cooperate with us in carrying them out. [Correspondent] I have the feeling that because the SDPJ left the coalition, the Hata cabinet might take the same political stance as the Liberal Democratic Party. Could you explain differences between the Hata government's political techniques and styles and those adopted by the LDP-led governments of the past? [Hata] The coalition is composed of Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, and other parties which were opposition parties eight months ago. Therefore, it is impossible for us to adopt the same political stance as the LDP did when it was in power. I want to stress that the coalition government, established eight months ago, was the first such government in 38 years. Under the Hosokawa coalition government, I had to make hasty decisions in time for deadlines set to deal with various issues. At that time, I was criticized as being high-handed and hard on others. I think that as the coalition government gradually matures, we will begin to respect others' opinions and styles, to compromise with each other, and to seek new things. In short, we will begin to seek new measures to improve the living standards of the people. As I said earlier, the Hosokawa coalition government began to pay attention to issues concerning the environment and working people, which the LDP did not. I think this is the result of our 8-month-long learning process, and I evaluate this highly. [Correspondent] What will be the priority tasks to be tackled by the Hata government? I am sure there are many urgent tasks. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, what tasks will your coalition government emphasize? [Hata] The political reform bill was passed in the Diet, and it is necessary to establish the major elements of political reform. We need to do that. I think that one of the coalition government's major tasks is to create a new political system in Japan. Although it is said that Japan's economy is now showing some signs of recovery, its recovery is not certain. Looking at the unemployment rate, we cannot be optimistic about the economic recovery. Japan's politics and enterprises are doing something to help foster economic recovery. I believe the coalition government is now expected to abolish or ease regulations, promote administrative reform, and establish an open information system. Therefore, the coalition government will have to work on those issues. As I said just a while ago, the coalition government will have to work on addressing the issue of the ratio of direct to indirect taxes in total tax revenues. The coalition government will also have to work on cutting the income tax while pursuing a welfare policy. The coalition government will have to upgrade the current social structure to prepare for a society of senior citizens. The coalition government has those tasks. I believe that it is important to make known the current situation to the people and ask them to share burdens to deal with the issues. What I realized while serving as finance minister and foreign minister is that all of the nations of the world -- including industrialized nations, nations in transition from planned economies to capitalist economies, developing countries trying to take off, and other developing countries -- pin high expectations on Japan. They do not expect only money from Japan. They ask Japan to transfer technology and other know-how and cooperate with them in other fields. Japan should make international contributions in response to other countries' requests. Japan should also help with the reconstruction of war-ravaged nations and provide aid to nations plagued by conflict. This is what the outside world expects from Japan. I believe that if Japan fails to play a proper role in the world and make international contributions, it will be impossible for the nation to further develop itself. I think that those are tasks the coalition government should take on in the future. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, on the day when former Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his resignation, you asked what Japan will be like and said that you were fretting about Japan's future. What sort of message does the coalition government intend to send to the rest of the world? [Hata] As I stated briefly a while ago, I intend to help the international community understand that Japan is an open nation. At the same time, Japan inflicted mental wounds on people in many nations during the past war, and some of those people lost their lives. I believe that Japan must engage in candid soul-searching regarding what it did to those people. Japan has so far followed the path of peace while engaging in such soul-searching. All nations of the world have understood what Japan has done, and they have supplied Japan with resources while seeking manufactured goods from our country. Japan has become the industrialized nation it is thanks to their cooperation. Japan would not have been able to become the industrialized nation it is if all the nations of the world had not understood our country. As I said a while ago, Japan should aggressively provide aid to developing countries and other nations trying to transform themselves. I believe that Japan is being asked to make clear that it intends to make international contributions toward world peace. [Correspondent] Last year, the ruling coalition parties succeeded in seizing power from the LDP because of their cohesion. This time, however, the ruling coalition parties succeeded in remaining in power despite their minority role in the Diet. Mr. Prime Minister, what do you think of this contradiction? [Hata] The SDPJ broke away from the coalition government over the issue of forming a parliamentary group. SDPJ Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Kubo told me that the SDPJ will cooperate with the coalition government in dealing with such issues as political reform and the budget. As I said at the outset of this news conference, the LDP supported the coalition government on major policies in the Diet. Looking back at various things that have taken place in the past, I am convinced that when I strive for the sake of our nation to transcend the power struggle and I work to move our nation forward, the SDPJ and the LDP will cooperate with me.
