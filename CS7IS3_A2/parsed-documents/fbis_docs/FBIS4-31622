Officer Who Knows a Lot"] [Text] If he has actually decided to weave the strings of power in his hands into something that implies a lasting peace, together with Corps General Ante Ros, which he recently promised during his visit to Medjugorje, then that is good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He finally has a real opportunity to materialize unity between Croats and Bosniaks, which he has always advocated, at least verbally. Bosniak General Fikret Muslimovic, the main Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina officer for the Bosniak side in the recently formed Joint Staff of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first Muslim general to visit Medjugorje since the unsuccessful and abortive meeting between Tudjman and Izetbegovic, which took place in the same location exactly one year earlier, when it turned out that despite the mediation of Owen and Stoltenberg, even in a place like Medjugorje miracles do not exactly happen every century, much less every day. The generals who represented the two armies at that time were Slobodan Praljak for the Croats and Sefer Halilovic for the (still at that time) Muslims. Nothing came of the firm handshakes after the signing of the peace "documents" and the optimistic statements into the microphones of all the relevant world media companies. The war escalated, an unprecedented Muslim offensive in central Bosnia began, and hundreds of thousands of Croats were expelled. At that time, former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Lieutenant Colonel Fikret Muslimovic, with the rank of colonel in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was on that army's General Staff as the head of all intelligence and security activities. He was in a position where he was considered the person to whom even the slightest whiff of dilettantism had to be attributed at the outset. The top intelligence officer--or "security officer," as he was called at the time--acquired his skill and agility through many years of service in the notorious department led by former JNA General Vasiljevic. Muslimovic was one of the main links in this murky chain even as the storm began to brew in Slovenia, and then in Croatia. In some insider circles in Sarajevo, it was said at the time that Muslimovic could have advanced much further if he had not happened to be a Muslim, which is very likely, although like the majority of officers in the former JNA who were not of Serb nationality, he identified himself as Yugoslav. The Serb drums of war in Bosnia forced Lt. Col. Muslimovic to opt for the just-formed Territorial Defense, an offshoot of the Patriotic League, which was formed by people primarily of Sandzak origins. At the very outset of the war in and around Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Muslimovic, under the roof of the state presidency building, assumed the duties of head of a similar political agency, attempting to apply the experience gained in organizing the disbanded army to the new conditions. To the extent that the author of this article can recall those days and the talks with the present-day Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina general in Sarajevo, he mostly preferred Croat-Muslim unity and the need to "go to the Drina together"; however, it never occurred to him to acknowledge the real contribution of the HVO to that common cause. At the time, Muslimovic was among the people who, after the establishment of a tolerable Muslim defense in Bosnia-Herzegovina, felt that they should take the matter into their own hands and that other defense units should join them according to plans drawn up in Sarajevo, which of course did not work at all. At that time, Muslimovic's sympathies were reserved for the HOS [Croatian Defense Force], which had experienced a precipitous fall in esteem among the Croat nation. During that period, Muslimovic's main associates were certain Sandzak commanders, especially a young man nicknamed Zagi, and it is impossible to say how it is that some of the people around Muslimovic were in fact unsuccessful in defending certain parts of Sarajevo. From the beginning, he was opposed to the creation of any Croat state community in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and at the mention of Herceg-Bosna this seemingly peaceful man would react in a manner that is inadvisable for such a high-ranking officer. He also selected some Croats as his associates, people who under such circumstances were deprived of any and all autonomy, which certainly comes as no surprise since the top Muslim soldier and Muslimovic's boss at the time was Sefer Halilovic, who ended the way he did. After his fall, Muslimovic advanced in the service, and he has in fact experienced his professional finale in recent days, with his appointment to the Joint Staff of the HVO and formations of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which role he has remained in Medjugorje as the head of the Bosniak military delegation, which has begun working on the more concrete implementation of the signed agreements together with a corresponding delegation from the HVO. Gen. Muslimovic has not concealed his satisfaction with what has been achieved, and he brims over with optimism. Curiously enough, he has not mentioned a "joint advance to the Drina," although he did so before the agreements, when as part of the Muslim negotiating team he negotiated with Croat military delegations, mostly at the Sarajevo airport. What happens in the period to come will show whether this means that Gen. Muslim has finally understood the logic that the HVO is no one's mercenary army and that it exists exclusively to protect Croat interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But one thing is sure: Muslimovic is the officer in the Bosniak ranks who knows the most, and he pulled some of the strings during the Croat-Muslim fighting. If he has actually decided to weave the strings of power in his hands into something that implies a lasting peace, together with Corps General Ante Ros, which he recently promised during his visit to Medjugorje, then that is good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He finally has a real opportunity to materialize unity between Croats and Bosniaks, which he has always advocated, at least verbally. He himself will have to come face to face with the possible fragments of a troubled conscience during the war with the Croats from the one-year phase of his military career.
