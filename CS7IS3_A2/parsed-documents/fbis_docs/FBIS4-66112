After transmitting his message of utmost continuity in Italy's foreign affairs, and its willingness to play a bigger role in peacekeeping operations, Previti said he had found "no prejudice, and no reservations, whether covert or overt", in his meetings here. Previti echoed Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in Washington in stressing that Italy wants an "appropriate involvement" in political and military decision-making if it is to take on any larger role: a fact that was recognised by U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. He reiterated Italy's willingness to send peacekeepers to Bosnia, on three conditions -- "if the UN Security Council so requests, if it is a case of implementing a peace plan, and if all the sides in question have agreed to that plan" -- and added that Italy is also willing to take part in a possible aid operation in Rwanda "if the UN asks us, and in forms that will have to be agreed". In talks with British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe he examined industrial and technological cooperation. NATO's supreme European commander George Joulwan expressed gratitude for Italy's loan of air bases for operations in former Yugoslavia.
