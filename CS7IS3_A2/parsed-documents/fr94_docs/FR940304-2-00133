FR940304-2-00133 FR940304-2-00063 Vermont State Standards; Approval 1. Background Part 1953 of title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes procedures under section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (hereinafter called the Act) by which the Regional Administrator for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called Regional Administrator) under a delegation of authority from the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (hereinafter called the Assistant Secretary), (29 CFR 1953.4), will review and approve standards promulgated pursuant to a State Plan, which has been approved in accordance with section 18(c) of the Act and 29 CFR part 1902. On October 16, 1973, notice was published in the Federal Register (38 FR 28658) of the approval of the Vermont State Plan and the adoption of subpart U to part 1952 containing the decision. The Vermont State Plan provides for the adoption of Federal standards as State standards after: a. Publishing for two (2) successive weeks, in three (3) newspapers having general circulation in the center, northern and southern parts of the State, an intent to amend the State Plan by adopting the standard(s). b. Review of standards by the Interagency Committee on Administrative Rules, State of Vermont. c. Approval by the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, State of Vermont. d. Filing in the Office of the Secretary of State, State of Vermont. e. The Secretary of State publishing, not less than quarterly, a bulletin of all standard(s) adopted by the State. The Vermont State Plan provides for the adoption of State standards which are at least as effective as comparable Federal standards promulgated under section 6 of the Act. By letter dated December 2, 1993, from Barbara G. Ripley, Commissioner, Vermont Department of Labor and Industry, to John B. Miles, Jr., Regional Administrator; and incorporated as part of the plan, the State submitted updated State standards identical to 29 CFR parts 1910, 1915, 1926 and 1928, and subsequent amendments thereto, as described below: (1) Correction to 29 CFR parts 1910, 1915, 1926 and 1928, Occupational Exposure to Cadmium; Correction; Final Rule (58 FR 21778, dated 4/23/93). (2) Amendment and addition to 29 CFR 1926.62, Lead Exposure in Construction, Interim Final Rule (58 FR 26627, dated 5/4/93). These standards became effective on November 19, 1993, pursuant to section 224 of State Law. 2. Decision The above State standards have been reviewed and compared with the relevant Federal standard. It has been determined that the State standard is identical to the Federal standard, and is accordingly approved. 3. Location of Supplement for Inspection and Copying A copy of the standards supplements, along with the approved plan, may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: Office of the Regional Administrator, 133 Portland Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02114; Office of the Commissioner, State of Vermont, Department of Labor and Industry, 120 State Street, Montpelier, Vermont, 05602; and the Office of State Programs, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N&hyph;3700, Washington, DC 20210. 4. Public Participation Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c), the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for other good cause which may be consistent with applicable laws. The Assistant Secretary finds that good cause exists for not publishing the supplement to the Vermont State Plan as a proposed change and making the Regional Administrator's approval effective upon publication for the following reason: 1. The standards were adopted in accordance with the procedural requirements of the State Law which included public comment, and further public participation would be repetitious. This decision is effective March 4, 1994. Authority: Sec. 18, Public Law 91&hyph;596, 84 Stat. 1608 (29 U.S.C. 667). Signed at Boston, Massachusetts, this 3rd day of January, 1994. John B. Miles, Jr., Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5012 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;M
