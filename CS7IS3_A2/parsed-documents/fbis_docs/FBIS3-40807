Then came Mr. John Malott's speech telling India how it should conduct its domestic and regional policy, which was remarkable not for its content but its eschewal of a two-year epoch of private diplomacy that was the best indicator of warming Indo-U.S. relations, and a return to public postures and rhetoric. Then came Ms. Robin Raphel's extraordinary remark that the U.S. no longer believed that the Simla agreement provided a framework for settling the Kashmir dispute, because very few discussions had taken place under the agreement in the past 20 years. One could say as much about the border between the U.S. and Mexico. We will pass over Ms. Raphel's gaffe on the Instrument of Accession: A close look at the text of her statement shows that she was caught unawares and did not realise the full implication in international law of what she was saying. But only days later we heard that the Administration intends to withdraw the Pressler amendment and replace it with a new comprehensive foreign aid law that will apply the Pressler-type restrictions to all non-NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) countries and even those signatories (read China) that are seeking to expand their nuclear arsenals. India will, of course be included in the first category. And, as if our cup of woe was still not full we had to listen to Mr. Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human rights, who told an Indian newsman that the U.S. disapproved of India's Human rights record in Kashmir, and did not believe that a nation's right to put down insurgency excused, let alone justified, some abrogation of these rights. At any normal time, such sustained, public arm-twisting, would have signalled a deliberate decision by the U.S. to replace cooperation with pressure as the basis of dealing with India. But are these times normal in the U.S.? Are the postures it is adopting, not only towards India, but towards China, Japan, the EEC, and the United Nations on various issues, sustainable? Above all, do the pronouncements coming out of Washington reflect carefully worked out foreign policy positions, or are they products of `Gung Ho activists in the foreign policy establishment shooting from the hip'? The truth lies somewhere in between. And this is presenting New Delhi with a foreign policy dilemma that it may understand but has, clearly, not been able to resolve. So far New Delhi has carefully refrained from any public posturing and its communications with the U.S. have been carried on strictly within diplomatic channels, (although paraphrased in the press). The tone of its communications, except on the issue of the Instrument of Accession, has also been markedly moderate. This would have been the correct response, had the U.S. got its foreign policy act together. But if its policy is being made largely by individuals shooting from the hip, then moderation is just the wrong attitude to have adopted, for it has made India appear defensive on issues like Human rights, Kashmir and to a lesser extent, NPT, and has encouraged activists like Ms. Raphel and Mr. Shattuck to think that they can push this country around, a belief that Ms. Raphel has not bothered to hide. The truth is that just at this moment the U.S. does not have a clearly articulated foreign policy, except in one or two areas such as supporting economic reform in Russia, de-nuclearisation (again mainly in the former Soviet Union), and freer trade. Two of even these have gone grievously wrong with the elections in Russia. Outside these core areas, the Clinton administration has only vaguely formed attitudes pushed by public opinion manipulated by the media, whom Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher has described somewhat querulously as the aspiring North Star of American policy. Thus it does not like Human rights violations; it wants all countries to sign the NPT, and put their facilities under fullscope safeguards; it wants a cleaner environment, and it reserves its right to use bilateral trade pressure to secure concessions in selected areas of trade, notably intellectual property rights. It wants global stability, brokered by itself and the NATO where it feels it more directly threatened, and according to the U.S. permanent Representative to the U.N., Ms. Madeleine Albright, by the U.N., which it considers a junior partner, where it does not. India could not fail to be at the receiving end of nearly all these concerns, despite the fact that it shares most of them, because any attempt to force one country's views and `solutions' on another, ends by denying the latter a large part of its sovereignty. In effect the message being sent to India is `join us and we will look after you; resist us and we will press down on and eventually hurt you.' The choice might have been a real one if these concerns had reflected deeply felt convictions and not just vague attitudes. But this is far from being the case. On Human rights no less an organisation than the American Human Rights Watch has condemned the Clinton administration of adopting double standards, pressing for their observance where no other national interest is involved, and giving them the go by when there is. It has specifically indicted Mr. Clinton's record in this respect towards Israel as being worse than Mr. George Bush's. The U.S. has adopted double standards in a more fundamental way: In Somalia its helicopter gunships blew away somewhere between 150 and 300 Somali civilians in a retaliatory attack designed to kill Aideed, for the killing of a single U.S. soldier by one of his gunmen. The U.S. spokesman said that in such an operation there were no innocent bystanders. And when Mr. Keith Richburg of the Washington Post investigated the casual killing of a Malaysian CARE worker by a U.N. patrol while he was out buying his lunch, the U.N. command said `Guerillas fire from crowds. They use women and children as human shields. There are bound to be civilian casualties when U.N. troops fire back in self-defence.' Does that sound familiar Mr. Shattuck? On the role of the U.N. as a world policeman, realism, burst the media's pipe-dream of a new world order when none other than President Clinton decided to pull U.S. troops out of Somalia after the killing of 18 soldiers, and to start political talks with Aideed and the other warlords. Within the U.N. Secretariat, disillusionment with the forward policies that have been thrust on the organisation by the rich nations in the heady afterglow of the Gulf War is complete. There is a total consensus that the U.N. must not undertake any more military actions under the mandatory chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, and that even supervisory or humanitarian actions under chapter 6, will not be possible if national contingent commanders do not place themselves unreservedly under the U.N. commandant. Ms. Madeleine Albright's September dream of U.S.-U.N. partnership is already light years out of date. The administration's lack of commitment reflects an even more profound lack of interest in the American public. In civilised drawing rooms from Washington to Cambridge, no one is talking about foreign policy. What true American liberals are appalled about is the crime bill that has been rushed through Congress. Children over 13 will now be treated as adults and can be sentenced to death mandatorily on as many as 19 (or is it 29) counts. The passage of this bill has focussed attention as nothing else could have on the internal social problems of the country -- the growing racial divide, the violence, crime and decay in the inner cities; the growing inequalities in health care, the fact that a large part of the population has grown poorer in the Eighties and Nineties; the rise in highly educated white collar unemployment, and the deterioration in the status of blue collar workers all over the country. These are Mr. Clinton's real worries, and he has unabashedly little time to spare for a foreign policy that is no longer rooted in an acute sense of national insecurity. But the foreign policy establishment is a leftover of the old days when this was where the best and the brightest went. Activism is therefore part of its very blood. But it is now activism without a guiding beacon, or a steady restraining hand. So every one is shooting from the hip. New Delhi may choose not to shoot back but it must show that it has little respect for Washington's cowboys. And, it must rebuild its relations with China.
