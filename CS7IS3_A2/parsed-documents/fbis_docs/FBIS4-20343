More than 1,00 directorate-grade officers were asked about their plans. Thirty five per cent said they wanted to leave government service after 1997. Also, 60 per cent trusted the monitoring role of the Legislative Council, saying they would find it difficult to adjust to China sovereignty, against 17 per cent expressing confidence in the accountability of the China authorities. The overall conclusion seemed to be a negative one where civil servants' confidence in the future is concerned. "There is strong resentment against political interference from China," the poll found. "A sense of impotence is evident among senior bureaucrats." In the light of the division in the civil service, as in the public -- occasioned by the ongoing Sino-British tug-of-war -- the survey was not altogether surprising. But there is no need to panic. One aspect of the statistics is interesting and could have some hidden meaning. The results said that 77 per cent of those surveyed held foreign passports -- 66 per cent of these being of the exclusively "home" British variety. It is to be assumed that those intending to leave the civil service will not be lost to Hong Kong completely but will be seeking opportunities in the private sector. Ideology But even should the 350-odd senior-rankers make good their intention, there should be no undue cause for alarm. There are substantially more people in the civil service with commitments to Hong Kong as a place secure and stable enough for a contented livelihood, than those influenced by ideology. Throughout the 45-year history of this newspaper, we have constantly observed and remarked on the ever-inflationary trend of the government bureaucracy. It has been our view, that the government tended always to ensure its own safety in numbers, disregarding the consequences to taxpayers. In recent years, and as we grind on towards 1997, there have been more reasons for the government to enlarge and fatten itself, this time with less inhibition -- the public is preoccupied with successive political crises. The civil service and its problems are a rice-bowl issue that should command a higher priority. Government service today is the envy of many wage earners. It is not convincing to the average man in the street, that government employment with all its protective and even pampering perks, will not be able to retain or attract what Hong Kong needs to maintain its civil service at the present par of efficiency at least. There is nothing worthwhile without some amount of risk. Government service is worthwhile. Furthermore, the risk is clearly addressed in the assurances which the Basic Law provides.
