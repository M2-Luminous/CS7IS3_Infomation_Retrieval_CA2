Japanese officials who participated in the negotiations said the two sides spent an "endless" length of time exchanging ideas on drawing up a mutually acceptable draft, but said no agreement is in sight. A major sticking point that has bogged down a series of working-level negotiations that began last September is a U.S. demand for numerical benchmarks to measure import penetration in Japanese markets. "There was no progress in this area," a Japanese official said. Medical equipment procurement is one of four priority market sectors under the Japan-U.S. framework trade accord concluded last July. The two governments have promised to come up with an agreement by the time Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets with President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. Japanese officials said the two sides plan to meet again to discuss medical equipment procurement, but no date has been set. Trade negotiators from the two countries are scheduled to hold talks in Japan next week on the insurance and automobile markets. Neither Japanese nor U.S. officials appear optimistic of an early breakthrough. "There was no movement at all on the quantitative and qualitative indicators," a senior U.S. trade official said Friday of the telecommunications framework negotiations. U.S. officials say Washington wants to introduce a multiple set of yardsticks to peg import penetration in Japan to the other industrial countries. Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. proposal, saying Japan cannot accept any criteria that "smack of market share." The framework talks were only one set of trade negotiations that took place in Washington between Japan and the U.S. on Friday. While Japanese and U.S. negotiators huddled at the Commerce Department over medical technology, another group of officials met at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to review the purchase of foreign telecommunications equipment by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT]. A senior U.S. trade official who spoke to Japanese reporters following the NTT session said while Washington is pleased with the progress in the amount of foreign equipment purchased by NTT in recent years, the U.S. feels the foreign share "should be significantly higher." According to Japanese figures, the amount of telecom equipment purchased by NTT from foreign suppliers increased to 100 billion yen in fiscal 1992 from 80 billion yen in fiscal 1991. Japanese officials said the foreign suppliers accounted for 14 percent of the high-tech equipment sourced by NTT in fiscal 1992, compared with 11 percent in fiscal 1991.
