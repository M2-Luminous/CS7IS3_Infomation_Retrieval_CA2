Similarly, Readers' Digest, a well-known U.S. magazine, was shocked when it discovered a popular Chinese periodical with the same name. And the world-renowned London-based newspaper Financial Times spotted a newspaper in Beijing using exactly the same name. The two Chinese publications were later changed into "Readers" and "Financial News" as China strengthens the protection of foreign property rights. For many foreigners doing business in China, one of the biggest headaches is protecting their trademarks and patents. All too often, brand names are stolen or fake products enter the market, hurting company sales. Fortunately, overseas companies are happy to see that the Chinese Government is making great efforts to protect their property rights. "The framework of China's laws provides protection which is as good as that of other Asian countries," said Jingzhou Tao, lawyer with the Beijing office of the American law firm Coudert Brothers, which was the first foreign law office allowed to practice in China. China has also signed major international conventions in the area such as the Paris Convention in 1985, the Madrid Agreement for the International Registration of Marks in 1989, the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention in 1992, and the Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms in 1993. "Intellectual property protection in China has undeniably improved throughout the past decade," Tao said. "At least more and more Chinese people are talking about this issue ." Meanwhile, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has intensified steps to crack down on counterfeiting and has achieved visible results. For example, the trademark W & W's, produced by a factory in Zhejiang Province, is no longer used. China now protects not only registered brands, but also packaging, such as the bottling of cognac. "However, we should admit that the enhancement [as published] of these laws requires much more time than the drafting and elaboration of the laws themselves," Tao said. He said the anti-counterfeiting efforts will be more effective if China imposes tougher punishment on violators. To prevent fake products, foreign investors should register their trademarks, patents, software and company names as soon as they enter China, Tao said. And before legal action is taken, it may sometimes be more effective to pursue informal measures such as sending a warning letter or meeting with an infringer since they may be unaware they are violating the law, he said. Victims may also approach the People's Court directly. Some cities, such as Beijing, have established intellectual property chambers.
