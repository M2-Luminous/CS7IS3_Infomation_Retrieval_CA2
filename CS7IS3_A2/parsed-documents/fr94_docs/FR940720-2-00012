FR940720-2-00012 FR940720-2-00007 Seamless standard pipes are most commonly produced to the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification and generally are not intended for high temperature service. They are intended for the low temperature and pressure conveyance of water, steam, natural gas, air and other liquids and gasses in plumbing and heating systems, air conditioning units, automatic sprinkler systems, and other related uses. Standard pipes (depending on type and code) may carry liquids at elevated temperatures but must not exceed relevant ASME code requirements. Seamless line pipes are intended for the conveyance of oil and natural gas or other fluids in pipe lines. Seamless line pipes are produced to the API 5L specification. Seamless pipes are commonly produced and certified to meet ASTM A&hyph;106, ASTM A&hyph;53 and API 5L specifications. Such triple certification of pipes is common because all pipes meeting the stringent A&hyph;106 specification necessarily meet the API 5L and ASTM A&hyph;53 specifications. Pipes meeting the API 5L specification necessarily meet the ASTM A&hyph;53 specification. However, pipes meeting the A&hyph;53 or API 5L specifications do not necessarily meet the A&hyph;106 specification. To avoid maintaining separate production runs and separate inventories, manufacturers triple certify the pipes. Since distributors sell the vast majority of this product, they can thereby maintain a single inventory to service all customers. The primary application of ASTM A&hyph;106 pressure pipes and triple certified pipes is in pressure piping systems by refineries, petrochemical plants and chemical plants. Other applications are in power generation plants (electrical-fossil fuel or nuclear), and in some oil field uses (on shore and off shore) such as for separator lines, gathering lines and metering runs. A minor application of this product is for use as oil and gas distribution lines for commercial applications. These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A&hyph;106 pipes may be used in some boiler applications. The scope of this investigation includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of this investigation. Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A&hyph;106, A&hyph;53, or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A&hyph;106, A&hyph;335, A&hyph;53, or API 5L application. For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics, could potentially be used in A&hyph;106 applications. These specifications include A&hyph;162, A&hyph;192, A&hyph;210, A&hyph;333, and A&hyph;524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products are covered by the scope of this investigation. Specifically excluded from this investigation are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing, and oil country tubular goods except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from this investigation are redraw hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.
