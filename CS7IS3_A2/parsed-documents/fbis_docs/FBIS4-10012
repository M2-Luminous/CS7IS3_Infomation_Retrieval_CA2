Amorim was received by President Jiang Zemin and vice premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, among several other high-ranking Chinese officials. He negotiated an agreement on principles about aerospace cooperation, which will be signed by President Itamar Franco in May during his official visit to Beijing. One of Minister Amorim's most fruitful meetings was the one with Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the state Economic and Trade Commission. Zhongyu showed special interest in a joint venture [two preceding words in English] project at Carajas [Para State]. The project involves the construction of a deep-water port in the PRC with the capacity to receive large cargo (300,000 metric tons) vessels. Minister Wang also showed interest in Minister Amorim's request that special attention be given to Brazilian companies' desire to participate in PRC biddings in the areas of infrastructure and telephone systems. Brazil and the PRC, which are celebrating the 20th anniversary of their diplomatic relations' resumption, are intensifying cooperation in the scientific and technological fields. Brazil proposed the reactivation of the bilateral agreement for cooperation in the nuclear field, which was signed in 1984, and reiterated the importance of the project for the construction of ground observation satellites (CBERS [China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite] Program).
