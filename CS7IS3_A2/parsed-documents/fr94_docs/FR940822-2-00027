FR940822-2-00027 FR940822-2-00019 CIPCO will provide electric energy to the steel mill. However, to deliver the electric energy to the steel mill, utilization of Iowa-Illinois' transmission facilities and the construction of new transmission facilities by CIPCO will be required. The Facilities Schedules provide for the utilization, construction and modification of these facilities. CIPCO plans to serve IPSCO's steel mill through two transmission sources utilizing Iowa-Illinois' transmission facilities. One source will require CIPCO to convert an existing 69 kV line between Iowa-Illinois' Substation 56 and CIPCO's Fair Station to 161 kV, disconnect the line at Fair Station and connect it to the IPSCO Substation. The other source will require CIPCO to construct a new 345 kV transmission line extending from the new Walcott Substation and terminating at the IPSCO Substation adjacent to the steel mill. Under Facilities Schedule No. 3, CIPCO's new line will interconnect at the Walcott Substation with Iowa-Illinois's 345 kV transmission line which extends from Hills Substation to Substation 56. CIPCO will own Walcott Substation and Iowa-Illinois will operate and maintain the substation at CIPCO's expense. The portion of the transmission service which uses the interconnection at Substation 56 will be provided pursuant to the Agreement for Interconnection of Transmission Facilities dated March 4, 1963 entered into by Iowa-Illinois, Iowa Electric Light and Power Company (predecessor in interest to IES Utilities Inc.) and Eastern Iowa Light and Power Cooperative (predecessor in interest to CIPCO). The remaining transmission service will be provided as required by Facilities Schedule No. 3. Under Facilities Schedule No. 4, Iowa-Illinois will supply all energy required at CIPCO's Blue Grass REC Substation to the Point of Connection between CIPCO and Iowa-Illinois. CIPCO will deliver an equivalent amount of energy including losses on a scheduled basis to Iowa-Illinois at the Point of Connection. The Facilities Schedules provide that they will be effective upon their acceptance for filing by the Commission. Iowa-Illinois requests the Commission to accept the Facilities Schedules for filing by November 30, 1994. Copies of the filing were served upon the Illinois Commerce Commission, the Iowa Utilities Board and CIPCO.
