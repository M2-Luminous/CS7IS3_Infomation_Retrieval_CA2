Idiz] [Text] Ankara -- The Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan is seeking help from Turkey. It claims that there is a systematic campaign of repression against it in the Autonomous Azeri Republic of Nakhichevan by the government in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Asaf Guliyev, the leader of the Popular front in Nakhichevan, a tiny republic of 300,000 people bordering Turkey and Iran, told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN] that hundreds of their members and supporters had been arrested, their offices ransacked and their papers banned. Guliyev also indicated that the Nakhichevan Parliament still could not elect a speaker because its former speaker, Geydar Aliyev, who went on to become Azerbaijan's president, had not resigned. "This is aggravating an already unstable situation in Nakhichevan and leading to further political instability which is making it easier for Russia and Iran to interfere in our domestic affairs," Guliyev said. He claimed that the reason why the office of parliamentary speaker was not being vacated was because President Aliyev was worried that the Popular Front, or other opponents of the government, may occupy this position. "Any government that has signed the Charter of Paris and claims to subscribe to it should not be doing such things," Guliyev said referring to the government in Baku. He was referring to the charter regarding human rights that was adopted by members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Azerbaijan is a full member of the organization and as such has undertaken to comply with the standards set in the Charter of Paris of 1989. Contacted by the TDN on the Popular Front claims, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Ankara, Mamed Aliyev Novruz Ogly, denied that there were any political prisoners either in Azerbaijan or in Nakhichevan. "There are over 50 parties in Azerbaijan today and some of the most outspoken opponents of President Aliyev's are free to express their views," Nevruz Ogly said. "If there are any arrests, these are only associated with non- political crimes such as murder and fraud or with attempts at dividing the country, as in the case of the arrest of Alikram Gumbatov, who tried to set up an Islamic republic in Azerbaijan's Lenkoran region near Iran," Novruz Ogly added. Indicating that President Aliyev would be arriving in Ankara for an official visit on Feb. 8, Guliyev said this would provide a good opportunity for the Turkish government to bring these issues up with him. Guliyev pointed out that Aliyev would be addressing the Turkish Parliament as a guest of honor, only the second foreign leader to do so -- the first was Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktas. He added that they would be lobbying Turkish deputies also on the subject of Baku's repressive measures. Aliyev came to power last year after democratically elected President Abulfaz Elchibey -- who was also the leader of the Popular Front -- was ousted following a military rebellion in June 1993. Aliyev, who had moved to become speaker of the Azeri Parliament during the rebellion, assumed presidential powers when Elchibey fled Baku as rebels seeking his resignation threatened to storm the city. Although Turkey continued to support Elchibey, it shifted its support to Aliyev after he legitimized himself through a referendum that confirmed Elchibey's ouster, and elections which endorsed his presidency.
