Four newspapers and journals, including SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL], were closed down, and the units running these newspapers and journals were fined. While the stock market in Shanghai was developing, many books and journals about the stock market were published and sold well. Some units found that the business of publishing such material was profitable. They disregarded state laws and regulations, and illegally published and distributed these types of publications to the population. According to complaints made by the masses, the Huangpu District Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau discovered that some of the publications sold openly in front of various major securities companies in Shanghai were of questionable origin. Through the investigation of the Shanghai Press and Publications Administration, the four newspapers and journals, SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK NEWS], HUGU KUAIXUN [EXPRESS REPORT ON SHANGHAI STOCKS], SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL], AND CAITONG ZHOUXUN [WEEKLY FINANCIAL REPORT] were illegal publications which had been published without the approval of the relevant authorities. The industrial and commercial inspection team of Nanjing Road Central in Huangpu District recently inspected a university printing house, and confiscated the above- mentioned publications that had been printed there, including nearly 100,000 copies of the newspapers and 7,000 copies of the weekly journals. According to the investigation, SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO, run by a university in Shanghai, published 39 issues and nearly 1 million copies over the past six months; SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO, run by a research institute published 27 issues and nearly 1.09 million copies over last four months. The management over these publications was not orderly, and the income from their distribution was received in cash and was never entered in the accounting books. The publications were all distributed and sold by unlicensed hawkers. The responsible officials of the Shanghai publications and business administrations told reporters that no country in the world would permit the illegal publication of newspapers and journals which were not registered with the authorities. The departments concerned in Shanghai will continue to properly manage the publications market.
