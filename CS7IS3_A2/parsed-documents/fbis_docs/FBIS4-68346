One could see this especially clearly when that period was brought to an end--over there on the Moscow River embankment, by this blaze, this massacre... As a writer, a novelist, I felt that Russian history itself was writing a novel. Amazing people came through my editorial offices; their characters and internal relations developed. These relations turned into friendships, conflicts, enmity, and then people would come back together again. And the entire sequence of events entwined into some sort of knot, some plot, some suspenseful, frightening, mystical novel, which had to have a focus and a resolution. I was waiting for this, I repeat, not as a politician, but as an intuitivist. I expected this novel to end in tragedy: blood, grief, stoicism, some explosion of light-bearing energy. And during those days in September-October, when I was tied up in the newspaper process and in politics, meetings, intrigues, struggle, I was not able to grasp to the end or understand these events in the House of Soviets. Our meeting there, fleeting as if in a fog, when I walked into the room and you were sitting there, tired after a sleepless night; fleeting meetings with Achalov, Rutskoy, with our politician-friends, Sterligov, spies and saboteurs--all of this for me is still some mysterious, tangled web. It is very important for me to learn from you how you acted, how you lived, how you felt in the White House labyrinths--both your movement and you personally. What have you learned from this; what was your understanding of this process? [Barkashov] The events that are happening in our country are undoubtedly of a metaphysical nature. It is almost meaningless to try them on, appraise them from the standpoint of political gain. Unfortunately, many still have not understood this and are attempting to make political calculations and forecasts--all for the purpose of jumping to one side or the other in time and not ending up a loser. Time has already shown that those who were guided by this political reckoning lost in the long run. While those, I think, who were guided by intuitive feeling gained politically, although perhaps this was not their goal. And this knot, as you said, was being entwined not out of political expediency. I also was in contact with many people then. I worked rather closely with Sterligov and others... The search for political alliances brought satisfaction. There was this inner feeling--not only mine but also of my comrades--that some historic mystery was taking place in Russia, and we need to look for friends, strategic allies in exactly this, mystical spirit that permeated this event. Of course, we came to the White House not out of political considerations. It is just that there were concrete people, with whom we were friends, who saw the situation more or less the same way we did and tried to participate in it in order to move events in the direction they wanted. I remember your words: You were sitting at the table, visiting Achalov, and you said: "This is not our celebration yet, not our battle." Yes, it was not yet our battle; for instance, it would not have brought us a final political victory. But we had to try to influence events in such a way that sooner or later would make it our hour, our time. We had our view of it, our intentions, which perhaps were different from the intentions of others. But we could not stand back and not participate, and that is why we came to the White House. In principle, we could have left, acted differently even at the last moment, but we stayed there to the end knowing that a mystical event was taking place. Speaking of political underpinnings, however, we also anticipated the outcome. But, on the one hand, it is the outcome of the preceding stage, and on the other--the beginning of a new one. Is it not? Back in March, when all those Moscow brain-grinders were interviewing me: "How will you feel about it?...," "Whose side will you be on?" we said then that we will be on the side of those who raise the issue of the integrity of the state, defense of national interests, the issue of Russian people. Since it was the Supreme Soviet that did so, specifically Khasbulatov, who openly raised the issue of the problems of the Russian people, and also Rutskoy, we took their side, of course. We said that we will provide a full range of support--from moral to physical. Then also, I personally have great respect for General Achalov; we are rather close friends; I respect him as a Russian, a general, and a man of principle. [Prokhanov] What affected you most from the emotional standpoint during all these events? [Barkashov] You know, there were two moments. The first one was on 3 October, when people broke through to the White House. During the time of this whole stand-off since 21 September, when the parliament declared itself a defender of interests of the people and statehood and the enemy of those destroying it, they naturally wanted to attract to their side large numbers of people. The public mind in principle was already receptive to the idea of statehood and national interests. So on 3 October these people came. I estimated their number at 100,000. Later, talking to foreign journalists who have a better eye for this, I learned that 500,000 people came. You saw it for yourself: They were not lumpen, as we were told; they were the cream of Moscow, mainly young people between 17 and 25 and mature men, 35 and older. Clear, pure faces--distorted, of course, somewhat by emotions and the heat of battle, but, I repeat, this was the cream of Moscow. Workers, officers--whose who make up the foundation of the state. So they came, this half a million people, and the parliament, which wanted them there, and the leaders of this stand-off did not succeed in organizing the actions of those who came to their aid. On the one hand, they wanted it; on the other--they were caught unprepared. On 3 October, when all this happened in such a disorganized and chaotic manner, one could see that there were some with a lot of personal ambition, their own calculations; at the same time, the people who came to their aid were united by a common sense of support. And this, so to say, disparity between those who had urged them to come and those who came was especially noticeable. In principle, the situation was controllable and much could be directed differently. This is when I experienced--not even disappointment, but a very strong emotion that it happened this way. The second moment was on 4 October, when at about noon we realized that we would not get out of there alive. I was very concerned for my people. They were doomed just like everyone else who was at the Supreme Soviet, but it was I who had brought them there, and therefore they were my responsibility. And of course, I was also concerned about the family. But then I thought that war is war, and there always are losses. These were the two most emotional moments of that period. [Prokhanov] After that physical defeat--because I believe that spiritually and morally we did not lose but win--you were stronger, stood taller, nobler; and heroes were among us, not among the "knights," OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments], and beytars... after that the next 10 days were terrible. I felt as if Moscow was black, sticky; that it had been surrendered to rapists. And all of this was done by the most cruel laws of a torture chamber. The nation was being raped; the people were being raped for the entire subsequent period, that is, the worst there is in a human being was being brought out: fear, animal fear, social fear. I remember how terrible it was to learn that Anpilov had been arrested--he was not able to disappear despite the fact that he represented one of the most secret organizations. Which means there is no secrecy, no organization, and what is there is defenselessness and helplessness... Konstantinov was arrested, although one would think that all he had to do was sit tight in a safe place and not venture anywhere. But some force--whether infantilism, madness, or anxiety and helplessness--compelled him to get out on the street, where he was immediately arrested. And I remember how everybody asked: "What about Barkashov? What about Barkashov?" No, Barkashov has not been arrested, he is hiding in the woods, he has survived. That Barkashov remained at large all those days inspired joy, hope that he would indeed get through this period of persecution and remain at the helm of his movement. And then this terrible news that there was an assassination attempt on you, you were shot and wounded, and ended up in the hands of oppressors. What can be more horrible than a wounded, helpless man finding himself in the hands of executioners, enemies? My heart was bleeding for you. Tell us about this incident; there are so many legends surrounding it, all sorts of versions, First, how did it all happen? [Barkashov] Everything happened more or less as described in the newspapers. I was walking at night on business of my own--there are such instances when you have to go alone--and I was shot at from a passing car. How many times--I cannot tell: three, two, one... I did not hear the shots. Simply felt a dull blow in the leg and several seconds later realized that I was wounded. The car disappeared without slowing down. This happened near Krasnogorskiy military hospital, and a passing car took me there, Since my condition was grave, I was immediately accepted. There I found myself among honest people, who conscientiously did what needed to be done. I ended up in the hands of enemies about 10 days later, when the information somehow leaked out. They were already looking for me. It appears that they knew more or less where to look, because there is no other explanation--I was under deep cover in this hospital: a different name, different papers... The time I spent in the hospital was hard only from the physical standpoint, because I was treated very well there. Later, in the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] and then in Sailor's Rest prison, it was also hard morally, but I came to the conclusion that there are people who share our views everywhere, and there are many more normal, good people than bad ones, even there. [Prokhanov] What is your own guess regarding that shot; what could it be? Beytars on a hunt, the MVD? An accident, a strange incident? [Barkashov] It is hard to tell. Usually armies, upon capturing a city, were given three days for looting; here they had three times three, since Moscow was let up for 10 days. At the time we received through our channels information from the MVD that there was a secret directive with respect to certain people on the wanted list. Do not take prisoners: stage resistance to arrest and an escape attempt. Therefore we were very cautious during that time; afterwards, we boosted our activities and perhaps relaxed; perhaps I personally relaxed. I believe that I myself made it easier: I had not been home for quite a while and decided to stop by. This is where they picked me up: They had external surveillance in place. Who was there--whether it was the MVD, militia, or beytars--they do not display signs on their cars. Until then I was out of their reach. Why they acted precisely this way, I do not know. Why they shot at me instead of arresting me. Maybe they wanted to kill me, or maybe to wound me first so that it would be easier to take me later--I cannot tell. Neither do I know who it was. But I had the impression somehow that is was a special MVD unit. [Prokhanov] Over the past three years since 1991 I have had a constant feeling that besides a contest of ideas, intrigues, and political potentials, a struggle of two principles is also going on. And perhaps we called ourselves a "newspaper of spiritual opposition" not so much because we do not have tank armies and airborne units, do not have our own spetsnaz, as because we clearly understood that victory, if we achieve it, must be won in the realm of the spirit, as if in heaven. And heaven can exist anywhere--in your soul and in your heart. And which spirit will turn out stronger: the spirit of darkness, the spirit of hell, the spirit of universal cunning, or the spirit of stoicism, the spirit of light, the spirit of eternal salutary goodwill goals and states. And we remember how during those terrible days of despondency, darkness, resistance, when it looked as if even unbending people were getting cold feet, people who had lived through wars, Afghanistan, suddenly disappeared, others turned into shrinking violets, when people were getting hysterical, there came your word, this expression of yours: "field of honor"--the message you addressed to the public. When I read it, it gave me many noble and bright moments. My friend Nevzorov told me the same thing. Aleksandr Glebovich also admired your message. It came as if from the rack, from a cross, operating table, torture chamber--a time when a person is expected to be silent, to moan, to groan. It was a spiritual phenomenon; it was a ray of light cutting through the walls of Sailor's Rest, and many perceived it precisely as proof of spiritual victory. I think that in prison you did not just suffer physically, not only were concerned about your family and comrades, but you definitely experienced a mystical state. I want to say once again: What came through to me in the brief words of your message was mystical, holy energy. Did you experience this state, or am I mistaken? [Barkashov] No, you are not mistaken. It was precisely in Sailor's Rest that I suddenly became convinced that this spiritual victory in heaven, as you have described it, had already been won. What contributed to it perhaps was my psychological state of mind and certain asceticism, cleansing of the spirit and body, because I practically did not eat and was exhausted. In such a condition, the spirit takes over the flesh; mystical horizons open for you. I prayed a lot then--very hard, with all my heart, and got a feeling of certainty that we had won. It became especially strong in the middle of February--that we had already won in spirit, and all that was left to do was implement it in a physical sense. It will be difficult, I think, but not as difficult as before. What is happening today in the camp of our enemies can be analyzed and presented this way and that way, of course. In truth, however, they also sense intuitively, with animal instinct, that they have lost the spiritual battle. So they are scattering like rats. I completely agree with you: There is always a struggle between good and evil, but in 1991-1993 it spilled onto the political level. This is the only way to look at the situation. And since it is this way, we are on the side of good, not evil, good in its ultimate manifestation. Time removes all pretenses, and no matter what our opponents say, no matter what values they use as a cover, one can see that they are demons. And we must defeat them. By political or any other means, but we must. [Prokhanov] In the final analysis all that drives us is concern for the state of our own soul, repentance for some sin--perhaps the original sin, perhaps the sin of a life lived iniquitously, and at the same time, concern and caring for the people. And thoughts about the people, a part of which each of us feels himself, and thoughts of one's own essence, spiritual nature, merge together, and frequently are inseparable. Today some say of the people: "they are asleep;" others say: "they are drinking themselves to death;" still others: "they have betrayed their mission, turned into a nation of money-grabbers, a nation of money changers. In reality, by their inner self--their mystery, their tenderness, their naivete, their virtue--they resemble a sleeping knight, who has covered himself with a shroud of Christ, a cloak. This cover may look like a horrible, disgusting rag or a garment made of foreign fabric in a foreign manner, but underneath it breathes the same eternal, mysterious, kindred and dear chest of a huge being sleeping--our people. He is having a dream in his sleep. And this is my dream, too; I also see this dream. [Barkashov] We all see this dream. [Prokhanov] Yes, we all do. It is a dream of some great memory, where there are many beautiful mysterious states coming from clean rivers, sorcerers making their way along these rivers, the first wondrous orthodox temples, snow-white on green hills, amazingly wise and kind old men--perhaps half-wizards, but also half-first Christians. This is one part of the dream, associated with the past, mystical and mysterious, which you do not even read about in fairy tales. The other part of the dream is the future. I see the same brilliant, light-giving, beautiful future. And it consists of shapes that are no longer archaic but symbolic--a huge building, cathedral, temple, land covered with flourishing cities and roads, where the people you love, brides, children, relatives, righteous men live. The country has been turned into a wondrous palace built by our labors. This is my vision of our future truth and our incarnation--perhaps very personal and subjective. Do you ever get such visions? If you see what I mean, what do you feel? [Barkashov] I understand you perfectly. It is common today among many Russians to look back into the past. It is the memory of the soul, the awakening of the archetype, which happens to the people at some stage, at the right moment. The dream of the future is linked with it, because they will have to break through to the future across everything that surrounds them now. This awakening happens at a time when it seems that there is no place to go, that everything is bound by artificial rules, marked by circumstances. It is at this point that man gets a vision of the past and the future. Many people are experiencing it today. Our people are at a borderline from which they are to break through, discarding all circumstances, all conventions imposed on them. And this future great endeavor is the reason the people have remained silent until now. Look, even democratic politicians are amazed: "How long can one keep the Russian beast, and keep humiliating it! Somewhere in Salvador they would have rioted a long time ago, and more than once, but Russians take everything." But this is all because the social factor will not be the dominant one in this accomplishment. It may provide momentum, start the movement, but the breakthrough will be achieved in the mystical, spiritual sphere. Our people are like no other people. A great future awaits them, as great as their past. And therefore at a certain stage politicians will no longer be able to influence the general course no matter how much they want to; they will not be able to speculate on the issues of the day, direct the movement--it will not longer be in their hands. It will be an explosion of popular mysticism, which will provide the energy for building the state. And it will be a breakthrough into the future. It is wonderful that many have already developed this feeling. This means we have already approached this borderline, we are already close to it. By the way, speaking about mysticism, this year Orthodox Easter coincides with Walpurgis night, when the most powerful occult magic operations take place. This is further evidence that this year is especially mystical in the sense of the struggle between good and evil and will be a decisive one... [Prokhanov] Nevertheless, you and I are not only Orthodox mystics, not only monks who have taken the vows of schema or zealots--we are politicians, and we know what a political organization is; we are concerned with the problem of creating powerful patriotic movements. I remember the siege of the Writers House in 1991. You were there, too... Since then, rather energetic attempts have been made to create a large patriotic nationalist party, a right-wing party, a party of the white idea. These efforts have not succeeded to this day. There are numerous small movements, initiatives, and groups that are very attractive by their membership and ideology--not only in Moscow but also in the provinces; there have been attempts to unite all these forces--first in the Pamyat, then in the Slavic Assembly, then in the Russian National Assembly, the National Salvation Front [NSF], the Congress... But we still have not pulled ourselves together into a right-wing healthy conservative party encompassing the nation. What, in your opinion, stands in the way of creating such a party? Is it the result of the social factor, meaning that it is very difficult to build a stable political organism in a disintegrating socium; or is it the result of some psychological confusion of the nation as a whole? Or perhaps our people simply are not prone to uniting into a traditional type party? Is it that the people have different forms of self-organization, different forms of collective self-rule? [Barkashov] First, I would like to point out that such a party must have a powerful base in the most socially organized groups of society. It should not be, for instance, a group of intellectuals and "politicians" who get together and decide what to do, vote, elect a leadership--and go no further than that. The main factor in realizing the idea proclaimed by the Congress of Patriotic Forces, the Russian Assembly, or the NSF are the Russian people, who are part of different social groups and live in different conditions of existence. In order for a party to become a mass organization, popular, and capable, we need to first and foremost create an ideology, then a grass-roots organizational structure through which to promote this ideology, and then finally build on this an organization in politically promising social groups. At this stage it is, of course, numerous groups, with little money, going through difficulties because of the current processes, and united by a social attribute. In my opinion, it is first and foremost the military, workers, and the youth. This is where we should look for support. The failure of all attempts to unite into a single party can be explained perhaps by the fact that objectively these groups were not yet ready to accept the ideas offered to them. While sympathizing with the ideas, they had not yet been brought to such a state as to truly accept them, absorb them, and then reinforce them in the form of creating organizations. I think that now they are ready for this. I have participated in many congresses and know the standard fare: get them together; proclaim. And personal ambitions: Who sits in the presidium, who will be in charge of this or that. Everything is parceled out, and in two weeks all work already dies down. For some reason secondary things always get confused with priorities. A priority is to prepare the soil, to implant the program, ideology, create a social base, and only then a congress--as a final stage, as a result of what has been achieved. We did it in reverse order: first a congress--as soon as we proclaim, state, advertise ourselves, everybody will learn about us and run to us--and right away we will have an organization. I have always tried to explain that a congress, a conference is the final stage of work. But everything was done the other way around. Many of those who participated in the congresses did not sincerely trust the leadership. Hence all these conflicts and ambitions. Because to start serious business with people who have different motives, who are cunning, for instance, does not make any sense--it dooms us all to defeat before we even start. Now perhaps the time has come for a national movement. We have seen each other--those who truly are sincere, able, who resonate with us in spirit... At the time this was not the case. At the time, we could not sort it all out without trials and errors... [Prokhanov] I am labeled a fascist--as are you. And my friends, my newspaper are in a way demonized by this label. By itself, the term is neither good nor bad. Actually, I still do not know what fascism is. There are several varieties of political regimes, political trends that are classified as such. Some remained theoretical constructions--such as, for instance, the Kharbin version of Russian fascism; others, such as the Italian version, remained in the shadow of the more powerful European national-socialist movement, with which all negative aspects of fascism are associated. For instance, Latin American variants, which also are called fascism, are completely exotic and absolutely unsuitable for Russian soil... [Barkashov] If we look at it closer, you will see that the negative points are being over-emphasized, while positive fascism--such as, for instance, in Argentina--nobody mentions... [Prokhanov] Nobody mentions Argentina, or Brazil for that matter. Neither is anyone talking about the American postwar period, which provided stability, some features of which were close to components of fascism... After the September-October events Yeltsin established what seems to be a "new Russian order." He thinks that he has established it, and he is now the master of the next period in Russian history. In reality, Yeltsin belongs with the post-Soviet period and is already finished, even though he may rule for another two or three years. As a political figure, Yeltsin is done; he has gone to rot; he is not there, and those who want to take power after him are now surfacing. For me, such a dark figure personifying very gloomy, cruel parts of our history is Luzhkov with his Moscow group, his banks, where 70 percent of all capital in Russia is concentrated and which he controls through commercial and economic structures. MOST [BRIDGE] is the main one among them. A bridge to where--to hell or to Manhattan? Everything associated with MOST is shrouded in mystery and apparently criminal secrecy. Luzhkov is gang formations, extremely well equipped--many of them shot at us on the 3 and 4 October--ruthless and cruel, well set-up, billeted in Moscow. Luzhkov is an instant party, a party of the "majority," which is ensuring for itself a political infrastructure. Luzhkov is influence on the highest echelons of the military, to a large extent corrupt and incensed and also representing semi-mafiosi organisms that have merged with similar civilian structures. Luzhkov--and this is the most dangerous part--is a gentleman standing in a temple, standing in front of an icon holding a candle. Luzhkov is a gentleman who contributes billions to the Russian zemstvo movement, who supports and saves impoverished provincial writers and artists... For me, these groups, which are thirsting to take a dominant place in Russia, are a synonym for everything most negative, cruel, ruthless, colored, strange as it may sound, by the ethnic national idea. This is fascism; this is the real evil and trouble... As to your movement, along with other small nationalist, well organized movements, I see it more as a kind of an order, semi-military--semi-monk perhaps; an order of Orthodox secularity; in your actions there is an equal share of the political as of the religious and spiritual. How would you yourself describe your movement and the stage it is currently going through? [Barkashov] Speaking of Luzhkov's criminal formations, they do represent a certain danger. But Luzhkov himself, who, like Yeltsin, belongs to the post-Soviet, Gorbachev period, also is spoiled meat. It is another matter that they may promote someone less stained, because they will be playing along with trends that are promising from the point of view of mass psychology. They do it deliberately, without that inner state that exists within the masses, and the latter will not accept them. If they attempt, however, to hook up to powerful collective energies, they will simply burn up. It is the same as plugging a telephone into a 220V outlet. So far, good technical equipment is giving them a tactical advantage. But when these energies mature, I think, they will be powerless. They can fool once again the already fooled people, give them more promises. But when that particular archetype that we have discussed awakens in the people; when people become aware of themselves; when a community of individual energies develops, which turns into a collective one, they can no longer deceive, win, or rule. They will be doomed, no matter how much they cling to power. Yes, it is annoying to part with stolen millions, Mercedes, and dachas. It is annoying to face trials. And frightening. But it is inevitable. Looking at events through a mystical prism, we are not afraid of them, although politically and technically we are still facing a tough battle against them. Right now, speaking of the current state of our organization, we are going through a period where its solid nucleus is turning into a broad political movement. We have felt that social groups are ready to accept our ideology. We already have the organizational skills, the needed number of organizers to enable us to quickly become a mass movement. But we do not want this movement to be a mere backdrop for one-time use--we want it to be politically mobile, well organized, and with good enough discipline... [Prokhanov] And in conclusion--about your health. How is your leg? I can see how unaccustomed you are to holding these crutches. When will you be physically rehabilitated? [Barkashov] Aleksandr Andreyevich, with your prayers... And ours, too. Anyway, everything is fine...
