FR940913-2-00041 FR940913-2-00027 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;751&hyph;000, et al.] Transwestern Pipeline Co., et al., Natural Gas Certificate Filings September 6, 1994. Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Transwestern Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;751&hyph;000] Take notice that on August 30, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), Post Office Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188 filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for an order granting permission and approval to abandon certain facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Transwestern states that while preparing for further proceedings in its refunctionalization proceeding in Docket No. CP94&hyph;254&hyph;000, and upon further analysis of its system in response to the gathering orders recently issued by the Commission, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including certain compressors, plants, meters, dehydrators, and other miscellaneous wellhead facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. It is stated that this abandonment requests authorization to abandon certain compression, plants, metering, dehydration, and other miscellaneous facilities, and to secure all other authorizations as may be required under the circumstances. Transwestern states that it is proposing to abandon a number of compressors because the wells upstream have been plugged and abandoned by the producer and deliveries of gas have ceased. It is stated that other compression facilities will be abandoned because the wellhead pressure has fallen below the level necessary for the gas to enter Transwestern's facilities or gas can no longer enter Transwestern's system because the producer disconnected the well. In certain instances, Transwestern contends that the well has been split connected or disconnected because the producer has opted to transport the gas through another pipeline with a lower pressure line. Transwestern submits that abandonment of other compressors is requested because the volumes of gas from the wells behind the compressors have fallen to below the minimum level required for operation of the compressors. According to Transwestern, abandonment of some of the compressors is requested because the facilities are no longer needed for one of the following reasons: (i) The gathering system behind the compressor was sold and there are no volumes flowing into the Transwestern system; (ii) the producer decided to provide its own compression; (iii) an exchange arrangement with another pipeline was terminated, and compression is no longer required or necessary; (iv) Transwestern's line pressure was lowered to the point that compression is no longer required; or (v) at stations where there are multiple units, the volume decreased to the point that one or more such units are not required. Transwestern also proposes to abandon six plants, three because the producers have chosen to install their own treating facilities for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, and therefore, the plants are no longer necessary. For the remaining three plants, Transwestern states that one will be abandoned because the wells requiring hydrogen sulfide removal have been plugged and abandoned, one will be abandoned because the production behind the plant no longer consists of sour gas requiring hydrogen sulfide removal, and the third will be abandoned its operation is no longer economically feasible due to a substantial decrease of volumes flowing through the plant. Transwestern states that it also proposes to abandon meters, dehydrators, and associated facilities because no gas has flowed through the subject facilities since 1990, and it is quite certain that no gas will flow through the facilities in the future. Comment date: September 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
