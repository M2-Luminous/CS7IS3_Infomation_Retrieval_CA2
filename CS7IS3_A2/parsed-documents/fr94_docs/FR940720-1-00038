FR940720-1-00038 FR940720-1-00010 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [FRL&hyph;5013&hyph;8] Redesignation of the Yavapai-Apache Reservation to a PSD Class I Area; State of Arizona AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of public comment period. SUMMARY: The purpose of this action is to extend the period for public comment on the request by the Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation (``the Reservation'') in the State of Arizona to Class I under EPA's regulations for prevention of significant deterioration of air quality. The Class I designation will result in lowering the allowable increases in ambient concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide on the Reservation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Jessica Gaylord, Air and Toxics Division (A&hyph;5&hyph;1), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105&hyph;3901. Supporting information used in developing the proposed rule and materials submitted to EPA relevant to the proposed action are available for public inspection and copying at the docket address listed above during normal business hours. A reasonable fee may be charged for copying. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jessica Gaylord, Air and Toxics Division (A&hyph;5&hyph;1), U.S. EPA, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105&hyph;3901, (415) 744&hyph;1256. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Part C of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') provides for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality. The intent of this part is to prevent deterioration of existing air quality, particularly in areas considered to be pristine. The Act provides for three basic classifications applicable to all lands of the United States. Associated with each classification are increments which represent the maximum allowable increase in ambient air pollutant concentrations above a baseline concentration. A Class I designation is the most protective of the three classifications, with the lowest amount of allowable increases in pollutant concentrations. Class II applies to areas in which pollutant increases accompanying moderate growth would be allowed. Class III applies to those areas in which considerably more air quality deterioration would be considered acceptable. Section 164 of the Act and the federal regulations set forth at 40 CFR 52.21(g) contain the procedural requirements for redesignation of areas under the PSD program. The Act provides that lands within the exterior boundaries of reservations of federally recognized Indian tribes may be redesignated only upon request by the appropriate Indian Governing Body. Under section 164(b)(2) and 40 CFR 52.21(g)(5), EPA may disapprove a request for redesignation only if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the redesignation request does not meet the procedural requirements of section 164 and 40 CFR 52.21(g). On December 17, 1993, the Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council (herein referred to as ``the Tribal Council'') submitted to EPA a request to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation from Class II to Class I. EPA reviewed this request and determined that it met the procedural requirements of Section 164 of the Act and 40 CFR 52.21(g). On April 18, 1994, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register which proposed to approve the request and solicited public comment regarding whether the Tribal Council had met the procedural requirements. 59 FR 18346. Please refer to this Federal Register notice for further information regarding this proposed rulemaking. EPA held a public hearing on the request for redesignation on June 22, 1994. Following the public hearing, a request to extend the public comment period was made. By this notice, the public comment period is extended to August 22, 1994. The public is invited to comment on whether the Tribal Council has met all the procedural requirements of section 164 of the Act and 40 CFR 52.21(g). Comments should be submitted to the address listed in the ADDRESSES section of this document. Public comments received by August 22, 1994 will be considered in the final rulemaking action taken by EPA. Administrative Review The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The proposed action affects only major stationary sources, as defined by 40 CFR 52.21, will not result in any additional requirements for small entities. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
