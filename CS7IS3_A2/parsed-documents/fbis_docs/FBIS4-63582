The West Considers that the Security System Is Impaired without Russia, but Is in No Hurry To Grant It Special Status"] [Text] On 24 May Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev will deliver a report to the session of North Atlantic bloc defense ministers in Brussels on Russia's terms for signing the Partnership for Peace program. According to the Russian mass media, the report was prepared jointly by the Defense and Foreign Ministries and amounts in essence to the demand that Russia be granted a special status within the program demarcating its position and role from that of the other participants, particularly the former Soviet republics. According to reports coming in from Brussels, the NATO leadership is inclining toward meeting Moscow's requests and even toward signing a special agreement with it which would provide for holding additional consultations on problems of European security but only after Russia's signing the Partnership for Peace program, to the text of which the West categorically refuses to make changes. As we succeeded in elucidating, the leadership of this Western military-political bloc is afraid that if it meets Moscow halfway in all its demands a situation could develop on the spur of the moment whereby Russia would achieve for itself the right to veto NATO military-political decisions and would thereby be able not only to block the activity of this organization but also to exercise control over it [kontrolirovat] which, after the breakup of the USSR and the ending of the Cold War, the NATO leadership could not even have envisaged in their wildest dreams. By all accounds, a quite tough reception awaits Pavel Grachev in Brussels. Will Russia join the North Atlantic bloc one way or another or not? -- swords are going to be crossed on this score for a good while yet both in the West and in our own country. And although limited membership -- via the Partnership for Peace program, drafted by the United States -- rather than full membership is involved, it is obvious that this step could be the prologue to another drastic redrawing of the geopolitical map of the world in the 20th Century. What are the basic pros and cons, and who stands to gain? Let us remember that the Partnership for Peace program appeared after Moscow's demarche opposing the immediate admission of East European and Baltic countries to NATO and that it is a kind of transitional stage toward full membership. It has to be acknowledged that the program has been to the liking of many people. The framework agreement on affiliation to the Partnership program has already been signed at NATO HQ in Brussels by the top officials or foreign ministers of 18 countries (among which number eight former Soviet republics), including Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Slovakia. The Partnership was conceived as preparation for carrying out joint peacemaking operations under UN and CSCE auspices, as a means of improving operational coordination. In the opinion of a high-ranking representative of the NATO military planning committee interviewed by us, some partners, particularly in Russia, do not altogether grasp the meaning of operational coordination. The opinion is current that this means replacing military equipment and purchasing armaments from NATO countries. That is not so, he maintained. The capability for operational coordination implies common doctrines, common procedures, and, of course, the possibility of maintaining liaison with one another, maintaining contact. It does not mean major expenditure, large-scale conversion of the defense industry, or its switch from producing Soviet weapons to the manufacture of NATO-type equipment. According to our observations, NATO is certain that Russia will sign the framework document. First, they think that Russia would otherwise remain on the sidelines in self-isolation. Second, the Partnership differs from participation in the present consultative North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC] by virtue of its individualized approach, and Russia wants to develop relations with NATO precisely on an individual basis. At the same time Russia's nonaffiliation would, it is thought in Brussels, have undesirable political repercussions. As far as Russian statements about its intention to have special status within the Partnership are concerned, NATO HQ makes clear that the program embodies the principle of equality and identical opportunities and that NATO will not agree to any amendments or additions to the framework document. But it is recognized here that it is in the general interests of NATO and the countries of Central and East Europe and in the interests of European security to take Russia's weight and significance into account. If NATO accepts any proposals by Russia that go beyond the Partnership program they will be the subject of separate agreements. NATO Allied Command Europe received a delegation of Russian journalists and political scientists on 17 May. During discussion it became clear that while Russian political circles pay paramount attention to the military aspect of the program, its initiators pay equal attention to joint rescue and and humanitarian operations. However, their conduct has been hampered without the affiliation of Russia and CIS countries to the Partnership. Asked whether NATO leaders don't see contradictions between the interests of Russia as a Eurasian power in its simultaneous participation in the CIS defense union [oboronyy soyuz] and the NATO program, the military replied that "in that event there will be complementarity of interests and the idea of a transcontinental community stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok will be realized." Global security in Eurasia will thereby be guaranteed, in their opinion. The Russian Foreign Ministry's standpoint was expounded by senior adviser Andrey Androsov: "The program has concentrated within itself, as it were, the potential for collaboration which has emerged since the demise of the bipolar world. It takes account of our main thesis that NATO should not be enlarged by the mechanical admission of new states." Foreign Ministry experts consider that the Russian Federation's nonaffiliation to Partnership for Peace will do great harm to the interests of Russia itself and that nonparticipation in the Partnership threatens seriously to isolate Russia in the international arena and reduce its scope for influencing the process of shaping a new Euro-Atlantic area. And Aleksandr Piskunov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, considers that the Partnership program is an attempt to find a new raison d'etre for NATO while moving, albeit in veiled form, toward confrontation with Russia. With its affiliation to the program Russia forsakes the opportunity effectively to influence the CIS and destroys the treaty on collective security among Commonwealth countries.
