Over half of the nation's 3,132 megawatts of generating capacity is produced by thermoelectric plants of Soviet or Czechoslovak manufacture. The Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel plants, as well as the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, came from the Soviet Union; the 10 de Octubre plant in Nuevitas, which has a generating capacity of 330 megawatts, was made in Czechoslovakia. This means that our country has not received parts for that equipment since 1990, which has had an influence on the difficulties being encountered with power plants. Today, the electric system's generating availability averages 50 percent, while under normal conditions it once reached over 70 percent -- for, because of maintenance and breakdowns, no plant operates at 100 percent of installed capacity. This year, the power plant maintenance program has available resources that allow it to perform maintenance aimed at gradually recovering generating capacity. It is undoubtedly important to be able to count on Cuban oil, which since last year has been guaranteeing approximately 30 percent of the fuel earmarked for generating electric power. Cuban crude is burned only in the Maximo Gomez plant in Mariel, the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba, the Santa Cruz del Norte plant in Havana, and the Jose Marti plant in Matanzas. The problems of electric power service due to a lack of generating capacity are going to diminish progressively through the efforts of that sector's workers in maintenance tasks, supported by the construction workers of certain provinces. By carrying out the maintenance program planned for this year, and completing two new generating units early next year, there will also be a gradual recovery -- toward normal levels -- in the availability of the (?fuel ration). One of these new units will be the 200-megawatt Felton unit in Holguin Province; the other, the 100-megawatt unit at the Santa Cruz del Norte power plant in Havana. All this will benefit the national electric power grid, as will the entering on line next May of two units currently undergoing maintenance.
