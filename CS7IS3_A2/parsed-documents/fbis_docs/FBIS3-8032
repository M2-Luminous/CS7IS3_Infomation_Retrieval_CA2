Bosnian Moslems mainly welcomed it but others involved in the conflict doubted its viability and voiced fears it would either entrench an imperfect peace or prolong the war by allowing Moslems and Croats to join forces against the Serbs. In Zagreb, Croat Government officials suggested the agreement was a "compromise" with an uncertain outlook. Under the agreement, signed in Washington Tuesday by Bosnian Moslem and Croat leaders, the Bosnian federation will be composed of a number of cantons inhabited mainly by Bosnian Croats and Moslems. They will be granted equal national rights, with a central government in charge of foreign affairs, defense and trade. "It is clear that the agreement is a compromise," Mate Granic, the Croatian foreign minister and a signatory of the accord told Croatia's government-controlled daily VECERNJI LIST. In its editorial on the agreement, the paper said: "The vanquished in this affair are certainly the Croats. "The Serbs will undoubtedly keep all their gains. And the Moslems will be saved from destruction in a state which is a lot closer to their idea of the homeland than the way the Croats think of it," the paper added. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was not consulted in the talks, said in Moscow that he was "studying" the agreement but added that Serbians should have been involved. "We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed against Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he said. For the Bosnian Government, Gradimir Gojer, a Croatian and minister without portfolio in Sarajevo, said he now expected the United States to "put pressure on the Serb side, using the Russians" to get the Serbs to join the federation. "You can't reject the third nation who wants to live with us," he added. Russia, which held talks with Karadzic Wednesday, said the accord was "a new turning point in the negotiations." Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin said that "if correctly applied it could play a positive role in the political settlement of the Bosnian conflict," the INTERFAX news agency reported. [passage omitted] The strongest negative reaction came in Belgrade where Vladislav Jovanovic, the foreign minister of the rump Yugoslavia, warned that "the creation of a bloc, two parties against a third" would defeat the objective of peace. Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, told the Serbian Radio Novi Sad: "The Serbs will not accept a solution which harms the interests of the Serb people." [passage omitted] In Sarajevo, Hafiz Ismet Spahic, the second highest cleric in Bosnia-Herzegovina's Moslem community, summed up the pragmatic nature of the agreement. "We have to live in marriage, even if we don't love each other. Our interests are much stronger than the fact that we are not in love," he said.
