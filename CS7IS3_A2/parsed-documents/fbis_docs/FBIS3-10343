President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, read each one of the 32 resolutions of the San Cristobal table. Plainly speaking, the work was parceled out, Camacho Solis explained at an interview held after he left this meeting, which was also attended by secretaries of education, health, agriculture and hydraulic resources, social development, government, and finance and public credit. As Camacho reported it, the president has given instructions that the agreements made by the government in this pacification process be faithfully complied with. This private meeting lasted approximately two and one-half hours. The secretaries left Los Pinos one by one, but did not make any statements. Camacho drove out and got out of his car, which was surrounded by about 50 reporters, photographers, and cameramen who were waiting for him to explain what had happened at the meeting. [passage omitted] He also made a very interesting comment when asked how the negotiation problem was going; he said one must not look at this matter as a problem. Let us listen to his answer to this question. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] This is not a negotiation problem because we are not even talking of negotiation. We are talking about a dialogue. This is something I would like to tell you and the citizens of Mexicans, through you. Instead of regarding this as a problem, let us look at it as an occasion to provide better political, economic, and social solutions to a reality as complex as Chiapas. The more we have of this.... [pauses] The better we keep our commitments and the greater our seriousness is during the whole process, the more positive it will be. This is not a problem of giving and taking. This is a problem of raising to the social and political circumstances and of clearly understanding that some things need a different approach. Therefore, we are not talking about money but of reforms, institutional changes, coordination, and most of all, a republican attitude, which entails two things, namely, acknowledging problems and meeting with the people so we can provide government solutions based on that reality. [end recording] [passage omitted] I think the interview was interesting. He was very courteous, as always. He tried to answer all the questions. Of course, some [pause] He noted: I have been asked, through different means, what my political future will be, but I will not speak of politics now, nor will I speak of my aspirations or personal life. I have a major responsibility. To conclude, he has always been willing to answer the reporters' questions. He was that way today. He also indicated there had been false reports that Article 27 of the Constitution would be amended. He affirmed that this Article will not be amended. He mentioned two points that were discussed with the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. One has to do with the possibility of submitting a bill on Indian communities rights, which will touch on some aspects dealing with land. The other is the possibility of enacting an agrarian justice law. This would be a state law based on Article 27, which is in force. During talks with the EZLN, there was no mention of amending this article, as some news media have reported.
