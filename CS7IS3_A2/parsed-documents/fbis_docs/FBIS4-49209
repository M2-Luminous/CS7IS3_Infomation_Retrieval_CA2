The decision to promote Liu Yuan, son of the ousted Chinese president Liu Shaoqi, to political commissar of the paramilitary force was a compromise between conservative and reformist factions, Chinese sources said. The younger Mr Liu, former vice-governor of central Henan Province, joined the armed police last year as political commissar of the paramilitary police's division responsible for safeguarding the nation's reservoir and power projects. Sources said his transfer from the civilian to the security establishment last year was a move arranged by his patrons to pave the way for his promotion in the armed police force. Mr Liu's new unit is considered a key element both in the internal power rivalries of Chinese leaders and in maintaining social stability in the post-Deng era. Many of the influential incumbent party elders, known for their conservative views, were either supporters or proteges of Mr Liu's father. But Mr Liu himself is widely considered as a young educated reformist official Beijing sources said. They added that Mr Liu's promotion was expected to be welcomed by many party elders and military officers. China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and state president Jiang Zemin were the key persons behind the decision. Mr Deng has been actively trying to promote Mr Jiang's status and hold over both the People's Liberation Army and the security apparatus, which includes the police, armed police and state security forces. Mr Jiang, who is also party chief and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has been trying to strengthen his hold over the security apparatus, especially the armed police in the past year. During his recent trips to the localities, he sought out and talked to senior officers of the regional army, paramilitary police and the police. Last September, Mr Jiang called a meeting of top armed police officers in Beijing and urged them to be ready in the "struggle to safeguard state security and social stability" while observing "the absolute leadership of the party". Aside from patrolling the borders, the armed police must also respond to internal challenges to the party and government, including those posed by dissidents and "class enemies".
