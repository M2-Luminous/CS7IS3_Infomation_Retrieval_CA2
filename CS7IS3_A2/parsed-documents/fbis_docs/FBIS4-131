FBIS4-131 "drafr063_d_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Angola No Progress Reported at Lusaka Peace Talks No Progress Reported at Lusaka Peace Talks MB3103211194 Luanda Radio Nacional Network in Portuguese 1900 GMT 31 Mar 94 MB3103211194 Luanda Radio Nacional Network Portuguese BFN [Text] There is still no progress at the peace talks in Lusaka, Zambia, because the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has not yet presented its stand with regard to the document on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process. Pedro Manuel reports: [Manuel] Good evening! The UNITA negotiating team has not yet presented its final stand to the mediators and observers. This has further reduced the chances of progress at the peace talks. According to a source, UNITA promised to present its stand today but failed to do so, alleging that it has not yet concluded the examination of the government document. In turn, the government negotiating team has already presented to the mediators its final stand on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process. This afternoon the parties did not work for all intents and purposes. The mediators and observers reportedly used the afternoon to meet alone in search of a solution that will force both the government and UNITA to resolve the issue of the country's governance. A source assured us that although they are working on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process, the mediators and observers are also carrying out work on another two points still to be concluded: the UN Angola Verification Mission mandate and national reconciliation. According to the source, what is most important for the mediators at the present moment is to resolve the problem of national reconciliation. Mediator Alioune Blondin Beye only decided to move forward in order to give time to the leaderships of the negotiating teams to reexamine the issue of national reconciliation. The source also revealed that the date for the second round of presidential elections will be set later. The date will be chosen in a situation of complete peace. Now, what is important for the mediators is to obtain from the negotiating teams assurances that the second round of presidential elections will take place. Although there are four consecutive holidays because of Easter, the mediators said the parties will work tomorrow, most probably in a hotel, because the Mulungushi Conference Center will only be reopened on 5 April. According to another source, during this long weekend there will only be work if UNITA presents its final stand on the Conclusion of the Electoral Process.
