The two small planes, which were intercepted by Peruvian Air Force planes, landed at an illegal airstrip in the Boca Apua zone and were set on fire by the crew, after which the alleged drug traffickers escaped into the jungle. Military troops and two judges later went to the illegal airstrip and destroyed it [as received], the sources said.
