[video shows close-up of Raidi reading from prepared notes, close-ups of Chen Kuiyuan and other Tibetan leaders perusing Raidi's report] He said: On the whole, Tibet's fight against splittism is satisfactory. The region is politically and socially stable, people of all nationalities are united, and the defense is strong along border areas. This has created a social environment good for reform, opening up, and economic construction; and good for improving people's livelihood. Owing to their class nature, however, hostile forces in the world and separatists at home and abroad will never accept their defeat willingly. They will continue to do everything they can to intensify their splittist activities. The antisplittist situation we are now facing is therefore still a severe one, and the mission we have to carry out is a formidable one. Raidi said: All party and government organizations and we, as leading cadres, must be vigilant in peace time. We must have a clear understanding of the problems and the acute and complex antisplittist struggle we are now facing. We must have a clear idea of the situation, and know our assignments and carry them out properly. We must take the necessary precautionary measures against what might occur. Raidi emphatically pointed out: Leadership is critical for stabilizing the situation. The regional party committee expects that top party and government leaders as well as all units will take personal charge of the work of stabilizing the situation, regularly study the situation and problems in their respective areas and units, and come up with plans with which they can lead the vast number of cadres and worker to fight splittism. Leading cadres must firmly and unequivocally handle major issues of principles. To ensure Tibet's stability and the normal and healthy development of reform, opening up, and economic construction, Raidi urged party committees and governments at all levels to unite all forces that can be united, mobilize the initiative of all social quarters, and, on the basis of closely relying on the masses, build a stronger patriotic united front and give full rein to the special roles played by patriots and religious leaders of all nationalities in all quarters in fighting splittism and in stabilizing the situation. Expressing his views on economic affairs, regional government chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: Since the beginning of the year, government organs at all levels, implementing the guidelines laid down by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet Regional Party Committee and by the regional economic conference, have intensified their reform efforts and opened wider to the outside world, and have achieved preliminary results in developing the economy. Compared with the same period last year, growth has been registered in all sectors -- agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, communications and transportation, capital construction, foreign trade, tourism, taxation, and banking. We have achieved the expected results. This year's reform projects require great efforts because the scope is broad, the standards are high, there are many problems to be resolved, and the assignments are heavy. To make sure that all reform projects are carried out successfully, we must stand firm in launching reform, fully understand what has to be done, educate the masses about reform, and make genuine efforts to speed up reform. Gyaincain Norbu also put forward requirements for accomplishing various production projects, making adequate arrangements for what the masses' needs in their daily life, intensifying the preparations for [word indistinct] construction projects, improving work style, and promoting planned parenthood. Those attending the meeting also heard a report given by Comrade Zi Cheng, member of the regional party committee standing committee and secretary of its Politics and Law Committee, on the situation regarding public order and the fight against splittism. In conclusion, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan stressed that the meeting was significant for Tibet in deepening reform, speeding up development, and maintaining stability. He said all prefectures, cities, and departments must earnestly implement its guidelines.
