Zhou Hanqiong, wife of Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , said at the meeting that there are over 200 million families in China. The Chinese Government has always attached great importance to the role of the family, as it is the basic cell of society. She said that a happy and harmonious family constitutes an important part of Chinese culture. It has also many social functions to perform. If every family enjoys harmony and progress, Zhou said, it will contribute significantly to social stability, cultural and ethical advancement, reform and development and higher population quality. She said: "While enjoying the warmth, care and security of the family, we cannot forget that there are still places in the world where families are suffering from chaos of war, where numerous mothers and children have lost homes, having neither warmth nor security. We deeply sympathize with their plight. "We hope to see an early end to these wars so that the mothers and their children will regain their family warmth and well-being in a peaceful environment," she said. Farid Rahman, representative of the office of the United Nations Children's Fund in China, spoke on children's education. He said that on the occasion of the International Year of the Family, it is of great importance to stress again the role that families play in children's subsistence and development. Rahman noted the astonishing progress that China has made over the past 44 years in this regard, adding that there was still much to be done. The United Nations Children's Fund is willing to help China solve these problems in cooperating with it. Prof Yan Renying, Chinese expert on women's health and children, and Mrs. Lombo, wife of the ambassador of Zaire, Lombo Lo Mangamanga, spoke respectively on "maternity and child care" and "family and children's education".
