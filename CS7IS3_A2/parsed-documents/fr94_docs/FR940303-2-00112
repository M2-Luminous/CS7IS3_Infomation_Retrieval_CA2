FR940303-2-00112 FR940303-2-00065 Requirements of Section 6 of the NRA Section 6(a) of the NRA contains the new regulatory requirements to be codified at 49 U.S.C. 10702(c). 2 New section 10702(c)(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act requires that, for motor transportation contracts entered into after March 3, 1994 (i.e., 90 days after enactment of the NRA), there must be ``a written agreement, separate from the bill of lading or receipt.'' This requirement is identical to the writing requirement in former 49 CFR 1053.1. It is important to remember that the signed agreement must be in place before the transportation begins. 2 In sections 6(b) and 6(c) of the NRA, Congress amended 49 U.S.C. 11901(g) and 11909(b), respectively, to provide for civil and criminal penalties for violations of these new requirements. New section 10702(c)(2) specifies the minimum contents of the agreements. Section 10702(c)(2)(A) requires that the agreement ``identify the parties thereto.'' This requirement follows our requirement in former 49 CFR 1053.1 that the contract provide for transportation for a particular shipper or shippers. Signatories to the agreement must be persons authorized to bind the parties to the mutual undertakings described in the contract. Section 10702(c)(2)(B) requires that the agreement ``commit the shipper to tender and the carrier to transport a series of shipments.'' This reflects the longstanding definition at 49 U.S.C. 10102(15)(B), which limits contract carriage of freight to ``transportation of property for compensation under continuing agreements with one or more persons'' (emphasis added). A long line of Commission decisions addresses the meaning of ``a series of shipments'' in the context of a continuing agreement. See, e.g., Interstate Van Lines, Inc._Extension_Household Goods, 5 I.C.C.2d 168, 185&hyph;86 (1988) (Interstate Van Lines). On the one hand, isolated shipments or so-called spot market transportation are not sufficient to satisfy the series of shipments standard. See, e.g., Global Van Lines, Inc. v. ICC, 804 F.2d 1293, 1300 (D.C. Cir. 1986). On the other hand, the standard can be met by a short-term agreement 3 or a so-called requirements contract that contemplates shipper tender and carrier transportation obligations for specified traffic regardless of its frequency or amount. In the first rulemaking to address the subject, the Commission made clear that ``the contracts need not cover long periods of time or fixed amounts of traffic.'' Contracts of Contract Carriers, 1 M.C.C. 628 (1937). In determining whether an agreement meets the series of shipments standard, we will continue to be guided by the essential commitment between the parties that transportation be offered and accepted on a continuing basis. See Zoneskip, Inc. v. UPS, Inc. and UPS of America, Inc., 8 I.C.C.2d 645 (1992) ( Zoneskip ), aff'd sub nom. Zoneskip, Inc. v. United States, 998 F.2d 1007 (table) (3d Cir. 1993). 3 As far back as 1937, the Commission found ``an agreement to transport property extending for a week, with a further provision that it will continue from week to week until terminated, is an agreement for continuous transportation.'' Edward Webb, Jr. Contract Carrier Application, 1 Fed. Carr. Cas. (CCH) 7037 (1937). Section 10702(c)(2)(C) requires that the written agreement ``contain the contract rate or rates for the transportation service to be provided or being provided.'' Neither Congress nor the Commission has previously required that the particular rate be specified. In interpreting this new requirement, we must accommodate both the purpose of the NRA, in reforming contract carrier requirements, and the policy of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 (1980 Act) of ``remov[ing] many of the obstacles that (previously) kept motor contract carriers from realizing their full potential.'' H. Rep. 96&hyph;1069, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2283 (``House Report''). Our goal is to protect the integrity of contract carriage without harming contracting parties or competition. Accordingly, we interpret this new requirement to mean that either a fixed rate or a methodology for determining the rate must be in or appended to the contract. This comports with the rate requirements for common carrier tariffs, as articulated in Regular Common Conference v. United States, 793 F.2d 376, 379 (1986) (RCCC), which require that a common carrier tariff show on the face of the tariff either the per-unit rate or how the per-unit rate is determined. For example, contracts for annual volume or incentive rates are permissible as long as an objective methodology for computing the rate is provided in the agreement itself. References may be made in the agreement to tariffs or other readily available publications or materials. We believe the RCCC standard is appropriate for contract rates. Under this standard, the parties to the agreement can maintain pricing flexibility while achieving the Congressional goal of guarding against a future challenge to the existence or level of the contract rate. The price will be determinable without unduly interfering with the pricing of contract carriage services.
