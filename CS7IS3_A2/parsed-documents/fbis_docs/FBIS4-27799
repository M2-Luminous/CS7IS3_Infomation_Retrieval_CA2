"I have not harbored any intentions of viewing South Korea as an enemy or siding with North Korea," Ishii, who had served as chairman of the Dietmen's League for Promotion of Japan-Korea Friendship, told a news conference. Ishii, concurrently serving as chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, has been under pressure from the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party to quit the chairmanship in view of his status as a cabinet minister and head of the commission in charge of gathering intelligence on North Korean agents. "I have to avoid misunderstanding as chairman of the National Public Safety Commission amid the North Korean (nuclear) issue and domestic issues," he said. The LOS ANGELES TIMES and some Japanese media have claimed that the presence of Ishii and other alleged supporters of North Korea in the ruling coalition would deter it from regulating the flow of money to the isolated communist nation from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents of Japan.
