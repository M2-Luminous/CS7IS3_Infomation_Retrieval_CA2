This was revealed at a news conference on the imminent seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the inaugural meeting of a new Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE). A CAS spokesman said that the foreign academicians will be selected from some 25 foreign scientists recommended to the academy. The two meetings are due to be held here from June 3 to June 8. This will be a grand gathering for the country's scientific, technological and engineering communities, the spokesman said. "The opening of the two meetings of academicians will certainly arouse the attention and interest of all social sections, particularly the scientific and technological communities both at home and abroad," the spokesman said, adding that the two meetings will have a far-reaching impact on the country's development of science and technology. He said that a change of rules on CAS academicians is expected to be passed during the meeting, adding that currently China has 535 CAS academicians. He said that leading officials from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council will speak at the meeting. He said that thanks to the concern of the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council, the preparations for the founding of the CAE have been accomplished, and the inaugural ceremony, namely the first meeting of the academicians, will be held during the CAS meeting. Ninety-six people have been appointed as the first academicians of the CAE. The list will be made public on June 3, the spokesman said. He attributed the relatively small number of initial CAE academicians to the fact that the official preparations for the establishment of the academy were not started until January. But a second batch of CAE academicians will be chosen from a nationwide selection after the meeting, the spokesman said. He added that the president and deputy president of the CAE will be selected from its academicians at this session.
