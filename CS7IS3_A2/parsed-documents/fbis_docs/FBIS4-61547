He was in Bulgaria, where he gave a number of interviews and made a number of statements sharply criticizing the Armenian leadership. The Armenian authorities had earlier sanctioned the arrest of the former high-ranking official, and he was put on the "wanted" list. According to information that is as yet unconfirmed, Avakyan was expelled by the Bulgarian authorities at the request of the Armenian side and was arrested on arrival in Moscow by staff of the State National Security Directorate of Armenia. It was announced here that he was taken to Yerevan on Friday evening. Avakyan is charged with attempting to take state secrets out of Armenia. His spouse, who was taking six computer discs containing secret information to her husband, was detained at Yerevan airport in February. The investigation that is under way is to determine what Avakyan's aim was in gathering, storing, and attempting to take out secret material with the help of his wife, and also to what country and to what services he intended to hand the information over to and who his accomplices are, the leadership of Armenia's security department reported in March. Avakyan used to be the first deputy to Ashot Manucharyan [presidential adviser on national security], one of the members of the Karabakh committee who was sharply critical of Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his administration's political course when he left the entourage of the Armenian president. In reply to this criticism, Armenian Internal Affairs Minister Vanik Siradegyan, another member of the Karabakh committee, publicly accused Manucharyan of supporting criminal elements and mafia structures. The minister named Avakyan among those who enjoyed Manucharyan's protection. According to the internal affairs minister, Avakyan is involved in taking abroad and spending large sums of hard currency intended for aid to Nagornyy Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh].
