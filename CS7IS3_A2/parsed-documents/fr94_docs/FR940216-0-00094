FR940216-0-00094 FR940216-0-00010 The final rule constrains the use of the averaged standard for oxygen, and the use of oxygen credits in certain circumstances. Reformulated gasoline subject to simple model standards that is designated for use in the high ozone season_VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline_must meet both the oxygen standard and the RVP standard separately during the VOC control period (discussed more fully below). Simple model VOC-controlled gasoline may not be averaged with simple model non-VOC-controlled gasoline to show compliance with the oxygen standard during the VOC control period. In addition, reformulated gasoline designated for use in cities subject to the requirements of the oxygenated fuels program during the oxygenated fuels program control period (or ``OPRG'' gasoline) may not be averaged together with gasoline not designated for this use for purposes of meeting the oxygen standard on average. 40 As a result, only oxygen credits generated from VOC-controlled gasoline subject to simple model standards may be used to meet the separate oxygen standard for VOC-controlled gasoline; and oxygen credits generated from OPRG gasoline may only be used to meet the oxygen standard for OPRG gasoline. The mechanisms used to ensure correct accounting under these oxygen averaging and credit constraints are discussed in a separate section below. 40 The oxygenated fuels program refers to state programs established pursuant to ยง211(m) of the Act, involving wintertime use of oxygenated gasoline to control emissions of carbon monoxide. The final rule also includes provisions that regulate the manner in which oxygenates may be added downstream of the refinery or import facility within the reformulated gasoline program. Oxygenate may only be added to specially formulated reformulated gasoline blendstock intended for such downstream oxygenate blending (or ``RBOB''). If oxygenate were added to reformulated gasoline not specially formulated, in most cases the resulting gasoline would not meet the reformulated gasoline standards. Refiners and importers of RBOB are required to include in the RBOB product transfer documents the type and amount, or range of types and amounts, of oxygenate that may be blended with each particular RBOB. RBOB must be segregated from reformulated gasoline, and from other RBOB having different oxygenate requirements, to the point of oxygenate blending. Distributors may only dispense RBOB to registered oxygenate blenders. Oxygenate blenders may only blend the specified type and amount of oxygenate with any RBOB, and must meet the standard for oxygen for all RBOB dispensed to them. Refiners and importers are required to meet the reformulated gasoline standards for RBOB for all parameters other than oxygen, based on the properties of the reformulated gasoline that will be produced through blending the appropriate type and amount of oxygenate with the RBOB. As a result, if the incorrect type and/or amount of oxygenate is blended with the RBOB, the refiner or importer may fail to comply with the non-oxygen standards. In order to ensure that the non-oxygen standards for RBOB are met, refiners and importers may transfer RBOB only to oxygenate blenders with whom they have a first- or second-hand contractual relationship. This contract must include procedures intended to ensure proper performance of oxygenate blending. In addition, the refiner or importer must conduct a quality assurance program over the oxygenate blender's blending operation.
