Last year, arbitration committees accepted and heard 12,358 labour disputes, up 51.6 percent from 1992, according to a Labour Ministry and State Statistics Bureau report released this week. More than 92 percent of the cases were settled by the end of the year. About 2,800 arbitration committees have been set up at various levels since 1986, the ministry said. Meanwhile, half of the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in the country have established labour supervisory institutions. The labour unrest is the result of poor management in the enterprises, especially overseas-funded and private firms, imperfect laws and lack of labour markets, the ministry said. Another reason for the increase in disputes is labour controversy has finally come out in the open. Disputes in non-government firms rose more sharply than State- owned ones. In the past years, Guangdong Province has handled 7.892 labour disputes among which 1,421 happened at non-State companies. The employers often hired workers without signing a contract so they could be fired at will. Some managers defaulted or embezzled workers' wages and even subjected the workers to indignities. China Business Times reported that about 300 workers at a company in Huizhou, Guangdong, held a two-day strike because their Hong Kong boss had fallen far behind in payments. Before the Spring Festival in early February, the company paid each worker 100 yuan ($11.5) because it was afraid they would not return. However, the workers didn't get January and February wages on March 15. The city's labour supervisory department recently imposed a fine on the boss and instructed the company to pay the two months' wages immediately. Strikes have also happened in the foreign-funded enterprises in other cities. But some labour disputes were initiated when workers broke their contracts, the report said. To protect legal rights of both the enterprises and' the workers, the ministry is making efforts to research the arbitration system and set up a nationwide network.
