According to local officials, in the past year the city approved the establishment of 1,134 foreign-funded projects, with contracts involving a promised foreign investment of 3.3 billion U.S. dollars. The two figures represent sharp increases compared with the corresponding figures of the previous year. The officials said the total investment, as well as foreign investment of the approved projects last year both surpassed the related totals of the past 14 years. The officials attributed the achievement to the fact that since last year the city has made active efforts in launching investment promotion activities at home and abroad, and has made painstaking efforts to improve its investment environment. The emergence of foreign-funded enterprises in large numbers has greatly promoted the development of the export-oriented economy, said the officials. Foreign-funded enterprises have developed into the main contributor of the city's economic growth. For instance, in 1993 foreign-funded firms in the city completed 10.8 billion yuan-worth of industrial output value, accounting for 48 percent of the city's industrial output value created by enterprises at or above township level. These foreign-funded enterprises last year exported goods amounting to 730 million U.S. dollars, making up 80 percent of the provincial capital's total exports. Many of the foreign-funded enterprises have settled down in the city's economic and technological development zones, making these zones into areas of great vitality for economic development. As more and more overseas investors have begun to try their luck in Fuzhou, many of the city's existing foreign-funded enterprises have also started to enlarge their investment scales. Last year 128 foreign-funded firms in the city increased their investment, and the increase totalled 300 million U.S. dollars. According to the officials, the city has 1,146 foreign-funded enterprises in operation.
