Construction is proceeding on Kyoto Research Park (KRP, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto) where once stood a line of gas tanks belonging to the Kyoto plant of Osaka Gas. KRP is attracting attention as the ``heart'' of the ``brain city.'' KRP is a city-type research park of national prominence on the scale of Kanagawa Science Park (KSP, total floor area approximately 150,000 square meters) in Kawasaki City. Its eastern area (total floor area 48,000 square meters) opened in October 1989 as its first phase. About fifty organizations are located and active in the eastern area, in addition to the main business entity fully funded by Osaka Gas. These include institutions performing contract research in software and mechatronics, Kyoto Higher Technology Research Institute and Kyoto Prefecture Small and Medium-Sized Industry Center, and laboratories of high tech and start-up companies. The central area is currently under construction for rental research space, hotels, and convention facilities. When it is completed in 1997, total floor area will be 250,000 square meters, making it the largest in Japan. While Kyoto is a mecca for traditional arts such as Nishijin textiles and Kiyomizu pottery, it has also produced many prominent high-tech and start-up companies such as Kyocera, Omron, and Rohm. Since factors such as rising land prices have made corporate start-ups more difficult, KRP is emphasizing its role as an incubator for R&D-based industries by putting effort into strengthening capacity for doing research in rented facilities. It's not just a matter of gathering research institutions. ``We would like to offer many capabilities such as industry-academia exchange, business matchmaking at a global level, and even consulting on foreign companies' entry into Japan and on foreign research parks,'' says Hiroshi Endo, president of KRP. The International Technology Exchange Center (ITEC) which is scheduled to be set up in the central area in Spring 1994 will be the first in Japan to specialize in supporting world-scale joint ventures and market development. Tenants will include full-scale venture capital firms, firms that manage databases of intellectual and industrial property rights, and consulting companies. KRP will also be active in an international network of 22 research parks formed upon KRP's initiative. A personal computer network is being set up for the mutual exchange of information on the world's high technology and high tech companies. KRP plans to hold an international research part conference in Kyoto on the park's fifth anniversary in spring 1994 which will be a leading event of the 1200th anniversary of the founding of Kyoto. The goal of the event is to exchange information on research park management, world market trends, and technology. Participation from research parks in Europe and the U.S. is currently being sought.
