It was not so much their contents as the party's symbol, which looked very much like a swastika, that attracted particular attention. At that time, the SNPU backbone was comprised of members of "Rukh's Guard" -- youngsters that used to be bodyguards of former dissidents some time ago. When the "Guard's" militants were all done performing their functions, they were "befriended" by a Yaroslav Andrushkiv (he used to be responsible for the physical fitness program for "Rukh's Guard" members), who realized that he could capitalize on those boys. After some time, the new organization began to attract the Lvov youth. Its ranks were joined by members of other organizations, such as "Spadshchyna," [Heritage] "Plast," [Scouts] and "Studentske Bratstvo" [Student Brotherhood]. However, it was last summer when the party became especially vocal. Let us just recall the furious reaction of Lvov residents to the Black Sea Fleet Treaty signed by L. Kravchuk. The entire city was rocked then by a wave of rallies, where SNPU members showed themselves in all their glory. At one of them, a party's member said out loud: "I dream about staging the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day for Russians, but we don't have enough strength, so far." It was, however, just enough for them to form the "Committee for Protection of Nation and State" that included all far right organizations. The Committee actively engaged in forming "people's detachments" ready to execute any order of their leaders. At their rallies, the nationalists yelled that Ukrainian tanks would shoot at the Kremlin. So far, they have managed to get away with it -- maybe because no one takes them seriously? But the newly emerged Nazis continue to spread their wings, increasing their profile. Unidentified thugs shattered windows in all of the Russian high schools in Lvov and left as a keepsake slogans that read: "Moscow mugs, get out of Ukraine!" It is not difficult to guess who were the most immediate suspects. Later last fall, SNPU members assaulted the building of the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] oblast department, cracked down on one of the local organizations of the "Student Brotherhood" (by that time, the Lvov student community had split into those who joined the SNPU and those who declined). And very recently, the SNPU boys instigated a brawl in the "Postup" cafeteria, where they often dropped in. They explained later that it was not them, and that the bartender simply managed to identify the cafeteria's habitues only. However, all those "little pranks" are nothing compared with the Social Nationalists' intention of vigorously participating in the upcoming elections. Although the party is not officially registered -- and it will hardly be in the nearest future -- its 21 candidates were proposed for legislature in the Lvov Oblast districts. The Social Nationalists are sure that this time, people should vote for the true nationalist patriots, and not for those who joined only recently. They believe that all present legislative deputies must resign, except for S. Khmara or I. Kalynets. The Social Nationalists are not eager to seize power today. They understand that their time has not yet come. But they do not doubt that it eventually will. The SNPU leader Andrushkiv said: "We will just wait until people are tired of anarchy, and will ask us to grab power. And you bet, we will!"
