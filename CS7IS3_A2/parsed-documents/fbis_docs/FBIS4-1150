FBIS4-1150 "drafr079_e_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Togo Opposition Leader Kodjo Named Prime Minister Opposition Leader Kodjo Named Prime Minister CAR Not To Participate AB2404145394 Lome Radio Lome in French 1230 GMT 24 Apr 94 AB2404145394 Lome Radio Lome French BFN [Text] Following the decision by Edem Kodjo of the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] to accept the post of prime minister, the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has reacted saying that his acceptance constitutes a violation of the agreement signed on 26 March. CAR noted that under an agreement concluded and signed on 26 March by the two political parties which formed the parliamentary majority, it was decided that the new prime minister must come from the CAR party. On that same day, the UTD approved the nominee for that post. The fact that Edem Kodjo has accepted the post of prime minister is a blatant and unacceptable violation of the 26 March agreement. The CAR believes that no one can take advantage of the privileges of a parliamentary majority without adhering to the agreement upon which that parliamentary majority is based. Therefore, the CAR has decided not to participate in any cabinet that may be formed by Edem Kodjo, in defiance of the desire expressed by the people during the 6 and 20 February polls and of the agreement signed on 26 March between the CAR and the UTD.
