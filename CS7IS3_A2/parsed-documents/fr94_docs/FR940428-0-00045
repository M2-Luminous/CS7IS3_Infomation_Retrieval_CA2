ACTION : Final regulations. SUMMARY : The Secretary amends the regulations for Institutional Eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and the regulations for Eligibility of Foreign Medical Schools under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program (GSLP) to reflect changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The Secretary removes the latter regulations from Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, revises them, and adds them to the former regulations as a new subpart E. The regulations revise the procedures and criteria under which a foreign institution establishes eligibility to apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs if the institution is comparable to an eligible institution of higher education located in the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : Ms. Joyce R.
