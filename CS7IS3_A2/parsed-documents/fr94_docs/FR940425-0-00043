FR940425-0-00043 FR940425-0-00018 D. National Environmental Policy Act In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule will have no adverse impact on the quality of the human environment. On the contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of CNG vehicles will encourage their use, NHTSA believes that the rule will have positive environmental impacts since CNG vehicles are expected to have near-zero evaporative emissions and the potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well. E. Civil Justice Reform The rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles. PART 571_[AMENDED] In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 571 is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for part 571 continues to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1403, 1407; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. 2. Section 571.303, a new safety standard, Standard No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles, is added to part 571, to read as follows: §571.303 Standard No. 303; Fuel system integrity of compressed natural gas vehicles. S1. Scope. This standard specifies requirements for the integrity of motor vehicle fuel systems using compressed natural gas (CNG), including the CNG fuel systems of bi-fuel, dedicated, and dual fuel CNG vehicles. S2. Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce deaths and injuries occurring from fires that result from fuel leakage during and after motor vehicle crashes. S3. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks and buses that have a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less and use CNG as a motor fuel. This standard also applies to school buses regardless of weight that use CNG as a motor fuel. S4. Definitions. Bi-fuel CNG vehicle means a vehicle equipped with two independent fuel systems, one of which is designed to supply CNG and the second to supply a fuel other than CNG. CNG full container means a container designed to store CNG as motor fuel on-board a motor vehicle. CNG fuel system means all components used to store or supply CNG to a vehicle's engine. Dedicated CNG vehicle means a vehicle equipped with one fuel system and designed to operate on CNG. Dual-fuel CNG vehicle means a vehicle which is fueled by two fuels simultaneously, one of which is CNG and the second is a fuel other than CNG. High pressure portion of a fuel system means all the components from and including each CNG fuel container up to, but not including, the first pressure regulator. Service pressure means the internal pressure of a CNG fuel container when filled to design capacity with CNG at 20 ○ Celsius (68 ○ Fahrenheit). S5. General requirements. S5.1␣Vehicle requirements. S5.1.1␣Vehicles with GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. Each passenger car, multipurpose passenger vehicle, truck, and bus with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less that uses CNG as a motor fuel and that is manufactured on or after September 1, 1995 shall meet the requirements of S6, except S6.4.
