However, there is a growing voice within the ruling parties, including in the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], that the Finance Ministry-proposed hike in the consumption tax rate should not be included in the immediate economic pump-priming measures. For that reason, there is a view that the government will make a political decision on this issue with emphasis on ensuring the unity of the ruling parties. The ruling coalition government is scheduled to resume sessions of the economic affairs consultation council, which is composed of representatives from each of the ruling parties, starting on 5 January in hopes of reaching a certain conclusion -- it is hoped by the middle of January -- on the issue of cutting the income tax and raising the consumption tax. In this connection, the Finance Ministry insists that the decision should be made to raise the consumption tax simultaneously with the income tax cuts on the grounds that even if the income tax cut is carried out before the consumption tax is raised, it is necessary to decide in the council session on the timing of raising the consumption tax. On the contrary, the SDPJ, the largest party in the ruling coalition, is strongly opposed to a hike in the consumption tax, saying that sources of revenue should be obtained by issuing deficit-covering bonds. In addition, some SDPJ member are saying that the party should leave the coalition depending on the situation. There is another opinion within the other ruling parties that although it is inevitable that there will need to be a study of a possible increase in the consumption tax as a source of revenue for the future improvement of the welfare system, the issue of raising the consumption tax should be discussed separately from the issue of the tax cut, which the government plans to include in its immediate economic stimulus measures. In this way, there are opinions within the ruling parties opposing the simultaneous implementation of the tax cut and the hike in the consumption tax, and therefore, work for an intracoalition coordination of views on this issue is expected to be rough sailing. In this sense, a view has also been expressed that Prime Minister Hosokawa will make a political decision with emphasis on how the deliberation of political reform bills -- wherein attention has been focused on the SDPJ's move -- will develop and on the unity of the ruling partners.
