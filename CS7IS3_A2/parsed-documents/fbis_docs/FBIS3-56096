No Sensation"] [Text] Despite the tradition which has become rooted in the style of young Russian parliamentarianism, the first sitting of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly began in a calm and organized manner with no sensations. As planned, the sitting was opened by Boris Yeltsin. While paying ritual rhetorical tribute in the form of congratulations to deputies on their "great personal and political success" and expressing his intention to cooperate with the legislators and conduct consultations with parliamentary faction leaders, the president also identified a number of points of principle in his speech. First and foremost he noted that most Federation Council members are "experienced political figures who have learned the secrets of power and are capable of distinguishing real politics from petty politicking." This could well have been a passing allusion to the composition of the State Duma, which as yet is frighteningly unpredictable, unlike the Federation Council, which is dominated by the heads of the executive branch in the republics, krays, and oblasts -- firm pragmatists who are prepared for dialogue with the Kremlin and, equally importantly, are capable of controlling the situation in their regions. The president thereby made it plain that he sees his parliamentary support primarily in the Federation Council, which has the right of veto over highly important decisions from the lower chamber and is able to bring the Duma legislators to their senses as necessary. The appeal to "forget revolutionary terminology and jettison relapses into morbid suspicion and political maximalism" had an extremely timely ring and was maybe the first time it had been heard from the president's lips. Boris Yeltsin also stated that the president's annual message to the Federal Assembly, which is stipulated by the Constitution, will be presented in the very near future after the organizational matters relating to each of the chambers' work have been resolved. The message will propose a program of political and economic transformations for 1992 and the basic guidelines of domestic and foreign policy. There is one sentence which should probably be regarded as the key fragment in the president's speech: "No matter who our voters voted for, they were unanimous that the Russian Federation must continue to be an integral state, a solid federation. It is out obligation to fulfill this wish." The president is indubitably aware that the specter of separatism looming over the Federation has by no means been exorcized by the adoption of the new Constitution. Having received a nationwide mandate to pursue a more autonomous, more independent policy, regional leaders, it goes without saying, will not pass up the chance of making use of it. And the Federal Assembly [as published] hall of sessions will become an arena of struggle to coordinate the interests of the center and the provinces. Giving a foretaste of this struggle, the president recalled the precise constitutional delimitation of the areas of responsibility of the Federation and its components, noting at the same time that "strong regions are a condition of Russia's prosperity." Then, in accordance with constitutional procedure, Yuriy Chernichenko, the oldest deputy in the upper chamber, took the chair for the first sitting of the Federal Assembly [as published], calling on Kaliningrad Oblast Administration Head Yuriy Matochkin and Sakhalin Governor Yevgeniya Krasnoyarova to act as his assistants. The draft standing orders for the first day of the sitting stipulated the election of the credentials commission, which has already happened, and also the approval of the agenda, which presupposes a most important matter: the election of the Federation Council chairman and his deputies. In reply to my question about which candidacy for the post of head of the upper chamber seems preferable to him, Bashkortostan President Murtaza Rakhimov noted that he has no personal antipathy toward, say, Vladimir Shumeyko, but in his view the Federal Assembly [as published] should be led by a person with experience of leading a republic, kray, or oblast. Here Murtaza Rakhimov stressed that the Federation Council chairman must be "someone with a Russian surname," from which it an be inferred that, for example, Ramazan Abdulatipov and Eduard Rossel, who figure among the contenders for this post, should not particularly count on being successful. On the other hand, Krasnodar Kray Administration Head Nikolay Yegorov assessed Vladimir Shumeyko's chances as pretty high ("the whole of the North Caucasus is for him"), while at the same time noting the "anti-Kremlin mood" of a considerable proportion of the Federal Assembly. The first sitting of the upper chamber of parliament is continuing. After the procedural warm-up, it is likely that 11 January will also see the beginning of substantive debate.
