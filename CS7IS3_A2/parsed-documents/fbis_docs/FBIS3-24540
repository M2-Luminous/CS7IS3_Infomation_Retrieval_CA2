Bakh, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 577.152.9] [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is widely used in biology, medicine, and the food industry because of its high level of sensitivity, which is primarily the result of the marker enzyme/ligand conjugates used in the analysis. The researchers here create conjugates consisting of a ligand and laccase extracted from the culture fluid of Coriolus hirsutus, and they use the reagents in various enzyme immunoassays and compare the properties of the reagents with those of immunoperoxidase conjugates. The laccase conjugates can be used in sandwich, concurrent, and indirect EIA. The absolute sensitivity of laccase/antibody conjugates was shown to be threefold higher than that of similar peroxidase conjugates (7.7 x 10[.sup]-11[/] M versus 2.3 x 10[.sup]-10[/]). The use of laccase conjugates simplifies the assay process by its use of atmospheric oxygen as a second substrate for the enzymatic reaction. Figures 5, references 17: 4 Russian, 13 Western.
