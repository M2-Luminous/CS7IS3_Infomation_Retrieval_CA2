The SZDSZ does not approve of a single party determining the work of the next parliament instead of a sensible compromise between various political parties, as compromises always have greater social support than the decisions of one party, Fodor said. SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar stated that electors will determine what coalition opportunities exist after the second round of voting on May 29, and whether the balance of different political forces will be ensured within the new government. The SZDSZ is aware that the country needs a balanced government which is able to put an end to social division. During coalition talks after the run-off elections, the Free Democrats will strive to help the emergence of a new government with a large social following, ready to deal with economic questions instead of ideological debates.
