FBIS4-319 "drafr068_d_94012" FBIS-AFR-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Army Commanders' Nonpartisan Stance Questioned Army Commanders' Nonpartisan Stance Questioned MB0804085894 Maputo MEDIAFAX in Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 1 MB0804085894 Maputo MEDIAFAX Portuguese BFN [Unsigned editorial] [Text] Generals Lagos Lidimo and Mateus Ngonhamo were this week sworn in as commanders of the FADM [Mozambique Defense Armed Forces]. It is, therefore, time to demand that both of them renounce all commitments of a partisan nature. That is prompted by the following: 1. The public remarks Ngonhamo made to promote Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] standpoint are still very fresh in one's mind. (Hopefully, these were his last remarks.) 2. Although there are no facts known to the public, many observers of our peace process feel that they are right to fear that Renamo has not confined all its men and surrendered all weapons. 3. In 1992, MEDIAFAX reported the transfer of thousands of FAM [Mozambique Armed Forces] men to the police. At the time, official comments on the issue fell short of answering the questions that were raised. Information given to us by reliable sources, but which require official confirmation or denial, says those men, who were issued with police uniforms, are now in Magoanine, believed to be under the command of Lagos Lidimo. The government owes a clear and final explanation on the matter. Does Lagos Lidimo or does he not anything to do with the Magoanine force? What is the purpose of that force? Is it to replace the PRM [Mozambique Republic Police]? If in fact it is a police force, does Compol [National Commission for Police Affairs] have any control over it? The country's stability depends on the nonexistence of any hidden army, either in Magoanine or in the bush.
