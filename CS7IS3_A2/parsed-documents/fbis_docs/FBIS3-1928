This name is Xu Honggang, a squad leader of a certain unit under the Jinan Military Region and a young hero who is ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause. On the eve of the Spring Festival, General Secretary Jiang Zemin issued a call for learning from Xu Honggang. Thus, an upsurge of learning from a hero of the times and promoting healthy tendencies in society has been rapidly started in areas both north and south of the Chang Jiang. This reminds us of the radiant and enchanting spring 31 years ago when Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call for learning from Comrade Lei Feng. Lei Feng's noble ideas, character, morals, and charisma have influenced millions of people and encouraged them to pursue their lofty ideals in life over the past 31 years. Xu Honggang is an outstanding representative of those people. Why can the deeds of Lei Feng and Xu Honggang, two young soldiers of different times, excite people in the depth of their hearts? When we review these heroes' noble ideas and their processes of growth, it is not so difficult for us to find a common characteristic among them -- Both Lei Feng and Xu Honggang have been models in realizing our party's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. In his life and career, Lei Feng cherished and loved the people so much. He did numerous good turns for the masses all his life, which is a vivid portrayal of his devoting his limited life to the unlimited cause of serving the people. In an emergency, Xu Honggang expressed his loyalty and devotion to the people at lightning speed by waging a life-and-death struggle against a ruffian with a knife to protect people's property and lives. From Lei Feng to Xu Honggang, heroic deeds are not quite the same, but they radiate with the glory of the concept of serving the people and reflect the mental attitude of communists and contemporary youths. When many old people hear the term of serving the people, a historical picture presents itself before their eyes: Fifty years ago, shortly after a fighter by the name of Zhang Side laid down his life, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered his famous speech "Serve the People." This term of serving the people has encouraged generation after generation of communists and youths of noble aspirations to fight bloody battle for the interests of the nation, with one stepping into the breach as another fell, and to be the first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts. Emerging on battlefields were Dong Chengrui, who laid down his life under a hail of bullets while flinging a grenade into an enemy pillbox, and Huang Jiguang, who blocked an enemy embrasure with his own body. Coming to the fore in the peacetime of construction was Jiao Yulu, a good cadre who spared no effort in the performance of his duty for the people, and Major Shu Ning of the Artillery Corps who sacrificed himself for the life of a soldier. Our great motherland has numerous heroes. Although they are engaged in different trades or professions, what they are spiritually nurtured and the great vigor they display can find their sources from the term of serving the people. Serving the people is precisely the basic purpose of the CPC. Let each of us communists realize this purpose as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang did, and perform our duties in an outstanding manner at our respective posts! Xu Honggang is a contemporary hero who has come to the fore in the new situation in which our country is developing a socialist market economy. In our society, some people misunderstand the market economy and set the principle of material benefits against the concept of serving the people. For some time, the concept of serving the people has become diluted in or has even disappeared from the minds of some people. This is why the following phenomena have occurred: an old man over 80 and a pregnant woman jumped into the water to rescue those being drowned, while strong, young people looked on coldly; people forgot their integrity under the temptation of personal gain or saw someone in mortal danger without lifting a finger to save him. The market economy we want to establish and develop is a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. It is aimed at accelerating the development of the productive forces and achieving the four modernizations to satisfy the increasing material and cultural needs of the people. To develop a high degree of material civilization is a component of the socialist market economy, and to develop a high degree of spiritual civilization is also one of its components. This determines that while establishing a socialist market economic structure, we must attain a lofty realm of thought, develop the spirit of selfless devotion, and always bear in mind the basic purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. Fifty years have elapsed from Zhang Side to Lei Feng and to Xu Honggang. During these years, earthshaking changes have taken place in our motherland. The purpose of serving the people set by our party has been inherited and pursued by one generation of people after another. General Secretary Jiang Zemin pointed out: Xu Hongang's deeds embody the tradition of the Red Army, the People's Liberation Army, and the Communist Party. Practice once again shows us that when the tradition of the party and the spirit of the times are integrated, it will nurture millions of new heroes and models. Let us hold high the torch of serving the people and greatly push forward the four modernization of the great motherland!
