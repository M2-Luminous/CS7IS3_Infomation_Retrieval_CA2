Maynard's comments were made after news reached the region that five Latin American banana-exporting countries had got a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to rule that a European Union policy which gives preferential treatment to Caribbean bananas, violates GATT rules. Maynard, speaking to CANA, expressed surprise that Venezuela which has been leading Latin American efforts to develop closer ties with the English-speaking Caribbean, was among the five countries. The minister declined to name any Latin American country with which he was unhappy because of their fight for a bigger share of the European banana market, but it was obvious from his remarks that he was disappointed with Venezuela. "We must be conscious of those who are playing games with us," he said. "There're some countries that want to have trading arrangements with us but at the same time when it comes to our trade and our critical trade in bananas, they are on the side of those who are jeopardising our interest." Venezuela has extended to Caricom countries duty free access to its market for an initial period of five years. Just days ago, it was announced in Caracas, the venezuelan capital, that a new shipping service would be launched by March to facilitate trade between Venezuela and the English-speaking Caribbean. "In the continuing effort ... to preserve what we have, to sustain the levels of protection that we have achieved, we must recognise and see where the blast is coming from and expose it," Maynard added. "And we must let our friends know that we cannot seriously consider a partnership in trade with them as an ongoing arrangement, if at the same time at the international level, they're jeopardising our major export in bananas." Dominica and other Windward Island banana exporters contend the European preferential arrangement is critical for the survival of the key foreign exchanging earning industry. They see the continuing Latin American challenge as an attempt to hurt their economies. Reports by GATT panels have no legal weight until they are adopted by the trade body's full council which must reach consensus. Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua are the other countries which made the complaint.
