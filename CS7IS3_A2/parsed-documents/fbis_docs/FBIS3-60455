According to the deputy health minister, the first instance of AIDS observed in Iran was in 1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] in a one-year-old child. This resulted from imported blood products, he said. He announced that all blood received from donors by the Blood Transfusion Organization is being examined meticulously and no blood is being imported. Imported blood products are also being carefully tested, so there is no likelihood in Iran of AIDS being transmitted through blood. The number of AIDS victims that has been identified in Iran so far is 270, and of those, 62 have died.
