This was revealed today by Liu Baofu, head of the advertising department under the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC). Specialized advertising companies in China totalled 11,000 last year, earning 4.6 billion yuan, that is, a hike of 150 percent over 1992, according to Liu. To boost the advertising sector, the four publishing media of TV, radio, newspapers and magazines vigorously developed their own advertising enterprises in 1993, which gained an average business volume rise of 64.5 percent over the 1992 figure. The advertising enterprises affiliated with cable TV, airlines, railways and theaters reaped a total of 1.54 billion yuan, sharing 11.5 percent of the total advertising business volume of the country, said Liu. The SAIC official attributed the vigorous growth in the advertising sector to various reasons. According to Liu, Chinese entrepreneurs have become more aware of the importance of advertising for their products amid fierce market competition and are willing to spend more on the sector. Meanwhile, advertising companies are offering more satisfactory services in market investigation and research, advertising planning and media arrangement, in line with the so-called "modern advertising concept." More significantly, the overall quality of advertising services has been heightened through the government's efforts in regulating the advertising market, in which all private, collectively-owned or state-run enterprises are encouraged to compete for market share. Besides, more and more foreign enterprises are vying for the Chinese market and are investing more to advertise their products. To ensure a sound and healthy development of the sector, the government has promulgated a series of rules and regulations to tighten control over advertising for food items, cosmetics and medicines in 1993, Liu added.
