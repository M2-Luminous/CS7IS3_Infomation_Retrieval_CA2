FR941202-0-00105 FR941202-0-00011 The following rules were repealed in response to EPA's September 14, 1994 Federal Register notice: OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(41); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(53); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(63); OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2230(1)(j). The following proposed rule was not adopted by the EQC on October 21, 1994 in response to EPA's September 14, 1994 Federal Register notice: OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(4). 2. Response to Public Comment EPA received comments on the EPA's proposed action on the Oregon program from four commenters: ODEQ, the American Forest & Paper Association, the National Environmental Development Association/Clean Air Regulatory Project, and the Northwest Pulp and Paper Association. No commenters objected to approval of the Oregon permit program. a. Insignificant Emissions Units. One commenter objected to EPA's proposal that in order to avoid disapproval of its title V program, Oregon must revise its regulation defining ``categorically insignificant activities'' (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(15)) and the related provisions on permit applications (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2120(3)) and applicability (OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(7)). The commenter disagreed with EPA's position that all activities subject to applicable requirements must be properly incorporated into title V permits. The commenter further stated that the Clean Air Act does not support EPA's position and that EPA's interpretation renders the Part 70 provisions on insignificant activities meaningless. EPA maintains, however, that title V and the part 70 rules preclude the exemption of activities as ``insignificant'' when such units are subject to an applicable requirement. Section 504(a) of the Act provides that ``each permit issued under this title shall include enforceable emission limitations and standards, a schedule of compliance, a requirement that the permittee submit to the permitting authority, no less often than every 6 months, the results of any required monitoring, and such other conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with applicable requirements of the Act, including the requirements of the applicable implementation plan. '' (emphasis added). Section 70.6(a)(1) provides that each permit shall include ``emission limitations and standards, including those operational requirements and limitations that assure compliance with all applicable requirements at the time of permit issuance''. Furthermore, 70.6(c)(1) requires that each permit shall contain ``compliance, certification, testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit.'' The fact that an emission unit may emit only small quantities of pollutants does not provide a basis to exempt it from the fundamental statutory requirement that title V permits must specifically include, and ensure compliance with, all applicable requirements. EPA disagrees that requiring all activities subject to applicable requirements to be properly incorporated into title V permits will render the insignificant activities provisions of Part 70 meaningless. For example, the requirement to ``describe'' emissions of regulated pollutants in a permit application is not a requirement to quantify those emissions. Smaller units can be aggregated and described in very general terms (i.e., ``all valves and flanges not otherwise specified'') provided the description is specific enough to determine the applicability of and to impose all applicable requirements. Furthermore, the requirement to include in a permit compliance certification testing, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping sufficient to assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit does not impose the same level of rigor with respect to small emission units that do not require extensive testing or monitoring in order to determine compliance with the applicable requirements. In any event, Oregon has made the changes to its insignificant activities regulations which EPA indicated in the September 14, 1994, Federal Register notice were necessary for approval and it is these revised regulations on which EPA is taking final action at this time. The versions of OAR 340&hyph;28&hyph;110(15), 340&hyph;28&hyph;2110(7) and 340&hyph;28&hyph;2120(3) originally submitted by Oregon to EPA on November 15, 1993, as part of its title V submittal are no longer effective as a matter of State law and are no longer before EPA for consideration. Accordingly, EPA is fully approving the Oregon program with respect to insignificant activities.
