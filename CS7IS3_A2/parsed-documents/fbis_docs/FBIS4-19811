Boross thanked Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, saying that his support was instrumental in today's decision. In his opening speech, Kohl said that "Europe would be a torso without Hungary." Hungary is at this year's Fair as a "partner state", so the spotlight is on Hungarian businesses. At the Fair, 123 Hungarian firms are displaying new products over 1,800 square meters. In his speech, Boross emphasized the importance of Germany's role in Hungary's foreign trade and business. Last year there was 8.4 billion German marks trade with Germany, or 24 percent of Hungarian foreign trade. One third of foreign loans to, and 20 percent of foreign investments in, Hungary come from Germany, and there are more than 4,000 Hungarian-German joint ventures, Boross said.
