In his traditional Monday radio interview this week, Brazauskas said outlays on government will not increase, although the number of ministries will grow from 16 to 19. The president said changes within the Cabinet do not mean that a government of experts will be replaced by government of politicians. Brazauskas emphasized that ministers must be both politicians and experts. Commenting on the creation of the new Environment Protection Ministry instead of the currently existing department, which is subordinate to the parliament, Brazauskas said it is not normal that an institution of the executive branch belongs to the legislative branch. Besides, he said, such ministries exist in nearly all countries around the Baltic Sea. Similar structures should deal with such problems as pollution of the sea, Brazauskas said. Discussing division of the Culture and Education Ministry into two separate ministries, the president said these institutions were merged artificially and the step proved to be incorrect. In Brazauskas' words, the new Municipal Affairs Ministry will not be very big, but is needed to carry out government reforms "from the top to the bottom."
