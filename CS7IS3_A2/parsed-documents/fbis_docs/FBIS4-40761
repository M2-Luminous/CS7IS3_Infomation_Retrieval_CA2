Konovalov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, France now occupies a special place in the struggle for world atomic markets and nuclear fuel quotas. It has been striving to supply even atomic power stations to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. For this reason, the agreement of the European Union to our atomic exports is important. Konovalov said prices for low-grade material are falling sharply. This is connected with a surplus and free capacities at most enterprises. Since the collapse of the USSR, the fuel and nuclear complex has been concentrated in Russia. We are now producing everything including atomic fuel, highly sophisticated equipment for atomic power stations, and the cheapest energy. We are not building new stations but we are completing the construction of a number of uranium units and making some things for China and East European countries. According to the deputy minister, we are not purchasing anything abroad. However, four conversion production lines have been delivered and they have made it possible to convert the parts of the Krasnoyarsk chemical combine which once carried out military atomic orders into one of Europe's largest production facilities for audio and video cassettes. The Germans are taking uranium rods for their nuclear power stations in payment. Because of a failure to pay, we are unable to supply our fellow-countrymen, and this threatens our own nuclear power stations with closure.
