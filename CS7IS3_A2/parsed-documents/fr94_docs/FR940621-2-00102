FR940621-2-00102 FR940621-2-00064 [Release No. 34&hyph;34210; File No. SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;01] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Adding a Residual Credit Transfer Feature to the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service June 14, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on May 5, 1994, the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;01) as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by SCCP. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change will offer SCCP clearing members the ability to transfer through the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (``ACATS'') credit positions which accrue to an account after the account has been transferred to another broker-dealer. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. SCCP has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change Residual credit processing is an enhancement to SCCP's ACATS program which allows an ACATS delivering member to initiate through ACATS the transfer of residual credit positions for both cash and securities which have accrued to an account after the account has been transferred to another broker-dealer. The current method for identifying and transferring residual credits differs from firm to firm. Some firms have systems which automatically review transferred accounts for the presence of residual positions. Other firms either review transferred accounts on a periodic basis or rely on customer inquiries or claim letters from ACATS receiving firms. Currently, no matter what method a firm uses to monitor transferred accounts, to transfer residual positions the delivering firm will issue a check or will transfer securities outside of ACATS. Transferring residual positions outside of ACATS may result in lost or improperly routed checks and securities and increases the processing costs of transferring positions due to postage costs and other processing inefficiencies. The ACATS residual credit processing will help to eliminate lost or improperly routed checks and securities by providing an efficient and standardized automated method for the transfer of residual credits. The procedures for transferring residual credits are the same as the procedures for transferring customer accounts through ACATS with the following exceptions: (1) Only the delivering member may transfer residual credits through ACATS, (2) the transfer request must be initiated in an automated form, and (3) the delivering member's input constitutes both the request and the details of the residual credits. Money settlement for residual credits will be processed along with the clearing member's other ACATS money settlement obligations. In addition, to the extent that the residual securities are eligible for continuous net settlement, ACATS residual credits will be netted along with a member's other CNS obligations. However, the ACATS receiving member retains the ability to reject the residual credits or request adjustments. The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 2 of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by providing an efficient and standardized automated method for the transfer of residual credits. 2 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition SCCP does not believe that the proposed change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments have been solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective on filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) 3 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4) 4 promulgated thereunder because the proposed rule change effects a change in an existing service that does not adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of SCCP or for which SCCP is responsible and does not significantly affect the respective rights or obligations of SCCP or the clearing members using the service. At any time within sixty days of the filing of this proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 3 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii) (1988). 4 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4(e)(4) (1993). IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
