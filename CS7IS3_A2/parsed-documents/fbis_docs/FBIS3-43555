The statements were issued in reaction to the decision by the IFP Central Committee that the party will not take part in the April election unless the constitutional demands by the Alliance are met. The NP said it was prepared to consider the proposals by the IFP and the Alliance on merit, but that it would not be intimidated in the process. The party said it appeared that the IFP and the Alliance were turning towards blackmail, and there was a strong likelihood of the two organizations painting themselves into a corner. The ANC said its executive committee would discuss the matter next Friday if the IFP informed the ANC of its decision formally. The ANC said although it remained committed to negotiations with all parties, there was no chance of the election being postponed. The organization said the reasonable demands in the joint document signed by the ANC, the government, and the IFP could end the present deadlock. The IFP Central Committee said in a statement that if its demands were not met, it would not take part in the elections, liaise with the new parliamentary or provincial councils, participate in the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], nor accept TEC decisions. The IFP considered the reintroduction of double ballot papers as nonnegotiable.
