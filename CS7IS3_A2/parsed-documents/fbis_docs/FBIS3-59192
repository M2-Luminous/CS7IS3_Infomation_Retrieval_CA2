Van den Broek proposed that only the "essential parts" of the agreements be submitted to the European Parliament by the end of March. Thus, the European Parliament, which must ratify the expansion of the European Union, might begin preparations in March. Van den Broek no longer considers the presentation of complete treaties possible by 10 March. The president of the European Parliament, Egon Klepsch, believes that membership might be postponed by one year if negotiations are not concluded according to schedule. Chancellor Vranitzky told DER STANDARD in Athens that contradictory statements by commissioners of the European Union or the European Parliament on the schedule are not surprising. It must be clear, however, that accession is a political decision that will be made ultimately at the government level. Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek stated that, according to his information, there will be no delay in the talks. If problems should occur, it will still be possible to achieve a solution at the summit of the European Union in February.
