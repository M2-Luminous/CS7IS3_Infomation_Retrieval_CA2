FBIS4-48271 "drafr095_e_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Cote d'Ivoire Government Increases Water, Electricity Rates Government Increases Water, Electricity Rates AB1605141094 Abidjan FRATERNITE MATIN in French 16 May 94 p 2 AB1605141094 Abidjan FRATERNITE MATIN French BFN [Excerpt] Electricity rates will increase by an average of 19 percent within the next few days while water rates will increase by an average of 15 percent. These increases were announced by the government on 14 May. For electricity, 45 percent of regular consumers, notably 194,000 households, will be spared the rate increases. For water, 100,000 consumers will be exempted. The increases in electricity and water rates are due to the excess operational costs resulting from the devaluation. However, the necessary rate increase was calculated as strictly as possible in order not to penalize the people and to preserve the competitiveness of the country's businesses and professionals. In both cases, the state will bear the greater share of the cost. For water, the real increase in the average rate is about 40 percent, and for electricity, the rate is 30 percent. [passage omitted]
