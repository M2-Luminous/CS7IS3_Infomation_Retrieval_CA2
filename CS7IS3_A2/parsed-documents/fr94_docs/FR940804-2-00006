FR940804-2-00006 FR940804-2-00005 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;830] Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Coumarin From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David J. Goldberger or Michelle A. Frederick, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4136 or (202) 482&hyph;0186, respectively. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that coumarin from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. We have also determined that critical circumstances exist. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on January 19, 1994, (59 FR 3841, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred. On January 31, 1994, we sent a survey to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and certain companies in the PRC requesting information on production and sales of coumarin exported to the United States. The names of the companies were found in the petition and in data supplied by the Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS). We requested MOFTEC's assistance in forwarding the survey to all exporters and producers of coumarin and in submitting complete responses on their behalf. On February 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of Commerce (the Department) of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of coumarin from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value. On February 26 and 27, 1994, responses to the survey were received from Tianjin No. 1 Perfumery Factory (Tianjin Perfumery) and Shanghai Perfumery General Factory (Shanghai Perfumery), both of whom manufacture coumarin. These responses helped us identify other producers and exporters of coumarin. On February 28, 1994, MOFTEC and those PRC producers and exporters identified in the course of this proceeding, for which we had addresses, were sent full questionnaires. Additionally, during the month of March, the Department held a questionnaire presentation with MOFTEC and company officials in Beijing. In a March 28, 1994, filing, MOFTEC advised the Department that the following companies produced or exported the subject merchandise to the U.S. during the POI: Tianjin Perfumery, Shanghai Perfumery, Gaoyo Perfumery Factory (Gaoyo Perfumery), Changzhou No. 2 Chemical Plant (Changzhou Chemical) (producers); China Foreign Trade Development Companies (CFTD), Tianjin Chemicals Import & Export (Tianjin Chemicals), Tianjin Native Produce Import & Export Corporation (Tianjin Native), Jiangsu Native Produce Import & Export (Jiangsu Native), and China Tuhsu Flavors and Fragrances Import and Export Corporation (China Tuhsu) (exporters). In March and April, 1994, responses to section A of our questionnaire were received from the following producers and exporters: Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD, Tianjin Chemicals and Gaoyo Perfumery, Tianjin Perfumery and Tianjin Native, and Jiangsu Native and Changzhou Chemical. On April 13, 1994, pursuant to section 353.15(c) of the Department's regulations, we postponed the preliminary determination in this investigation (see, 59 FR 19692, April 25, 1994). In April 1994, we received responses to section C of our questionnaire from Tianjin Chemicals, Tianjin Native, CFTD, and Jiangsu Native; and responses to section D of our questionnaire from Gaoyo Perfumery, Tianjin Perfumery, Shanghai Perfumery, and Changzhou Chemical. China Tuhsu did not respond to any portion of our questionnaire.
