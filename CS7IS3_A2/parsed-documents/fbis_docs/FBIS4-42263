Following the arrest and serious charges brought against six members of Omonoia, yesterday the Tirana regime launched a new wave of persecutions by arresting 30 North Ipirotans at Gjirokaster and four at Delvine (they have been released for the time being) and searching for another 10. What other evidence does the State Department need to be convinced that human rights in Albania are being systematically violated with persecutions that aim at terrorizing the Greek minority? Tirana's goal is clear: It wants to drive the North Ipirotans out of Albania and implement known methods that Turkey had implemented for the extermination of the Greeks in Istanbul, Imroz, and Tenedos. The State Department does not have evidence. Didn't U.S. President Bill Clinton have evidence a month ago, during the Greek prime minister's visit, when he said that he was concerned about the Greek minority in Albania? What has happened since then? This is not just double-talk by the United States, but hypocrisy, which sometimes--according to the interests served--shows super sensitivity for human rights whereas usually it is indifferent. Some 40 years ago, when the Hellenism of Istanbul, Imroz, and Tenedos was being expelled, the U.S. stance was similarly hypocritical. At that time as well, the United States did not have evidence. As for Cyprus, at the time of the Attila invasion, the United States did not have evidence, as it still does not have any for the continuing occupation of Cyprus. But for Kuwait, the United States found the evidence in the value of oil. It is hypocritical to put on the same scale, the interests of the superpower and human rights, for which every U.S. leader is supposedly interested and issues a Sultan's order. It is hypocritical to cut 25 percent of aid to Turkey for the genocide of the Kurds while at the same time cutting aid to Greece as "punishment" for the embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. What scale equals a systematic genocide with the measures of a state against a provocative neighbor? Perhaps the answer is found in the American expression: Business as usual....
