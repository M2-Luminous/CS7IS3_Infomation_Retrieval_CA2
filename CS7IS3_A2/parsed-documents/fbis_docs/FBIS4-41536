Attitudes to the decree may differ but I think we are doomed to this," Russian Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray told correspondents here today. Shakhray has finished a trip to the extreme northern areas with a governmental delegation to analyze goods supplies and will attend a meeting of the council of the "Siberian Agreement" interregional association. Efforts of all power branches should be pulled in measures against organized crime, stressed Shakhray. A corresponding draft law has been approved by the government and submitted to the State Duma. Asked about his opinion of the proposal to prolong powers of deputies, the president and other power structures, Shakhray said "i almost do not doubt that the deal of political elites -- prolongation of the Civic Accord Treaty -- will not result in any elections till the end 1998. This can be legalized only with a constitutional amendment or a constitutional law". Speaking of goods delivery to the extreme northern areas, Shakhray said extreme measures will have to be taken if the goods are not transported on rivers in July. This first of all goes for oil products, coal and foodstuffs. Otherwise, they will have to evacuate residents from the extreme zones.
