FBIS4-33631 "drlat111_i_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-111 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Nicaragua Occupation of Venezuelan Embassy, Cathedral Ends Occupation of Venezuelan Embassy, Cathedral Ends PA0806135494 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1144 GMT 8 Jun 94 PA0806135494 Panama City ACAN Spanish BFN [Text] Managua, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The seizure of the Venezuelan Embassy in Managua, with five diplomats inside, by 23 former Sandinist military ended today following 11 hours of tension and negotiations as the Nicaraguan Government pledged to discuss the occupiers' petitions for compensation. Another group of at least 20 former military, who also demanded compensation for being discharged in the past four years, also ended the takeover of the Managua Cathedral. The seizure of the cathedral occurred almost at the same time and was also peaceful. Diogenes Silva, assigned to the embassy's military attache office, confirmed that the former military had left and said that "control of the diplomatic office" had been regained. Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant and four other diplomats remained inside the embassy, which is located on the outskirts of Managua. Moments later, Donald Flores -- one of the former military who seized the cathedral and led a similar action in 1993 -- also confirmed his partners had left the church. Kidder Salazar, first secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy, told ACAN-EFE during the occupation that he and the other diplomats did not stay there as hostages, but to protect the embassy. The former military -- who were unarmed -- released two employees who were also at the embassy after several hours. Also on Tuesday, other former military seized and occupied the Italian Embassy in Managua and the UN building for several hours. Following the civil war and the demobilization of thousands of combatants, there were two simultaneous abductions of political leaders and high-ranking officials in Nicaragua last year. Former contras were responsible for one of the abductions in northern Nicaraguan while Sandinists were responsible for the other abduction in the capital. In 1993, another heavily armed anti-Sandinist command seized and occupied the Nicaraguan Embassy in Costa Rica for two weeks. Today's occupation was solved around midnight, local time (0600 GMT), after Vilma Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights, and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, of the Managua Archbishopric, mediated the conflict. Both assured that the government had agreed to begin conversations within two days with the former military, thereby allowing the solution of the cathedral's occupation. A letter from Alfredo Mendieta, justice minister, to Nunez and Montenegro, announced that the government accepted the negotiation and in addition would release seven former military who had been arrested. In exchange, however, the minister demanded that the military leave "immediately the embassy and the cathedral." In the negotiations it was agreed to create a commission to discuss the retired military's claims. The commission will have two representatives of the "Movement for a Fair and Honorable Compensation," Eduardo Hernandez and Adrian Calero. According to the government commitment, compensation will be negotiated for an unspecified number of retired military based on the October 1993 agreements. At that time the cathedral was also occupied by discontented former Sandinist military. Vilma Nunez and Monsignor Montenegro will act as mediators again in the negotiations. The government also accepted the diplomatic mission occupants' demand that no reprisals would be taken against members of the movement. Donald Flores, leader of the former military, declared that he hoped that the "actions aimed at a peaceful solution" of their demands for compensation for their years of service, had concluded. Nevertheless, Frank Cesar, deputy government minister, said before the agreement was reached, that they have no right to any compensation and that some of the former military "had been involved in criminal actions," while others already had collected their compensation and continue to work in government institutions. The official assured that the previous Sandinist regime had fired hundreds of military who served in the former Interior Ministry; the majority now are demanding compensation to which they have no right. He explained that in February, 785 persons received their compensation although it appears that 1,000 were demobilized from the Interior Ministry, the majority before April 1990 when Violeta Chamorro took office.
