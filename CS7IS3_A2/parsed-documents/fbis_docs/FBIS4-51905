An inspection team at the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs detected illegal practices by 24 importers in March and the ministry ordered them to destroy frankfurters valued at 19 billion won, although two-thirds had already been sold. The officials are Chang Chun-sik, 48, who now works for the National Institute for Safety Research, and Chi Yong-ae, 37, at the Pusan National Quarantine Station (PNQS). The ministry yesterday asked a disciplinary committee of the Government Administration Ministry to determine their punishment. Chang and Chi, who worked together for the PNQS in November 1990, permitted importers to extend expiration dates of refrigerated sausages from 30 days to 90 days as if they had been frozen.
