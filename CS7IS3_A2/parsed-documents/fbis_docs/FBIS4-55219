[Horn] My condition has improved a lot. My hand has been operated on and the fracture in my cervical vertebra has been stabilized; my ribs will soon be healed as well and, of course, the election results have helped a lot to improve my mood. The most important lesson for me is that a wise, mature society lives here in this country. By this I mean that a lot of things can be said about a person, or some people, but if they are able to demonstrate an authentic policy, people will be taken by this and people will accept it. [Correspondent] Is it this to which you attribute victory of the Socialists? [Horn] I attribute it to the sense and wisdom of these 10.5 million people, among them 8 million citizens with voting rights. Well, 58 of our individual parliamentary candidates are still competing -- in leading positions -- with others. We would like to gain a decisive majority of these seats because I am convinced that a substantial turnabout can be achieved in this country only if the Socialist Party wins the elections with a big majority. However, I have to add immediately that it is not for power that we are striving but for the beginning of a normal policy, for an end to hatred among people, for cooperation with any power which wants to do something for the country. [Correspondent] Several analysts have said that it is clear that Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate for the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] will be the Socialist Party's candidate for prime minister. A leading German paper has also written this. [Horn] I do not know where the analysts have received this information. It has not even occurred to us. Excuse me, but the candidate for prime minister will be offered by the winning party. If we have a chance for victory, the Socialist will provide the prime minister. If the SZDSZ finishes ahead of us, this can be discussed. I maintain my view that individuals are not important, for whatever government comes into power, it will have a difficult job on its hands. What is important is the determination, the will, the program, and the team which exist within and around the Socialist Party. This is what will decide the next four years in Hungary. I see everywhere that people have tremendous expectations regarding the coming period. A change has to be made and things will have to be put in order. The road of normal development has to be paved. Otherwise something that one of the ladies told me at an election forum will come to be: If you too disappoint us, if you do not win, we will all leave home. Let nobody leave this country, other than for touristic reasons. The next act is the second round of the elections. After that, coalition negotiations with the other parties can commence. My opinion is that no democratic force should stand against another democratic force. If we find a group or party with whom agreement can be reached about the country's vital issues, than an agreement has to be made. There is a need for a turnabout but not for turning things upside down. [Correspondent] If the Socialist Party is unable to find coalition partners, will it be willing to form a government on its own? [Horn] A party supported by the majority of society (?does not need to) form a minority government. At the moment, it seems that the majority of society supports us. If this is also expressed in the votes on 29 May, then society can be certain that we will accomplish what we promised in our program. This party does not want to exclude anyone. This party will be open to every decent force regardless of the outcome of the votes and [word indistinct] we will do everything to pull the country out of the crisis. [Correspondent] Thank you for the interview and on behalf of the "Newsreel" program I wish you a speedy recovery. [Horn] Thank you very much.
