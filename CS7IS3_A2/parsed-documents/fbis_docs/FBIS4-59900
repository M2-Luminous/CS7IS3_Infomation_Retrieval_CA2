The world shook and judgments were passed after the statements attributed to Yasir 'Arafat about jihad for Jerusalem, a recording of which was broadcast by Israel radio the day before yesterday. We heard that the Palestinian president made the statements attributed to him at a mosque in Johannesburg in South Africa. Regardless of the circumstances in which the statements were made, how accurately they were reported, and the timing of their reporting, one week after the fact, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has insisted on exploiting the event and on regarding it as "a serious violation of his ['Arafat's] written undertakings which threatens the peace process." Rabin's escalation got sympathy from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who directed his aides to investigate the statements. All that despite the fact that there was no Palestinian confirmation of the alleged statements and despite the fact that a responsible U.S. source said that there should be no exaggeration of what was alleged to have happened or what did happen. Even [Israeli] Communication and Culture Minister Shulamit Aloni -- of Meretz, which supports full withdrawal from the occupied territories -- downplayed the "seriousness" of the statements and said that 'Arafat perhaps wanted "to voice his fear of the fait accompli and disappointment at having gotten less than he had hoped for" in the negotiations with Israel. Judgments have been passed with hints of jeopardizing the withdrawal program and reneging on the agreements even though the whole story is hearsay. Regardless of what 'Arafat did or did not say, the fact remains that Jerusalem, the first qiblah [to which Muslims used to turn in their prayers] and the third holy place, belongs to the Muslims, and Israel should realize this fact. By contrast, and this is what is really strange, the charge made by the UN observers in Hebron yesterday that the Israeli Army was preventing them from carrying out their mission as observers of Palestinian safety in the city, has passed unnoticed, and the words and actions of Jerusalem's Mayor Ehud Olmert (a former minister in the Likud government) and his call for the confirmation of Jerusalem as "the unified and eternal capital" of Israel, disregarding the feelings of Muslims and Christians throughout the world, have fallen on deaf ears and blind eyes. We talk and are blamed, and they act and are acquitted.
