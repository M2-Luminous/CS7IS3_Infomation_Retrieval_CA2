He also had a one-hour conversation with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. After years of confrontation and polarization, Walesa said in greeting the U.S. guest, there is now a chance to build a new order in Europe. We have fought for 50 years for Europe without divisions. This has cost millions of victims; the financial costs were enormous. After the sophisticated struggle in the 1980's, there is now a chance to resolve the problems. Fast action and courageous decisions are needed, the president said. [Begin Walesa recording] I am convinced that, by cooperating with the United States, we can achieve beautiful victories in Europe. We are, however, concerned about the remnants of communism and the Warsaw Treaty. Of course, there are no direct dangers, but a sphere under a question mark still remains. We wonder whether this sphere, when left alone, can rebuild the old setup in different conditions but following the communist pattern, or whether one should aim at unity in Europe.
