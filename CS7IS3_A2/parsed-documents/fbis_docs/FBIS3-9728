The minister expressed his trust in Russia's foreign policy, and said that peace partnership would provide a good framework for reducing anti-Western prejudice in Russians. In his view, Russia's more active foreign policy poses no danger to the region. If this policy aims to restore peace in the Balkans, it is welcomed by all, Jeszenszky said. The minister mentioned that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would visit Budapest next week. Russian Patriarch Aleksey II, who visited Hungary recently, could also experience that both the Hungarian people and policy-makers are eager to strengthen economic relations with Russia, Jeszenszky said. Concerning the new Slovak government, the minister said that Hungary is ready to pursue a policy of extended arms. Should someone grasp this arm, it would be fortunate not only for the two countries but even for Europe as a whole, he said.
