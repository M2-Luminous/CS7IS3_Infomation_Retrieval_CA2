FR940610-2-00038 FR940610-2-00031 I. Jurisdiction and Authority The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify persons injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of its regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds see, Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981) and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). II. Background Mt. Airy operated a refinery in Mt. Airy, Louisiana from the date of its incorporation under the laws of the state of Ohio in 1977 until its dissolution on August 11, 1983. It was therefore a ``refiner'' as that term has been defined in the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. As such, Mt. Airy was subject to the jurisdiction of DOE. In accordance with the reporting requirements found at 10 CFR 211.66(b)(h), Mt. Airy was required to submit a ``Refiners Monthly Report'' detailing its crude oil receipts, runs to stills and volume of crude oil processed. DOE reviewed Mt. Airy's compliance with those regulatory provisions, as well as provisions set forth at section 211.67, during the course of an audit of Mt. Airy's principal business operations. The audit was conducted during the period beginning on January 1, 1977 and ending on January 27, 1981. On July 25, 1986, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) which found that Mt. Airy had improperly reported its crude oil receipts for the period beginning July 1977 and ending November 1977, by approximately 300,000 barrels of controlled crude oil. ERA amended that Proposed Remedial Order on May 27, 1987 (the May 1987 PRO) to include additional entitlement reporting violations by Mt. Airy. In its May 1987 PRO ERA found that Mt. Airy under reported its crude receipts by a total of (i) 1,018,905 barrels of controlled crude oil; or (ii) 718,905 barrels of controlled crude oil, in the event OHA found that Mt. Airy was not required to report the 300,000 barrels identified in the original PRO. The May 1987 PRO directs Mt. Airy to refund the amount of its violation, plus interest. The PRO further states that Mt. Airy shareholders were individually liable, to the extent that Mt. Airy's assets were distributed to them upon its dissolution in 1983, for refunding the violation amount. ERA found that shareholder liability in this case was predicated upon the ``trust fund doctrine'', which provides that stockholders who receive assets upon corporate dissolution hold those assets in trust for the payment of bona fide corporate debts incurred before dissolution. See Bayport, 18 DOE ¶83,007 at 86,058 (1989). Mt. Airy and its former shareholders vigorously contested the May 1987 PRO in proceedings before OHA. Nonetheless, without admitting any violations, they agreed to enter into a Consent Order with DOE to settle the alleged violations. The Consent Order was published in proposed form in the Federal Register on November 26, 1990 (the November 1990 Order). 55 FR 49104. 1 1 On January 17, 1991, ERA published a notice making the Proposed Consent Order a final DOE Order pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199J. 56 FR 1804. According to the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy's alleged violations resulted in its receipt of $2,059,649.94 in entitlements which it was not authorized to receive. The maximum potential liability, with interest, was estimated by ERA as roughly $7.6 million. Id. After assessing a number of factors, including the time and expense required to litigate fully every issue in order to obtain any recovery, ERA concluded that the resolution of the matters referred to in the Proposed Consent Order for the principal sum of $2,000,000 was both an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Id. In accordance with the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy and its former shareholders (1) paid the principal sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000.00), plus interest, in full and final settlement of all matters covered by the Order; and (2) agreed to retain (i) Mt. Airy's records evidencing sales volume data for each product subject to controls, during the period covered by the audit; and (ii) Mt. Airy's customers' names and addresses. The November 1990 Order requires Mt. Airy to retain the records described above for a period of thirty (30) days following DOE's final distribution of the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds or January 1, 2000, whichever occurs earlier. Mt. Airy shall make such information available to DOE, if so requested. III. The Proposed Refined Product Refund Procedures A. Crude Oil Refund Policy The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP). See 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. See Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). Under the MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the Federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specified that, after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid, any remaining monies will be disbursed to the Federal government and to the states in equal amounts. For a more detailed discussion of the MSRP see, In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶90,509 (1986)(the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).
