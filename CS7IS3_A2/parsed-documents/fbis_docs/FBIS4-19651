[Michelini] Such a decision would have to be agreed upon within the context of the Pact, of which I am a member. It cannot be a personal matter or something done in a hurry. On what conditions might I join the government? This is a question that concerns the entire Pact and the Center. [Politi] And what are those conditions? [Michelini] Antimonopoly legislation, the antifascist issue, a genuine federalism, and a policy on the family. Be that as it may, at present I see no possibility of any comprehensive connection with the government. [Politi] Nevertheless, Berlusconi strongly believes in such a ministry. With what do you think it should deal? [Michelini] It should be a center for coordinating and initiating family policies. In France it was a Socialist, Mitterrand, who decided to establish such a ministry, and in Germany it was the Social Democrats. There is nothing new to invent. Let us look at the other examples in Europe; we need to gather together forms of expertise that are at present dispersed. The Health Ministry deals with elderly people, the Interior Ministry deals with young people, the Foreign Ministry deals with some forms of adoption, and the Labor and Finance Ministries are also involved. Instead, everything should be coordinated. [Politi] What are the priorities? [Michelini] Jobs for young people, with tax relief on first jobs, the definition of part-time work status for men and women, housing for young couples, health and pension benefits for housewives, and tax policy, which must take account of all members of the family. These issues must be tackled at last, because the family is a common asset, irrespective of ideologies. Let us not forget that many people voted for Berlusconi because he, at last, talked about the family. [Politi] And so we come back to Berlusconi. The future prime minister has announced that he wants an alliance with the Center. With which of you has he initiated contacts? [Michelini] Neither with me nor with Segni's Pact. Of course, both within the Pact and within the Italian Popular Party [PPI] there are members well disposed toward such an approach. [Politi] Who are they? [Michelini] Within the PPI, the Formigoni-Buttiglione group; within the Pact, apart from myself, there are Tremonti, the economist; professor Siciliani; Judge Stajano; and Milio, the attorney. We are five out of 13. Another two or three might join us. This position must be taken into account. Tomorrow we Pact members of parliament will have a meeting with rank and file members at the Metropol Hotel, and we will discuss this. Furthermore, I have already told Segni directly: "Mario," I said, "now that La Malfa and Amato are shifting to the Left, what will we do?" [Politi] What was Segni's reply? [Michelini] We are of the Center-Right, we are liberal democrats, but we are closed to Berlusconi and Berlusconism. [Politi] But you consider that a mistake. [Michelini] I told Segni that we cannot remain closed. If Berlusconi puts forward acceptable arguments, he must be brought toward the Center. No comprehensive accord is necessary, but certainly the Right must be encouraged to become the Center that [LA VOCE editor] Montanelli would like. In other words, if he puts forward a program that is not unacceptable, I will not vote against it but will abstain. That is, I do not accept a fundamental rejection of Berlusconi, and neither do the Italian people accept such an attitude. [Politi] What does the Church hierarchy think? Have you met with Cardinal Ruini? [Michelini] I will be meeting with him this week. I want to hear his opinion concerning issues that are of close concern to the Church. This, because it is the first time that an opportunity has arisen to implement the Catholic social doctrine. It has never happened before: The DC [Christian Democratic Party] never did anything about it, using the excuse of its nonconfessional allies; and I am talking about issues such as education, the family, solidarity, and the protection of life from birth to death. [Politi] Does the Vatican share that opinion? [Michelini] The Vatican is waiting to see how the situation turns out. The crucial date will be in July, at the PPI congress. If Buttiglione is not elected secretary, a split is inevitable. Buttiglione is the most faithful interpreter into political terms of the Church's social doctrine.
