A statement addressing these soldiers was distributed in Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, and other cities. The statement says: Your history, dignity, Arabism, and Arab magnanimity require you to rebel. This call is a sincere invitation to rescue yourself from the quagmire of crime against our kinsfolk and clan. The statement adds: Our call is genuine and does not stem from emotions. Throughout the years, we have persevered and we have suppressed our pain and sorrow as we saw part of our own people practice killing and terrorism against our people everywhere in southern Lebanon and Palestine. The statement says: It is now time for you to return to your genuine Arab dignity and magnanimity that was upheld by the great struggler Sultan Pasha al-Atrash followed by the great struggler Kamal Junblat. Let those heroes be your paragon of honor and dignity. The statement says colonialist invaders are evicted and defeated and oppressed people triumph. History tells us about the invaders and colonialists. Remember your ancestors at Jabal al-'Arab who, led by struggler Sultan Pasha al-'Atrash, defeated and evicted the French, just as they were evicted from Algeria and just as the United States left Vietnam in defeat. Fatah hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you and the occupation army and other security bodies will not protect you. The warning says: It is time for retribution. Your only chance is to immediately leave the settlements before it is too late. The warning adds: If you leave, you will survive. Leave the settlement immediately. Your life from now on will be at the mercy of our heroic men.
