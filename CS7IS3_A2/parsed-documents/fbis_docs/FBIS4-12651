Does that mean that there are U.S. assurances that such a step will be completed on this date? ['Arafat] Dr. al-Baz made that statement before the recent hectic and unbalanced maneuvers. While the economic talks between us and them were continuing in Paris, they decided to suspend the talks in Cairo on the pretext of celebrations in Israel. This raises the question that there are two governments in Israel: one sanctioning negotiation and another suspending it. It is one of the continued Israeli maneuvers designed to obstruct the main aspect of the negotiations, that is the withdrawal. It has become known that Israel is procrastinating to obstruct the peace agreement. Regrettably, there are -- for the first time in Israeli history -- tendencies inside the Israeli Army controlling the Israeli Government's policy. Rabin is a prisoner of these tendencies inside the Army. [Abu-Husayn] But a month ago Israel was urging a speedy resumption of the negotiations to implement the agreement, so what is the secret behind this contradiction? ['Arafat] There are secret organizations inside the Israeli Army, like the French organizations that confronted the brothers in Algeria after they had signed the first and second Evian agreements. It is the same thing. There are secret organizations inside the Israeli Army seeking to obstruct the implementation of the agreement. [Abu-Husayn] Obstructing the implementation of the agreement would lead to further violence and counterviolence. In your view, what is the solution? ['Arafat] That is true. I hold Rabin responsible, especially as any obstruction of the agreement's implementation will have serious adverse effects on the overall situation inside our occupied land, because there is a serious Israeli escalation against the Palestinians, especially from Army units, extremist elements, armed settlers, and secret organizations. There are four secret organizations in the Army: "Sha'ol's Sword," "David's Sling," "Revenge," and "Custodians of the Temple." This is known to the cosponsors of the peace process, the United States and Russia, who have been informed of details of the actions carried out by the secret organizations operating inside the Israeli Army. [Abu-Husayn] Hamas and Islamic Jihad today urged preparedness for war. What is your opinion? ['Arafat] That is part of escalating the incident and a reaction to the escalation of Israeli violence. [Abu-Husayn] After the PLO's regret for the Israelis' murder, the United States is demanding that you take a stronger position. What is your position? ['Arafat] We should not forget that victims of the bus incident include some Palestinians, as it was a public bus used by the Palestinians of 1948. [Abu-Husayn] Do you invite Rabin to come to Cairo tomorrow to sign the agreement? ['Arafat] I agreed with the brothers in Egypt to return to Cairo on 12 April so that after this date the implementation of the withdrawal operations would begin and Israeli Army troops would be replaced by Palestinian security forces in both the Gaza and Jericho strips. So I am not going to invite Rabin. It is the cosponsors' responsibility to maintain the thrust of the peace process and force the Israelis to implement what was agreed. It is also the international community's responsibility. [Abu-Husayn] So do you expect the signing to take place this month, at the end of it, as Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said? ['Arafat] I am not in a position to offer expectations. But let Rabin and the Israeli Government understand that obstruction is harming not only the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well. [Abu-Husayn] Why do you not invite Rabin to sign? ['Arafat] I am not inviting Rabin to sign, because yesterday he refused to sign on 12 April -- which is a defiance of the Israeli proposal. The U.S. Administration should contact Rabin, especially as it proposed this date! [Abu-Husayn] In view of the repeated talk about the U.S. secretary of state's participation in the agreement signing, does that mean that a breakthrough concerning the date will emerge within days? ['Arafat] I do not think so. [Abu-Husayn] When will you go to Jericho? ['Arafat] That matter is delayed for a while, because I am dealing with the events, and Israel is maneuvering for the sake of obstructing the agreement. This should be known to the Palestinians, Arabs, and the whole world. Rabin is under pressure from a force in Israel exercising obstruction. Rabin is controlled by this situation, and he has to prove otherwise! [Abu-Husayn] How do you view the importance of the Arab position's support for the implementation of the agreement? ['Arafat] The importance of peace in confronting the warmongers for the sake of posperity has been proved today. There have been incidents which stress the importance of bolstering peace and assuming this responsibility fully. The current situation is much more serious than it appears on the surface, and I always warn of it. [Abu-Husayn] What would you tell those opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, especially in view of the hitch in the negotiations? ['Arafat] The severity of the opposition gives you the answer...tell me who your enemies are, and I will tell you who you are! ('Arafat did not elaborate) [Abu-Husayn] What are the results of your visit to Cairo? ['Arafat] President Mubarak and Egyptian officials have made huge efforts, but regrettably, Israel is not listening to any appeals and has abandoned all the promises it made. While the Cairo negotiations have been suspended, the economic negotiations are continuing in Paris. [Abu-Husayn] When will the negotiations resume? ['Arafat] There is talk that they should be resumed Sunday (tomorrow) [10 April]. We see Israeli attempts to avoid implementing the agreement and get around it with a view to abolishing or obstructing it.
