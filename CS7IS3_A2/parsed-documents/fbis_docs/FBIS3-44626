The Beijing Municipal Students' Federation ceremoniously held its seventh congress on that date. Chen Xitong, Zhang Jianmin, Li Zhijian, Chen Guangwen, Jiang Daming, Wang Tong, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, Tao Xiping, Hu Zhaoguang, Feng Mingwei, Chen Dabai, and Yao Wang attended the opening ceremony. [passage omitted] The municipal students' federation now has 900 member units. In the past four years, 160,000 college and high school students in Beijing applied to join the party, 14,016 students joined party organizations, and 2,817 students became national or municipal three-good students. Chen Xitong gave a speech at the congress. He said: I attended the congress of the students' federation four years ago. Rapid and great changes have taken place in these four years. I would like to hold a heart-to-heart talk with you students. I will speak on three questions for your discussion: 1) what is the most lofty and beautiful people's ideal, 2) how should they turn this ideal into reality, and 3) how should they work to achieve this ideal. Chen Xitong said: These are important questions on why people live. Everyone has his own ideal. In my opinion, rather than the ideal to make a few people affluent and happy, no ideal is loftier than the one to let all Chinese people lead affluent lives. Such a lofty ideal is a communist ideal, and those who fight for it are good youths. Of course, we should acknowledge our backwardness, but never should we be resigned to it. Only those who do down-to-earth work in order to change backwardness comprise the backbone of China, and youths should embrace only the idea of changing backwardness as the concept on life. Chen Xitong also said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics clearly indicates the road we should take. On the road of building socialism, young students should acquire knowledge well and master skills. Only by so doing can they have the strength to work hard. They must never be "lazy in youth lest they regret in old age."
