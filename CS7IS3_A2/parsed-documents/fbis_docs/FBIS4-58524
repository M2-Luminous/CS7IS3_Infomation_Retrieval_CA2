This agreement does not spell out clearly the future of these negotiations nor is it committed to recognizing a Palestinian state, political rights, or the human rights of the refugees. He added: proceeding from this premise, we are not among those who are enthusiastic about or applaud this agreement. But since the PLO broke away from Arab solidarity and coordination, which was in its own interests, and since all we wanted from this coordination was to stress our moral obligation to the Palestinian cause, all we can do is to wish the PLO success, despite this agreement's being shamefaced [khajulan] in terms of its results.
