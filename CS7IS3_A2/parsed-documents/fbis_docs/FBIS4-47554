An attempt is made to establish the possibility of leptospirae identification and differentiation in a DNA-DNA hybridization reaction. To this end, reference leptospirae strains of 23 serological groups and commercial leptospirae strains used for making animal leptospirosis vaccines were examined. The conclusion is drawn that the use of DNA-DNA hybridization may substantially expand the leptospirae identification and differentiation test system, shorten the study duration, and increase the number of animals examined. The findings show that the use of molecular DNA cloning makes it possible to obtain a genus-specific DNA probe, the pLp 41, which is a fragment of the L. interrogans DNA of the pomoma serotype. The DNA probe thus engineered fuses with DNA specimens of many pathogenic leptospirae serotypes but does not fuse with any of the known saprophytic leptospira strains, thus making it possible to discriminate between pathogenic and saprophytic leptospirae. No DNA specimen hybridization signals from Y. pseudotuberculosis and other cells were recording for bacteria with the pLp 41 DNA probe, attesting to its high specificity.
