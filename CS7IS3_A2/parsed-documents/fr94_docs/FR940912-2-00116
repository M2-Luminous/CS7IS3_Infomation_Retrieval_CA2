ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare wilderness management plans and environmental documents and host public scoping meetings. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given of intent to prepare several wilderness management plans. This notice also constitutes the scoping notice required by the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.7). (1) Description of proposed planning action: In accordance with Bureau of Land Management wilderness management policy guidance, Wilderness Management Plans will be developed for six wilderness areas. Because several of the areas share similar issues or are in close proximity with each other, the six areas will be covered by three wilderness management plans: one for the Tres Alamos Wilderness, one for the Signal Mountain and Woolsey Peak Wildernesses, and one for the Harquahala Mountains, Hummingbird Springs and Bighorn Mountains Wildernesses. An Environmental Assessment of the impacts of the proposed actions and alternatives will be prepared prior to approval of each plan. The plans will state policies, actions and monitoring standards to be used to maintain each area's wilderness resources and will consider issues and alternatives identified through a number of public forums including scoping meetings. The public is invited to participate in scoping meetings beginning in October 1994. (2) Geographic areas involved: The six wilderness areas are in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern and south central Arizona, located in Maricopa, eastern La Paz, and southwestern Yavapai Counties. Towns in the vicinity are Bagdad, Wickenburg, Aquila, and Gila Bend. Distances from Phoenix range from 35 miles to the southwest, 55 miles to the west, and 80 miles to the northwest. (3) Types of issues anticipated: Wilderness values such as naturalness, solitude and primitive recreational opportunities must be preserved. Use of these areas for developed public and commercial recreation, education, research, wildlife and wild burro management, livestock grazing, mining and existing private rights will be assessed. Acceptable levels of these uses as well as for primitive recreation will be identified. Appropriate levels of activity to administer the areas, e.g., assuring public access, providing recreational facilities, signing, law enforcement, search and rescue, wild burro removal, and fire suppression will be determined. (4) Disciplines to be represented in the preparation of the management plans will include: Wilderness, Recreation, Cultural, Wildlife, Range, Livestock, Wild Burro and Fire Management. (5) The kind and extent of public involvement to be provided: Three public scoping meetings will be held to identify issues and opportunities for management of the six areas. These will be held in Gila Bend, Wickenburg and Phoenix, Arizona at the following times and locations: Tuesday, October 4, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Gila Bend Community Center, 202 Euclid Ave., Gila Bend, Arizona. Wednesday, October 5, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Wickenburg Community Center, 160 North Valentine Street, Wickenburg, Arizona. Thursday, October 6, 1994, 6 p.m.&hyph;9 p.m., Phoenix District Office Conference Room, Bureau of Land Management, 2015 West Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona. Written comments regarding issues and opportunities for management will also be accepted until October 15, 1994. Comments should be sent to: Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, Attn: John R. Christensen, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027. Interested publics will be sent copies of the completed draft Wilderness Management Plans and associated Environmental Assessments and will have 45 days in which to comment. Interest in this mailing will be solicited and a mailing list maintained at the Phoenix District Office. ADDRESSES: Relevant documents will be available for public review at the Phoenix District Office, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona, 85027. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Jamrog, Bureau of Land Management, Lower Gila Resource Area, Telephone 602&hyph;780&hyph;8090. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These areas were added to the Wilderness Preservation System by Public Law 101&hyph;628, of November 28, 1990, known as the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act of 1990. Management and use of these areas is directed by this law as well as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Wilderness Act of 1964. The area involved in this planning effort include 8,300 acres in the Tres Alamos Wilderness, 22,880 acres in the Harquahala Mountains Wilderness, 31,200 acres in the Hummingbird Springs Wilderness, 21,000 acres in the Bighorn Mountains Wilderness, 15,250 acres in the Signal Mountain Wilderness, and 64,000 acres in the Woolsey Peak Wilderness. Areas and activities on non-wilderness land adjacent to the wilderness boundaries may also be addressed in these plans. These areas are also described in the Lower Gila South and Upper Sonoran Final Wilderness Environmental Impact Statements of 1987 available at the above address. Dated: September 2, 1994. Gordon L.
