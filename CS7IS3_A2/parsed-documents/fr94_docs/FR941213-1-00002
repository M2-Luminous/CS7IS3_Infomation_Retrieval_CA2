SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Statute Section 202(e)(7) of the FBSEA amended section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA) by adding a requirement that the Board, in consultation with the Treasury, develop and publish criteria to be used in evaluating the operation of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis. In developing such criteria, the Board is required to allow reasonable opportunity for public review and comment. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7). In order to implement this statutory provision, the Board is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 12 CFR part 211 of its regulations governing international banking operations. The Congress in enacting the FBSEA recognized the importance of the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of banks operating internationally. The FBSEA strengthened the role of U.S. banking supervisors as the host country supervisors of foreign banks operating in this country. The Act also recognized the importance of home country supervision in assuring the overall safety and soundness of foreign banks that conduct operations in the United States by requiring the Board: 1. To determine that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor in order to establish a new banking presence in this country; and 2. To establish, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, these criteria in order to evaluate the operation of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to such supervision. As provided in sections 7(e) (1) and (5) of the IBA, as amended, a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis is a sufficient ground, in and of itself, for the Board to require or, in respect of federal branches or agencies, to recommend, termination of the foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(1),(5). Termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations in these circumstances is not mandatory, however. Instead, in enacting section 7(e)(7) of the IBA, Congress recognized that there may be factors in particular cases that militate against termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7).
