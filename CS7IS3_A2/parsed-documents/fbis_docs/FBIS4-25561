In the eyes of most Chinese people, AIDS is mainly a foreigners' disease. But a report for the Chinese Government has warned that AIDS could be a serious problem. The State Council Research Office report is based on research by the State Council and the ministry of Public Health which studied China's AIDS prevention and control programmes. The world's first AIDS case was reported in the United States in 1981. In the early 1990's, 400,000 patients around the world were diagnosed with AIDS. Nearly half of them were found in the United States. Since the mid-1990's, however, the threat of AIDS has become of worldwide concern and it is now spreading especially fast in developing countries. According to a conservative estimate by the World Health Organization, the world will have seen 50 million people infected by HIV by the year 2000. Most of these are expected to be in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. HIV is one of the viruses that causes AIDS. China's first case of AIDS, in Beijing, was reported in June 1985. The patient was an American tourist. Since then, 1,361 cases of HIV infection have been reported in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; 1,106 cases of HIV infection were found among mainland Chinese, the rest among foreigners and overseas Chinese. Forty of the HIV carriers have developed AIDS, and 22 of them have died. These figures were determined by a very small-scale testing operation among nearly 3 million people. In China, the HIV virus has been spread mainly through the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users in Southwest China's Yunnan Province. More than 70 percent of China's AIDS cases reportedly come from Yunnan as a result of sharing needles. However, in recent times, HIV infection from heterosexual contact is increasing faster than infection from sharing needles. In 1991, 5.6 per cent of the HIV carriers were infected through sexual contact; in 1992, the figure was 13.8 per cent; and in 1993, 15.7 percent. Outside Yunnan, most patients were found to have contracted HIV through sexual contact. Before 1989, most HIV-carriers found in China were among foreigners. But since then, the number of Chinese infected with HIV has risen comparatively quickly. The State Council report predicts that about 100,000 mainland Chinese will be HIV-positive by the year 2000. The report predicts about 20,000 cases will have developed into full-blown AIDS. The World Health Organization predicts that by the end of this century the number of HIV infected people in China will be no less than the average for Asian countries as a whole. If this happens, China will have a large number of HIV-infected people. The danger of this happening is quite feasible, according to the State Council report. The 1992 World Health Conference predicted by 2002, southern Sahara in Africa would be the hardest-hit HIV-infected region in the world, as it was at the time of the report. But towards the end of this decade, it will be Asia, home to 50 per cent of the world's population, that will witness a sharp rise in the spread of HIV. Each year, the number of Asians becoming infected with HIV is expected to be greater than the number of new infections in Africa. A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine shows that nearly half of the students investigated in eight Shenyang colleges, in Liaoning Province, did not fully understand how HIV was spread. Public ignorance over how HIV is spread makes large-scale infections possible, said the State Council report. The increase in prostitution in China is expected to make sexual contact the most common factor in the spread of the infection, said the State Council report. Police authorities are also concerned over the increase in drug use and, along with that, needle-sharing that can spread HIV. What is worse, say officials, is that drug users tend to be promiscuous. Women drug users often become involved in prostitution to finance their drug habit. This undoubtedly accelerates the spread of HIV, said the report. China is yet to test all of its blood donor samples for traces of HIV. Medical equipment, if not disinfected carefully, can be the agent for spreading HlV. In some of China's rural hospitals, medical equipment is not carefully disinfected, said the State Council report. People aged between 18 and 45 are considered to be at the highest risk of contracting HIV. About 80 per cent of HIV-cases in China now are people aged between 20 and 49. Because this age group represents a normally productive part of society, the report says, the burden on the Chinese economy could be great. Average annual medical expenses for AIDS patients range from 3,300 to 7,400 yuan ($381 to $855), which is half the average annual family income in China. According to the report, some high-ranking officials show indifference to the potentially devastating threat of AIDS in China. China now has only 1,000 or so HIV-infected people, they argue. Even if this number were to increase 20-fold, it would still represent just a tiny fraction of the nation's populace, they say. Many ordinary people still think AIDS is just a foreigners' disease and, providing one doesn't become involved in prostitution, doesn't represent a real danger. Also, some prostitutes think they can avoid infection by avoiding foreign clients, said the report. Public awareness about the threat is at a low level in China. Each year, wide publicity is given to the AIDS issue around December 1, which is World AIDS Day. But for the rest of the year, the problem is often ignored. To increase public awareness on the AIDS problem, the Chinese media need to provide free time and space for public education, said the report.
