FR940304-1-00043 FR940304-1-00011 40 CFR Part 261 [SW&hyph;FRL&hyph;4844&hyph;5] Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Waste; Proposed Exclusion AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule and request for comment. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is proposing to grant a petition submitted by Bethlehem Steel Corporation (BSC), Sparrows Point, Maryland, to exclude certain solid wastes generated at its facility from the lists of hazardous wastes contained in §261.31 and §261.32. This action responds to a delisting petition submitted under §260.20, which allows any person to petition the Administrator to modify or revoke any provision of Parts 260 through 265 and 268 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and under §260.22, which specifically provides generators the opportunity to petition the Administrator to exclude a waste on a ``generator-specific'' basis from the hazardous waste lists. The proposed decision is based on an evaluation of waste-specific information provided by the petitioner. If this proposed decision is finalized, the petitioned waste will be conditionally excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Agency is also proposing the use of a fate and transport model to evaluate the potential impact of the petitioned waste on human health and the environment, based on the waste-specific information provided by the petitioner. This model has been used in evaluating the petition to predict the concentration of hazardous constituents that may be released from the petitioned waste, once it is disposed of. DATES: EPA is requesting public comments on today's proposed decision and on the applicability of the fate and transport model used to evaluate the petition. Comments will be accepted until April 18, 1994. Comments postmarked after the close of the comment period will be stamped ``late''. Any person may request a hearing on this proposed decision by filing a request with the Director, Characterization and Assessment Division, Office of Solid Waste, whose address appears below, by March 21, 1994. The request must contain the information prescribed in §260.20(d). ADDRESSES: Send three copies of your comments to EPA. Two copies should be sent to the Docket Clerk, Office of Solid Waste (5305), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. A third copy should be sent to Jim Kent, Delisting Section, Waste Identification Branch, CAD/OSW (5304), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. Identify your comments at the top with this regulatory docket number: ``F&hyph;94&hyph;B8EP&hyph;FFFFF''.
