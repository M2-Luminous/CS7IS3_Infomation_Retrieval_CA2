Regardless of their various party or other affiliations, the Israeli rulers -- starting with Ben-Gurion and up to Yitzhaq Rabin -- have always talked about peace while launching wars and embarking on invasions, aggressions, and occupation. For many years, and while committing some of the ugliest massacres and expelling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, they were always talking about peace. AL-BA'TH adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged threat, the Israeli rulers expanded in land and usurped all the territory set by the UN resolution of 1947 to the Palestinian state. Their occupation extended to cover territory from three Arab states -- Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. The paper adds: Under the pretext of deterring the alleged threat, the Israeli rulers also attempted to realize their aggressive dream to set up a greater Israel that would control the Middle East. The paper says: Syria has exposed the true Israeli rulers' negative attitudes toward the peace process. Syria proposed complete peace for complete withdrawal. It followed that with President al-Asad's initiative in Geneva on Syria's readiness to respond favorably to all requirements of the complete peace. The paper stresses that Syria wants the just and comprehensive peace that carries within it the elements for its continuity and survival. Such a peace is not based on injustice, occupation, and violation of international legitimacy. Any one who wants such a peace will undoubtedly meet with Syria. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Those who do not want peace can fabricate excuses and allegations every day to escape peace. The Israeli rulers are doing just that. Their problem lies in themselves. They think they can continue to escape the requirements of the peace process and continue both with the occupation and settlements activities.
