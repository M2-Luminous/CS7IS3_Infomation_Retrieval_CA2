"The tax screw cannot be tightened all the time without putting economic growth and stability at risk," the Bundesbank economists say in their 1993 annual report. The reintroduction of the solidarity tax at the beginning of 1995, the increase in mineral oil tax, and the increase in pension insurance contributions "will pave the way for a further considerable increase in the total tax burden." In view of the high public indebtedness, which, at 1,740 billion German marks, reached 56 percent of the GDP at the end of 1993, the Frankfurt central bank pleaded for more severe corrective measures in monetary policy. "An early return to sound public finances that bring back the lost breathing space for private investors and savers and that are convincing in the medium term, could mobilize growth and open up new perspectives." The Bundesbank concedes, however, that this consolidation process will take several years. The economists at the Bundesbank assess Germany's economic recovery somewhat more cautiously than the Federal Government. For eastern Germany, the central bank calls for a change in wage policy, with lower growth rates. The Bundesbank states that "prospects of the German economy have brightened up lately." Yet, there is "no clear upward trend in industrial production for the first few months of 1994" visible in western Germany at the moment. But conditions for a recovery, and thus a final defeat of recession, have clearly improved. At the opening of the Hannover Trade Fair on Tuesday [19 April], Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of an economic spring when he said: "A number of economic figures indicate an upward trend." According to the Bundesbank experts, a permanent stimulation of exports "has become likely." However, this will only happen "if the recovery in the world economy continues and western German industry manages further to strengthen its competitiveness." The latest wage round settlements are rated favorably in this connection. Beside the chemical industry compromise with a 1.5-percent wage increase, the metalworkers agreement is considered a particularly significant settlement. It does not involve any real increase of income for the employees, and thus no additional cost for the employers. According to the Bundesbank, "a change in wage policy is crucial" for improving competitiveness in eastern Germany. In 1994 alone, basic wages in the metalworking industry will increase by 12 percent over 1993. An end of the catching-up process with western German wage standards could contribute a great deal to preserving existing jobs and improving the opportunities for unemployed people. If the wage policy course of adjusting to the western German level continues, the pressure to decrease the gap between wages and productivity by means of further job cuts will increase.
