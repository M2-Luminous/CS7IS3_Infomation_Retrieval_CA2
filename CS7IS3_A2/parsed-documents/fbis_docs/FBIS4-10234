The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of La Hispaniola. Recently 48 U.S. Democratic congressmen sent a letter to Balaguer calling on him to put an end to the embargo violations by stopping the transfer of gasoline and fuel oil across the Haitian border. In an interview with the press, Balaguer admitted "there had been a certain loosening in the surveillance the Armed Forces should maintain to make the blockade effective." He said many Haitians cross the border, thanks to the "lax surveillance," to stock up on gasoline at gas stations in the Dominican Republic, thus increasing the volume of fuel contraband into Haiti. He reaffirmed his opposition to the blockade, however, because of the implications it could have for his country. He said the faltering border surveillance "is because of the exceedingly long time the embargo has been in place and because the naval blockade has not been strictly enforced either." He announced he has told the representatives of the Group of Friends of Haiti (the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela), the Dominican Republic cannot maintain an "indefinite policy in support of the blockade" against Haiti. "This is impossible for humanitarian reasons." He said that the representatives agree it is necessary to resolve the situation and that the Dominican Republic cannot support the blockade for too long. For the time being, he said, the government will continue to take steps to maintain the embargo. The measures will be reinforced with support offered by the Group of Friends of Haiti, as presented by a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, with whom Balaguer met a few days ago. Balaguer expressed his hope the Haitian crisis will soon end. "I believe it will, as things are moving in the right direction. I hope the crisis will conclude sooner for the good of all sectors and for the improvement of trade between Haiti and the Dominican Republic," he concluded.
