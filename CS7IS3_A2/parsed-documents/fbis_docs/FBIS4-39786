They concern citizens of foreign states and CIS countries, as well as those republics of the Russian Federation which have not signed the federal agreement. To enter Yakutia from now on, it is necessary for them to have special invitations approved by the local authorities. In a number of instances, citizens in given categories could be refused permission to enter the republic of Sakha, or be expelled before the expiration of their stay. The grounds for this specifically are actions which go against the interests of state security or public order, established traditions and standards of moral behavior, as well as breaches of customs, currency, and other laws of the Russian Federation and Yakutia.
