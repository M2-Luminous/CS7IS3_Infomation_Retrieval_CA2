FR940413-0-00069 FR940413-0-00025 The Title IV student financial aid programs affected by this notice are the FFEL Program (consisting of the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program); the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; the Federal Pell Grant Program; and the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, and FSEOG programs (known collectively as the campus-based programs). To assist both institutions and individuals, this notice also provides certain regulatory relief to institutions in their administration of these student financial aid programs. The Secretary has already provided certain regulatory relief to lenders and guaranty agencies in the FFEL Program under section 432(a)(6) of the HEA and 34 CFR 682.406(b) and 682.413(f). The guaranty agency directors were informed of this relief in a letter dated January 31, 1994. Covered Individuals This notice is intended to assist institutions and individuals that have been adversely affected by the California earthquake of January 1994. This notice will apply to institutions that were unable to maintain normal operations because they were located in Los Angeles, Orange, or Ventura Counties on the date on which the President declared the existence of a major disaster. This notice of relief also applies only to individuals who suffered financial harm from the disaster and, at the time the disaster occurred, were residing, attending an institution of higher education, or employed in the counties designated as disaster areas (or, in the case of an individual who is a dependent student, whose parent or stepparent suffered financial harm from such disaster and resided or was employed in such an area at that time). This notice of regulatory relief will be applicable for awards made under the Title IV programs and collection activities conducted under the Federal Perkins Loan Program during the 1993&hyph;94 and 1994&hyph;95 award years (the periods from July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994 and July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995). Note: For further updates to the list of designated disaster areas, institutions may contact the Department on its toll-free number at 1&hyph;800&hyph;433&hyph;3243 between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call 1&hyph;800&hyph;730&hyph;8913 between 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. The Secretary provides the following enforcement relief from the regulations governing the student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA: I. 34 CFR Part 668_Student Assistance General Provisions A. 34 CFR 668.19␣Financial Aid Transcript Under current regulations, before a student who previously attended another eligible institution may receive any Title IV, HEA program funds, the institution to which the student is transferring must make an effort to obtain the student's financial aid transcript. The Secretary is waiving the requirement to obtain financial aid transcripts before disbursing funds for individuals who attended institutions covered by this notice for the 1993&hyph;94 and 1994&hyph;95 award years. If the financial aid transcript is not available as a result of damage caused by the California earthquake, the institution may disburse Title IV funds. Any institution affected by this situation must document in the student's file that the financial aid transcript is unavailable due to damage stemming from the natural disaster. In addition, the student will still be expected to provide statements concerning all prior financial aid received, and the institution will be expected to retain this information in the student's file. B. 34 CFR 668.51&hyph;668.61␣Subpart E_Selection of Applicants for Verification The Secretary is waiving verification requirements under 34 CFR 668.51&hyph;668.61 during the 1993&hyph;94 and 1994&hyph;95 award years for those applicants who are selected for verification and whose records were lost or destroyed because of the California earthquake. The institution must document in the student's file that the records are unavailable due to damage stemming from the natural disaster. For these students, Verification Status Code ``S'' may be used when reporting a Federal Pell Grant disbursement. II. 34 CFR Part 690_Federal Pell Grant Program 34 CFR 690.83␣Submission of Reports The Secretary modifies the deadline in 34 CFR 690.83(a)(1)(i) that an institution submit all SAR Payment Vouchers (or the equivalent) for an award year by September 30 following the end of the award year in which the grant is made. The Secretary will extend this reporting date, on a ``case-by-case'' basis, for institutions affected by the California earthquake.
