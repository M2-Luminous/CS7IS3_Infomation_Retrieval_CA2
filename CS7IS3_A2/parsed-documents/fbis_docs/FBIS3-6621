Shinseito representative Ichiro Ozawa and DSP General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa attended the meeting, and the parties agreed that "the coalition parties should endeavour to form a new party, rather than try to rely on electoral cooperation of existing parties, to fight in the general election conducted under the new electoral system." Even though they are said to have not discussed specific steps to form the new party, this development shows that Ozawa's work of forming a new party -- which comes in the wake of the idea of Shinseito and the JNP forming an alliance -- is continuing, and this move is likely to send ripples to the new Sakigake [Harbinger] Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. The meeting, which took place in a restaurant in Tokyo, was called by Shinseito and the JNP to discuss the issue of forming an alliance of all parties in the coalition and Prime Minister Hosokawa's idea on forming a policy study commission. Present at the meeting from the DSP were, in addition to Yonezawa, five lower house members and five upper house members, including floor whip Atsushi Kanda and Hiroshi Nakai, chairman of the party Election Strategy Committee. Among those from the JNP was Dietman Hiroyuki Nagahama. From Shinseito, Ozawa and Dietman Naoto Kitamura were present. An independent Diet member, Toshio Yamaguchi, was also there. According to Yonezawa, the meeting that the SDPJ's position of wanting to fight the next general election, retaining the existing parties but cooperating in the election, "has limitations in fighting the Liberal Democratic Party" and that "the only way to maintain the government is to form a new party and campaign with new platforms." But there were also opinions that "it might be difficult for all ruling parties to merge into one party in one big sweep" and also those saying, "We should be cautious about this matter since this idea of forming a new party or a new unified alliance can create a big stir."
