In its final statement, the KRP Central Committee denounced the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against Iraq, and urged the international community to shoulder its full legal, human, and moral responsibility to lift, immediately and unconditionally, the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. The Central Committee condemned the criminal, terrorist, and destructive plan of the foreigner's agents, led by Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani in Kurdistan, stressing support for the Kurdish masses' perpetual struggle and their heroic daily confrontation of the agents of the foreigners. The KRP also stressed its determination to defend Kurdish national rights against slogan traders and brokers of international politics, who have turned the Kurdish cause into a commodity for bargaining and cheap blackmail in order to achieve their evil intentions. It also pledged to defend the homeland and safeguard the achievements and gains, which the 17-30 July revolution has given to the Kurdish people under the leadership of leader President Saddam Husayn, foremost of which is the Autonomous Region law. The Central Committee emphasized the KRP's solidarity with the Palestinian Arab people to enable them to determine their fate and it denounced the American and the Zionist role in liquidating the Palestine question. It condemned the foreigners' occupation of Somalia, as well as the Egyptian regime's criminal positions against the Egyptian militant popular forces, and stressed the KRP's solidarity with the Yemeni people. It also said in its final statement that the Arab nation has no choice but unity and economic integration to confront all foreign challenges. The KRP then warned the international community in general and the Arab nation in particular of the serious role U.S. imperialism is playing to control the world economy, and appealed to the international community to work to end the imperialist hegemony over the international organization.
