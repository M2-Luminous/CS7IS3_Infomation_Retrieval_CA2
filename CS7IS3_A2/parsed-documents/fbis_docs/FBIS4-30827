Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava. [Nagy] At its session yesterday, the National Council of Coexistence authorized the movement's executive body to begin discussions, with the involvement of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], about setting up a close triple coalition. Although the delegates took tacit cognizance of the fact that discussions are to be pursued with the MKDH, the current coalition partner, they are of the view that the close unity of Slovakia's Hungarian community will in future be rendered possible by their union. However, on account of the criticisms connected with it, they are presuming that it cannot be developed at the moment, and that is why discussions have to be started about the establishment of a triple coalition. According to Coexistence, the two partners -- that is the MKDH and the MOS -- must undertake a commitment to form a joint deputies' group in parliament, to put forward a joint candidate for the local government elections in October, to create a joint local-government and foreign affairs council, and in the future to take a united stand on forums abroad.
