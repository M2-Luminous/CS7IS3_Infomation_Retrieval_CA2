FBIS4-1384 "drafr082_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Official Describes Situation in Country RPF Official Describes Situation in Country AB2604215594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 26 Apr 94 AB2604215594 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] Now to Rwanda, where a cease-fire has been declared by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels, starting from midnight last night. It comes after three weeks of massacres in several parts of the country during which tens of thousands have lost their lives. Rwandan Government forces have also announced a cease-fire starting today. But the United Nations has been unable to get the two sides together to agree on the ground (?rules). RPF Secretary General Theogene Rudasingwa is in Nairobi at the moment. On the line Robin White asked him if the cease-fire was holding: [Begin recording] [Rudasingwa] Our forces began respecting the cease-fire, which we declared on Saturday [23 April], with effect from midnight last night, but the government troops have been shelling our positions until actually early this afternoon. [White] Does that mean you will not keep the cease-fire any longer? [Rudasingwa] We are going to keep the cease-fire but, of course, we do have a legitimate obligation to respond to some of these violations at the time of our own choosing. [White] So, how long will you give government forces to obey before you start fighting again yourselves? [Rudasingwa] First of all, we had expected that the troops would immediately respect the cease-fire because the cease-fire takes two to respect. Secondly, we have given a 96-hour grace period within which the government forces must stop the killings. [White] Now, what is the current military position now, as you said. How much territory do you currently claim to control? [Rudasingwa] Well, we do control, I think, close to half of the territory of Rwanda and the position -- the latest which I have -- is that they had an upper hand shortly before we declared the cease-fire and they are remaining in those positions. [White] How far have you advanced since the fighting started, since the death of President Habyarimana? [Rudasingwa] We have definitely advanced close to Kigali. As you know, we do control some stratetic locations within Kigali. [White] But how many miles have you actually advanced? [Rudasingwa] Well, the distance we are talking about may be close to 40, between 40 and 60 kms occasionally. [White] And do you control any territory at all south of the capital? [Rudasingwa] As of now, no. I am not aware of any position that we do control in the south of the capital. [White] Do you have any plans, if the cease-fire breaks down, to try and take over territories south of the capital? [Rudasingwa] Well, if the cease-fire fails, then we continue with the struggle elsewhere. We shall continue with the objective of contributing to the restoration of law and order. If that means that we should hold some positions anywhere in the territory of Rwanda, then we shall proceed to do that. [White] I am wondering if in the back of your mind you are thinking of the partition of the country, with you controlling the north and forces which are basically Hutu controlling the south? [Rudasingwa] (?Unfortunately no), I am sorry to [words indistinct] because we do have a national agenda. We do have a patriotic obligation to rescue the entire people of Rwanda, to rescue the entire territory of Rwanda, and it would be inappropriate and highly irresponsible on the part of anybody to leave any part of the country or any section of the population to some of the people who have unleashed a lot of terror on the population.
