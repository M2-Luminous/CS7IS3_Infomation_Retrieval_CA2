"Russia had supported this U.N. Security Council resolution, regarding that such a decision is an emergency, but a necessary measure under the present circumstances. We proceeded from the assumption that the unprecedented human tragedy in Rwanda, and the continued massacre of the civilian population in that long- suffering country dictates the need to take swift and adequate measures capable of stopping the further bloodshed in Rwanda. Besides this, we took into consideration the condition that sufficiently long period of time will be required for a full deployment of any additional U.N. force," Karasin said.
