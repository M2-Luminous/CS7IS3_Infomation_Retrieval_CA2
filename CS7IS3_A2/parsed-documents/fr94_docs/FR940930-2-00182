FR940930-2-00182 FR940930-2-00063 2. Included among the MT Funds as of April 1, 1991 was a guaranteed fund (the G Fund) which invested primarily in group annuity and guaranteed investment contracts issued by various insurance companies. As of April 1, 1991, the G Fund had approximately $65.6 million invested in group annuity contracts (the GACs) issued by Executive Life Insurance Company of California (ELIC), representing approximately 7.5 percent of the assets in the G Fund as of that date. On April 11, 1991, the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California (the Commissioner) ordered a conservatorship (the Conservatorship) of ELIC, and halted all payments on ELIC's guaranteed contracts, including the GACs. 4 The Employer represents that it took immediate protective action on behalf of the Plans' participants, by segregating the G Fund assets attributable to the GACs in a new segregated fund (the Segregated Fund), effective April 1, 1991. The account of each Plan participant with an interest in the G Fund as of April 1, 1991 was assigned an interest in the Segregated Fund, in proportion to the GACs' total value as of April 1, 1991. 5 The remaining G Fund assets were placed in a new fund designated as the Income Fund. The Plan was amended, effective April 1, 1991, to prohibit distribution, withdrawal, and transfer of any account balance attributable to the Segregated Fund. 4 The Department notes that the decision to acquire and hold the GACs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GACs. 5 Each participant's interest in the Segregated Fund was determined by multiplying his interest in the G Fund by a fraction, the numerator of which was the value of G Fund assets invested in the GACs as of April 1, 1991, and the denominator of which was the value of total assets in the G Fund as of April 1, 1991. 3. The Employer represents that on September 3, 1993 the assets and restructured liabilities of ELIC were assigned to Aurora Life National Assurance Company (Aurora), pursuant to the Commissioner's court-approved rehabilitation plan (the Rehab Plan). Under the Rehab Plan, each ELIC contract holder was permitted to elect between (1) Opting in to the Rehab Plan, in which case Aurora would assume the ELIC contract, or (2) opting out of the Rehab Plan, in which case a cash settlement would be paid in exchange for the ELIC contract. A determination was made by a delegee of the Committee that the Plans would elect to opt out of the Rehab Plan, and the appropriate opt-out election forms were completed by the Trustee. Subsequently, the Plans received $37.9 million (the Initial Recovery), approximately 58 percent of the Segregated Fund, as part of the Rehab Plan's provisions for ELIC contract holders who opted out of the Rehab Plan. The Employer represents that the Commissioner has estimated that such holders of ELIC contracts can expect to recover a total of about 85 percent of the Conservatorship Date value of the contracts. Accordingly, the Employer states that the Plans can expect to recover from Aurora another $17.8 million on the contracts, approximately 27 percent of the Segregated Fund, over the remaining estimated four years of the Rehab Plan's operation. 4. However, on April 6, 1992, a class action (the 1992 Litigation) was commenced on behalf of affected participants and beneficiaries of the RIGP and PSSP (the Plaintiffs) against the Employer and members of the Committee (collectively, the Defendants), Maureen Rose, et al., v. Joan Ganz Cooney, et al., Civil Action No. 5:92&hyph;CV&hyph;208, Federal District Court, District of Connecticut (the Court). The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants' actions in connection with the Plans' purchase of the GACs violated various provisions of the Act. On July 15, 1994, Plaintiffs and Defendants executed an agreement in settlement of the 1992 Litigation (the Agreement), which provides as follows: (A) Defendants are to make an initial cash payment of $13 million to an interest-bearing escrow account (the Escrow). Amounts in the Escrow, including interest, less attorney's fees and administrative costs approved by the Court, are to be transferred to the Master Trust for the benefit of Plaintiffs no sooner than 10 days after the Court enters a final order approving the Agreement, but only if the transactions contemplated by the Agreement are approved by the Department, in the exemption proposed herein, and by the Internal Revenue Service (the Service). The Employer represents that it is expected that the Escrow payment to the Master Trust on behalf of Plaintiffs, after payment of costs and fees, will be approximately $9 million, or about 15 percent of the Plaintiff's account balances in the Segregated Fund.
