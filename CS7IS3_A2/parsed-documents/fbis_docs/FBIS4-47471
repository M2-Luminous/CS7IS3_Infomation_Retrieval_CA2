Belousov, A.M. Mamin, Yu.K. Niziyenko, and A.R. Sidorov, ``Kurchatov Institute'' branch of Russian Science Center; UDC 535.375] [Abstract] A Nd-glass laser set for thermonuclear fusion consisting was built and tested, a set consisting of a master oscillator and two successive amplifier stages with phase conjugation and pulse compression. The oscillator operates in the single longitudinal mode and single transverse mode. The two amplifiers operate in the four-pass mode. The beam emitted by the oscillator in pulses of 3 mJ energy and 25 ns duration passes through a x10 magnifying telescope, a 12x12 mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture stop, and then two Faraday isolators before entering the first amplifier stage. The active medium here is a cylinder of neodymium glass 20 mm in diameter and 300 mm long. This preamplifier stage includes a cell filled with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, where an SBMS (Stimulated Brillouin-Mandelshtam Scattering) mirror for phase conjugation is formed by a focusing lens with a 50 cm focal length. After four passes in this stage and with the energy of radiation thus having been boosted to 3-4 J, the beam proceeds through a x3.3 magnifying telescope, a Faraday isolator with a 60x60 mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture, and then a x2.5 magnifying telescope before entering with a 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] aperture the second amplifier stage. The active medium here is an array of six slabs of neodymium glass 340 mm long with a 20x120 mm[.sup]2[/] large cross-section each. They are optically pumped by seven rows of four IFP-5000 flash lamps between each two slabs, distilled water thermally insulating the slabs from these lamps. Each slab is followed sends radiation to a cell filled with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, an SBMS mirror for phase conjugation in the pulse compression mode being formed in each by a 17 mm[.sup]2[/] large square lens with a 5 m focal length. Upon entering this second amplifier stage, the beam is thus split into six separate partial beams with a 17x100 mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture each. It then leaves this stage with an about 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] large compound aperture, the duration of radiation pulses having in this stage been shortened 20 ns to 2 ns duration. The energy reflectivity of the mirrors here is estimated at 50 %. Two tests were performed: 1) with direct passage of the beam passage through the second stage, 2) with reflection of the beam first by only one lateral face of each slab and then by their both faces. Direct passage was found to cause breakdown of the active medium near the lateral faces of the slabs, but radiation pulses of 20-25 J energy were nevertheless coming from each slab. Reflection by one lateral face resulted in a more uniform distribution of radiation intensity over the beam cross- section and reflection by both lateral faces resulted its most nearly uniform distribution. In the latter case the divergence of the total radiation beam was smaller than 0.1 mrad, while the energy of radiation pulses from each slab still reached the 25 J level. Such a laser set can be modified for simultaneous radiation emission at two different frequencies. This can be achieved by splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half- beam to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas and one containing a solid substance. Then while the beam is being focused, a traveling interference pattern will form in the focal plane owing to different radiation wavelengths in the two half-apertures. Figures 3; references 3.
