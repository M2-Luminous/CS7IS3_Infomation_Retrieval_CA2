ACTION: Technical amendment to final rule. SUMMARY: HUD is adopting a technical amendment to its final rule containing procedures to implement Executive Order 11988 on floodplain management. The final rule requires that documents used in the conveyance of HUD-acquired properties in a floodplain must refer to uses restricted under Federal, state or local floodplain regulations and include any land use restrictions under state or local laws. The final rule also requires purchasers of HUD-acquired properties containing Critical Actions to notify tenants regarding floodplain hazards and flood insurance. The technical amendment restricts these requirements to the disposition of multifamily properties. HUD is also correcting an error in a cross-citation within the final rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard H. Broun, Director, Office of Environment and Energy, Room 7240, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: HUD published 24 CFR part 55 as a final rule on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19100), with an effective date of May 23, 1994. Part 55 contains procedures implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management (42 FR 26951, May 25, 1977). Section 55.22(a) of the final rule requires that in the disposition (including leasing) of properties acquired by HUD that are located in a 100-year floodplain (a 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action), the documents used for the conveyance must: (1) Refer to those uses that are restricted under identified federal, state, or local floodplain regulations; and (2) include any land use restrictions limiting the use of the property by a grantee or purchaser and any successors under state or local laws. Section 55.22(b) requires that for disposition of properties acquired by HUD that are located in a 500-year floodplain and contain Critical Actions, HUD shall, as a condition of approval of the disposition, require by covenant or comparable restriction on the property's use that the property owner and successive owners provide written notification to each current and prospective tenant, and post an easily visible notice, concerning: (1) The hazards to life and property for persons who reside or work in a structure in the 500-year floodplain, and (2) the availability of flood insurance on the contents of their dwelling unit or business. The requirements in §55.22(a) were intended to implement Section 3(d) of Executive Order 11988, which applies to agencies with responsibilities for Federal real property and facilities. However, HUD annually disposes of approximately 65,000 to 70,000 one- to four-family properties acquired as the result of foreclosure or similar means, generally in connection with a homeowner's default under a mortgage that has been insured by HUD under the National Housing Act. HUD has determined that application of the requirements in §55.22(a) to the disposition of these one- to four-family properties would be impractical and unnecessary. Application of the requirement to these properties is impractical because it would necessitate the research of Federal, state and local restrictions on thousands of properties to be disposed of within the floodplain each year. These restrictions may be located within building codes, zoning ordinances or other bodies of law, thus requiring a broad search of various laws and ordinances. The research needed to locate these provisions for each one- to four-family property would impose an unreasonable burden on HUD resources. In addition, the requirement is unnecessary, because the Federal, State and local laws and regulations are applicable and enforceable regardless of whether they are specifically mentioned in conveyance documents. The vast majority of such acquired properties will already contain an existing residential structure, so that any legal restrictions will generally apply only to additions to the structure or a change in use; in any case, the owner will generally need to obtain a building permit or other local government approval for any improvements or additions to the property. Accordingly, HUD has determined to amend §55.22(a) to apply these requirements only to the disposition of multifamily properties. The requirements contained in §55.22(b) with regard to notification of tenants in properties containing Critical Actions (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities that are likely to contain occupants with mobility difficulties) are not expected to be applied to one- to four-family properties, since it is unlikely that one- to four-family properties will contain critical actions. However, to avoid confusion on this issue, HUD is amending §55.22(b) to clarify that the requirements of that paragraph apply only to the disposition of multifamily properties that contain Critical Actions. Finally, HUD is correcting an inadvertent error in a cross-citation within part 55. Section 55.12(b)(2) refers to the definition of ``substantial improvement''. The citation to that definition is corrected to refer to §55.2(b)(8) rather than §55.12(b)(9). Other Matters The findings and statements made in the preamble to the final rule with respect to Executive Orders 12606, 12612 and 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act are not affected by this technical amendment. The Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment that has been made with respect to this rule is also unaffected.
