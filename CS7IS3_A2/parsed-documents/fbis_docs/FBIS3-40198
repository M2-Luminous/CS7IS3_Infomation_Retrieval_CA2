There must be a well-developed financial market in a flourishing market economy. The 14th National CPC Congress explicitly pointed out that the goal of the economic system reform is to establish a socialist market economic system. Therefore, to establish a financial market that satisfies the needs of the socialist market economy is something basic and important in reforming China's financial system. The financial market is divided into the money market (short-term financial market), capital market (long-term financial market), stock market, foreign exchange market and gold market. China resumed the issuance of treasury bonds in 1984, and Shanghai issued the first batch of stocks in 1984. The financial market began to develop since 1986, but it is still in the preliminary stage and there are plenty of rooms for further development. China's future financial market should be a unified and open market with orderly competition and strict management. It has the general features of today's world financial market as well as China's special characteristics. It is well adapted to the current situation in economic and social development in China. In this unified and open financial market, funds which are regarded as a commodity in business transactions are able to circulate freely throughout the country so that limited social resources are allocated in various localities. If the financial market is cut into pieces, it will be difficult to circulate funds and put them to effective use. This will be a tremendous loss to China where funds are badly needed. In the past, China's financial market is not unified and open due to various reasons, and people in the financial circles were often restricted to carry out their activities in a designated area. In dealing with this situation, we must further carry out reform to develop a unified, open market. If it is said that a unified, open financial market is the basic prerequisite for the effective circulation of funds, building an orderly and competitive market is the basic way for the effective circulation of funds. Competition instills vitality into the financial market. If there is no competition, or competition is not allowed, it will be difficult to make the financial market prosperous and avoid market monopoly by a few financial institutions. Meanwhile, this kind of competition must be orderly and it should be carried out in accordance with certain rules and regulations. The "illegal day-to-day loans" and certain types of chaotic phenomena noticed on the stock market not long ago were precisely signs of disorderly competition. This kind of disorderly, malignant, and abnormal competition will disturb the market and harm the legitimate interests of the people and enterprises in the society. It would even endanger the regular operation of social economy. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a good legal system for China's financial market and exercise strict supervision and control over the market. We must adopt resolute measures and firmly curb these illegal activities. We must also use our policy to guide those who participate in various activities on the market to ensure that market competition remains unified, open and orderly. There is no doubt that a flourishing financial market plays an important role in helping develop a modern economy and the enterprises. However, the growth of China's financial market is far from being strong in despite of the fact that for the past 14 years since the beginning of the reform program, such market in China has started from scratch and begun to take shape. Due to the fact that it was born at the time when the new system was replacing the old, it still remains in the preliminary stage, and many sectors of the market are still not operating smoothly. Therefore, to quicken the pace in building the financial market and strengthen market management has become an important theme in reforming the financial system. To achieve this goal, it is, first of all, necessary to improve the money market. As a short-term financial market, the money market plays a significant role in helping the central bank exercise its macroeconomic control and the monetary institutions utilize the time of turn-around of the funds, in financing lateral financial institutions and making the best use of available funds. 1) It is necessary to strengthen the control of the money market, and set standards for the major participants of the market and their behavior. 2) It is essential to cut the direct link between the money market and the capital market, and stop funds from flowing from the money market to the capital market. Otherwise, there will be boundless increases of investments in fixed assets, causing economic overheating and serious inflation. 3) On the basis of different requirements in regulating money supply and adjusting supply and demand, it is imperative to set standards for the overnight loan market and the short-term financing market. 4) It is necessary to gradually develop an open business operation of the central bank and turn the money market into a tool of the central bank for implementing the monetary policy and into the main arena for regulating the basic currency and the money supply. Second, the stock market is the principal form of the capital market. Many problems have cropped in China's stock market during the three years since the opening of the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Thus, we must vigorously develop this market and make further improvements. Efforts must be made to further improve the market for treasury and financial bonds. From the point of view of credit and money, all activities concerning credit invariably affect the money supply. Therefore, we must make use of the large number of geographically widespread financial institutions to help selling government bonds. This is not only conducive to the issuance and circulation of government bonds. It also helps enhance credit worthiness of the government bonds and create conditions for the central bank to regulate the money supply. In addition, the stock market should also be further standardized. We must do a good job in transforming the enterprise share-holding system, set up a standard procedure for issuing and listing stock on the market, and strengthen control over stock exchanges and the stock exchange system. Currently, the market for corporate stocks and that for personal stocks are separated, while the market for Type-A stocks and that for Type-B stocks are not in line with each other. We must energetically create conditions and gradually form a unified and standard stock market. Third, we must further develop and form a standard foreign exchange market. Measures have been taken to reform the system for the control of China's foreign exchange. After the implementation of the method of allowing units to retain a part of foreign exchange they have earned for their own use, a number of foreign exchange swap markets have taken shape. Nevertheless, there is still a part of foreign exchange which goes to units that use the foreign exchange through administrative channels instead of the swap market. Meanwhile, a dual-track or multi-track system is being implemented in determining the foreign exchange rate. Therefore, it is necessary to set a single foreign exchange rate; develop a mechanism to form a unified exchange rate and turn monetary institutions into the mainstay for the foreign exchange market; and finally, form a completely unified foreign exchange market to run the financial market in an orderly manner.
