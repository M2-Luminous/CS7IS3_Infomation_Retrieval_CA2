The 18-percent tax replaced the equal size general excise tax, however apart from being applied to local products, the new tax was also imposed on imports. As soon as the new tax came into effect, the usual routine was disrupted at Lithuanian customs offices. Not knowing how to apply the new value-added tax law, customs officers simply stopped all cargoes on the border. Vitalijus Girzonas, head of the Lithuanian Customs Department, said lines of trucks have become even longer at the Lazdijai crossing on the Lithuanian-Polish border because a number of companies failed to bring goods into the country before 1 May. Ignorance of the value-added tax law created additional problems for tax inspectors, who are unable to answer all questions asked about the new tax. Experts of the European Union's PHARE [Poland-Hungary Action for Restructuring Economy] program came to Lithuania around a month ago to help prepare for the introduction of the new tax. PHARE experts provided a considerable amount of information about the tax to the public, but the desired result was not achieved. Forecasts of the expected price-leap are quite controversial and range from 3 to 20 percent. Drivers were first to experience the new tax when gasoline prices jumped by as much as 25 percent in some gas stations. The reaction of store owners varied. Prices did not change at a majority of stores in Vilnius, although salespeople said imported goods may become more expensive very soon. But nearly all stores changed prices and were closed Monday in the second biggest town of Kaunas. Virtually all store owners agree that sales will drop. Lithuanian industrialists said the value-added tax will scare away foreign investments, although the authors of the value-added tax law contend that the tax will stimulate the investment process.
