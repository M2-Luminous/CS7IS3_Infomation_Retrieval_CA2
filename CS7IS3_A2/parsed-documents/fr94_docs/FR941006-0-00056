FR941006-0-00056 FR941006-0-00012 Appendix B to Part 806_Requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (Send With Letter to Submitters) (a) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires Federal agencies to provide their records, except those specifically exempted, for the public to inspect and copy. (b) Section (b) of the Act lists nine exemptions that are the only basis for withholding records from the public. (c) In this case, the fourth exemption, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), may apply to records or information the Air Force maintains. Under this exemption, agencies may withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information they obtained from a person or organization outside the government which is privileged or confidential. (d) This generally includes information provided and received with the understanding that it will be kept privileged or confidential. (e) Commercial or financial matter is ``confidential'' and exempt if its release will probably: (1) Impair the Government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future. (2) Substantially harm the source's competitive position or impair some other legitimate Government interest. (f) The exemption may be used to help the source when public disclosure will probably cause substantial harm to its competitive position. Examples of information that may qualify for this exemption include: (1) Commercial or financial information received in confidence with loans, bids, contracts, or proposals, as well as other information received in confidence or privileged, such as trade secrets, inventions, discoveries, or other proprietary data. (2) Statistical data and commercial or financial information concerning contract performance, income, profits, losses, and expenditures, offered and received in confidence from a contractor or potential contractor. (3) Personal statements given during inspections, investigations, or audits, received and kept in confidence because they reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information, normally considered confidential or privileged. (4) Financial data that private employers give in confidence for local wage surveys used to set and adjust pay schedules for the prevailing wage rate of DoD employees. (5) Information about scientific and manufacturing processes or developments that is technical or scientific or other information submitted with a research grant application, or with a report while research is in progress. (6) Technical or scientific data a contractor or subcontractor develops entirely at private expense, and technical or scientific data developed partly with Federal funds and partly with private funds, in which the contractor or subcontractor retains legitimate proprietary interests per 10 U.S.C. 2320&hyph;2321 and 48 CFR 227.4. (7) Computer software copyrighted under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. 106), the disclosure of which would adversely impact its potential market value. (g) If release of the subject material would prejudice your commercial interests, give detailed written reasons that identify the specific information and the competitive harm it will cause to you, your organization, or your business. The Act requires we provide any reasonably segregable part of a record after deleting exempt parts. So, tell us if deleting key words or phrases would adequately protect your interests. (h) If you do not prove the probability of substantial harm to your competitive position or other commercial interests, we may be required to release the information. Records qualify for protections case by case. Patsy J. Conner, Air Force Federal Register Liaison Officer.
