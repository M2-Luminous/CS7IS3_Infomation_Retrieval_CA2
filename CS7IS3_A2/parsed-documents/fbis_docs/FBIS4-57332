The Commerce and Industries Ministry is one of the engines of economic development. I think the task is difficult, but I feel capable of accomplishing it.

With the support of the industrial and commercial sectors, we can do a good job. The doors to my office will be open to anyone who approaches, especially investors, so this country can progress the way we want it to.

[Begin Moreno recording] Mr. Gabriel Lewis Galindo has been confirmed [as foreign minister] by the president of the Republic, as has the minister of commerce and industries.
