The unions pointed out that although the government has agreed to the principle of paying overdue step increases, it has not earmarked funds for the increase in salary indexes. The government is insisting that all salary changes should not exceed the allocated 9 billion CFA francs. The unions recall that the amount can only cover a 10 percent increase on the basis of the 1990 salary index. The unions, therefore, conclude that the government's decision to accept the principle of paying overdue step increases is only aimed at curtailing the workers' past gains. Due to the above reasons, the unions maintain the strike call and urge all workers to give their maximum support to the strike in order that, quote, government maneuvers fail, unquote. Furthermore, the unions have decided to refer the matter to the appropriate legal institutions in the country as well as international organizations for what they term government's machinations, which infringe on labor rights. Following the resumption of negotiations with the government, the National Federation of Workers' Union of Benin [UNSTB], also a signatory to the strike motion, has just backed out of the action. It held an extraordinary session on 19 March during which its steering committee reviewed workers' social conditions, especially those of its activists. Given that the government has accepted the principle of paying overdue step increases, increasing the salary index, and increasing family allowances to the tune of 9,225,328,610 CFA francs, the UNSTB thinks there is a need to continue negotiations with the government. It has, therefore, decided to suspend its participation in the strike and urges all its activists to report for duty as of 0800 this morning. The government has reacted to the strike threat. It has reaffirmed that in its 16 March cabinet meeting report, it expressed readiness to negotiate by agreeing to meet two of the unions' demands. The government communique clearly stressed that the cabinet has already confirmed the government position and informed the unions. It said the government will also proceed with the necessary actions for the payment of the 28-percent salary increase in conjunction with union representatives chosen by the unions. It further stated that work on this has been under way since 18 March to enable the government to take up the matter quickly at the National Assembly for an enabling draft bill. Thus, payment of workers' financial benefits, pending the adoption of the 1994 budget, as well as their salary readjustments and promotions will be effective as of the end of April. [passage omitted] In view of the government's decision, the two reasons given for the five-day strike announced on 15 March are no longer valid. Moreover, since no strike motion or any other workers' demands have been brought before the government, the civil service minister urges all workers in all sectors to report for duty without fail as of 0800 this morning.
