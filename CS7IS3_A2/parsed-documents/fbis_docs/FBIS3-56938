"The Russian foreign minister has given a detailed enough characteristic of the inadequate reaction of official representatives of foreign states, including the United States and the Baltics to his speech on January 18. It is hard to add anything to it, however, a logical question appears: How such hasty statements can be made even before their authors get acquainted with the full text of the minister's speech, how does this get into the framework of normal and generally-accepted norms of political communication", he told TASS on Thursday. "Reporters of ITAR-TASS and other news agencies have wired only separate quotes taken out of the context and it is not their fault that such a sharp response followed. All these moments were rather fully characterised by the foreign minister on January 19. He expressed concern that someone has not got rid yet of the image of an enemy in the face of Russia or tries to restore it. In any case this unfortunate incident should be a good lesson", Karasin said. Before Kozyrev's speech on Wednesday Karasin told INTERFAX news agency that TASS had misconstrued Kozyrev's comments.
