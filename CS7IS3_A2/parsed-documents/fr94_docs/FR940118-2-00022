SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance is established under section 491 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended by Public Law 100&hyph;50 (20 U.S.C. 1098). The Advisory Committee is established to provide advice and counsel to the Congress and the Secretary of Education on student financial aid matters, including providing technical expertise with regard to systems of need analysis and application forms, making recommendations that will result in the maintenance of access to postsecondary education for low- and middle-income students, conducting a study of institutional lending in the Stafford Student Loan Program, and assisting with activities related to reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. As a result of the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, the Congress has directed the Advisory Committee to assist with a series of special assessments and conduct an in-depth study of student loan simplification. Also, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directed the Advisory Committee to conduct an evaluation of the Direct Lending and FFEL programs and submit a report to Congress and the Secretary of Education on an annual basis. The proposed agenda includes: (a) A discussion on evaluating the Direct Lending and FFEL programs; (b) an update on the delivery system; (c) an update on other ED initiatives; and (d) an Advisory Committee regulatory update and planning session for the upcoming year's agenda. The Advisory Committee will meet in Washington, DC on January 31, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on February 1, from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon. The meeting will be closed to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. to elect a new chairman and discuss other personnel matters. The ensuing discussions will relate to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency and will disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if conducted in open session. Such matters are protected by exemptions (2) and (6) of Section 552(b)(c) of title 5 U.S.C. A summary of the activities at the closed session and related matters which are informative to the public consistent with the policy of title 5 U.S.C. 552(b) will be available to the public within fourteen days of the meeting.
