"During the convention it will be proved that the virus has no dormant period," said epidemiologist Dr. A. Khatzakis yesterday. Dermatologist Ioannis Stratigos said doctors had thought the disease had an incubation period because "HIV positive people maintain relatively good health for six to 10 years." But while the medical community has been struggling to understand the virus, residents of a Piraievs suburb are showing less compassion over a hostel for the HIV-positive. "We fear for our children's health," said one hostel neighbour, while another said the AIDS victims should be moved out of the city. "We just want to live with dignity and find a job," said AIDS-affected Andonis. But not all neighbours are negative. "These kids are my friends," said Nikolaos Roumeliotis who lives right next door.
