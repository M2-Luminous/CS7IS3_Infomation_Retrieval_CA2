The result of previous contacts turned into a $50-million credit granted to Cuba by the Bank of Curacao. This amount is earmarked mainly for the Cuban nickel and sugar industries, Willem C. Van't Wout [name as received], chief of the Netherlands delegation, told PRENSA LATINA. He also reported that he has signed a letter of intent between the Cuban tourist institutions and the Netherlands hotel group the Golden Tulip. The group has committed to building five hotels with a $75-million investment. Van't Wout and Ariel Maso, chief of the Cuban delegation, signed a protocol of the meeting's minutes that will be followed up next year in the Netherlands. Both executives expressed their satisfaction with the seriousness and cordiality that characterized the negotiations. Maso, director of the Cubaniquel [Cuban nickel] Company, labeled the Netherlands kingdom as one of Cuba's most important access doors to the EU. William C. Van't Wout, who has been negotiating with Cuba for 26 years, said that three-quarters of the Netherlands mission on this occasion was made up of businessmen who were visiting the island for the first time. The executive announced that specific results of the first session are still abstract although they allow for future businesses, particularly in the construction and dredging of ports. Among this missions' participants were representatives of several large banks, as well as trade companies interested in investing in production for the local market. Van't Wout was questioned on his role in the presence of Netherlands buses on Havana streets, to which he replied that the operation was the result, in part, of a donation by Rotterdam municipality, while other buses were sold at low prices. The Netherlands mission met during their stay with Isabel Allende, deputy foreign minister; Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation; Orlando Hernandez, vice minister of foreign trade; Abraham Maciques, president of the Cubanacan Corporation; and Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, Chamber of Commerce president.
