FR941107-1-00020 FR941107-1-00007 More than 20 years ago, the Commission began requiring disclosure of legal proceedings involving directors in registration statements and annual reports filed under the Exchange Act. 36 In 1970, Exchange Act registration statements 37 and annual reports 38 were amended to require disclosure of the initiation of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, court appointments of receivers, criminal convictions and pending criminal actions if these actions involved a director of the registrant and were material to an evaluation of the director's ability and integrity. Disclosure also was required if a court restricted activities involving the purchase or sale of securities or certain activities in the securities, commodities, banking and insurance industries. 39 In the administrative context, disclosure of similar restrictions was required if a suspension or bar exceeded 60 days. Disclosure was required if the action was taken within the past 10 years. 36 In March 1969, the Commission's Disclosure Policy Study recommended increased disclosure of legal proceedings involving management in Securities Act registration statements and Exchange Act registration statements, proxy statements and annual reports. Disclosure to Investors: A Reappraisal of Administrative Policies under the '33 Act and '34 Act , Report and recommendations to the Securities and Exchange Commission from the Disclosure Policy Study, March 1969, pp. 93&hyph;95. 37 Form 10, 17 CFR 249.210, Release No. 34&hyph;8996 (October 14, 1970) [35 FR 16537]. 38 Form 10&hyph;K, 17 CFR 249.310, Release No. 34&hyph;9000 (October 21, 1970) [35 FR 16919]. 39 Specifically, disclosure was required if the director had been restricted from acting as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker or dealer in securities, or as an affiliated person, director or employee of any investment company, bank, savings and loan association or insurance company. Disclosure also was required if the court imposed any other restriction on activities associated with the position. In 1973, the legal proceedings disclosure provisions were expanded to include executive officers. 40 Comparable requirements were added at that time to the general form for registration under the Securities Act 41 and the registration form used for certain development stage companies. 42 40 Release No. 33&hyph;5395 (June 1, 1973) [38 FR 17202]. 41 Form S&hyph;1 [17 CFR 239.11]. At the same time, prospectuses relating to interests in oil and gas programs also were required to include disclosure of legal proceedings involving management and operating companies, because the Industry Guide applicable to such programs contained a provision requiring disclosure of the background information called for by Form S&hyph;1 with respect to those persons. See Release No. 33&hyph;5036 (January 19, 1970) [35 FR 1233], adopting Guide 55, subsequently redesignated Guide 4 [17 CFR 229.801(d)]. In 1976, through the operation of a newly adopted Securities Act Industry Guide for registration statements relating to interests in real estate limited partnerships, comparable disclosure was required in such registration statements respecting individuals responsible for a partnership's investment decisions. See Release No. 33&hyph;5692 (March 17, 1976) [41 FR 17403], adopting Guide 60, subsequently redesignated Guide 5 [17 CFR 229.801(e)]. 42 In 1973, the then Form S&hyph;2 was used for development stage companies (other than insurance, investment or mining companies) that had not had any substantial gross returns from the sale of products or services, or any substantial net income from any source, for any fiscal year ended during the past five years, had not succeeded to any business that had such returns or net income, and did not have any subsidiaries (other than inactive subsidiaries with no more than nominal assets). In July 1978, the legal proceedings disclosure requirements for Securities Act registration statements, as well as those in the Exchange Act registration statement and annual report, were consolidated into Regulation S&hyph;K, and the individual provisions were replaced with references to the Regulation S&hyph;K Item. 43 The disclosure requirements also were extended to real estate company registration statements and proxy and information statements. 44 The disclosure requirements were expanded at that time to include information relating to persons nominated to become directors and to require disclosure of court orders imposing restrictions on any business practice, as well as injunctions prohibiting future violations of federal or state securities laws. 45 Disclosure of findings of securities law violations by a court or by the Commission also was added. Finally, the time period for the disclosure was reduced from 10 to five years from the time the action was taken. 46 43 Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401 [17 CFR 229.401]; Release No. 33&hyph;5949 (July 28, 1978) [43 FR 34402]. The disclosure requirements originally were included in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 3 (Directors and executive officers), subsequently redesignated Item 401. Release No. 33&hyph;6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. 44 Provisions requiring the disclosure called for by Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401 were added to Form S&hyph;11 (for registration of securities of real estate companies) [17 CFR 239.18] and the proxy statement requirements in Schedule 14A. This new provision did not replace the requirement to disclose criminal proceedings involving participants in an election contest, discussed above in n.33, but rather, was included as an additional requirement. The amended proxy statement requirements also applied to information statements prepared in accordance with Schedule 14C [17 CFR 240.14c&hyph;101] of the Exchange Act, which incorporates many of the proxy statement requirements, and to proxy statements under Rule 20a&hyph;1 of the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.20a&hyph;1], which makes the Schedule 14A disclosure requirements applicable to investment companies. 45 Section 3(a)(47) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47)] defines ``federal securities laws'' to mean the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [15 U.S.C. 79a et seq .], the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 [15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq .], the Investment Company Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Investment Advisers Act'') [15 U.S.C. 80b&hyph;1 et seq .], and the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 [15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq .]. 46 Subsequent to these changes, the Commission incorporated the Item 401(f) requirements into other disclosure documents. In April 1980, the Commission amended Form S&hyph;8 (17 CFR 239.16b), for securities issued pursuant to employee benefit plans, to require the incorporation by reference of the issuer's latest Exchange Act annual report, including its legal proceedings disclosure, into the registration statement. Release No. 33&hyph;6202 (April 2, 1980) [45 FR 23653]. In March 1982, Securities Act Industry Guides 4 and 5 were amended to require the information specified in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401, replacing the reference to the requirements of Form S&hyph;1. Release No. 33&hyph;6384 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11476]. See n.41, above, and current Item 11 of Guide 4 and Item 9.A. of Guide 5. At that time, the Commission also adopted current Form S&hyph;2 [17 CFR 239.12], for registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain issuers, and Form S&hyph;3 [17 CFR 239.13], for registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain issuers offered pursuant to certain types of transactions. Release No. 33&hyph;6383 (March 3, 1982) [47 FR 11380]. These forms incorporate by reference information required in the Form 10&hyph;K, including the legal proceedings disclosure. In the same year, the Commission adopted Form S&hyph;18 [17 CFR 239.28] (optional registration form for small issuers) Release No. 33&hyph;6406 (June 4, 1982) [47 FR 25126] and Form S&hyph;20 [17 CFR 239.20] (optional registration form for standardized options), Release No. 33&hyph;6426 (September 16, 1982) [47 FR 41950]. Both forms required disclosure of the legal proceedings specified in Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401. Form S&hyph;18 was rescinded in connection with the small business initiatives in 1992. Release No. 33&hyph;6949 (July 30, 1992) [57 FR 36442]. For information relating to the adoption of Form S&hyph;4 [17 CFR 239.25], see n.49, below.
