FBIS4-16148 "drsov072_e_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Foreign Ministry Denies Understanding Reached Foreign Ministry Denies Understanding Reached LD1304203594 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in Ukrainian 1900 GMT 13 Apr 94 LD1304203594 Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service Ukrainian BFN [Text] This is a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. On 13 April Ostankino TV carried information to the effect that an agreement on solving the Black Sea Fleet issues on the basis of the Massandra protocol was allegedly reached during the negotiations in Kiev. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that this does not comply with reality. Ukraine proceeds from the necessity of a comprehensive approach toward the Black Sea Fleet issue, with regard to the provisions of the Dagomys, Yalta, and Zavidovo agreements, as well as the Massandra protocol. Besides, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine points out that the Ostankino report about the visit by the representatives of the Russian Government to Odessa also fails to correspond to reality. Contrary to the agreements reached in Kiev, Russian Navy Commander in Chief Feliks Gromov undermined the meeting with the command and the officers' personnel of the Black Sea Fleet to be held jointly with the Ukrainian side. Such reports and actions, underlines the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, show who is really standing in the way of a just solution to the Black Sea Fleet issue.
