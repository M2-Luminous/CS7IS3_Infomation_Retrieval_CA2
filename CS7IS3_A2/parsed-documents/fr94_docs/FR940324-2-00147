FR940324-2-00147 FR940324-2-00084 Research and Special Programs Administration [Notice No. 94&hyph;3] Corrections Advisory: 1993 DOT Emergency Response Guidebook AGENCY: Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. ACTION: Corrections advisory notice. SUMMARY: This is to notify distributors, suppliers, and users of corrections to the 1993 DOT Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG). Corrections identified in this notice should be made to each ERG in a permanent fashion. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy J. Burton, Office of Hazardous Materials Initiatives and Training, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, telephone (202) 366&hyph;4900. Office hours are 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The DOT Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) is prepared and distributed, without charge, to fire, police, and other public emergency response entities throughout the United States. Recently, after more than one million copies of the 1993 edition of the ERG were distributed, several errors and omissions were discovered. While none were considered sufficient to cause concern in regard to a potential for misdirected emergency response actions, RSPA believes it appropriate to publish this advisory notice to alleviate concerns that have been raised. The corrections in this notice apply to ERG's printed as of January 29, 1994. Subsequent printings of the ERG have been corrected. The corrections affect the ERG's ID Number Index, Name of Material Index, and Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances. Corrections to the ID Number Index (The Yellow-border Pages of the Guidebook) are as follows: 1. For the entry ``1058 12 LIQUEFIED NONFLAMMABLE GAS charged with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or air'', revise ``dioxide'' to read ``dioxide.'' 2. For the entry ``1202 27 GASOLINE'', revise ``1202'' to read ``1203.'' 3. Add the entry ``2031 44 NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with more than 70% nitric acid'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order. 4. Add the entry ``2031 44 NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with not more than 70% nitric acid'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order. 5. For the entry ``2742 57 ISOBUTYL CHLOROFOMATE'', revise ``CHLOROFOMATE'' to read ``CHLOROFORMATE.'' 6. Add the entry ``3077 31 HAZARDOUS WASTE, solid, n.o.s.'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order. 7. Add the entry ``3082 31 HAZARDOUS WASTE, liquid, n.o.s.'' in the appropriate alpha-numeric order. Corrections to the Name of Material Index (The Blue-border Pages of the Guidebook) are as follows: 1. For the entry ``GASOLINE 27 1202'', revise ``1202'' to read ``1203.'' 2. Add the entry ``HAZARDOUS WASTE, liquid, n.o.s. 31 3082'' in the appropriate alphabetical order. 3. Add the entry ``HAZARDOUS WASTE, solid, n.o.s. 31 3077'' in the appropriate alphabetical order. 4. For the entry ``ISOBUTYL CHLOROFOMATE 57 2742'', revise ``CHLOROFOMATE'' to read ``CHLOROFORMATE.'' 5. Add the entry ``NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with more than 70% nitric acid 44 2031'' in the appropriate alphabetical order. 6. Add the entry ``NITRIC ACID, other than red fuming with not more than 70% nitric acid 44 2031'' in the appropriate alphabetical order. 7. For the entry ``TETRAETHYL DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE and gases, mixtures, or in solution (LC50 more than 200 ppm but not more than 5000 ppm) 15 1703'', revise ``DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE'' to read ``DITHIOPYROPHOSPHATE.'' Corrections to the Table of Initial Isolation and Protective Action Distances (The Green-border Pages of the Guidebook) are as follows: 1. For the entry ``1703 TETRAETHYL DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE and gases, mixtures, or in solution (LC50 more than 200 ppm but not more than 5000 ppm)'', revise ``DITHIOPRYOPHOSPHATE'' to read ``DITHIOPYROPHOSPHATE''. 2. For the entry ``2407 SOPROPYL CHLOROFORMATE'', revise ``SOPROPYL'' to read ``ISOPROPYL''. 3. For the entry ``2742 ISOBUTYL CHLOROFOMATE'', revise ``CHLOROFOMATE'' to read ``CHLOROFORMATE''.
