The session was chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic. As the conditions have not been fulfilled for this year's federal budget to be adopted by the Federal Assembly by the end of the year, and in order not to threaten the most vital functions of the federal state, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government passed an act on a temporary budget for the first quarter of the year. This will make it possible to secure resources to finance the work of the Army of Yugoslavia and the fedaral administration bodies, pay war veteran's pensions and social security, provide social security for refugees and for the population on the territories under the control of the UN peacekeeping forces, the statement says.
