FR941012-0-00113 FR941012-0-00011 Second, OSHA believes that there is a potential for injury when operators attempt to drop-start chain saws. There is a potential for the operator to lose his grip when starting the saw. In addition, especially when the saw is not properly adjusted, the engine can flood. This can cause the saw to fly upward and hit the operator. When the chain saw starts there is potential for sudden movement of the chain because of the increase in rpm. Third, while OSHA believes that starting the chain saw on the ground will provide the best control and support, OSHA is aware that there may be some circumstances in which a chain saw cannot be started in this manner. Nonetheless, even in those circumstances, OSHA believes that it is necessary for operator safety that the saw be firmly supported. Fourth, even when the chain brake is on, the saw needs to be firmly supported when it is started. When the chain saw is started, the chain will move until the engine returns to idle. If the chain saw is not firmly supported when the operator starts the engine, he could lose control of the saw and the moving chain could strike and injure him. At paragraph (e)(2)(vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that chain brakes be engaged when the saw is started. Although this requirement was not contained in the proposed rule, OSHA believes it is necessary for chain brakes to be engaged when the engine is started. As discussed above, when chain saws are started, the chain will run momentarily. When a chain brake is present, it will hold the chain when the engine returns to idle. However, when the chain brake is not engaged, the chain may continue to run at idle, further exposing the operator to the hazard. OSHA believes that the many comments recommending that the final rule require chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes, also imply that the chain brakes should be properly engaged during use of the chain saw. In addition, none of those commenters supporting a chain brake provision indicated that there were situations in which it would be safe to allow the chain brake not to be engaged during operation of the saw. At paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of the final standard, OSHA is requiring that the operator hold the chain saw with both hands during operation. This requirement does not apply when the employer can demonstrate that a greater hazard is posed by keeping both hands on the saw in that particular situation. This provision is the same as the provision contained in the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also recognized the occasional need for momentary release of one hand from the saw in some situations. Some commenters urged OSHA to require that a chain saw must never be operated with only one hand (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;50, 5&hyph;66). One commenter said: Regardless of what organization recognizes and sanctions momentary one-handed chain saw use, it is extremely dangerous. I do not agree it is necessary to operate a saw with one hand and place a wedge with the other. By so doing, the right hand is on the pistol grip controlling the throttle, the left handling the wedge. If, during this one-handed process a kick back should occur, the left hand which has the primary responsibility for maintaining a distance between the operator and the saw chain is absent. Sufficient time exists between the initiation of the backcut and its completion for the cutter to momentarily halt his sawing to insert a wedge (Ex. 5&hyph;66). The U.S. Dept. of Interior also said that chains saws should be held with both hands unless the motor is at idle (Ex. 5&hyph;50). It is not difficult for chain-saw operators to put the saw in idle before removing one hand from the saw. Before placing a wedge the feller can stop the chain by simply removing his finger from the throttle, that will idle the chain saw, thereby reducing the possibility of injury resulting from operating the saw with only one hand. OSHA agrees that in this situation as well as most other operating situations, the greater hazard is posed by removing the hand from the chain saw. According to the WIR survey, 13 percent of chain-saw operators injured reported that their hand slipped into the chain or they did not have a tight grip on the saw. However, OSHA believes there are other situations in which the hazard may be greater if the operator attempts to hold the saw with two hands. For example, when an operator has climbed a tree to top the tree, the operator may not be able to keep his balance if he tries to operate the saw with both hands. In that case, the safest method may be to use one hand to control the saw and the other hand to steady himself.
