According to the general, these changes are envisaged by the military reform and requirements of the main provisions of Russia's military doctrine. Vladimir Semyonov called the establishment of the mobile forces a "coerced measure". "We were forced to do this due to the current political situation in Russia and the new views developed by military science and strategy," the commander-in-chief said. The mobile forces, the colonel-general noted, will be used at a "threatening period". With the outbreak of local and other conflicts, Vladimir Semyonov noted, these forces will be moved to the necessary regions "for a short period of time". For instant- reaction forces this period will be twenty-four hours and for rapid deployment forces -- several days. The commander-in-chief determined some tasks to be resolved by the mobile forces: The inadmissibility of spreading of local conflicts, the localization of large scale conflicts and the creation of conditions for strategical deployment of Russian Armed Forces. The colonel-general believes that the mobile forces will be best staffed in the Russian Armed Forces. They will also include units and subunits of land and airborne troops, military transport and combat aircraft and other units from fighting services and branches of arms.
