Dr. Anafu told Channel Africa that the soldiers had agreed in principle to leave their positions and return to their barracks at Makoanyane and (Ha Rakamose) just outside the capital. Mr. Gaylard said discussions with the two fighting Army factions were continuing, with both sides having expressed loyalty to the Lesotho Government. Lesotho Foreign Affairs Minister Molapo Qhobela told Channel Africa that his government wanted the Commonwealth to take as much time as necessary to talk to the soldiers and resolve the conflict.
