During 'Arafat's visit, the Palestinian official said, Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be held on the highest level, and the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement will be signed. The signing of the agreement has been postponed several times. The official, who requested anonymity, said that the next Jordanian-Palestinian meetings will be extremely important, as conferees will discuss a Jordanian-Palestinian mechanism of action that is much more exhaustive than coordination. The official added that the Palestinian self-rule authority, which is the first Palestinian experience of its kind, needs an Arab effort to strengthen it and to protect it from the Israeli side, which is superior in terms of its economy, scientific knowledge, and technology. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, the same Palestinian official revealed a Palestinian's wish to reassess the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He indicated that this agreement has only been initialed, and that the Palestinian side is not committed to implementing it if it harms the Palestinian people or will harm Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations, which are viewed by the Palestinians of the West Bank as the core of their Arab-Islamic extension. He said that all the agreements that have been signed with Israel are temporary, since there are Palestinian rights that must be addressed and numerous topics of negotiations that must raised with Israel prior to the final peace accord. He said that this requires everyone to be careful when raising issues of a pan-Arab dimension and that Jordanian-Palestinian efforts should be united to safeguard these issues, chiefly the issue of Jerusalem, which should be the focus of Arab and Islamic efforts, rather than Jordanian and Palestinian efforts only.
