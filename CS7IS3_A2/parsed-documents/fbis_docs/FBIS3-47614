FBIS3-47614 "dreas010_l_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-010 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Jan 1994 Philippines Sison Accuses Government of Aiding Breakaways BK1401095794 Quezon City MALAYA in English 10 Jan 94 p 2 BK1401095794 Quezon City MALAYA Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Romy Tangbawan] [Text] Jose Maria Sison, exiled leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) yesterday accused the Ramos administration of "coddling (party) renegades" and threatened to pull out of the peace talks unless such "reprehensible" act is stopped. "There are glaring indications that they (renegades) are being manipulated for a scheme of bloody intrigue," Sison said in a statement faxed to media outfits in Manila from the National Democratic Front (NDF) International Office in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The statement named the renegades as Romulo Kintanar, Arturo Tabara, Filemon Lagman, and Ricardo Reyes, who are all facing criminal charges before the party for allegedly committing acts inimical to the interest of the movement. Sison claimed that the NDF international office has received information that the four "renegades" use firearms and bodyguards provided by the government. It said the four, under the supervision of military intelligence officers, have been holding caucuses and other activities in Metro Manila since September 1992 with the goal of "decapitating, discrediting, disintegrating and destroying" the movement. Kintanar, alias Daniel Bagani or Dan, was the former chief of the New People's Army; Tabara, alias Victor del Mar, Pol, and Piloy, used to head the CPP Central Visayas Commission; Lagman also known as Carlos Forte and Popoy, heads the breakaway CPP Manila-Rizal Regional Committee; Reyes was former deputy secretary-general of the CPP-Mindanao Commission. Kintanar, in particular, is being blamed by the CPP-NPA of introducing "gangsterism" in the movement in Davao City in 1984, "abuse of authority," and corruption within some party units. Sison expressed concern that the four ex-rebel chiefs have been "openly and freely" operating in Metro Manila and "misrepresenting" themselves as CPP leaders despite the fact their expulsion from the party had been made public. Sison hinted that Malacanang may not have sanctioned such scheme, pointing out that there are military and police officials who have been overruled by their superiors but who continue to disagree with the policy of "condoning, arming and funding criminal elements who have committed random killing of military and police officers, mass murders [sentence as published]." But he said the "U.S.-Ramos regime cannot escape responsibility for any crime of intrigue committed by its military personnel and its Balweg-type assets against the patriotic and progressive forces in the Philippines." Sison reminded the president, whom he addressed by his former military title "General Ramos," that similar tactics were applied by past administrations using the "Lava revisionists," "Kumander [Comrade] Melody," "Kumander Pusa," and rebel priest Conrado Balweg against the movement but all have failed. Sison first threatened to withdraw his group from the peace talks after assassins killed Vicente Martinez, another former NPA chief, at his house in Antipolo, Rizal last week. The CPP described the slaying as an attempt to spark killings within the movement. Partisans loyal to Lagman's group have blamed Sison's faction for the killing but sources from the mainstream movement said there is no reason for them to want Martinez killed since he is not among the renegades. Sison suspected that government forces were behind the killing.
