Earlier this week their leader, Barend Strydom, also indicated his support for the Freedom Front. A man claiming to be the leader of the Wit Wolwe in the southern [Orange] Free State, Mr. Eddie Visagie, told our Bloemfontein staff that he and the Wit Wolwe leaders in the northern [Orange] Free State, Eastern and Northern Cape, Kalahari, and the Transvaal have all decided to support the Freedom Front in the coming election. The Freedom Front said earlier that the party welcomed any support; however, it would not consider Mr. Strydom as a candidate because of his past.
