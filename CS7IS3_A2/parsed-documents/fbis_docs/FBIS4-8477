This is what Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, told Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn. Andras Agoston expressed hope that in the future a clear and verifiable system will be established in the mother country to support the organizations of Hungarians beyond the borders. Gyula Horn considered it important that the Hungarian political forces, independent of their party political affiliation and ideology, should be united in support of the Vojvodina Hungarians.
