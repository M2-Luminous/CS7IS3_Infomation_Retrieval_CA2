As the typical family prepares to pay an extra 10 pounds a week, rising to 16 pounds next year, the full extent of the Tory tax deceit is becoming apparent. The typical British family is now paying more of its income in tax than in 1979. By focusing attention on the headline rate of income tax, Mr Major and his ministers thought they could get away with freezing tax allowances, lowering tax thresholds and cutting mortgage tax relief. They even thought that they could obscure the doubling of VAT [value-added tax] since 1979 and a 50 per cent rise in National Insurance. The attempt has failed. The facts are out. The Conservatives will never be trusted on tax again. In 1988, George Bush famously called on American electors to "Read my lips: No new taxes." Taxes rose once and he was never trusted again. In 1992, John Major told people to read his manifesto commitment not to increase tax. Now taxes are set to rise--not just once, but in 20 separate ways over the next two years. Mr Major will never be trusted again. Both the tax rises themselves and the sense of betrayal will get worse. When Labour left office, 34.75 per cent of national income was taken in tax. This year, tax will take 35.5 per cent, rising to 37 per cent next year, 37.5 the year after and 38.5 per cent by 1998. Never again can the Tories claim to be the low tax party, or that they have an "instinct" for low taxation, when they have had to admit that in every year until the brink of the next century, taxation will take more and more of national income. Almost all of us are now paying for the Government's mistakes. Families on half average income have seen an increase in the share of this taken in tax, and so have families whose income is twice the average. Even families which have benefited from cuts in top rate income tax--those on four times average income, nearly 80,000 pounds a year--will be paying more than they did in 1979. The only beneficiaries of Conservative tax policies have been a tiny minority very close to the Tory party. The top I per cent, earning more than 120,000 pounds a year, received 30 per cent of the tax cuts in the big handout of 1988. Only a fraction of that is being taken back. It is still possible for someone earning 1 million pounds a year to pay virtually no tax at all. But because this tiny minority pays less, the rest of us have to do more. Yet Tory tax-cutting promises were not incidental commitments, the accidental result of casual remarks in the heat of the election campaign. The tax promises were the centrepiece of the Tories' political strategy and their attack on Labour. They were the cornerstone of Mr Major's attempt to secure re-election, and they are at the heart of the question of integrity in politics. In 1992, Mr Major promised that "we have no plans and no need to extend the scope of VAT." He now claims his statements were to be taken as aspirations, rather than undertakings. Yet the evidence is against him. For he also categorically stated "there will be no VAT increase." His party even issued a special campaign briefing which said that "following a series of unfounded and irresponsible scares by the Labour Party, the Prime Minister has confirmed that the Government has no intention of raising VAT further." The promises given on national insurance and income tax were, if anything, even more explicit. The Tory party chairman called national insurance rises "a backdoor stealth tax," while Michael Portillo said that "higher tax and national insurance would hit those who work harder and do overtime." It was not only that Mr Major promised not to raise income tax. He went far further. He promised that he would cut it "year on year." The Government now claims that circumstances changed. But when Norman Lamont was asked at the election whether he would increase taxes, he replied: "We will not have to increase taxes. I cannot see any circumstances in which that will be necessary." What annoys people is a Conservative Government making promises one year and refusing even to acknowledge breaking them the next. The Prime Minister's "back to basics,'" if it were to mean anything, should mean telling the truth, and there can be little sympathy for a Government that simply refuses to do what it asks of the rest of the public: to be honest in its promises, to face up to the consequences of its commitments and to understand the difference between right and wrong. Tax is the cash nexus between people and government. Trust is therefore essential. The Tory deception is therefore betrayal of a central trust. A new confidence needs to be established between people and government on tax, a confidence the Conservatives are incapable of achieving. The Labour party has made it clear that it will not tax for taxation's sake. There will be no sleight of hand. By linking the benefits that people receive to the taxes they are charged, we will show what they are getting for what they are paying. And Labour--unlike the Tories on VAT--will be fair in its approach. Honest disclosure, full consultation, open debate and full accountability for how money is spent are the means to reestablish trust between government and electorate. Only Labour can do that now.
