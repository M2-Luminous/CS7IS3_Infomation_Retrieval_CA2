Leotard, speaking on French radio, said that "the scientific community tells us that we need a few more tests," and added that he had not met a single scientist who believes otherwise. "France must acquire as quickly as possible -- perhaps in seven, eight or 10 years -- the capacity to simulate tests that would allow us to test the effects of a nuclear explosion," Leotard said. "That is essential for our country if we are to remain a major power." He said those opposed to nuclear testing are generally "politicians," an apparent reference to President Francois Mitterrand who is against France resuming nuclear [sentence as received]. Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wants to stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations Security Council members except China.
