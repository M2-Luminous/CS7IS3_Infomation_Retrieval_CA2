However, it can only take place when an examination in each individual case has shown that the person to be deported neither has to fear torture nor capital punishment in Turkey, the party leadership stated. The struggle for the Kurds' self-determination has to be carried out with democratic and nonviolent means. In particular, the valid German laws have to be observed and respected, it was stated. The SPD again criticized the FRG Government because of arms supplies from former GDR stocks to Ankara. A government led by the SPD will discontinue all deliveries of military material to Turkey, it was stated.
