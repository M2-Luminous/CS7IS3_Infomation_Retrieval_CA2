Karlov report: "So Who Exactly Is Poisoning Us?"] [Text] A conflict situation has now arisen in Russia because of the purchase and use of of foreign pesticides which have not undergone expert ecological and toxicological analysis. Over 500 domestically produced pesticides are authorized for use as it is, and counting all their various compounds and forms the figure runs into several tens of thousands. Every year the list of authorized pesticides is augmented by new preparations. This information was heard yesterday at a collegium of the Russian Federation Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Numerous research studies have shown that persistent stable pesticides are accumulating in the soil, ground sediments, plant-growing products, water, and living organisms. As a result various illnesses have arisen and the reproductive functions of people and animals and the functions of their genital organs have been disturbed. All this is not surprising, because around 100,000 tonnes of unusable pesticides have accumulated at Russian Federation Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs depots alone, and the problem of disposing of them has still not been solved. Fish are dying as a result of poisoning. For example, two years ago two million fish died in the Mechetka River (Rostov Oblast) alone -- pike, roach, perch, carp, and silver carp. For the same reason insects -- the pollinators of plants -- are dying, and this is greatly reducing the yield of agricultural crops. It is no accident that in 1992 almost 1,000 violations of environmental protection requirements were detected.
