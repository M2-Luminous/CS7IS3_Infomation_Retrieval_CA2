FBIS4-34334 "drlat118_a_94025" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Prosecutor's Spokesman on Fight Against `Moneybags' Prosecutor's Spokesman on Fight Against `Moneybags' FL1706184394 Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 17 Jun 94 FL1706184394 Havana Radio Progreso Network Spanish BFN [From the "First Thing" program] [Text] The confiscation of the moneybags' [maceta] goods and assets resulting from ill-gotten wealth is a coordinated and effective effort being conducted by the General Attorney's Office and its provincial and municipal branches to fight corruption in our society. To conduct this systematic work, prosecutors first make an inventory of the goods in the possession of the person under investigation and check it against real income. Those goods without official documentation are held until the owner proves their legality. The Finance and Prices Ministry is in charge of issuing confiscation papers and transferring the goods to the state. We will hear about the case of another one of these moneybags who resorted to illegal wealth to satisfy disproportionate material cravings. Here is Enrique Valdez Machin, from the Havana prosecutor's office, on implementing Decree-Law 149 against those who become wealthy through theft, embezzlement, speculation, and other illegal activities: [Begin Valdez recording] Havana prosecutors carried out a search, according to the law, of the home of one of these renowned moneybags and seized one fan, two ceiling fans, one air conditioner, two digital clock-radios, two color televisions, two refrigerators, one freezer, one VCR, three remote controls, one plastic pool, three cars, one motorcycle, one two-story house, and numerous vehicular spare parts and domestic items. How can someone who does not work acquire all these things? Where did he get the money from? How many years of honest and well-remunerated work would be required to accumulate even a portion of the things seized from this house? The implementation of Decree-Law 149 has brought to light, in all its crudeness, the situation of many people who took advantage of the workers' labor to satisfy their personal cravings. The time of reckoning has come for these social parasites. We are witnessing the beginning of the end of the moneybags. [end recording]
