The attribution of some vague responsibility to the Turkish side is ruined by the alternative procedures that are suggested." Among other things, the archbishop said in his statement: "Who is Butrus-Ghali to threaten with his reference to the withdrawal of the UN international peacekeeping force that is stationed in Cyprus? Certainly not the Turkish side..... It is a threat to us, who will essentially remain exposed to the mercy of the fully armed Turkish troops and settlers." "...the UN secretary general's report makes no reference to the need to put an end to the invasion and occupation or that the Turkish troops and settlers must withdraw. It also makes no reference to the basic UN resolutions." The Archbishop suggests that: - The political leadership make united demands that the national issue return to its basis--that is, the invasion, occupation, and violation of human rights. We are all obliged to appeal to the United Nations, without hesitation or disagreement, and insist firmly that the basic UN resolutions be implemented. - We appeal to the powers guaranteeing Cyprus' independence--Great Britain and Greece--and demand that they fulfill their responsibilities and commitments stemming from the treaty that guarantees Cyprus' independence.
