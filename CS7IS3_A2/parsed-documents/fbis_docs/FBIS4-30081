The Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, left out specific figures which politicians will decide on later but showed implications for continuing the 6.2 trillion yen income and other tax cuts already implemented this year and raising the 3 percent consumption tax to above 6 percent in April 1997. In the report, the panel strongly recommended the government to offer concrete promises such as "medium-term numerical targets and programs" on fiscal and administrative overhauls to win taxpayers' support. Commission Chairman Kan Kato handed the report over to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, leaving sufficient time for the government and the ruling coalition parties to detail the tax reform by the end of this month and enact it into law by the year-end. Japan promised the timetable in its March market-opening package. But uncertainties are mounting on the political side with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party preparing to launch a no-confidence motion against the minority-rule coalition government. Apparently to avoid unnecessary political disputes over the sensitive issue of raising the sales tax, the panel avoided specific figures, and it also spelled out as "minority opinions" that the tax hike be limited only to fund the tax cuts while leaving the issue of securing a revenue surplus for welfare spending toward the 21st century for further discussion.
