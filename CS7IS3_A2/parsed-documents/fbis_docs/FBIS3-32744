The sources added that "thanks to some information," police arrested "El Guajiro" at Los Garzones airport in Neiva as he prepared to board a domestic flight. The EPL dissident rebel, who did not want to sign the peace agreement with the government in January 1991, is being interrogated today by authorities. Solano or "El Guajiro" is accused of rebellion, association with criminal intent, and terrorism, among other charges. Last 29 January, authorities captured another rebel from that group in Cartagena de Indias (in the north) called Guido Meneses Ruiz, the alleged author of the murder of 50 former members of his organization who rejoined civilian life through the EPL agreements in 1991.
