ITAR-TASS learned on Monday that this had been done in line with an instruction by Vladimir Lozovoy, the head of the interim administration. In the meantime, a wide-scale "transport" operation aimed to strengthen the state of emergency regime is under way in the zone where the regime is in force. It envisages thorough check-ups of vehicles, trains, train stations, and airports. It was reported that dozens of fire-arms, hand-grenades, various rounds of ammunition, and drugs had been confiscated from passengers over the past three days. Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from military sources makes it possible to conclude that the situation in the North Ossetian rayons where the state of emergency regime is in force until 31 May remains relatively calm. No night shellings or attacks on army or militia posts or interethnic conflicts have been registered here in the past 24 hours.
