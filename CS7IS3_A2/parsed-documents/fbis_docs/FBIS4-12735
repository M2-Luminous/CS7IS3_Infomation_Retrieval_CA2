This information raises many suspicions about the parties that took part in or were behind the incident. The competent Iraqi authorities are willing to cooperate with the United States to learn the facts as they exist. We hope that the U.S. side that handles this will be impartial. It is preferable that this should be done with the knowledge of the U.S. Congress or under its supervision.
