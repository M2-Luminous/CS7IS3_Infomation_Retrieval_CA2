Mark Silver, an American ballistic missile expert and head of the 30-member team, told reporters today that they have accomplished all the task to put tags on the operational missiles for the non-modification purpose. "These missiles are very dangerous because they are in a capability that are ready to launch," silver said upon his departure for New York. Along with the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, Iraq's long-range missiles had been destroyed by the end of March 1992 in accordance with UN resolutions, but Iraq is allowed to possess and produce medium- and short-range missiles (less than 150 kilometers) for self-defense. A missile reportedly exploded last year while under test at an Iraqi site, damaging the surrounding UN monitoring video cameras which are remotely controlled by UN experts in downtown Baghdad. The missiles experts also paid a total of seven inspections to Iraqi missile sites and facilities during their 15-day mission, but they found no violation of the cease-fire terms, Silver said. He praised his Iraqi counterparts' cooperation during his mission, saying, "The Iraqis did what we were asking them to do." Silver and his men are expected to come back to Iraq periodically to inspect and verify the tags on the missiles as part of the UN plan for long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons-related industries which was accepted by Iraq last November. "Among taggings, cameras and other surveillance means, the best way is human eye," Silver said. "They cannot beat the human eye." Iraqi compliance with destruction of its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles and monitoring of its weapons programs is a prerequisite to lifting the UN oil embargo though the United States has been seeking to add other conditions.
