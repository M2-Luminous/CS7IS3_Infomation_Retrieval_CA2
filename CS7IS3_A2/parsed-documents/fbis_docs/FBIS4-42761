Do you, meanwhile, believe that you made a mistake? [Scharping] We criticized the standards of the elections, not the person elected. Roman Herzog has a right to cooperation; but even the FDP's [Free Democratic Party] Ms. Hamm-Bruecher spoke of "power calculations." I was angry at first, but everybody makes mistakes. Today I see things more calmly. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Yet SPD Minister-Presidents Schroeder and Stolpe strongly criticized you in public. Are you going to strike back? [Scharping] These two must not be lumped together. One person clearing his throat does not mean that the whole SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] suffers from pneumonia. Every Social Democrat must contribute to the election victory instead of acting out their personal vanities. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Strong words, when will they be followed by actions? [Scharping] At its party conference on 22 June, the SPD will present a solid picture and will clearly support me. And we will adopt a convincing government program. [BILD AM SONNTAG] What will it say? [Scharping] Among the things we want are a cut in government costs and a modern state. The number of ministries will be cut from 19 to 15 or 16, and of the 60 state secretaries, some 40 will remain in office. We want to introduce reforms in public service regulations. Public servants will only perform tasks such as police, inland revenue, and judiciary functions. The top positions in the public service will be temporary ones. Salaries for young, qualified persons starting a vocation will be higher from the beginning. We will weed out the system of grades of seniority drastically. There must be more competition in public services, including privatization, as long as this does not mean a deterioration in quality. The number of regulations and approvals needed, say in building, must be reduced significantly. In a nutshell: The Kohl policy of constantly increasing taxes and quickly growing debts will be over. This requires an efficient state. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Opinion polls indicate that you have lost a great deal of support. Is there still a chance that you will win the Bundestag elections and put your program into practice? [Scharping] Serious polls show that we are still the strongest party. And I am clearly in the lead ahead of Mr. Kohl. The European elections on 12 June and the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag elections will be further indicators. [BILD AM SONNTAG] But you will need a coalition partner in Bonn. The FDP has clearly decided in favor of the Union [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union], thus giving the SPD the brush-off. Does this mean that there will be a red-green coalition after all? [Scharping] No. Our position is clear and it will not change: We want to be the strongest party. This way we will always find a partner. We are ruling out a grand coalition. The FDP did not say that it will join the Union as an opposition party if the elections turn out unfavorably for them. This means that after the elections the supply of partners will be greater than the demand. But there is one thing that I will not grant: exclusive rights for small parties. This way the tail would wag the dog. The only way things will change in Germany is if the SPD wins a majority. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Who shall be part of the SPD government? [Scharping] We will present our cabinet team after the summer recess. I have talked to several people. And I have always made sure that governments include people from outside politics, as is the case in Rhineland-Palatinate. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Will you establish a reconstruction ministry? [Scharping] I will personally look after reconstruction in eastern Germany. And I hope I will be able to get Wolfgang Thierse to coordinate this, perhaps in the Chancellor's Office. The share of east Germans in government will be higher than it is now. [BILD AM SONNTAG] Would Chancellor Scharping prescribe a 130-km speed limit on all German highways? [Scharping] On most highways. But there will be exceptions. [BILD AM SONNTAG] There have been voices in your party calling for a ban on the Republikaner. Are you in favor of such a ban? [Scharping] I am in favor of having them observed closely by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. This has turned out to be successful over the past few months. The Republikaner have been unmasked. We must succeed in keeping them out of all parliaments.
