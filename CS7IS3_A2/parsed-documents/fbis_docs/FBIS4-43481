It also seems to have stirred the Flemish socialist to pursue even more vigorously than his free-market conservative predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, competition abuses in the single market. Mr van Miert feels he has been let down by governments which had originally asked him to draw up with Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, a plan to cut European steel capacity. "I was asked to put together a steel plan but I was never `demandeur' (Originator). If the feeling is that we should put an end to it, I'm prepared to do so," he said defiantly in an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES. Although governments are now scrambling to salvage the plan, Mr van Miert suggested the moves were unlikely to succeed but designed rather to give the whole affair "a decent burial." For Mr van Miert, the steel affair reflects the contradictory and often hypocritical position of governments that ultimately undermines the entire European Union process. "It's very frustrating when you have to discuss with governments about capacity cuts, about state aid, when they all have a veto. It doesn't work. I mean, it's like a referee in a football game where he has to ask the player if he please may give him a yellow or a red card. That's the position the Commission has been facing on steel," he said. And then governments, not least the UK, adopt completely contradictory positions. "We will be told we are well paid, which is true, perhaps even over-paid Eurocrats, and not politically responsible, and things like that. But the British government will ask Mr Bangemann and me officially and formally to use Article 90 to liberalise the telecommunications sector without parliament, without the Council of Ministers. Isn't that a very strange attitude?" he asks, referring to Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome, known as the nuclear option, a rarely used provision which gives the Commission the power to break up public monopolies on competition grounds. In some more liberal quarters, Mr van Miert's appointment 18 months ago raised fears he would take a soft approach to competition issues. Instead he is confounding his doubters by initiating a broad series of competition cases involving everything from mergers and state aid to price fixing in sectors as varied as consumer goods, cement production, carton board, telecommunications, airlines and banking. He is proposing to block a controversial takeover of a German feminine hygiene products company by Procter and Gamble of the U.S.: only the second deal to be blocked by the Commission since it was given wider powers to vet large mergers more than two years ago. Mr van Miert, a former transport commissioner who engineered European air transport liberalisation, is also planning to attack ground handling monopolies at European airports. He is keeping an eye on the French government's proposed FFr20bn (2.3bn pounds) capital injection into Air France, the troubled French national carrier, and is pursuing a complaint by the small Irish carrier, Ryanair, against Aer Lingus, the Irish state nag carrier, of predatory pricing. Mr van Miert is extremely concerned by the French government's plan to inject FFr4.9bn of capital into Credit Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks, and writing off FFr40bn of bad debts. In a novel approach to EU competition investigations, he is planning to appoint a panel of eminent independent bankers to advise him on the case. From the beginning, Mr van Miert has adopted a pragmatic approach to competition issues. Just as he felt that the only way forward for the steel industry was a flexible plan linking state aid to the decommissioning of capacity, even though this might have been in a strict legal sense questionable, he believes the state has a role to play in areas, including big infrastructure programmes, where private investors do not want to invest. But he is also convinced that the cause of liberalisation in Europe has been won, even in his own country of Belgium. Under the Commission's state aid policy for flag carriers, state-owned airlines have been allowed one last injection of state funds to help them adapt to the new liberalised aviation market and restructure their operations. "Sabena (the Belgian national carrier) made losses for many, many years. Now they have had to adapt in a dramatic way to new circumstances. So we thought it was fair enough to give carriers a new chance. But just once." Privatisation is also the only way ahead for large sectors of previously state-owned industries, including steel, telecommunications, airlines, among many others. "There is no reason why they should be state-owned," Mr Van Miert said. "It is utterly unfair if in a given member state companies not receiving state aid are being put to the wall by those continuing to produce quite happily although in trouble because of state support," he said, adding that national bankruptcy laws also risked further distorting the market. For all these reasons, it was important to give the Commission the necessary instruments to monitor competition. "If we are not equipped we must admit that we are unable to do so and then leave it to the gods," he said. "Once you go for liberalisation, you need a strong central authority to make the rules, implement them and respect them." Equally, it was important to take a long-term view of competition and overall industrial policy, added Mr van Miert, a close friend of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. "I believe you have remain far-sighted. One of great strengths of Jacques Delors is that he senses I perhaps much more than many other people what will might be needed in years come. I believe very much that the next president of the Commission should be that kind of guy." Mr van Miert recalled how Mr Delors asked him draw up a new transport infrastructure network for Europe when he first took over transport portfolio. "I still keep the map he gave me on which he drew various lines and at least one tunnel."
