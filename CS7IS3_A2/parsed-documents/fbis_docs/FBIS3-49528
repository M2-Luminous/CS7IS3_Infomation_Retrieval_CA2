In Macedonia, two lines, in the direction Kocani-Blagoevgrad (Bulgaria) or Kumanovo-Guesevo (Bulgaria), are envisaged. The route Kocani-Blagoevgrad foresees the construction of a new track long 145 km, and which will cost $430 million. The second route Kumanovo-Guesevo consists of a track long 46 km, at the cost of $120 million. The direction Kumanovo-Guesevo is given the advantage, in view of the costs and the quick realization. The public in Kocani is complaining about this and believes that the government is not well informed as to the advantages of this route, which would connect their own town with Bulgaria.
