"It was a bad 10 minutes," Nepta Anngret, 45, a historian from Berlin's museum of ethnography, told AFP. She was on her way from her hotel in Ba'labakk to the famous Roman ruins of this ancient al-Biqa' Valley town when two young men approached her and said: "Hizballah, follow us." "They were very young guys. One was around 16 and the other 18," Anngret said. "I refused to follow them so one of the youths grabbed my arm and tried to drag me away. Passersby intervened and escorted me back to the Palmyra (hotel) but one of the guys followed me there," she said. She said the other young man drove away in a car but quickly returned to the hotel to get his friend. Hotel staff and witnesses confirmed the kidnapping attempt. Anngret has been staying at the Palmyra Hotel for a week to carry out research at the Roman temples of Ba'labakk. "I've been in Lebanon for a month. People here are very nice and I plan on continuing my research before packing up in 10 days time," she said, stressing that the incident had shaken her up but not frightened her. It was the first reported kidnapping attempt of a Westerner since the last Western hostage was released in 1991 following a wave of abductions during the Lebanese civil war. Hizballah militants seized six Lebanese men and a retired Syrian soldier from the Ba'labakk region Wednesday but freed them the next morning after the Syrian military command in the al-Biqa' threatened to arrest Hizballah militants. The seven were abducted after some of them were seen taking photographs outside the home of the former Hizballah secretary general al-Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. The Iranian-backed guerrillas have been on alert since June 2 when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base near Ba'labakk.
