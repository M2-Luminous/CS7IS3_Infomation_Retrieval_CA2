Endara has acknowledged opposition had "emerged" ever since these constitutional reforms were presented. Various sectors of the community have expressed their rejection to these reforms, and this is why he is assessing their possible withdrawal from the assembly. Nevertheless, Endara has said he personally agrees with the text of these reforms, which offer greater freedom of action and financial independence to the Electoral Tribunal. In the name of the executive branch, Government and Justice Minister Jacobo Salas presented to the Legislative Assembly at the end of May a "package of reforms" to the Constitution that should be approved during the current assembly session and ratified by the next. Up until now, the Legislative Assembly has not initiated the debate on this "package of reforms" to the Constitution, but political, professional, and even internal sectors of the assembly, have rejected it. Endara has said that as of yet he has not decided if he will call special assembly sessions to discuss these reforms; nevertheless, he has said this is a possibility he is also contemplating. The National Front for a Constituent Assembly (FRENO) last week reiterated its rejections of these reforms, affirming an overall revision must be made to the Constitution instead of "adding more bits and pieces." FRENO has insisted on the need to call a constituent assembly to take charge of the drafting of a new constitutional text the nation requires in light of the changes that have occurred in the past years.
