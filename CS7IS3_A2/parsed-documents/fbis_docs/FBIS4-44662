Without entering into details concerning the statements made by Professor Ruffini we will limit ourselves to expounding some essential points regarding the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] program. 1 -- The Scientific Profile of the Mission The qualifying characteristics of SAX are its ability to make simultaneous observations of celestial X-sources over an extremely wide energy band covering three decades from 0.2 keV (kilo electronvolt) to 200 keV, a bandwidth that has never been simultaneously explored before. One of the preeminent aspects of the sky seen in X-rays, as appears from the observed panorama, is its extreme variability with respect to time. The key factor in obtaining a consistent picture of the processes occurring in the sources, based on the possibility of effecting simultaneous spectral measurements over the widest range of bands obtainable, is obtained by SAX by using a scientific package made up of a well-balanced group of sensors, that together give unquestionable superiority and the possibility of contextual reconstruction of the energy spectrum over all the bandwidth. 2 -- The Scientific Instruments On Board SAX The scientific package of SAX includes a set of innovative elements, based on leading-edge techniques: grazing incidence X-optics obtained by using a nickel electroplating process. This technique, which was developed in Italy for SAX, has been successively used for the Jet-X telescopes in the Russian mission Spectrum X-Gamma and in the mission ESA-XMM [X-ray Multiple Mirror]. Spectrometers with image sensors based on scintillating gas proportional meters, with a sensitivity that is comparable to that of CCD [charge coupled device] sensors. A high-pressure scintillating gas proportional meter that operates with characteristics of energy sensitivity and resolution that have never been achieved before. A high-performance photodischarge (PDS) crystal sensor. Wide range X-observation cameras, that are the most sophisticated type of blackout camera developed to the present day. 3 -- Comparison With the Satellites for X-Astronomy That Are Currently Operational or At the Planning Stage When SAX is considered in comparison with the two X-astronomy missions currently in orbit (the German Rosat [Roentgen Satellite] and the Japanese ASCA), its scientific profile is competitive and largely complementary. As far as future missions are concerned, NASA's XTE mission is limited to energies above 2 keV. The ESA's XMM and NASA's AXAF [Advanced X-ray Astrophysical Facility] are planned to go into orbit four or five years after SAX. As missions of the observation type belong to the next generation, they will present a substantial advance with respect to previous X-astronomy missions. Anyway SAX will continue to be unique in terms of the width of the band covered, this simply cannot be attained by any other mission underway or currently being planned. 4 -- Considerations on the Launching Date The program for the realization of SAX is now well-defined and the details have been settled. The nominal launching date, using an Atlas Centaur from the Cape Canaveral base, is set for 22 December 1995. Negative comments about delays to the program over the years are often made by the critics of the SAX program, delays that would deteriorate the scientific validity of the mission and would be characteristic only of SAX and not of other missions. As far as the presumed "aging" of SAX is concerned, the argument is an excuse. As far as the time delays are concerned, it is illustrative to look at the reference dates of some of the most well-known satellites, as shown in the table.

(Sources: NASA-ESA) 5 -- Consideration on Costs SAX is a sophisticated satellite with high-profile technological instrumentation. Its cost, when compared with similar European projects, is completely in line with them and is not at all excessive or abnormal. Some "critical" voices of SAX present the evolution of the cost of the mission, from the amount that was originally estimated in 1981 to that of today, in a deliberately confused way. A correct evaluation must take account of: a) The initial cost that was estimated at 100 billion lire in 1981 and that would correspond to about 300 billion lire in 1994; b) Following the Challenger disaster in 1986 the SAX mission had to be radically replanned and reoriented to be launched using an expendable Atlas-Centaur carrier (that currently costs over 100 billion lire) instead of using the NASA spacecraft (at zero cost to the program); c) The current cost goes back to the contractual stage negotiated in 1989 and has not changed much since that date. 6 -- Participation of the Scientific Community From the hardware point of view (scientific instrumentation), six research institutes are participating in the program, four of these are in Italy and two are abroad, all together about 30 technicians and researchers are involved, an analogous number of researchers are dealing with the software part (data analysis and preparation of observation programs). We are therefore dealing with a group of highly qualified scientists, that is anything but small for this preparatory stage of the mission. The community that is interested in the observation data obtained from the satellite when it is in orbit will naturally be much vaster. Johan A.M.
