Of these, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor Simon of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), and 16 to Varga. In this way, Rasko moved to first place with 9,417 votes, ahead of Varga, who thus had 9,412 votes. Simon received 21 additional votes, but even so he remained third, with 8,200 votes. At Rasko's request, on Thursday [9 June] afternoon the committee will re-examine all 26,000 votes cast in the constituency. The MDF would thus send 38 and the SZDSZ 69 parliamentary deputies to the 386-seat parliament.
