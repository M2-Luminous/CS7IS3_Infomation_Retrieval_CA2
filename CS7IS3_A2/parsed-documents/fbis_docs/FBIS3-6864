According to the Department of Information, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to invest in setting up a bank in Hungary requires a capital of at least U.S. $10 million. Hungary agreed to consider easing various constraints to pave the way for the setting up of branch offices in Hungary by Thai commercial banks. The country also wants to sell several industrial products to Thailand, such as railway tracks, crop godowns, and cooling system cables. Thailand asked Hungary to buy more Thai products in return. During the recent visit to Hungary by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, Thailand proposed that Hungary use tapioca as an ingredient for animal feed production. Hungary asked Thailand's advice for the use of tapioca in animal feed production. The country also agreed to serve as an agent to bring frozen pork from Thailand for further distribution to the commonwealth independent state.
