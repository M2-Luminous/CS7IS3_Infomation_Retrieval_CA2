May this year bring you well-being and prosperity. At year's end each of us has an opportunity to think, to be with our families, and to examine our past, present, and future. With the internal peace fostered by the Christmas season, which allows us to reflect -- which I am certain we all did -- I thought of my almost five years in office and examined where I came from, where I am, and where I am headed. As the end of my term approaches, I could not help but recall the situation that existed in 1989. We had an armed conflict that was causing bloodshed throughout the breadth and length of our country, bringing grief and sorrow to the Salvadoran family. We were a polarized society and sectors confronted one another. What is even worse, there was a considerable uprooting of people. Many Salvadorans had to go abroad in search of peace and a way to make a living. We had an economic situation that could have been characterized as chaotic. During the eighties, which we now describe as the lost decade, our country gradually sank further into an economic abyss. The crisis returned us to the levels that existed in 1960 which, of course, meant higher levels of unemployment and poverty. El Salvador also had problems abroad because it was identified by its violence and by bad things, not as a country that could participate in international meetings or present itself with dignity and respect. In 1989, my friends, our country was immersed in desperation. When I first addressed you on 1 June 1989, I identified two key issues as the main focuses of my government: The first was to resolve the armed conflict and the second was to correct the chaotic economic situation that prevailed. I chose these two key issues because if we failed to resolve them it would be very difficult to resolve the country's other problems. Devoting the entire national budget to a military effort left no resources to resolve such problems as health, housing, and education. Likewise, with the economic crisis it was impossible to generate jobs and resources to invest in social projects. Thus, it was necessary to emphasize these two issues. It was the only way to overcome the obstacles that were hindering the solution of the country's problems. This is why I made this huge effort. As I recall these past four and a half years, I believe it would be worth our while to weigh the current situation. At present, our country is no longer at war. Instead, it is increasingly consolidating a peace process and has become an example to the entire world. All of the sectors in our country understand that the mechanism of dialogue prevents confrontations and is the best way to resolve our problems. For the first time in El Salvador's history, all of the country's many ideological trends will participate in an election, which means that we are consolidating our democracy. Also at present, our economy is healthy and stable, which opens the possibility of investing in that which a government should invest in: social projects. Although there are numerous examples, suffice it to say that already we have tripled the public health budget and doubled the education budget. In short, we are now able to resolve the problems that are affecting the Salvadoran people. Within the framework of a stable economic situation, considerable confidence has been generated domestically and abroad. This confidence is fostering investment in our country which, in turn, generates new sources of employment; and employment is the best way to pull a person out of extreme poverty. Internationally, El Salvador is viewed throughout the world as an example of pacification and democracy. However, beyond politics or political openness we now also have economic openness. All of the worldwide financial centers have opened their doors to El Salvador because they believe in and have confidence in our country's responsible economic efforts. This will allow us to rebuild all of the destruction generated by the armed conflict. Now, every Salvadoran can dream of the future; now, our children have space to work and grow; now, El Salvador has a future. However, looking beyond our accomplishments, we should consider who is responsible for this very significant change. There can be no other conclusion but that all of it is thanks to your support, the support of the entire Salvadoran population, a people who decided on a peace process to rescue the nation. We must remember that our country was torn between a military solution and a political solution. When I took office, I chose one of these two options: the political solution. I was certain that it was the only solution that would be truly lasting and permanent. As of that moment, differences disappeared and I was able to rely on the Salvadoran people's support to successfully culminate the negotiations process which, in 1992, brought us the peace we so desired. In the area of economics, I remember that once during a message to the nation I said I had two alternatives with which to deal with our difficult economic situation. I could either take the easy way out and continue ruling the country with methods that would create apparent solutions, or I could make the responsible decision to execute actions that would attack the problem at its roots, although I knew this decision implied high costs and sacrifices. At that time I likened the economy to a seriously ill patient at death's door, to whom we could administer morphine to diminish his pain but who would eventually die. The other alternative was to make the responsible decision to perform surgery which, although painful and with a slow recovery, would allow the patient to survive and regain his health. It was necessary to make the sacrifice for the sake of a better future for our country and to ensure the possibility of having El Salvador prepared to take off economically and prepared to grow. My brother Salvadorans, through these thoughts I have confirmed that you, that all Salvadorans, are unquestionably our country's greatest wealth, because without your support I would never have been able to eliminate the obstacles that prevented us from resolving our problems. I know that we still have problems, but a country always has them and they must be resolved. Nevertheless, by eliminating obstacles, our problems are already being resolved. We are now in a position to resolve our problems because the government has more resources and they are no longer devoted to an armed conflict or demagogic policies, but to those issues to which the nation's efforts should be directed: the effort to ensure all Salvadorans' success and to provide them with safety, education, health, and the necessary opportunities to succeed. We must make El Salvador a country of opportunities. Therefore, we must have confidence in our country; we must have confidence in our peace process; we must have confidence in all of our democratic institutions, which provide us with freedom. We must continue to have confidence in our development and in our progress as a people. Beloved fellow Salvadorans, we must have confidence in El Salvador because I am certain that together, all of us together, we will achieve what we have always desired: an El Salvador with peace, progress, and freedom. May God bless you all and may He always bless our beloved El Salvador. Thank you very much and a very good evening to all.
