Some 2,000 soldiers -- from the rapid response force headquarters (ARRC) -- will take part in this exercise, known as "arrcade guard." It will take place between 3 and 9 February in the area of Bielefeld (Northwest Germany), relying largely on computers to simulate the deployment of 100,000 men. The rapid response force, which can use troops from twelve Atlantic alliance countries, including Belgium, is the key component of NATO's military mechanism in the post-Cold War era. According to NATO Secretary General Manfred Worner, the principal task of the ARRC is to defend the territory of the twelve member states but certain elements of the unit would in the future be deployed on peacekeeping missions outside the NATO zone. For its part, the alliance has repeatedly stated that it is willing to dispatch -- under the aegis of the United Nations -- up to 50,000 men to Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to implement a peace plan agreed between the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims. The "arrcade guard" exercise will be the first carried out by the rapid response force in the field of peacekeeping. It will include the simulated deployment of the force headquarters to a nonidentified crisis area, the ARRC announced in a communique. "The ARRC headquarters will validate the necessary procedures for transferring its multinational staff headquarters to a foreign country where the mechanisms for responding in support of a UN mandate will be tested. This exercise will simulate all aspects of such an operation, including cooperation with UN agencies and humanitarian organizations, together with the way of dealing with local politicians and belligerents," the text adds. The force headquarters -- under the command of the British Lieutenant General Jeremy Mackenzie -- will command imaginary land troops up to 100,000 strong. But only 2,000 men will be present in the field as most of the troops will be computer-simulated, an ARRC spokesman reports.
