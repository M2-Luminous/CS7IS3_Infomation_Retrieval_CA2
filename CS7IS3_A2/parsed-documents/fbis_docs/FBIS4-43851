FBIS4-43851 "drweu120_p_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 GREECE Greek EU Presidency Seen `Successful' Greek EU Presidency Seen `Successful' 94P20905 94P20905 CSO [Editorial Report] An article in the 12 June Athens daily I KATHIMERINI by the newspaper's correspondent in Berlin, Tasos Telloglou, contended that the Greek European Union [EU] presidency is considered "successful" by Germany, Greece's successor. Despite the Greek embargo against The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's referral to the European Court of Justice, it is expected that German Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel will express his satisfaction to Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos during the two men's meeting on 14 June. Relations between them have been characterized by "special cordiality," according to Telloglou, following the successful negotiations on EU enlargement last February and the Ioannina meeting that resulted in a successful compromise on minority blocking. This "dramatic change," which comes after the German EU representatives stopped communicating with Greek officials because of Pangalos' well-known "importune" statements, contributed to an intervention by Bonn in the FYROM and Albanian issues that was more favorable to Greek interests. According to Telloglou, it proves that Germany considers its relations with Greece more important than its relationship with these two Balkan countries. Kinkel "contributed to a more realistic" appraisal of the problem of the embargo by adopting the view that this issue should not define the entire Greek relationship with the EU. Telloglou asserted that Kinkel also perceived that the Greek Government would not compromise unless FYROM shows flexibility. Germany's understanding would have been impossible had not Greece shown the availability and imagination to solve some of the problems faced by the EU, Telloglou concluded.
