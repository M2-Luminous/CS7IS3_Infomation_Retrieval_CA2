However, this has not yet been decided." Thus Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi answered a question from foreign journalists on the subject of constitutional reform, during a press conference at Palazzo Chigi [government seat]. "To my knowledge, no specific initiative has been taken in this direction," Ciampi added. "In this case, we would need a constituent assembly," he repeated, "like the one after World War II. During the constituent phase, if I recall correctly, the government also had legislative powers, because there was no parliament, only a constituent assembly." "If, however, it is only a question of amending the existing Constitution," Ciampi further explained, "the procedures are very clear. During the previous legislature, a bicameral commission was formed. This could be done again or, alternatively, we could follow the procedure laid down in the Constitution, which provides for certain steps to be taken." In Ciampi's view, changing the Constitution will be more parliament's than the government's responsibility. As regards a possible reform to introduce federalism, the prime minister said: "It is not up to me to make proposals concerning the contents of possible constitutional amendments. We must wait and see whether the next government will include this type of issue in its platform, or whether it will prefer to leave the initiative to parliament." Gianfranco Rotondi, PPI [Italian Popular Party] Deputy, was also proposing to set up a constituent body. In his view, "the only feasible way to introduce very substantial amendments to the Constitution, such as redrafting the constitutional chart's second part in its entirety, is to set up an ad hoc body invested with specific constituent powers, whereas the very scope of the reform process objectively rules out the possibility of resorting to the constitutional reform instrument provided for by Article 138." "Deputy Gianfranco Rotondi's proposal," a PPI circular explained, "posits setting up an assembly in order to tackle the constitutional reform. According to the proposal, the election of such a constituent assembly would be carried out on a clearly proprortional basis, in such a way as to represent all the political forces in the field, thus ensuring that the new forms of state and government reflect the composition of the country's social and political fabric as faithfully as possible."
