Kravchuk's edict "On Measures for Commemorating the Victims of Deportation From the Crimea" was, at first glance, timed for a specific date. On 18 May, 50 years ago, the "resettlement" of Crimean Tatars, as well as of Armenians, Bulgarians, and Greeks, started.... However, some politicians also saw in the edict official Kiev's political reaction to recent events in the Crimea. In particular, for the first time, in an important official document, the Crimean Tatar Majlis figured as a plenipotentiary representative body. Its chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev was appointed as deputy chairman of the Organizing Committee for Preparing and Holding the Remembrance Program. Mustafa aga [Tatar polite form of address] arrived in Kiev to take part in the first meeting of the committee. [Dzhemilev] I think that, indeed, the edict was to a certain extent a response to the recent actions by Crimean Republic's President Meshkov, who openly violates the constitutions of Ukraine and of the Crimea, as well as accords between the Crimean administration and the Ukrainian leadership. We are generally surprised that Kiev has been waiting for such a long time and, when it does respond to Meshkov's illegal edicts, it is on paper only. I understand Kiev's striving to avoid confrontation. However, if one proceeds along the road of compliance, this may, in the long run, lead to such a conflict that, by comparison, the troubles, which might result from decisive actions on the part of the Ukrainian leadership, will look like minor things. [Filipchuk] In accordance with your forecasts, will such uncertain relations between Kiev and Simferopol prevail for a long time? [Dzhemilev] The situation in the Crimea largely depends upon its administration. It is clear that Meshkov feels confident, since specific Russian statesmen, who are interested in maintaining instability on the peninsula, are backing him in pursuance of their own interests, in particular with regard to the Black Sea Fleet. Kiev's indecisiveness only inspires chauvinists both in the Crimea and in Russia. I hope that, eventually, the silence of the Ukrainian leadership will end. A different development of events is also possible: If Meshkov's Moscow coaches suggest that he pursue a different and more cautious policy and if they promise that there will be no territorial claims upon Ukraine. [Filipchuk] How will the events develop if the Crimean administration gets the Crimean Tatars to their side? [Dzhemilev] As things stand at present, this is not realistic. Even the fact that 14 of our representatives were elected to the parliament does not mean that we found understanding; this is the result of our acts of civil disobedience. Meshkov himself, who was actually against ethnic quotas in the parliament, stated in the parliament the next day after the elections that he did not recognize the Crimean Tatar Majlis and that Bagrov's parliament had made many stupid things (he meant, in particular, the quotas), and called upon the new parliament to "resolve" those problems. A few days ago, Meshkov's mediator spoke to us -- wouldn't we agree to meet with the president at his invitation. If President Meshkov wants to meet with us as with private persons, because he does not recognize the Majlis' powers, then does it really make sense? Incidentally, we have already been offered rewards for supporting a specific candidate for the post of chairman of the Crimean parliament. However, it is not alms that we need, but full recognition of the rights of the Crimean Tatars. [Filipchuk] Do official Russian representatives seek contacts with you? [Dzhemilev] There recently was a proposal from [deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers Sergey] Shakhray to meet with representatives of the Majlis. Readiness was even expressed to come to the Crimea, if representatives of the Majlis are unable to go to Moscow. Our doors are open to anybody. However, before we hold negotiations with official figures of foreign states, especially under today's conditions, we want to coordinate this with the leadership of our state. Russia does really seek contacts with us, but for what purpose? When, in 1991, they wanted to officially recognize us and even showed us a Russian Supreme Council's draft decree to that effect, there was just one "request" for the Crimean Tatars: To agree to the cancellation of the 1954 decree on the transfer of the Crimea to Ukraine's jurisdiction. As regards Crimean Tatars, very many illegal acts against them have been perpetrated throughout their history, but it would be best to start with 1783: Russia's unlawful annexation of the Crimea. That was the end of our "friendship." Nobody mentioned recognition any more after that. However, the trouble is that Ukraine delays official recognition of the Majlis in precisely the same way, fearing the reaction on the part of the Crimea and Russia. At the same time, we in the Crimea feel ourselves more Ukrainian than Ukrainians themselves. [Filipchuk] Incidentally, neither representatives of Rukh, nor of Ukraine's democratic parties have been elected to the Crimean parliament. Do they, today, see their allies in you? [Dzemilev] Our representatives will primarily defend the interests of Crimean Tatars, and these interests largely coincide with the interests of pro-Ukrainian parties. We see our self-determination as the revival of our national territorial autonomy within Ukraine and are categorically against a revision of borders. We are grateful to Ukraine for agreeing to finance the return of deported peoples to their historical land. Although there also are problems here: The allocated funds first get to the administration of the republic and not to the Crimean Tatars. The administration is the least interested party here. Our compatriots from Uzbekistan, for example, cannot sell their houses in order to return to the Crimea, because the legislation of that state is an obstacle. Obviously, Ukraine might somehow, on a bilateral basis, coordinate this issue. It would also be logical if Russia also allocated certain funds for the return of deported people, as it considers itself to be a successor to the USSR. The correspondent's note. On 18 May, Ukraine and the Crimean Tatars will commemorate victims of the deportation. It is a just and timely measure. However, the Crimean Tatars hope that this will not limit the care about deported people. Over the first quarter of 1994, just 36 billion [monetary unit not specified] out of the 148 billion set aside for the return of deported people to the Crimea was received; in the second quarter -- just 35 billion out of 124 billion. Out of the 40 billion allocated for social needs of the victims, only 5 billion was received. A few days ago, Crimean Tatars occupied by force the building of the former mosque -- presently used for storing the Black Sea Fleet archives. They virtually forced Admiral Baltin to make a written obligation to vacate the building by 15 May. So that on 18 May, a rally-requiem could be held in the mosque....
