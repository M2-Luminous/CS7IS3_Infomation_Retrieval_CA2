Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will not visit any country besides El Salvador and Guatemala during his upcoming trip, a ranking official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday [23 May]. The official, who requested anonymity, made the statement to refute an earlier press report that the premier will make a secret visit to Mexico on his way to the two Central American countries. Bilateral ties between Taiwan and Mexico have held stable despite the lack of diplomatic relations, he pointed out, noting the Taipei economic and cultural office opened in Mexico City on May 1. The two countries suspended official ties in 1971. Lien will leave for San Salvador May 30 as President Li Teng-hui's special envoy to attend the inauguration of newly elected President Armando Calderon Sol on June 1. He will then proceed to Guatemala City June 2 for a four-day visit and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.
