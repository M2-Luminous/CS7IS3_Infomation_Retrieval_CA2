FBIS3-65 "cr00000017494001" 26 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-039--JAPAN JAPAN: Study Groups Lay Groundwork for Political Restructuring SUMMARY: Recent Japanese press articles have detailed the mushrooming of policy study groups formed among Japanese Diet members, most of which cross party lines and factions within individual parties. Their reported aim is to both promote political reform and to act as catalysts for the "second phase" of political restructuring. Cross-Party Policy Study Groups Have Proliferated More than ten cross-party policy study groups have been formed since the inauguration of the Hosokawa administration in August 1993, according to the 8 January 1994 SANKEI SHIMBUN. These are in addition to several that were formed in 1992 and early 1993. The study groups have been formed, according to a Sakigake (Harbinger Party) leader, because "Diet members are insecure in the current chaotic political situation and want to join forces with others" so as to be ready for the "second stage" of Japan's political reaignment--the possible formation of new political parties. SANKEI notes that the study groups can be "roughly divided" into three categories: 1) those composed of "conservative centrists" that include LDP Diet members; 2) conservative centrist groupings that exclude LDP members; and 3) centrist members of the SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The paper observes that some groups are not only inviting participation by members of the public, but are also actively seeking to "conceptualize" the formation of new political parties. [See Annex I for membership listings and other information concerning the major cross-party study groups. Annex II contains information on the LDP study groups and Annex III reports on the Socialist Party study groups.] The 1 January 1994 TOKYO SHIMBUN also reports that the study groups are actively contemplating the formation of new political movements. It asserts that "each group" is striving to form a "new- new party," coalescing around three groupings: 1) a party comprising Sakigake, the Japan New Party (JNP), and "about 30" reform-minded LDP members; 2) a party led by Shinseito and Komeito, which would follow the line reportedly subscribed to by Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa, viz., that political realignment should center on two major parties; and 3) a "Yokomichi Party," led by Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi, that will be the political vehicle of "liberal" SDPJ members, and which will be supported by members of the "Democrats," a recently established SDPJ policy study group which includes rightist and centrist groups within the party. Makeup of Study Groups One ostensibly influential cross-party group, established initially by Prime Minister Morihito Hosokawa and others in 1992 to promote political reform, is the "System Reform Study Group," comprising LDP, SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, Japan New Party (JNP), DSP and Sakigake members. It is reportedly led by Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Izumo Mayor Tetsundo Iwakuni, and other Sakigake members, particularly Shusei Tanaka and Yukio Hatoyama. Tanaka and Hatoyama left the LDP in June 1993, joined Sakigake, and subsequently became "driving forces" behind the birth of the Hosokawa administration, according to the 3 October 1993 NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN. This group also reportedly supports the setting up of an independent organization resembling an omsbudsman's staff in the Diet to monitor political reform. On 25 January 1994, group chairman Naoto Kan put together an outline of a bill, specifying that this new organization, "Gyosei Kanshi Chosakai," or "Administrative Supervisory Committee," will include five committee members approved by the speakers of both upper and lower houses, according to 26 January 1994 YOMIURI SHIMBUN. In addition to the five committee members, the bill also reportedly calls for a staff of 70. Another influential grouping, the "Long-Term Basic Problems Study Group," was formed in December 1993 by SDPJ and JNP Diet members. Its leader is Hirotaka Akamatsu, former secretary general of the SDPJ. The group was formed to coordinate policies among members of different political parties with an eye toward a possible tie-up in the second phase of political restructuring, according to the 23 December 1993 YOMIURI SHIMBUN. This group reportedly discusses problems related to the decentralization of power, deregulation, problems of an aging society, U.N. policy and Japan's international contributions, as well as the nuts and bolts functioning of a new political party and its leadership. Another cross-party group that reportedly includes LDP members is the "Forum on Comparative Study of Political Systems." This group is comprised of 21 "younger pro-reform Dietmen" from the LDP, SDPJ, Komeito, and DSP, according to the 20 February 1993 ASAHI SHIMBUN. The group reportedly discusses issues such as the functioning of different political systems, the Japan-U.S. security treaty, and Japan's "vision" of the future, SANKEI notes. In order to deal with the multiplicity of views in Japan, this group reportedly supports a "multiparty system" rather than a "two-party system," according to ASAHI. One large and expanding cross-party study group, the "General Economic Policy Study Group" promoted by Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member of the House of Representatives, has reportedly "created quite a stir." When this group was inaugurated in October 1993, it was rumored that Yamaguchi's intention was to unite Michio Watanabe, leader of the LDP's Watanabe faction, and Ichiro Ozawa to form a "new party." But because of opposition within the Watanabe faction to Watanabe's personal involvement in the new group, Watanabe refrained from joining the group as chairman. However, according to the 3 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, it now appears that Watanabe will participate in the group's activities and will give lectures on issues such as economic stimulus measures, the FY95 budget, and Japan-U.S. economic problems. NIKKEI concludes that such a move by Watanabee could once again stir up speculation concerning a "Watanabe-Ozawa tieup." Yet another study group, the "New-WIC Dietmen's Forum," was established in January, according to the 20 January CHUNICHI SHIMBUN. Headed by the LDP's Masayasu Kitagawa, it includes 30 younger Diet members from the LDP, SDPJ, JNP, DSP and Sakigake. The group reportedly aims to make recommendations on improving social welfare and Japan's information and communications networks, according to the paper. The paper also observed that this forum has excluded Shinseito, Komeito, and the Communist Party from its ranks. LDP-Oriented Groups There are reportedly a number of LDP-oriented study groups in existence, including "Forum To Promote Pump-Priming Measures and Political Reform," "Forum To Renew the LDP," "Parliamentary Alliance To Promote Political Reform," and "Democratic Politics Study Group." According to a 24 February Kyodo report, 20 legislators mainly from the LDP attended a meeting on the same day to prepare for launching yet another policy study group called "Liberals" in early March. Organizers of this group reportedly hope to secure the participation of more Diet members, local assembly members, academics and business executives. The group will reportedly be chaired by Diet member Koji Kakizawa, and will include Seiichi Ota and Shokei Arai. Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi's Prospective Role The idea of a "Yokomichi Party" corresponds to Rengo (Japanese Trade Union Confederation) Chairman Akira Yamagishi's concept of a "New Liberal Party," TOKYO SHIMBUN notes. The prospective leader of this party, Hokkaido governor Takahiro Yokomichi, is regarded by members of the SDPJ rightist-centrist "Democrats" study group to be the "last trump card" left in the hand of the SDPJ, the paper adds. Yokomichi, now in his third term as governor of Hokkaido, left the House of Representatives in 1983 to run for the Governorship, stating that he would return to national politics "in 12 or 13 years." In March 1993, "as expected," he made public his intention not to seek a fourth term as governor, thus indicating his interest in returning to the national political scene. Annex I.
