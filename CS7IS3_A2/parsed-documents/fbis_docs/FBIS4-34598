Athough domestic as well as foreign events have translated into uncertainty in domestic markets, we should be conscious of the temporary nature of these events and not lose sight of the important economic progress we have achieved, Aspe said. During yesterday's inauguration of Banco Capital -- a new institution comprising several banks belonging to the Capital Financial Group -- Pedro Aspe said the banking sector is moving toward universal banking. This not only means that a wide range of financial services will now be offered through bank windows, but it also implies the creation of special market niches and increased competitive advantages in a dynamic market. According to information delivered by Aspe, the new bank will initiate operations with paid capital of 120 million pesos, and its aim will be to offer services to small and medium-sized industries, particularly in Mexico City. Banco Capital now joins the invoicing, renting, and guarantee companies previously held by Capital Group. According to Jaime Weiss, chairman of this financial group's Board of Directors, capital has grown from 3 million new pesos at the beginning of 1990 to 420 million new pesos at the end of last month. The executive said that another division -- institutional investments -- has been added to the existing one -- which in the coming months will feature 280 million new pesos to achieve total capital of 700 million new pesos. Jaime Weiss also indicated that in 1993, Capital Financial Group placed 723 million new pesos in new credit among 3,563 customers, and, should this trend continue, it has scheduled the placing of more than 1 billion new pesos among 1,200 new customers. The new institution will have a nationwide presence and is scheduled to open four branches this year. The services offered will include investment services, consumer credit, contract loans, bridge loans, and nonrevolving mortgages, along with trustee services, foreign exchange and credit services via automatic tellers, as well as others.
