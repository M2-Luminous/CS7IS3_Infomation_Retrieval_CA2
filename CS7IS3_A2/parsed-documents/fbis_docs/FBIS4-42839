Grosskinsky, B. Baeumlisberger, B. Schindler: "The Test"] [Text] For their grandfathers it was a vision, for their grandchildren a bit of reality: united Europe. On 12 June, Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer will decide on the makeup of the next European Parliament. Whom the grandsons will vote for is no secret. The Frenchman will vote for "the other Europe." No surprise, since the descendant of the great general is himself running for this bourgeois ticket that has a strong nationalist bias. Konrad Adenauer will probably back his grandfather's party, which he wants to represent in the Cologne City Council in October. How the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the other German parties will do in the European election has been examined by the Basis Research Institute between 16 and 20 May exclusively for FOCUS. Only three of 26 parties (23 nationwide, the CDU with 15 land tickets, in Bavaria the Christian Social Union [CSU], the German Family Party in the Saarland) can be certain that they will be represented in the European Parliament: CDU/CSU, SPD, and Alliance 90/Greens. The CDU/CSU and the SPD come neck-and-neck when people are asked: "Whom would you vote for if the European election were held next Sunday?" Of the approximately 1,500 citizens in eastern and western Germany who were asked in the middle of May, 38.5 percent opted for the two major parties each. A possible explanation for this stalemate: What the two parties say in connection with Europe is only marginally different. Peace, internal security, and jobs are the main issues. Alliance 90/Greens follows with a clear margin: 8.5 percent. June 12 will be thrilling for the CSU. Because the number of people entitled to vote increased by 15 million since the conclusion of German unity, the 5-percent hurdle is now higher for the CSU. So for them it is decisive to mobilize as many voters as possible in Bavaria to prevent a landslide as in 1989, when the CSU lost 11.8 percent compared to the 1984 European election, even though in absolute terms it scored 216,000 votes more. If, say, the turnout is 62 percent at the national level, but only 51 percent in Bavaria, the CSU will need some 42.5 percent of the Bavarian votes. "No problem," says Ingo Friedrich, the always optimistic leading CSU candidate. "Realistically," he anticipates "45 percent plus x," even though CSU Chairman Theo Waigel has set a higher goal -- "50 percent plus x." Not without reason: For the CSU it may become difficult to get in if, as a result of the many local elections to be held on the same day, the voter turnout is very high at the federal level. There is agreement within the CSU leadership on one thing: It would be a "fatal signal" for the Landtag election on 25 September if the party were to be thrown out of the Strasbourg Parliament. In the 1994 super election year, the European election is going to be a test for the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. With a projected score of 4.5 percent, its reentry into the European Parliament is touch and go. The FDP might still manage to get in again, but there is a serious danger that it will not. The argument that the FDP is needed as a party that can help create a majority is irrelevant on 12 June. Europe's citizens only elect a parliament --not a government. The situation is particularly sensitive for leading candidate Uta Wuerfel. "On principle, I do not make any predictions regarding the election result," Wuerfel, who is one of the very few really prominent German candidates for the European Parliament, said. She knows what is at stake. "For the FDP this election is of particular importance. It is not merely a question of the liberal voice in the European Parliament," but the voters will determine Europe's future course. There is also more at stake for Uta Wuerfel personally: If the FDP were to fail she would have to look for a new job. She will not run again for the Bundestag, and she rejected a position in the party presidium. Moreover, the FDP must refute the downward trend that has been projected for the Bundestag election. The smaller parties and Maastricht opponents who want to mobilize protest voters in the European election will stand no chance. The Republikaner, who scored 7.1 percent in the last election, are currently projected to score 2 percent. The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], which is running for the first time in the European election, stands at 4 percent. All others -- from Manfred Brunner's "Alliance of Free Citizens" to the Instead Party and the "Ungovernable" -- can count on no more than 4 percent together. The Federal Government and the Bundestag, the European Parliament and the German mission of the EU Commission have spent no less than 14 million German marks [DM] to mobilize Germans for the 12 June poll. Not without reason: "In the view of the citizens, the European election is of rather little importance," Werner Langen, leading candidate in Rhineland-Palatinate complains. Langen has so far been the head of the CDU Land group, and now replaced longstanding European Parliament President Egon Klepsch at the top of the ticket, has noticed a "certain tiredness with Europe" on the part of the Germans. Claudia Roth, number one of the Greens, even speaks of "disenchantment with Europe." Yet, the FOCUS survey has not confirmed these assessments. The expected turnout of approximately 63 percent is slightly superior to that of 1989, while as many as 69 percent even said that they intend to participate in the vote. What is more, two-thirds are in favor of a united Europe and regard Germany's membership in the European Union [EU] as "a good thing," even though one cannot ignore the differences between east and west: People asked in the old laender are significantly more enthusiastic about Europe than east Germans (72 and 69 percent in the west, compared to 45 and 52 percent in the east). So is the European election more than just a token election? This is certainly what the candidates would say. Bundestag deputy Peter Kittelmann, nominated as number one by the Berlin CDU group, points to the "process of continual expansion of powers of the parliament since the first direct election in 1979," such as the right to codecision in the lawmaking process and the establishment of commissions, which has become possible since Maastricht. Yet, what SPD leading candidate Klaus Haensch has to say on the importance of the European election will probably play a much more significant role for the Germans: "The German parties know that the election result will set trends for all elections of the year. This is why 12 June is being taken so seriously."
