Several civic organizations in Cotuy called residents to a general work stoppage -- the first of several protest actions planned by the Dominican opposition and in which more than 50 percent of the population participated. According to reports, public transportation was scarce and only a few stores conducted normal operations during the strike. Nevertheless, no serious incidents were reported. Reports of serious irregularities during the elections have delayed the proclamation of a new president. Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate of the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, today threatened to call a general strike if current President Joaquin Balaguer is proclaimed the winner. Pena Gomez declared: "The illegal proclamation of Balaguer would unleash all kinds of protests, including a general strike. It would not be necessary, however, to resort to violence. Peaceful resistance would suffice." He added, "We will paralyze entire cities and provinces." Pena Gomez has repeatedly claimed that the Central Electoral Board permitted "a colossal and blatant fraud" in the May elections in the Dominican Republic.
