In the view of an expert consulted by EFE News Agency, Antigua and Barbuda's decision -- which under other circumstances would have passed unnoticed -- is of paramount importance now because it is the "first indication that the English-speaking Caribbean bloc, which was thought impregnable, has collapsed." Antigua and Barbuda is one of the 13 Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] members that -- according to what Niehaus has said again and again -- had pledged, even in writing, to vote for him. Notwithstanding this, Lester Bird, Antigua and Barbuda's deputy prime minister, explained that the commitment to vote for Niehaus was taken last October, when Gaviria had not yet decided to run for the OAS General Secretariat. Therefore, Antigua and Barbuda's decision is based on the conviction that "his election will further the interests of the OAS in particular and those of the hemisphere's countries in general." According to diplomatic sources consulted by EFE, Antigua and Barbuda's decision "opens the door for a general exodus of votes" from the Costa Rican candidate, who, in principle, thought he had secured 22 of the 34 votes to be cast on 27 March. Bird believes "Gaviria has the best profile" to meet the challenges of the "new OAS." This argument is shared by representatives from several countries, some of whom had initially committed themselves to voting for Niehaus but are now beginning to wonder about the "sense of their vote" given the "specific weight" of Gaviria's candidacy. The shift in Antigua and Barbuda's position irrefutably proves that Niehaus no longer has the 22 votes he asserted he had some days ago. His followers contend nonetheless that "there are still three votes more than needed for him to be successful in the poll" since only a simple majority is needed, i.e. 18 votes. Member countries' delegations also have gotten involved in the scramble for the General Secretariat race between Niehaus and Gaviria by -- openly or silently -- endorsing one candidate or the other. The issue has divided and stirred the OAS to such an extent that if each candidate had the votes his followers claim, the OAS would have 50 instead of 34 members. With barely three days left for the election to replace [incumbent OAS Secretary General] Joao Clemente Baena Soares, Niehaus, who champions the right of small countries like his to head the OAS, stressed in a news conference that he feels he is involved in a "fight between David and Goliath." Nevertheless, he said he has 21 votes that will secure his victory. The Colombians and their followers challenge these figures and, without expressing figures in their support, guarantee that they have enough votes to "be successful" on 27 March. Meanwhile, the OAS has become a place for lobbying and betting where lunches and "two-to-one" bets are rampant in an effort to discover vote preferences for 27 March. It must not be forgotten, however, that the vote for the OAS General Secretariat is "secret," and that anything might happen under the cover of anonymity, even forgetting commitments.
