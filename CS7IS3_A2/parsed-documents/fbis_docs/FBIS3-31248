President of the opposition parliamentary Democratic Party Zoran Djindjic said that the NATO ultimatum "is contrary to U.N. Security Council resolutions and dangerously threatens the peace process" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking at a meeting in Knjazevac, a town in southeastern Serbia, Djindjic assessed that it was evident that the ultimatum did not have any humanitarian or security foundations, but was primarily a tool to "pressure the Serb negotiators in Geneva." "Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must join the efforts to oppose this dangerous and irresponsible policy of the NATO pact," he said. The League of Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia most sharply condemns the by-passing of the U.N. in seeking a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina, said a statement released by the party, assessing that the ultimatum was a "threat to all small peoples and states if they do not bow to the will of the mighty." "As in World War II, the Communists will place themselves at the head of the battle against any foreign aggressor and in the interest of the people they will resolutely oppose Western military powers and all supporters of the civil war in former Yugoslavia," said the statement. The Democratic Party of Yugoslavia sent an appeal to all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to see reason and opt for compromise and agreement by easing tensions at all points. The Party of Serb Unity warned that peace could not be achieved with threats and ultimatums. "If only one bomb falls on Serb positions and homes in Bosnia, the Party of Serb Unity will put into operation its military agreement with the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia and call Russian volunteers to stand in the defence of the Christian Orthodox religion, side by side with their Serb brethren," said a party statement.
