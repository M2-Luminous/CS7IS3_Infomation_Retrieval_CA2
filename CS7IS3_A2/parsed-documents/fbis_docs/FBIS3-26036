Why should increasing peasant incomes take center stage? One, with adequate food and clothing, income becomes the peasants' greatest concern. They will abandon their farmland if over time farming proves unprofitable. Two, increasing the effective supply of agricultural products, including growth in total volume, structural optimization, and quality improvement, is necessarily related to peasant incomes. Peasants now have a clear idea of how much they can earn or lose from what they grow and breed. Increases in output without corresponding increases in income would do nothing to stabilize agriculture. Three, agricultural development in the past often ignored peasant market roles. One of the important reasons why we have had weak market demand is the failure to widen rural markets. The demand of some 200-million strong city population cannot possibly absorb the rapid growth of the entire national economy. To enliven rural markets, it is necessary to increase peasant incomes over the years. Four, by the end of this century, people throughout the whole country, above all peasants, should be enjoying relatively well-off living standards. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed: "The whole political situation will be unstable if rural areas are unstable. Our country cannot be said to have eradicated poverty if it still exists in rural areas." Therefore, increasing peasant incomes is not an isolated problem, but a strategic problem concerning the prosperity and development of the entire national economy. To increase peasant incomes more quickly, it is necessary to take the entire political situation into account, conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central Rural Work Conference, and pursue the following tasks properly: Increase Inputs Into Rural Areas Since the founding of the country, industrial development has mainly been based on a capital base built up by agriculture but conditions have changed. This strategy of industrial development based on agricultural accumulation must change. Adjustment should also be made in infrastructure investment, budgetary financial capital, and credit capital mix. Leading comrades from the central committee and State Council have stressed repeatedly that the urgent needs posed by agricultural development must be met, even if it means postponing a few industrial projects. Increasing input is meant to correct the state of affairs wherein agriculture is getting far too small a proportion of input for the development of the entire national economy. One, increases in credit; two, an increase in investment in infrastructure projects; and three, increases in financial inputs. These are key conditions for maintaining agriculture as the foundation of the economy. Actively Adjust Agricultural Production and Product Mix The crux of the problem for agricultural development is that it is next to impossible to reverse the trends of diminishing farmland and increasing populations and market demand. With these two nonreversals, to increase peasant incomes it is necessary to rationalize the use of available resources and continuously adjust the agricultural structure. One underlying principle for adjustments in agricultural production and product mix is that they must be pursued while total grain output is steadily rising. Last year, the State Council announced the "Outline on China's Agricultural Development in the 1990's" and the "Outline on Reforms and Development of Food Mix in China in the 1990's," which are documents providing guidance for adjustments in agricultural production and product mix and developing high-yield, good-quality, high-efficiency agriculture. The central rural work conference convened earlier decided to pursue vigorously a number of models of high-yield, good-quality, high-efficiency agricultural zones. The State Planning Commission and agricultural and forestry departments have provided specific details for implementation. The adoption of these measures is aimed at speeding up adjustment in agricultural production and product mix. There must be efforts to invigorate agriculture with science and education, fully exploit modern science and technology, extend and apply the existing agricultural technologies with a view to turning them into productive forces. Grain and cotton breeds must be renewed and their strains and quality upgraded to increase returns. We must also vigorously develop the processing, transportation, and sales of agricultural products to coordinate development in the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas to achieve added value for agricultural products and increase peasant incomes. Enlivening the Circulation of Agricultural Products and Rural Markets 1. Bring production and markets together by means of information and contracts. Prices for most of the agricultural products have been deregulated, except for a few such as cotton and cocoons. The main problem now is that production by scattered peasant households is out of touch with market demand. Many peasants do not know what is going on in the market and cannot adjust to market demand, not knowing what to produce, what will sell, and what can fetch good prices. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to provide information for peasants, strengthen the effort to build an agricultural product supply and demand information network, predict and issue bulletins on the supply and demand, and provide updated information for peasants in production and operations. 2. Actively guide and organize peasants to enter markets and build a bridge between production and demand so that the two can meet. Recently, the operating modes, such as trade-industrial- agricultural integration, production-processing-sale strings, firms-led peasant households, and various special associations, are all better organizational forms in which to guide peasants toward markets. We must actively supports these forms. We must break through the restrictions of the ownership system and administrative regions, orient toward domestic and international market, guide the agricultural, industrial, commercial, trading, and technological sectors together to form a risk- and benefit-sharing common body through socialized services and channeling of interests. 3. Form an agricultural product market system and build a normal operating order. To foster and promote a market system, the state has deregulated most of the prices and operations of agricultural products, and pursued the policy of allowing markets to decide prices for agricultural products and different modes of operation. However, some localities have erected regional and customs barriers, preventing the circulation of commodities and the formation of a great national market and hindering production development. A market is a system. We must create a primary-product market for producers and a retail market in sales regions. Most importantly, we must establish various wholesaling markets. Under unified planning, we can establish an agricultural product market system centering on wholesale markets linking up the producers and sellers of key agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, through wholesaling markets and establish legally safeguarded economic relations. Continued Efforts To Underwrite the Healthy Development of Township and Town Enterprises The main objective for developing township and town enterprises is to put the development of township and town enterprises on the track of technological progress and upgrade the quality of labor force. Blind launching of projects and competing for rates should be avoided. There must be vigorous efforts to promote and technologically transform and adjust the product mix and pursue strict scientific management to raise economic efficiency. The eastern region must orient toward efficiency and exporting and adjust the product mix to make improvements in standards, quality, scale, and efficiency. The central and western regions must increase the pace of development, organize the implementation of the "east-west cooperation and development project," and promote mutual supplementation of comparative advantages and mutual development. The development of small industrial zones will trigger the that of small towns and promote the development of tertiary industry in rural areas. Gradually Transfer Rural Surplus Labor One of the causes of slow peasant income growth is the absence of full employment. At present, there is a 170 million surplus rural labor force, representing one of the more outstanding rural problems. Practical situations suggest that it is possible to transfer part of this surplus rural labor force to industry and other nonagricultural sectors. From 1985 to 1988, the country transferred on average about 10 million people each year and 11 million by 1992. In recent years, peasant incomes derived from labor services have become an important source of income. In 1985, the per capita labor service income was 27 yuan, rising to 82 yuan in 1992, 10.5 percent of the year's per capita pure income for peasants. Localities cite many successes in this regard. Leaders from Lin County, Henan Province, led, in an organized manner, peasants as early as the 1980's to work in construction industry outside the province. Riding on the name of Henan being the home for traditional fine handicraft workers, this 130,000-strong construction labor force travelled through Taihang all over the country to earn income for themselves and create wealth for the country. They returned with much information and introduced talents and technology, which promoted the healthy development of township and town enterprises in the whole county. Last year, per capita pure income in the whole county was 792 yuan and is expected to reach some 900. The combined economic strength of the county rose from 44th to 14th in the province's county-level ranking. Experience from localities show that transferring rural surplus labor force must proceed in various ways: One, vigorously develop township and town enterprises. Plans are in place to transfer another 50 million by the end of this century, though this figure can be exceeded considerably. Two, develop and fully exploit agricultural resources, extend the space of development for agriculture and create jobs from it. Three, on the basis of policy coordination, actively create conditions to get farm hands to work in townships and towns. Four, develop in a planned manner small towns, and vigorously develops secondary and tertiary industries to channel rural surplus labor force toward nonagricultural sectors. Continue To Pursue the Task of Reducing Peasant Burdens Reducing peasant burdens is a policy-directed measure for maintaining peasants' production motivation. Since last year, governments and departments concerned at all levels have conscientiously carried out various policies on reducing peasant burdens and done much painstaking work. They have effectively curbed arbitrary apportioning, levying, and financing and reduced much of peasants' unreasonable burdens. Peasants called the burden reduction policy one of the Communist Party's big services for the people. But down on the field, factors that may potentially increase the burdens for peasants remain. Some departments are thinking of restoring some financing and levy charges for some public charities. This is understandable. For a department, the problem is not big. But when all departments are asking money from peasants for different projects, peasants will have a hard time. They can hardly bear all these burdens with their low income. We should all think with the overall situation in mind and continue to adopt effective measures to reduce peasants' burdens. Pursue Well the Support-the-Poor Scheme At present, there are more than 80 million people across the country for whom having enough to eat and to cloth themselves is still a problem. Without this problem for this part of the population, it is hard to achieve the relatively well-off living standards for the whole country. To solve the problem of getting enough to eat and keep warm for this 80 million, the State Council has decided to formulate and implement a "eight seven plan to take on the hardest parts of the support-the-poor scheme." Under the plan, from this year up to the end of this century, the problem of having enough to eat and keep warm for this number of people will be basically solved in seven years' time; and, further, they will have eradicated poverty on their way to prosperity. The next step consists of the formulation and implementation of the "eight seven plan to take on the hardest parts of the support-the-poor scheme." One, a serious summing up of the work and study to put forward new methods and measures for the support-the-poor scheme under the new situation. Two, perfect various policies and measures and increase input into the scheme. The central authorities are continuing with the program of getting the aided areas to repay relief with grains and low-to middle-standard industrial products. The additional parts of such a program concentrate on transport and communications in poor regions to ensure that there are roads to ensure improvements in necessary production and living conditions. Three, management of funds and materials for the support-the-poor scheme must be relatively centralized to be allocated rationally on a regional mix basis, with a view to gradually spending more in the poorest areas in the central and western regions.
