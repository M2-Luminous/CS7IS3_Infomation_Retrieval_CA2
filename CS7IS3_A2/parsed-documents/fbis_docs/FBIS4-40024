"Our task was to ensure practical implementation for the draft agreement on the first phase of the efforts to resolve the Black Sea Fleet problem. We succeeded in opening many brackets in this area. The present round ensured a step forward on the road toward resolving these problems," Dubinin noted. The talks will be continued on Russian soil, he said.
