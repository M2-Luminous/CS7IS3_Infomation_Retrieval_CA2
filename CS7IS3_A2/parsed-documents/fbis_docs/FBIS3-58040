"It is clear, however, that all these points, especially the delicate question of the opposition appointing a prime minister, must be cleared up. As in the past, we remain vigilant," the same source said. "President Mobutu is advocating presidential, parliamentary, and local elections before the end of the year, but for us it is essential that these elections be able to be held under good conditions and that they be free and fair. Only a government of national unity will be able to ensure such conditions," the spokesman continued. "In a country that has no infrastructure or means of communication, organizing elections presents enormous difficulties. At first glance, a one year deadline seems inadequate," the Foreign Ministry affirmed, saying that "this question will also have to be the subject of consultations between the Zairian parties involved." "Belgium will continue consultations with its Western partners as well as with the Twelve. At present, the policy established vis-a-vis Zaire is not subject to change. We feel the criteria of this policy were clearly established by the trilateral approach of 10 December 1993," the spokesman concluded. The approach of 10 December 1993 was made jointly by Belgium, France, and the United States to President Mobutu and Prime Minister Tshisekedi. Motivated by the breakdown of the democratization process and the alarming economic situation, the aim of the approach was to lead to concluding the transition agreements negotiated since 10 September between the opposition and the supporters of the president, appointing the prime minister from within the opposition, and rapidly implementing an efficient government of national unity. This approach was taken at the request of the Western countries by Lakhdar Brahimi, special envoy of the the UN secretary general.
