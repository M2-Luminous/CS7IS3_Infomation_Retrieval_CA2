FR940328-2-00022 FR940328-2-00011 Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for Review ACTION: Notice. The Department of Defense has submitted to OMB for clearance, the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C., Chapter 35). Title; Applicable Form; and OMB Control Number: DoD FAR Supplement, part 232, ``Contract Financing,'' and the Clause at 252.232&hyph;7002; OMB Control Number 0704&hyph;0321. Type of Request: Reinstatement. Number of Respondents: 150. Responses Per Respondent: 24. Annual Responses: 3,600. Average Burden Per Response: 5 hours. Annual Burden Hours (Including Recordkeeping): 5,400. Needs and Uses: Public Law 90&hyph;629, ``The Arms Export Control Act,'' requires purchases of equipment for foreign governments under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program be made with foreign funds and without charge to appropriated funds. The U.S. Government needs to know, therefore, how much to charge each country as progress payments are made for its FMS purchases. This information can only be provided by the contractor preparing the progress payment request. DoD FAR Supplement, part 232 requires contractors whose contracts include FMS requirements to submit a separate progress payment request. This separate request must contain a supporting schedule for each progress payment rate, clearly distinguishing the contracts' FMS requirements from U.S. contract requirements. This information is used to obtain funds from the appropriate foreign country's trust funds for payment to the contractor. Affected Public: Businesses or other for-profit; Non-profit institution; Small Business or organizations. Frequency: Monthly. Respondent's Obligation: Mandatory. OMB Desk Officer: Mr. Peter N. Weiss. Written comments and recommendations on the proposed information collection should be sent to Mr. Weiss at the Office of Management and Budget, Desk Officer for DoD, room 3235, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. DOD Clearance Officer: Mr. William P. Pearce. Written requests for copies of the information collection proposal should be sent to Mr. Pearce, WHS/DIOR, 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, suite 1204, Arlington, VA 22202&hyph;4302. Dated: March 22, 1994. Patricia L. Toppings, Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.
