Researchers at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg are currently investigating a gas-field ion source (GFIS) that can generate particularly fine, highly intense ion beams. This device, called the GFIS cannon, now makes it theoretically possible to produce and investigate structures in the nanometer scale range, with an eye to applications in materials science, environmental control, and medical/biological research. The ion beams are generated in a very high electrical field to an extremely fine peak. A special peak geometry (superpeak) makes the ion beam extremely narrow and the radiation about 1,000 times "brighter" than is the case in normal field emission peaks. The life of the "superpeak" can now be extended to the point where even industrial utilization is feasible. Professor Siegfried Kalbitzer, director of the Nuclear Solid State Physics and Materials Science Working Group at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, notes in the MPI journal SPIEGEL that this ion source has already been able to achieve an image point diameter of about 80 nanometers and that it seems possible eventually to reach a diameter of 10 nanometers. "While classical semiconductor technology currently plans structural elements having the finest structures at 100 nanometers, structures at 10 nanometers will open completely new avenues," Kalbitzer predicts. One first simple application of focussed ion beams, which has already been tested in Heidelberg, is the generation of optical patterns in semiconductors (silicon or silicon carbide). When a thin, transparent layer of such crystals is irradiated with a sufficiently high dose of heavy ions, the ions destroy the crystals in the irradiated areas. the material in those areas becomes formless (amorphous). Amorphous silicon has optical properties that are different from crystalline. When the light wavelengths are right, a clear "bright-dark" contrast, suitable for storing the patterns, is observed. Crystals only reform in an amorphous spot at temperatures of 600ï¿½C. When the ambient temperatures are in the normal range, information can be stored for a long time. Kalbitzer calculates that a beam diameter of 100 nanometers will permit up to 10 billion bits to be written in one square centimeter of storage area. This is about a hundred times greater capacity than the current storage densities. A 100 cm[.sup]2[/]-area disk is therefore able to record a billion data points or a text volume of 100 million DIN-A4 pages. Should it ever become possible to approach the structural realm of 10 nanometers, even far greater storage densities would of course be possible. Ion beam technology can also find applications in micromechanics and microchemistry. The Heidelberg researchers have shown that a neon ion beam can be used to etch fine patterns in thin copper wires, for example. Because secondary electrons, which can be captured on a screen, are released in this process, it therefore becomes possible to observe and even control the progress of microtechnical processing. Moreover, this kind of system permits highly precise cutting procedures to be performed, as, for example, preparative cuts on organic molecular compounds, microorganisms, and all sorts of specimens. In Kalbitzer's opinion, the exposure of photoresists with ion beams would be a very interesting experiment, in that the desired patterns could be written in substantially shorter times through the use of ion beam lithography. This becomes even more advantageous, the larger the wafer surfaces to be described and the higher the structural densities become.
