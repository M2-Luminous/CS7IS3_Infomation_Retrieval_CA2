The issues involving land borders, national sovereignty, and the struggle against violations and seizure of our border and sea-island sovereignty, resources, and national interests are becoming urgent and complicated ones. The activities of various kinds of political, criminal, and economic violators who take advantage of the "open door" situation are increasing and becoming more and more daring and well-organized, with the use of arms and the connections between the country and the outside creating many hot issues regarding the security and order on our borders and the sea. This is the reason why the work of organizing our border defense is playing an extremely important role and there must be a thorough understanding of the task and view mentioned in Resolution 3 of the CPV Central Committee, namely, to strengthen the management and maintaining of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to maintain security and order on the borders, coast, and islands of our fatherland. The need for managing and maintaining sovereignty and security on our national borders in the new situation must be total, with maintaining our sovereignty, territorial integrity, resources, environment, and national interests being closely combined with maintaining political security and social order and security, and defeating the criminals' peaceful-event plots, violations of territorial sovereignty, and sabotaging of security and order; at the same time, we must thoroughly understand the foreign policy of our state in the renovation period, build the peace-and-friendship borders with our neighbors, and open the doors and expand international relations in the fields of foreign investment and economic cooperation. In order to fulfill the above-mentioned task and need and to act on our own initiative under any circumstances, on the basis of our recent experience we must build a strong all-people border defense, maintain national solidarity, and closely combine socioeconomic development with strengthening and consolidating our national defense and security. Now and in the coming years, we must continue to properly implement the government's Decision 16/HDBT aimed at raising the quality and effectiveness of the Border Defense Day; make people know very well the new situation and task; heighten their revolutionary vigilance; strengthen and consolidate the political bases and the movement to maintain the fatherland's security; build the people's security front along with the all-people national defense front; and develop solidarity with and attachment to the people, joint combat and mutual assistance relations between the border defense forces and the people and forces stationed on the borders, and hence mobilization of the country's total strength to serve the task of building and defending our borders, particularly in the situation of unexpected events suddenly taking place. We need to build a more profound and stronger all-people border defense on the basis of developing the all-people strength, the strength of the country and the political system as a whole, from inland areas to the borders, both in the rear and at the front, so as to resolve on a first-priority basis the urgent socioeconomic issues and to build strong border and coastal areas and islands, particularly the highlands and remote areas, which will serve as the base for building the front line based on the people's wishes, the front line based on the people's security, and for firmly defending our national borders. We need to strengthen leadership provided by the ministries and central sectors and by local echelons and sectors, and to mobilize the people all over the country and particularly the ethnic groups in border and sea-island areas for properly implementing Directive 525/CT-TTg on a number of programs and measures aimed at developing socioeconomic conditions in the highlands and among ethnic groups, and Directive 399 CT/TTg on the task of developing the sea-based economy. The border defense troops, along with central and local committees and sectors, are to continue to effectively carry out programs calling for joint action with the Ministries of Education and Training, Culture and Information, and Public Health; the Vietnam Women's Union; and the Youth Union Central Committee and to obtain better and better results from them. At the same time, they must join with the localities in basic investigations of the socioeconomic conditions in border villages so as to introduce there programs of action having important and key provisions. As for the border defense troops, after 35 years of building, doing regular work, fighting, and growing up, they need to develop their proud traditions; to heighten their political capabilities and fighting power in all fields; to do their best to overcome any remaining shortcomings and weaknesses; to continue consolidating solidarity, democracy, and internal discipline; and to eliminate such negative aspects as authoritarianism and harassment of the people so as to strengthen the blood-and-flesh attachment to the people, to correctly implement the national and religious policies, and to turn themselves into strong, well-trained, regular troops capable of properly fulfilling their task while continuing to combine border defense work with socioeconomic development as a means to improve the standard of living and with strengthening of the masses' work as an important political task of the forces. The task of maintaining sovereignty and security in border areas requires that we set renovation at the same level as that of the new need and task. By fully learning from the "consider the people as the roots" lesson, knowing how to develop the strength of the masses while creating favorable conditions for stabilizing their living conditions, effectively promoting socioeconomic development, and achieving national wealth and strength, as well as a fair and civilized society, we will certainly succeed in building a front line based on the people's wishes that becomes stronger and stronger everyday, maintaining national sovereignty and territorial integrity, contributing to maintaining the country's political stability, and bringing victory to the renovation undertaken by our party and people as a whole.
