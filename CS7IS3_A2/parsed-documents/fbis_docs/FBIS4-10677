The governmental Radio Rebelde reported that the diplomatic source maintained that the air attacks could spark unexpected consequences at regional, continental, and world levels, instead of contributing to reaching a fair solution of the conflict. The source of the Cuban Foreign Ministry believes that the path to peace must not follow an escalation of war, not even as a result of a foreign military intervention. On the contrary, all parties should refrain from encouraging this alternative; they should take definite steps toward promoting the success of the negotiation efforts and the attainment of a political agreement that would bring peace to that region.
