Asked about the Army position if the Broad Front won the election, he said: Uruguay "will have absolutely clear elections and the winner will be able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes without any type of limitations." Gen. Garcia was born and attended school in Dolores, Soriano Department. A son, his grandchildren, and his parents still live here. He is visiting Mercedes with General Staff Chief General Juan A. Lezama; General Juan Curuchet, 2d Army Division commander; and Colonel Carlos Silva, 2d Infantry Brigade commander. He is on a routine tour of the area. During a news conference, the Army commander in chief talked about many issues, including military personnel salaries and peace missions abroad. Asked about the draft bill presented by the executive branch in Congress that will allow the Armed Forces to eventually participate in public security activities, Garcia said: "It is an issue that will demand the attention of legislators. They consider it a national priority." Regarding the possibility of sending Uruguayan soldiers to other countries, Garcia said: "In the case of Georgia, so far we only have a request to say whether Uruguay would be willing to participate with a battalion in a peace mission in that country. The government authorized an answer saying that if our participation is requested, we would acquiesce. But the United Nations still has not decided whether it will intervene in Georgia. The only UN personnel there are observers." Regarding the situation of military personnel salaries, Garcia said there has always been a great distance between needs and possibilities, adding, however, that the last budget contemplated a substantial improvement of military salaries, "the most important increase since 1985." The country's economic situation does not permit better salaries, which would be desirable, Garcia said. The commander believes the increase has brought salary levels closer to actual needs. Asked about President Luis Alberto Lacalle's remarks that he had to deal with the internal military crisis alone, Garcia said: "That is a political problem and I think the person who can best answer your question is the president himself. I am not the right person to judge the president's remarks. We have always tried to serve the institution and the country as best as we could from the Army command as well as from all our previous positions." The Batlleist Forum [Colorado Party faction] is opposed to the designation of General Mario Aguerrondo as military attache to the United States. Gen. Garcia said: "It is a political expression. I do not think it is quite like that, but it is within the rules of the game. Gen. Aguerrondo is fulfilling a service mission. He was appointed by the executive branch. There are no legal problems. There might be objections from a political point of view. But they do not belong to the commander in chief's sphere of action. It is beyond his responsibilities." Regarding the so-called "Berrios case" [Chilean security agent Eugenio Berrios kidnapped in Uruguay in 1993], Garcia said the Army finished its own investigation of the case. "The Berrios case is now being handled by the courts. All individuals involved testified. So far no one has been indicted. This is a good indication because it means the court has not found enough evidence to try anyone. I hope the case will be definitively closed, at this level, in the near future." Asked about the possible consequences if the Broad Front won the elections, the Army commander in chief said: "I hope our country will have absolutely clean elections and the winner will be able to exercise the power granted him by the people's votes without any type of limitations. That is my hope and that is what I expect it will happen."
