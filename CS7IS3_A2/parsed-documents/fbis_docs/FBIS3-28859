The official said that the official visit is being made at the invitation of Prince Kromluong Norodom Sirivut, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, and will pave the way for the Vietnamese prime minister to visit Cambodia in March. Analysts say the exchange of visits is necessary for the sake of relations between the two countries following the Thai prime minister's visit to Cambodia. Vietnam and Cambodia are entangled in a great many problems, such as the problem of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia and the border problem, not to mention past racial problems. It is expected that the two countries will be able to maintain good relations for the sake of their own development.
