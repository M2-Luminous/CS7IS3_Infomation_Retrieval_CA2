Of this, exports were $91.77 billion, and imports $103.95 billion, up 8 percent and 29 percent respectively over 1992. The increase of imports was 21 percentage points higher than exports, leaving a trade deficit of $12.18 billion. In 1993 the country took a giant stride in absorbing foreign investment. Foreign investment in China in 1992 was equal to the total investment in the previous 13 years since the policy of reform and opening was instituted. In 1993 foreign investment was double that of 1992, and was again equal to the total amount of the previous 14 years. Last year China approved some 83,000 foreign-funded projects, with a total contractual value of $110 billion; the actual amount of foreign investment was $25.7 billion. Foreign investment in China last year had four characteristics: 1) the scale of investment was further expanded; 2) the proportion of capital- and technology-intensive projects increased; 3) more and more large foreign companies and multinational corporations invested in China; and 4) the area of investment was gradually extended to the hinterland. Businessmen from 126 countries and regions have now invested in China. In the remaining time, friends are welcome to ask questions. [Correspondent] I am from CHINA DAILY. Would Vice Minister Gu please tell us about the progress in negotiations for restoring China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade [GATT]? What are the core issues at present? And does China have a specific timetable for rejoining GATT? [Gu Yongjiang] As you may know, China, a founding member of GATT, withdrew its membership for various reasons. In 1986 China applied for the restoration of its status as a GATT signatory. In 1987 negotiations began for China to rejoin GATT. So far, the China Work Group under GATT has convened for several sessions. During the sessions, the Chinese delegation gave detailed reports on the progress of China's reform and opening up, especially reform in its foreign trade system. In 1992 discussions on the protocol on reinstitution of China's membership began. Hence, the negotiations have entered a substantive stage. China also submitted lists of (?samples) during the Uruguay Round of trade talks. China will ultimately sign a comprehensive agreement on the Uruguay Round and become a founding member of the world trade organization, which may be inaugurated in the middle or latter part of next year. Before the inauguration of the world trade organization, China should be a GATT member. [Foreign correspondent speaking in English with simultaneous Mandarin translation] I am Webber from NEWSWEEK. My question is about the protection of intellectual property rights [IPR]. U.S. officials have hinted the next trade dispute with China will probably be in the field of IPR protection. Therefore, I would like to ask the minister about measures to be taken by China to avoid conflict with the United States. [Wu Yi] China and the United States concluded a memorandum of understanding on IPR protection in Washington on 16 January 1992. The Chinese Government has earnestly carried out the memorandum, and the U.S. Government has expressed satisfaction with the Chinese Government's efforts to implement it. The level of IPR protection in China has surpassed the average world level. However, I must frankly admit that problems do exist in China's implementation of the IPR protection accord. As you know, China is a country with a population of 1.17 billion. To make everyone understand the law on IPR protection, it is necessary to conduct extensive education. As for the measures to be taken in IPR protection, we will first conduct universal education at different levels to enable people across the country to understand the importance of IPR protection. IPR protection is not only the demand of various foreign countries, but also of our own. We also need to protect our own IPR. What is important now is to begin with education on IPR protection throughout the country. Second, we will actively suggest the establishment of local IPR courts in some key cities. People with clear evidence of their IPR being infringed upon may file lawsuits with the IPR court. The U.S. Government does not understand the Chinese Government's positive measures on IPR protection. It is extremely unwise for the U.S. Government to apply pressure. [Correspondent] I am (Gu Yunlong) from the Central Television Network. Minister Wu Yi, China's trade deficit in 1993 was over $12 billion. What were the causes? In 1994, or in the future, what will China do to maintain a balance between imports and exports? [Wu] I think the reasons for the problem of China's suffering, a $12.18 billion trade deficit in 1993 were very simple. One of the reasons was China's high-speed economic development and high domestic market demands; hence there was need to import some foreign equipment and materials. The second reason was the great development of sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises in 1993 which caused the need to import a large amount of equipment and some other materials for investment in those enterprises. Viewed from another perspective, it shows that China is a market of huge potential and that China's market is open to the world. On the issue of trade balance, China, of course, wants to maintain a balance between exports and imports. But seen from a philosophical viewpoint, balance is relative. It is impossible to achieve an absolute balance. The Chinese Government's attitude toward balance in foreign trade is positive. It strives to solve the problem of trade balance through expanding its exports and not through the negative way of reducing imports. Therefore, we say we seek a balance through development. I can tell you that China obtains over 80 percent of its foreign exchange through exports. If we are unable to achieve a balance in exports and imports and if the trade deficit keeps growing, then we will not have much available foreign exchange, which will affect imports. Therefore, we hope relevant countries and relevant industrial and commercial circles will actively increase imports of China's commodities so as to achieve a coordinated and balanced development in bilateral trade. [Correspondent] I am (Anrisen) from TASS. My problem is that, Minister Wu, what are your views on the prospects of the development of the economic and trade relationship between the two countries this year? [Shi Guangsheng] In 1993, the total amount of exports and imports between China and the Russian Federation reached $7.68 billion, an increase of 30.8 percent over the same period of 1992. Th amount of China's exports was $2.69 billion, an increase of 15 percent; and the amount of imports was $4.99 billion, an increase of 41.4 percent. As all know, China and Russia are two close neighboring countries. Both countries enjoy geological advantages. The two countries have a strong complementary nature in economic terms. As long as both sides base their relationship on the principle of equality and mutual benefit and increase exchanges and enhance ties, the economic and trade relationship between us will make further development. [Correspondent] I am from GUOJI SHANGBAO [International Commerce News]. Would you please talk about the effect of reform of the foreign exchange structure on China's foreign trade? [Liu Shanzai] The recent reform of the structure of foreign exchange was crucial to our reform of the foreign trade structure. The reform of the structure of foreign exchange will further expand our export and import trade, will make the reform of our foreign trade structure more compatible with the conditions of GATT, and will make our foreign trade structure more compatible with the operating mechanisms of common international practices.
