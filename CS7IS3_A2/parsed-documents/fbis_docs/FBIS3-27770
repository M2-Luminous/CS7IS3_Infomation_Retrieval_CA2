This move is seen as part of the ROK Government's countermeasures against North Korea's possible selection of T-72 tanks as its main force, said U.S. intelligence sources. Both the ROK and U.S. Armies think that North Korea deployed the tanks on the Western front of the Korean peninsula taking into account the hilly terrain of these areas. They are busy preparing for countermeasures because, if North Korea chooses these tanks as their main force, it would pose a great threat to the ROK. The T-72 tanks were first introduced in 1977 and Syria was the first country to actually use them in warfare in 1982 during the war with Israel. Iraq used the tanks during the Gulf war in 1991.
