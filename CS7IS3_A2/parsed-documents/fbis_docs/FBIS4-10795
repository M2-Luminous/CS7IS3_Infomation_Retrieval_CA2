The editorial states that in difficult and complex times like these, the Cuban union movement approaches 1 May in a period of growth, renovation, and a strengthened role as guide and mobilizer. After stressing the colossal experience of the Parliaments in the Workplace process and the willingness to root that spirit in the life of every work center, the editorial emphasizes the importance of the union leadership's decision to give continuity and shape to this method through the new Assemblies for Efficiency. The editorial also points out that each of Cuba's 18 unions, in a pilot program, will select two work centers in every province to conduct these assemblies. The 570 Assemblies for Efficiency during the second half of April will be a living laboratory to continue down the road opened by the Parliaments in the Workplace. The editorial adds that it is essential that these assemblies be born strong, vigorous, and well-designed because a good start is important to the success and development of this concept. It will not be a matter of repeating the former production and service assemblies under a new name. The main difference is that the Assemblies for Efficiency will not hear worker complaints or requests but will discuss and reach specific accords to boost economic efficiency in every work center. The TRABAJADORES editorial points out that this is not a new idea but the latest economic management methods that have resulted in heightened productivity excellence and set a priority on worker participation, interest, and morale. The editorial adds that the most efficient capitalists have recognized the value of these factors and we must learn to take advantage of them, in accordance with our system. It is necessary to develop the workers' economic information and knowledge and seek and evaluate efficiency on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Along with gradual progress toward linking production and individual and collective motivation, every union leader must focus on the struggle for efficiency. The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that every manager must learn that the men and women he leads are the primary focus of his endeavor. The editorial adds that we are confident this participative formula will become an integral part of a Cuban, socialist, and efficient economic system. The editorial points out that, as Fidel has said, economic efficiency will be a more important result that the streamlining of national finances; thence, the importance of adequately setting up the Assemblies for Efficiency, which will not follow a preconceived plan and to which the quality of management's reports will be vital. The editorial also points out that everything learned in the workers assemblies helps bolster this new effort. It is necessary to personify the Assemblies for Efficiency into what Fidel called the "brilliant economist" -- the sum of every workplace. The editorial closes by stressing that Cuba, the Revolution, and our people need this without delay.
