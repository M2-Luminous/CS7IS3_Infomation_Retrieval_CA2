[Begin Yeltsin recording] I spoke with Ukraine President Kravchuk yesterday. We discussed these issues. I gave a warning and he promised that Ukraine will not use any force whatsoever in Crimea. He promised me this, and we hope that the president, a respectable person, will keep his promise. Crimea is a sovereign republic and it has a right to make its own decisions. And it will make those decisions--but it is vital that neither we nor Ukraine should interfere. [end recording]
