The emergence on the market of such a professional participant, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, will not only bring qualitatively new forms of operation with these securities, but will also become the source of additional liquidity for the still weakly organized market in currency bonds. The "Taiga bonds" (in the terminology of the Chemical bank, this is what the Minfin [Ministry of Finance] state domestic loan bonds issued against the frozen debts of the Vneshekonombank [Foreign Economic Bank] are called) have attracted the attention of banking experts for a number of reasons. First of all, Chemical Bank has the reputation of being one of the most active dealers on the state loan bonds markets of the developing countries. Bank experts have experience in working also with Soviet debts. Specifically, the bank conducts active operations with the European bonds of Vneshekonombank. Secondly, in the opinion of the Chemical Bank, domestic currency loan bonds are very important from the standpoint of evolution of the Russian securities market. A significant volume of emissions, a broad investment base and diversification of repayment terms makes these securities one of the basic financial instruments in Russia. As our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at Chemical Bank, today on the world market there is a small but stable demand for Russian Minfin currency bonds. Specialists at the American bank believe that the market in these securities is in the stage of formulation and a serious quantitative leap may occur only after certain steps have been taken in the development of its commercial and accounting infrastructure. Nevertheless, the Chemical Bank hopes that already in the near future transactions on currency bonds may be conducted through the international clearing systems Euroclear/CEDEL. In response to our KOMMERSANT correspondent's question about what presently hinders the performance of bilateral fixed quotation of these bonds (for now the bank buys them from its clients, setting the price in the process of negotiations), the bank representatives gave the reason as being the insufficient liquidity of the market. They defined the criterion of liquidity as follows: "When at least three large financial institutions begin to announce bilateral quotations of bonds for purchase and sale, and also are ready at any moment to buy or sell the bonds for a sum of no less than $2 million, then we too will join in this game." Commentary KOMMERSANT experts believe that the initiative in the organization of a secondary market in currency bonds will nevertheless come from the Russian banks. Judging by the available information, at the beginning of the second quarter the largest banks will be able to assure the bond market that level of liquidity which experienced Western financial institutions such as Chemical Bank demand. Moreover, the rapid rates of development of the commercial networks of the MFD [Interbank Financial House] and the Cash Union will already by summer make it possible for the banks to conduct trade through professionally organized dealing systems.
