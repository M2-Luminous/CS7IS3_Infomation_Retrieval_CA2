In a further sign of growing business confidence, a Confederation of British Industry [CBI] survey also found that manufacturers expect a strong increase in output over the coming months. But this upbeat picture of economic recovery was slightly marred by new money supply statistics that hint at possible inflationary pressures. The latest figures for notes in circulation released by the Bank of England yesterday, suggested next week's statistics would show dramatic growth in M0, the narrowest measure of money supply. The total value of British bank notes in circulation in the week to May 25 was 6.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Using those statistics, and numbers from previous weeks, Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), estimates that annual M0 growth in May will jump to 7.1 per cent in May, from 6.2 per cent in April. The government's monitoring range is 0-4 per cent. Any such rise is likely to fuel concern that inflationary pressure could potentially undermine recovery, and increase speculation about a rise in interest rates. Earlier this month the Bank of England expressed some concern about rapid M0 growth in its latest inflation report. Although the report said the acceleration in M0 growth had been prompted by low interest rates, which encourage consumers to hold cash, it noted that "the longer M0 grows at well above the top of its monitoring range, the greater the concern about the implications for future inflation." These inflationary concerns were yesterday played down by the CBI. Its latest economic forecast, released today, predicts steady, low inflation, economic recovery during this year and next, and says there is little evidence yet of any pick-up in wage earnings. Meanwhile, the CBI's industrial trends survey, also released today, suggests that price pressures remained fairly weak in manufacturing in spite of the pick-up in output. Although slightly more companies now expect to be able to increase prices over the next four months than reduce them, this proportion is lower than a year ago, and only fractionally higher than in previous months. The survey covers companies accounting for about half of the total UK manufacturing output. Elsewhere, the survey suggests that overseas demand is contributing to the improvement in company order books. Although export order books are still running at levels companies consider below normal, they are at their best levels since 1990, the survey said. Medium-sized companies which employ between 200 and 500 people, reported the best levels of output and export, especially those supplying components and raw materials. But business confidence was high across most sectors, with 36 per cent of companies expecting to see an increase in output volume over the coming months.
