At a time when the country is apparently calm -- a calm fed by expectations created by the new government's search for a positive change in the course of the economy -- Cardozo openly reestablished fears of a rebellion or a popular uprising. In his opinion, "a democratic consensus was not restored" in the 5 December elections because Caldera won the elections by a narrow margin. "I hereby declare with unwelcome dread that President Caldera's democratic election, coming within the framework of a de jure state, is not a point of unity among all Venezuelans because there are still unsavory people who insist on continuing the crisis in the country. For this reason, I urge the government to make great efforts toward reorganizing democracy." Cardozo's position can be summed up in three possible scenarios that could threaten the nation's peace: a self-inflicted coup, a rightist coup, or a leftist coup, without forgetting the possibility of agitation by subversive groups. "I think all three of these elements are at work. Certain economic and social sectors, as well as Venezuelan capitalists, are trying to persuade the 27 November coupists into perpetrating what they describe as a civic-military coup. In addition, the people who had struggled in the Army as a military movement, who later became a political group, and who have now split into two factions with the separation of Chavez and Cardenas favor an insurrectional coup staged by a group of former guerrillas. There are some who say it is best to militarily support the president-elect to reinforce the government in this way." Would President Caldera support a self-inflicted coup? I do not think Caldera would. I know him very well. I received very good advice from him all my life. He used to tell me: Freedom and justice can be attained only through the law. Because of his age, and because of his experience, I do not think he believes such an action would agree with the law. Cardozo thinks the possibility of a coup will become clearer when the coupists who have been acquitted leave San Carlos prison, "because many rebels want to participate in politics, but we do not know whether they want to do this by way of democracy or subversion." According to Cardozo, the best political consensus ever attained in Venezuela's democratic history occurred in 1961 when the Constitution was drafted. A similar consensus should now bring together the government "to reinforce democracy." Cardozo also spoke firmly about "subversive techniques." "A coup is not the only way. There are subversion and dislocation techniques. There are psychological techniques to create conflicts and confrontations with one another. There are demoralization techniques. The government must be aware of this." Cardozo says the government and Congress must act. He says democracy cannot work if the population upholding it is not incorporated into it. The government must aim its actions at resolving problems, such as the high cost of living; joblessness; lack of housing, health, and education; and personal safety. Only in this way can the people defend democracy. "I want to tell you that the worst possible deal is to gamble on Caldera's failure, because the hope aroused by this government is based on him being a trustworthy man who maintains a clear social awareness. If this crumbles, and if this hope is turned into disappointment, those who benefit will not be the system's parties but those who believe that the only solution is one of a rebellious or military nature." Cardozo voiced an already general concern, prevailing confusion. "If there are doubts along the way, it is because no one is clearly showing the way." In turn, he issued an appeal to Caldera, who must reach an understanding with all sectors of the country to restore the people's faith in democracy. "The unification of the political, economic, and social sectors is required if we are to seek understanding. If this escapes Caldera's hands and a fight to the death is unleashed among the violent sectors to see who can protest more violently in the streets, chaos and national confrontation will be so great that they will be difficult to check." Cardozo's news conference only lacked the musical background of the first movement of "Carmina Burana" by Carl Orff, because he finished his remarks with nearly biblical remarks reminiscent of an apocalyptic finale. Although he did not mention the "Antichrist," from his remarks, it is evident he is among us. This is why Cardozo advocated what he called "an alliance for good" for the sole purpose of making it possible for the government to meet the economic challenges at hand.
