The city's planning methods were reviewed for the first time in 15 years since the 1978 release of the Science City Construction Plan. These reports were distributed to each concerned agency as a basis for future discussions on the city's development. The reports were compiled by the Science Council of the organization, which was chaired by Juichi Oyabu, Professor Emeritus at Osaka City University, and investigated by a working committee established in April 1991. The "Academia Plan" provided a research system for science and technology in Kansai Science City. In addition, it advanced (1) research on the foundations of human existence in philosophy and the arts; (2) research on guaranteeing the conditions for the survival of the human race, for instance on disputes, food, and energy; and (3) research on future images of life, cities, and industry which consider the coexistence of technology and the natural environment as directions for the long overdue establishment of research laboratories related to culture and society and future themes the city must tackle. In the "New Logical City Image," the 12 districts that form Kansai Science City and the roads which connect them will be interconnected in a logical system of ancient cities like Heijokyo where the roads were laid out like the squares on a checkerboard. The haphazard progress of building in each district is unified under this "new logic." The objective is for the Science City to give one impression. These two reports written by the organization were distributed to Kyoto Fu, Osaka Fu, Nara Prefecture, the National Land Agency, ministries, agencies, municipalities, and the financial organizations like the Kansai Economic Federation as a basis for devising the grand plan for future support of Kansai Science City.
