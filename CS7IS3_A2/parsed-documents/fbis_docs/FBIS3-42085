According to Mr. S.B. Bhoje, director, Reactor Group, the output would be further raised to 10 MW tomorrow morning and to 10.5 MW in the evening. `Everything is working very nicely. We reached another milestone at 3.45 p.m. today, when we completed 10,000 hours of operation after the FBTR attained criticality in 1985. Much of the 10,000 hours was achieved in 1992 and 1993,' said Mr. Bhoje. The IGCAR scientists and engineers would operate the FBTR at 10.5 MW for four days. Later, they would do reactor physics experiments on the core kinetics and engineering tests on the plant dynamics. With today's performance, there was a bright chance of power from the FBTR being wheeled into the Tamil Nadu Electricity grid in January 1994. The latest developments follow the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board clearance for raising the output after various checks. The FBTR output would be raised to 12.5 MW in a few months and it would reach its full capacity of 40 MW (thermal) in two years, said sources in the Atomic Energy Commission. The FBTR is a forerunner to India's ambitious Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor with a capacity of 500 MW (electrical).
