Interfax received this information from well informed sources in Yerevan, the Armenian capital. The negotiations between the delegations in Berdadzor which is situated at equal distances from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh were held behind the closed doors and there was no official information about the meeting. The negotiations between the parliament speakers of two conflicting republics are scheduled for early May in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital. Our Interfax correspondent who accompanies the mission of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly reports that during the meeting in Berdadzor the parties spoke in favor of the participation of the Nagorno-Karabakh delegation in these talks. Some time earlier Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev spoke against participation of Nagorno-Karabakh representatives in the negotiations. In his opinion, representatives of the parliaments of the Commonwealth's member-countries must participate in the talks. On Thursday the peacemaking mission of the CIS Inter- Parliamentary Assembly headed by the chairman of the Kyrgyz parliament Meditkan Sherimkulov held negotiations in Baku and Yerevan. The delegation of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is expected to return to Moscow in the evening of April 2.
