The situation is reminiscent of the well-known farce that happens every year, when the first snowfall takes the Sofia City Council by surprise. However, the difference is that the snow sooner or later melts, whereas the risk of war is drawing ever closer to our border. The possibility of NATO launching air strikes in Bosnia perhaps represents the greatest threat to Bulgaria's national security in the last 50 years. It is claimed that National Intelligence Service Chief Brigo Asparukhov spoke these very words at the session of the National Security Commission the other day. It is alleged that he even admitted that President Zhelev's stance on the question of NATO attacks in Bosnia has undergone a 180-degree change. One could read this claim in yesterday's issue of DUMA. However, the president, the prime minister, and the chairman of the National Assembly maintain an official silence. U.S., West European, and East European politicians vie with each other in making statements and giving interviews, while the omnipresent CNN turns the tragedy in Sarajevo into a live television show. In Bulgaria, there is silence, except for two statements made by the president on the Bulgarian media on Sunday evening [13 February], in which he described the Sarajevo tragedy merely as an "incident." Zhelev found himself in a spot when he received Demirel's personal letter. It is thought that the Turkish president wanted nothing less that support for the NATO air strikes. They might at least publish this letter, to let us know what is expected of us. Alas, such a policy of openness on issues on which a consensus is well-known to exist is a practice that has been alien for our statesmen since time immemorial. Instead of this, Ms. Yuliya Gurkovska is now concocting Dr. Zhelev's reply to his Turkish counterpart. We will probably learn the contents of this letter from the next laconic statement that emanates from the Presidential Press Center. Once again, rumors and guesses are rife. Once again, the members of parliament will wonder whether they are being sidelined when issues of national security are decided. We have reached the point where Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the Parliamentary National Security Commission, also had to sit down and write a letter to the president to remind him of what our position on the Bosnian conflict has been so far and to raise the alarm that a wave of militarism is developing that may engulf Bulgaria as well. Please excuse me, gentlemen politicians and statesmen, but against the background of a possible NATO intervention close to our borders, everything else should be secondary, no matter how important it may seem. The various ballots, disputes, gang wars, cabinet shuffles, and so on are nothing in comparison with the trial to which we are subjected by the decision of a military-political bloc that some people want us to join as soon as possible, although it is far from clear whether they want us. We should now learn a lesson from the other Europeans who are still not members of NATO and openly declare our official position, and at the highest level, instead of letting various deputy defense minister hint that limited air strikes will not directly threaten our national security. Does Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov think so, too? We must put an end to the lack of coordination in our foreign policy. A good opportunity for this is presented by President Zhelev's forthcoming visit to Brussels, where he is to sign the document by which Bulgaria will join the Partnership for Peace initiative. We hope that when in Brussels, he will express the country's unanimous view that partnership means cooperation in the name of peace, not war, and that Bulgaria will preserve its neutrality as regards what is happening on the territory of our western neighbor. Otherwise, it may turn out that the snow has again caught us by surprise, with the difference that the prospects of the spring coming will be indefinitely postponed.
