At the federal party congress over the weekend the delegates adopted corresponding programs for the European elections and the Bundestag elections. Honorary PDS Chairman Hans Modrow was nominated as top candidate for the European elections. A total of 94 percent of the delegates voted for the former GDR premier, who was indicted for perjury on Friday [11 March]. The fourth place on the ticket is occupied by Heinrich Fink, former rector of the Berlin Humboldt University -- another candidate who has been laid open to suspicion because of his former contacts with the Stasi. Before his election, Fink came out against locking the Stasi files away. One just has to read them correctly, he said, defending his former role in the GDR. In its European program the PDS rejects the Maastricht Treaties, but it comes out in favor of European unification and the creation of a "European Germany." In the future European Parliament the PDS wants to work for overcoming mass unemployment, for equal rights for men and women, for more democracy, and for an ecological restructuring. If it gets into the Bundestag again, the PDS plans to work for the same goals there. At the conclusion of the party congress, Bundestag group chairman Gregor Gysi expressed optimism that the PDS will have even more deputies than so far in the new Bundestag. It will be a "consistent opposition party" there, Gysi announced. He explained in detail how the PDS wants to combat unemployment. In this connection, Gysi called for flexible work time models, an industrial policy by the state, the reduction of obstacles for investments and employment, as well as alternative forms of production. The social division of the society because of unemployment is gaining the dimension of social destruction, Gysi said. Gysi rejected the accusation from the ranks of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] that the PDS is preventing a change in power in Bonn. The Bundestag deputy noted that it is the declared goal of the SPD to block the PDS. The SPD and Alliance 90/Greens are striving for participation in power at almost any cost. However, they are not a real alternative. The decision for the PDS does not endanger the political change in Germany. It is not the Social Democrats that are the "main enemy" of the PDS; the main enemy is on the Right, Gysi said. However, the SPD remains a political opponent. On the fringes of the congress, the former PDS chairman said that he is always ready for cooperation with the SPD on specific, individual issues.
