Security Council to complete a draft resolution on North Korea this week for adoption in two to three weeks' time. Han made the remark at a meeting of lawmakers and local chapter heads from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party held at the Lawmakers Hall of the National Assembly. The foreign minister's remarks are understood to signify that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] would cause the U.N. resolution to be advanced by one week from the original schedule. With regard to China's position on sanctions against Pyongyang, Han said, "Intensive diplomatic efforts to win the constructive cooperation of China are underway. China is well aware that North Korea is accountable for the current critical situation of its nuclear row. "Pyongyang's quitting the IAEA will not affect the status of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). Therefore, as long as North Korea does not quit the NPT, the nuclear safeguards accord and inspection obligations with the IAEA remain effective," he emphasized.
