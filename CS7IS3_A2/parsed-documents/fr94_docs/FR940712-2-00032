FR940712-2-00032 FR940712-2-00027 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;301&hyph;000] Stingray Pipeline Company; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff July 6, 1994. Take notice that on June 30, 1994, Stingray Pipeline Company (Stingray) tendered for filing proposed changes in its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, to become effective August 1, 1994. Stingray states that the filing reflects a base period encompassing the twelve months ended February 28, 1994, adjusted for known and measurable changes anticipated to occur during the nine month period ended November 30, 1994. Stingray further states that the filing reflects the utilization of a straight fixed-variable rate design, an equity return allowance of 15%, existing depreciation rate for transmission plant (3.1%), a higher negative salvage rate for transmission plant (from .35% to .60%), increased operation and maintenance expenses when compared to the level established in Stingray's last rate case settlement at Docket No. RP91&hyph;212, the elimination of its revenue sharing mechanism and a proposal to implement on a prospective basis after final settlement rates are determined an 80% load factor rate for service under Rate Schedule ITS. In addition, Stingray states that the filing reflects the continuation of Stingray's market-based interruptible rate program established in its settlement at Docket No. RP91&hyph;212. Stingray states that a copy of this filing was mailed to Stingray's jurisdictional customers and to interested state regulatory agencies. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures. All such petitions or protests must be filed on or before July 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
