Later this month, Prime Minister Paul Keating will be making his third trip to Jakarta in just two years to promote Australian business. He is preceded by Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, who was in the Indonesian capital last night to launch the biggest trade promotion Australia has yet staged in Asia. Michael Marr was there. [Begin recording] [Marr] The Australia Today promotion got off to a musical start in Jakarta last night where jazz musicians played at the opening of this three-week business and cultural exposition. The two nations, which have had their fair share of disagreements over the past few decades, got enough beat to get into a program and as Foreign Minister Gareth Evans put it, a good and needed ballast to the relationship. And in this case, its ballast is a commercial kind. Some 500 companies are expected to take part in the $12 million Australia Today promotion despite the problems of red tape and the importance of good political connections. Senator Evans argues there are several opportunities for Australian business in this country of 190 million people. [Evans] When you've got a country of 190 million people, almost, the fourth biggest in the world, with a rapidly developing economy as this one has, right on our doorstep, maybe it's simply crazy not to recognize the scale and the opportunity that it represents. [Marr] Has enough been done in the past to expand the commercial ties between Australia and Indonesia? [Evans] Well, there have been a lot of Australian businesses with their feet on the ground now for a very long time and I think their credibility has been important in building the base on which we're now erecting and further extending. I think the government has worked very hard at developing the kind of climate within which business can flourish and that's happened particularly of course over the last four or five years. Generally speaking however, it's important that Australian businesses themselves get out and put the groundwork [words indistinct]. Governments can only do so much. At the end of the day it's the entrepreneurial instinct that's going to win the reward. [Marr] Now, $12 million has been spent on this promotion and it's bound, of course, to promoting Australian business here. Some people have suggested that it would be far better to adopt a direct, high profile, more targeted strategy. Is this going to work? [Evans] What this is all about is changing basic innovative perception. There's still the perception up here that we are a land of mines and tourist beaches and agriculture -- another socially developed high-tech, value-added, capable kind of a society; and that matters when people at the decision-making level, not only in government but in business, are determining whether or not to trade with [words indistinct] or accept an investment or engage in a joint venture. You've got to have a background perception that work for a truly sophisticated advanced country. We know from surveys that that perception is not quite spread about at the moment and this whole promotion is about changing just that perception. [Marr] The organizers of Australia Today say they'd be scrupulous in following up their efforts. Such big time promotions elsewhere in Asia have produced variable results in the past. If that's so, Indonesia need to show some tangible outcome if it's to justify a $12 million budget. [end recording]
