In this situation, the key world community members should take energetic steps and exert pressure to prevent war and restore peace there, the Russian President's Special Envoy Vitaliy Churkin, a deputy foreign minister, declared in an interview with Interfax on Wednesday. In his words, pressure should be applied to both sides, the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems. "There is a war of nerves going on at Brcko, a confrontation that, in principle, could result in a military clash. That is why energetic actions and pressure are essential. What this really means is that the sides should sign an agreement that would end hostilities, disengage the troops, and would enable the UN to deploy its protection force in former Yugoslavia between the two hostile factions," Churkin said. In his words, Russia's proposal to convene a conference on Bosnia with Russia's foreign minister, US Secretary of State, EC and UN representatives to take part aims at putting pressure on the belligerents. Asked when and where such a gathering could take place, Churkin replied, "That may be known shortly. The issue has been discussed by the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his American counterpart Warren Christopher upon their arrival in Cairo to attend a ceremony for signing Israeli-Palestinian accords on Gaza and Jericho."
