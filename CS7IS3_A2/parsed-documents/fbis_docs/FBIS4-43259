It is expected that by the end of next year, 190,000 individuals will have been unemployed for over a year. That is 40 percent of the jobless total, and according to the PT's supervisor, Jukka Pekkarinen, it is a direct result of the government's economic and industrial policy. The obligation to place people in jobs, which was deleted from the employment laws at the beginning of last year, has led to a situation in which more and more long-term unemployed are losing all contact with the labor market. Government employment measures now cover only one out of every five long-term unemployed, compared to one out of every two in 1992 and almost 70 percent when Finland first entered the recession. Pekkarinen points out that unemployment cannot be markedly reduced until the growth rate in production stands at around 5 percent. We will not reach that point until the end of 1995. The researchers therefore feel that in order not to lose one of our most important competitive advantages -- a well-trained and knowledgeable work force -- Finland must concentrate more strongly on an active manpower policy. The institute points out that, instead, the funds available to the labor offices are being reduced. "When it comes to activity related to labor policy, Finland, which used to be at the average level for OECD countries, is now falling behind in international comparisons," the PT writes in its latest economic forecast for this year and next year. No Upswing The institute feels that while an economic recovery after three years of moving backward can certainly be glimpsed, it is still not possible to talk about a real upswing as long as private consumption continues to decline. The research team feels that the government must relax its extremely tight economic policy to some extent, and one of the measures it recommends is temporary tax reductions. The value-added tax, which will go into effect at the beginning of June, should be decreased by 2 percent for one year. The PT is also proposing a program to restore balance in the public sector for the purpose of reducing the structural deficit, recommending that the partners in the labor market commit themselves to low inflation, and proposing that the Bank of Finland take an active part in keeping interest rates down. The PT is somewhat more cautious than other research institutes. According to its forecast, total production will rise by 1 percent this year and 4 percent next year. Exports will grow by 20 percent this year and an equal amount next year, with their share of total production rising to 40 percent. Exports will be the locomotive of recovery, and the export industry's investments will speed up this year and increase by 15 percent next year, the PT predicts. Households To Get Less But the purchasing power of households will continue to decline. It is predicted that private consumption will decline by 2.5 percent this year because households are losing nearly 4 percent of their purchasing power. Private consumption is expected to rise by 3.5 percent next year. Recovery is also foreseen in the unemployment statistics. The PT is predicting that 430,000 individuals, or 17.5 percent of the labor force, will be jobless next year, compared to an average of 473,000, or 19 percent, this year. The PT expects weak trends toward rising inflation (1.5 percent this year), but feels that the threat of inflation is not likely to become an urgent problem before the end of this decade. The researchers feel that the Bank of Finland could very well ease up on its monetary policy without endangering its goal of keeping inflation at 2 percent or less. Record figures in trade statistics are expected to continue. The PT predicts that the surplus in the trade balance will total 44 billion markkas this year and reach 13 billion markkas in the current account balance and then grow to 47 billion markkas and 20 billion markkas respectively next year.
