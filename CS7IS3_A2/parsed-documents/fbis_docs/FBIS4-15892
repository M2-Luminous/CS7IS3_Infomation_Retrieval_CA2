In an interview with INTERFAX in Kishinev [Chisinau] he called the ruble zone "a bluff" and categorically objected to Moldova's entry to it. In his opinion, "today it is unrealistic to talk about the unification of monetary systems. On the contrary, it is necessary to accelerate the process of stabilization of national currencies in all former Soviet Republics." Sangheli pointed out that the rate of the Moldovan national currency, the lei, thanks to financial support from the IMF and the World Bank, is sufficiently stable, and its fall from 3.85 to 4.12 lei to $1 in the past five months was due to inflation. According to preliminary estimates, the level of inflation in March reached 20 percent.
