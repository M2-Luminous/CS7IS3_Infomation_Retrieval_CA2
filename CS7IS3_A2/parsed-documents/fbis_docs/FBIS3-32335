At a meeting with a group of journalists in an unidentified region of the Lacandona Jungle, in southern Mexico, Marcos spoke about the reasons for the uprising, the imminent dialogue with the government, and the issues on which there is no agreement. Marcos said that "there is the risk of the government politically isolating us at the national level. Obviously, this would lead to a renewal of the military option." He noted that "the next time there will be a great deal of carnage because we are not going to perish alone, and we are not going to move to another place." Marcos said that the EZLN has agreed to negotiations (that could begin in the next few hours) because "we owe it not to the government or Manuel Camacho (commissioner for peace and reconciliation) but to the civilian society. We want to sit down and talk with civilian society." Recalling a passage of the Mexican conquest, he insisted that "if the government succeeds in isolating us," the guerrillas "prefer to jump into the river than to surrender their weapons." The subcommander, who approached reporters escorted by armed Indians and wearing a military uniform, his already traditional "sky mask," and a black poncho, noted that "the total annihilation of our forces is improbable. It is in fact impossible." Regarding the dialogue, for which no date or place has been set, Marcos said: "We are thinking about holding it in the city." He added that "we don't want to hold it in the jungle" because "here we cannot guarantee the security" of Camacho or guerrilla mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz. Marcos said that the negotiations must take place "in a place where they (the government) will feel obligated to act properly." He did not discard the possibility of holding talks in the Mexican capital. Regarding the dialogue, Marcos said that the EZLN "has forced" the government to engage in negotiations. However, commenting on the official refusal to discuss national political issues, Marcos said he has doubts about the possibility of the government complying with an agreement. Marcos said that "it is not right for Camacho to say that he is not going to negotiate national policies with an armed group. The government is washing its hands before reaching an agreement, and if there is an agreement, it would not comply with it." Marcos noted that the government "does not want to discuss issues over which there is consensus." He added that there is no "democratic room in the nation" in which the Indians participate. He explained that "it is wrong to think that our problems will be resolved at the state (Chiapas) level." He added that "we know that this can only be fixed if there are changes higher up. Now," he analogized, "they are changing the tree's leaves, but the tree's roots are rotten." He went on to say that "the predicament is not whether to have peace with democracy. As we see it, the matter is to either have peace or war with dignity." Marcos criticized the official decision to recognize the EZLN as "a political force in formation," and not as a belligerent force, as his organization had demanded. He said that "it now happens that the Indians are no longer children but adults in formation," although "they will continue treating us like little children."
