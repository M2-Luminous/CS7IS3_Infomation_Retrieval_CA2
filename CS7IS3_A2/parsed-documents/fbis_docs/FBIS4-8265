The Executive Council supports the adoption of a law to right the injustices inflicted on Jewish people, Strasky said. He said that the Executive Council discussed a proposal by the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) concerning the restitution of church property, currently in the state's possession. The Council had asked ODS ministers and deputies to take a positive stand on such a bill provided an agreement on a limitation or restriction of restitutions of land and forests was achieved and that is was agreed that this bill would be the final one redressing property wrongs inflicted on the Church, Strasky said.
