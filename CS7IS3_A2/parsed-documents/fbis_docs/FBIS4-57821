This alleged plan to reunify the two countries sharing the island of Hispaniola was strongly rumored last week by the partisans of outgoing Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer. In a statement to the press this week, Ambassador Alexandre said he knows nothing about this alleged unification plan. In the middle of the grave post-electoral crisis being experienced by the Dominican Republic today, the pro-Balaguer sectors have set up an impressive campaign to highlight the dangers that would threaten the Spanish-speaking part in the event of a possible reunification. Alexandre noted the cultural and linguistic difference between the two peoples. Nearly half a million Haitians, considered the poorest people in the American hemisphere, are living in the Dominican Republic where they work in the sugarcane fields and live in field buildings. Alexandre adds that he is satisfied because the Balaguer government took effective measures last October to prevent violation of the UN embargo against Haiti, which was reinforced on 21 May. A UN mission, presided over by (Alexandre Martinovic), arrived in the Dominican Republic the middle of last week to ensure that the embargo, which some people use to amuse themselves by violating the Haitian-Dominican border, was observed. Observers accused several Dominican Army members of effectively contributing to the violation of the sanctions by authorizing the free transfer of oil products across the border. These last months, several hundred Dominicans have made exceptional profits by trading gasoline to Haitians, in exchange for household items, slippers, and so on. The Dominicans are closely observing events that threaten Haiti -- whether there will be a foreign military intervention in that country. The Dominican Army is extra watchful to prevent any violation of the embargo and a massive exodus of Haitians to the Dominican Republic, said an official source.
