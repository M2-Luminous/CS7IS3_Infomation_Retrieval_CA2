On the contrary, their number has declined since 1991. For instance, information regarding the work and location of individual departments of the ministry is still being kept secret for the time being. This is what Jan Subert, Interior Ministry press spokesman, said at a news conference yesterday. But, he added, the situation in the Interior Ministry's car pool (amounting to 11,599 official cars and 7,729 passenger cars at present), general information on the arsenal of Interior Ministry members, and the management of financial funds from the state budget are neither secret nor top secret information. "A complex report on the ministry's conduct of economic affairs, containing roughly 600 pages of text, has been presented to deputies," Deputy Interior Minister Jaroslav Kopriva said. "Of all this material, only about 2 percent can be considered secret information," he added. He also said that, according to him, the Interior Ministry's economic management is not unintelligible, but it contains a lot of individual items. According to Jan Frolik, archive worker at the Interior Ministry, the state secrets act applies only to information, the classification of which is in the interest of the state. [The obligation not to divulge] official secrets can also be applied to some parts of the public administration, such as the police, counterintelligence, the courts, or the state attorney office. The Interior Ministry will also consider publishing a so-called white book, which should contain all information about the activity of the Interior Ministry that has not been declared secret. "The coordination of the work between the ministry and journalists could also improve that way," Frolik added. According to Frolik, publishing a white book has proved to be very useful in some Western countries. On the subject of lifting the vow of secrecy regarding various aspects of the Interior Ministry's work, Frolik said that it could be lifted during court proceedings, for example, but that does not mean that the person's obligation not to divulge secrets would be lifted in general. "This person's vow of secrecy was lifted only to the benefit of specific bodies," Frolik added. Press Spokesman J. Subert refused to comment on the question of whether Czech intelligence members are active abroad at present.
