FR941116-0-00099 FR941116-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC09 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reclassification of the Virginia Round-Leaf Birch (Betula Uber) From Endangered to Threatened AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines that Betula uber (Ashe) Fernald (Virginia round-leaf birch) warrants reclassification from endangered to threatened. The determination is based on the substantial improvement in the status of this tree species, which is known from one naturally occurring population in southwestern Virginia. The establishment of 20 additional populations over the past decade has resulted in a dramatic increase in the total population to over 1,400 subadult trees. Betula uber seedlings also have been cultivated and distributed to interested parties throughout the United States and to two foreign countries. This rule implements the Federal protection and recovery provisions for threatened species as provided by the Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: The complete file of this rule is available for inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the Endangered Species Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035&hyph;9589. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Debbie Mignogno at the above address, telephone (413/253&hyph;8627) (FAX 413/253&hyph;8482). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Virginia round-leaf birch was originally described as a variety of the common sweet birch ( Betula lenta L.) in 1918 by W.W. Ashe from trees he reported growing along the banks of Dickey Creek in Smyth County, Virginia (Ashe 1918). The taxon was subsequently elevated to the species level by M.L. Fernald. The round-leaf birch was not collected or observed during the 1950s and 1960s, and was assumed to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1975 along the banks of Cressy Creek, approximately 2 kilometers (1 mile) from the type locality (Ogle and Mazzeo 1976). The general consensus among botanists working with the species is that Ashe probably erred in his original reference to Dickey Creek (Sharik and Ford 1984, Sharik, Feret and Dyer 1990). Since 1975, searches in the Cressy Creek and other watersheds over a three-county area have not revealed any additional populations in the wild. Several lines of evidence now suggest a close evolutionary relationship between the Virginia round-leaf birch and the sweet birch. Both taxa are apparently diploids, with 28 pairs of chromosomes, and isozymes extracted from the cambium of both species showing similar patterns (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). The taxa overlap completely in flowering times, and they are interfertile (Sharik and Ford 1984, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). The offspring of crosses between the two taxa typically possess either the round leaves characteristic of round-leaf birch or the ovate leaf shape typical of sweet birch. Preliminary analysis suggests that this difference in leaf shape may be controlled by a single gene (Sharik et al. 1990, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). This subject warrants further data collection and analysis to determine the species' proper taxonomic status.
