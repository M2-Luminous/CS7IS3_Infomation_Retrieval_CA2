The official's remarks came after the United States House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill by voice vote authorizing the transfer of 17 US naval vessels to nine countries, including the tank-landing ships to Taiwan. The US Navy declined to reveal the lease price for the three ships. "They will be used to replace some aging LSTs (landing ship, tank) that have been in service since the Second World War by the ROC Marines," the official said. Each of the Newport-class ships is capable of ferrying 700 fully equipped soldiers and 500 tons of military equipment, and can sail at 20 knots per hour. Meanwhile, a ministry report released Wednesday indicates the army is planning to procure some new-generation light tanks from the United States. The Army, according to the report, is keeping a close watch on evaluations being done by the US military on three types of newly developed light tanks, including the M8. The Army needs not only medium-sized tanks but light tanks as well to defend Taiwan and the offshore islands, the report says. It also defends the ministry's plan to buy an unspecified number of US-made M60-A3 tanks. The plan was severely attacked when the budget to finance arms acquisitions was recently submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, with lawmakers claiming that the medium tanks would not be suitable for use on the rugged Taiwan terrain, and that they were old models scrapped by the US Army. The report said the Army has no alternative but to buy the M60-A3s because Taiwan is unable to acquire more advanced tanks such as US M1 tanks, British Challengers and German Leopard 2s due to political factors. Nevertheless, the report places the M60-A3 on the same level as the M1 in terms of combat capabilities. M60-A3s are equipped with solid-state computers, laser rangefinders with a maximum range of 5,000 meters, add-on-stabilization systems, and passive night-sight equipment, according to the report.
