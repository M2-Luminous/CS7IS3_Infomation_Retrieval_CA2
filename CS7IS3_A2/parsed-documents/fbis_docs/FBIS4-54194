The coalition announced at an agenda-setting meeting for the House of Representatives Budget Committee that it agrees to the committee hearing testimony by Masatoshi Miyama after the state budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower house. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other opposition parties plan to step up pressure on the government for testimony from Hosokawa himself, which they view as a step to his resignation as a Diet member, opposition sources said. Hosokawa stepped down last month because of the row over his loan from a scandal-tainted company and alleged involvement in the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). The dispute paralyzed Diet proceedings, preventing the budget from being passed. Hosokawa has said the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin Co., and the purchase of shares in NTT were both handled by Miyama. The former premier insisted the shares were bought by his late father-in-law. Hosokawa said the financial deals were above board. He said he has paid back the loan from Sagawa, and denied he was personally involved in the stock purchase. But documents he presented to the Diet on the Sagawa loan were found to contain apparent inaccuracies. In addition, a financial consultant who had helped Hosokawa said in the Diet that the former premier bought the NTT shares himself.
