Iranian President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani said this in a news conference in Iran today. Rafsanjani emphasized that Iran has nothing to do with Ron Arad's fate. He also surprisingly declared Iran will not oppose the Middle East peace process in practice, despite its opposition in principle to any agreement with Israel. A senior activist in the organization of Mustafa al-Dirani, who was abducted to Israel, said in Beirut today that Iran is actively aiding any organization hostile to Israel. In reaction to Rafsanjani's comments, this evening, Israeli security sources said Israel continues to regard Iran and its satellites as responsible for Ron Arad's fate.
