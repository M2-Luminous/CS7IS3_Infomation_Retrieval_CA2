While the Center Democrats fall below the threshold for representation in the Folketing for the second month in a row. An unclear Folketing in which neither the four parties which currently form the government nor the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress Party together can produce a majority. This, according to the Gallup Institute, would be the outcome of an election today. The poll does not show any major shift in the relative strengths of the two blocs since last month. However, what is most striking is that the Liberal Party has again moved forward after being on the retreat since December last year. In December Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) teased Liberal Party leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen that he had peaked too early. Now there is everything to indicate that the Liberal Party has regained its form. Its successes would seem, however, to be at the expense of the other major nonsocialist party, the Conservative People's Party. At the same time the Social Democrats have improved their poor figures from last month. However, the biggest government party is still four percentage points below its excellent election result in 1990. The Center Democrats have, it would seem, still not gotten over their downturn and the split after the Bente Juncker affair in February. For the second month in a row the party is faced with the prospect of disappearing from the Folketing. On the other hand the Christian People's Party, which holds its national conference during the weekend can be happy that it is nicely above the representation threshold and is now in fact as big as the Radical Liberal Party. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Political Index | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Question: How would you vote if there were a Folketing election tomorrow? | |(Interviewing period: 15-21 April 1994) | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |February 1994 |Election (12 |Feb 94 |Mar 94 |Apr 94 | | |Dec 90 | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social Democr-|37.4 |35.4 |31.2 |33.3 | |atic Party | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radical Liber-|3.5 |2.9 |3.6 |2.9 | |al Party | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conservative |16.0 |12.3 |13.0 |12.1 | |People's Party| | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center Democr-|5.1 |2.1 |-- |-- | |ats | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Socialist Peo-|8.3 |8.7 |10.7 |9.8 | |ple's Party | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Christian Peo-|2.3 |-- |2.0 |2.8 | |ple's Party | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liberal Party |15.8 |26.9 |25.8 |27.6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Progress Party|6.4 |5.7 |7.7 |6.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |0.3 |6.0 |6.0 |5.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Distribution of Seats: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Poll |Election 90 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Social Democratic Party |62 |69 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radical Liberal Party |5 |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Conservative People's Pa-|23 |30 | |rty | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Center Democrats |0 |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Socialist People's Party |18 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Christian People's Party |5 |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liberal Party |51 |29 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Progress Party |11 |12 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
