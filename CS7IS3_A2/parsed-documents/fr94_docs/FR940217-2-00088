SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Sanpete Water Conservancy District is proposing to build a multiple-purpose water development project that would provide water for irrigation and municipal use. Water from the project would come from a transmountain diversion from upper Gooseberry Creek and its tributaries which are located in the Price River drainage. Irrigation water shortages would be reduced from their present level of 30 percent to 19 percent. Three alternatives, including no action, are considered in the draft statement. The two action alternatives are: (1) Reclamation's Recommended Plan, and (2) Smaller Reservoir Plan. The Recommended Plan would provide to north Sanpete County an average annual supply of 4,920 acre-feet of supplemental irrigation water for 15,420 acres of presently irrigated farmland and 480 acre-feet of water for municipal use. The service area encompasses about 49,000 acres. The project plan would include construction of Narrows Dam and Reservoir on Gooseberry Creek, pipelines to deliver the water to existing water distribution systems, rehabilitation of the existing Narrows Tunnel, and relocation of 2.9 miles of State Road 264. The project would also provide recreation opportunities and fish and wildlife improvements. In addition to the two action plans and the No Action Plan, the DEIS also evaluates in less detail the impacts of several nonviable alternatives. The principal environmental consequences that would result from the two action plans include: increased crop production, economic stability and growth, expanded fish and wildlife resources, and recreational opportunities. Hearing Process Information Organizations and individuals wishing to present statements at the hearing should contact the Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region, at the above address, to announce their intention to participate. Requests for scheduled presentations will be accepted through 4 p.m. on March 21, 1994. Oral comments at the hearing will be limited to 10 minutes.
