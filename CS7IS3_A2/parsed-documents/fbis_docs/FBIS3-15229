He told reporters that with the coming to power of the Agrarian-Democratic Party which won a convincing victory, there is no ground to believe that Moldova's political course will change. As to the success of the Socialist Party and the "Unity" Movement which were second at the elections, the president said that candidates to parliament from the party, will be able to join the Agrarian Party and conduct the course of reforms. INTERFAX Note: As of Wednesday morning, preliminary results of the elections indicate that the Agrarian-Democratic Party has won 43.7% of votes, the Socialist Party and the Movement "For Equality and Unity"--22% and election alliance of peasants and intellectuals--less than 9%, the Christian-Democratic People's Front--7.35%. This means that Agrarian Democratic Party will receive approximately 55 deputy mandates out of 104 and will be able to form the government by itself, without resorting to creating a coalition body of executive power. Snegur hopes that the new parliament will be able to solve the problem of Transdniestria. He believes that the proposal of the CSCE standing mission which grants Russia the role of a mediator is the basis for settlement of the conflict in the region. Snegur said that he means the democratic Russia. If nationalist forces come to power in the Russian Federation, Moldova will be able to defend itself by resorting to help of international organizations, of which it is a member. The president has favored the unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Russian army and said that it is the army of a foreign state and must be withdrawn from the territory of the independent republic of Moldova. Snegur called the sociological poll scheduled for March 6, a political event of primary importance for the strengthening of the independence and statehood of Moldova. (On that day the citizens of the republic will be asked to answer the question on the prospects of the further development of the republic and the state's policies -- "INTERFAX"). Speaking Tuesday with the leaders of the commissions responsible for the poll in provinces, the president said that it was time for the president to address the nation, the most consistent judge which can distinguish between the right and the wrong. He believes the parliamentary elections on February 27 showed convincingly that the people can make the right choice. The president believes the forthcoming sociological poll will positively influence the strengthening of statehood and independence of Moldova and its results will tell on the adoption by parliament of a new Constitution. Snegur also said that for explanatory activities, about 100 representatives of the government will go to the republic's provinces. Snegur said that 310 thousand Moldovan lei, approximately $80,000 will be set aside from the budget for conducting the poll.
