The Panamanians' selecting him to head the destiny of the nation for the next five years demonstrates unequivocally their great confidence in his levelheadedness and intelligence and his ability to carry out such a complex task, much desired by the citizens. Last Sunday's events and the entire electoral process, in which not a single incident occurred to mar or create a lack of confidence in the pureness of the elections, demands of the winning candidate -- in this case Perez Balladares -- a supremely lofty attitude, above all resentments or wounds that might have resulted from the civic confrontation that just ended. Now, only the official proclamation by the National Electoral Board is pending. We understand perfectly well the traditional political and moral commitments acquired in the Panamanian elections. We know about the political positions that are distributed among the parties and alliances that offer their support for the victory of a person who at a given moment reaches the presidency. We believe that it is an act of justice to govern with friends and with political supporters. Perez Balladares, however, who unofficially is Panama's president- elect in view of the results of last Sunday's elections, has thus taken on one of the most significant commitments in the country. He has ceased to be an alliance candidate and has become -- as he himself promised -- the president of all Panamanians. The emotion of victory must not blind those who were favored by the electors. Having lost must not become a reason for bitterness on the part of those who did not obtain the people's support. The new president must face significant challenges. First, he must face a wealthy opposition, which can only be neutralized through a national consensus that will offer participation in the administrative handling of state affairs to the best men. This situation must be understood by his own party members. It must be recognized that the organization demonstrated by the Democratic Revolutionary Party in last Sunday's elections shows it has capable men who could also form part of a government team, seeking to achieve the purposes outlined in the program announced so many times by the new president. He pledged to the Panamanian people that he would govern without hate or rancor. The bitter taste of the political confrontations must be buried in the past. The experience of revenge, which diverted the current government and which totally disrupted efforts at national reconciliation, must serve as a lesson to the new president. There is a given fact. To strive for this national consensus requires the consent of both political groups that were opponents in the bid to secure the support of the people, as well as those distinguished citizens whose participation will be sought. Thus far, the composition of the Legislative Assembly, which must begin holding sessions on 1 September, is not known. It is important that the president, no matter who or what party is involved, have the necessary capability to achieve harmony and respect their autonomy. This is the only way to promote and achieve the social reality of the programs that must be carried out by the Executive Branch. Perez Balladares must also realize the other challenge placed in his hands by the Panamanian people: implementation of the most important stages of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The people are aware that nobody would be better suited than a student of General Omar Torrijos to implement a contractual agreement that emerges from the very heart of the country. There will be many other challenges that can only be implemented through national consensus. The nation needs a president who will be of all Panamanians, who will assume a genuine leadership, and who will be aware of the historic moment that he must cope with. We always have had trust in Perez Balladares' promises. Those who got on yesterday's horse to spur it and break it did not succeed. With his good sense, his levelheadedness, and above all, his absolute certainty that he was acting in the best manner, he was able to secure the support of the Panamanian people in the purest elections in our history. The country's political circumstances are different now. Our democracy has been strengthened. We dare say that the virtual president, Perez Balladares, will not let the Panamanian people down and that his fundamental objectives will be to respect liberty, free enterprise, workers' achievements, and democracy. For this, he will have to count on the support of all citizens, regardless of their color, social or economic position, or party persuasion.
