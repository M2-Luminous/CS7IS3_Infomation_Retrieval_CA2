He claimed that the president's actions convey a message of no confidence in the prime minister and the government coalition to the voters. "The president will have to provide a good explanation, why the candidates recommended by the prime minister are unacceptable," Adams said. Prime ministerial legal advisor Aino Lepik von Wiren described the presidential decision as arbitrary and stressed that the constitution was not intended to delegate such powers to the president. Riigikogu [parliament] foreign affairs commission Chairman Vello Saatpalu claimed that the president is seizing more power than the constitution allows and described his manners in signing agreements with other states as "incomprehensible." Saatpalu further claimed that foreign ambassadors had expressed their amazement at the vagueness of the president's powers. Coalition Party member Academician Endel Lippmaa claimed that the economic development has been successful and there was no need to replace the ministers. He criticised the refusal of the appointed new ministers to start performing their duties as "excessive party loyalty" and described the situation as a crisis of interpreting the constitution rather than a constitutional crisis. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Tiit Kbin was of the same opinion, stressing that the constitution should have been more accurate about the president's authority in the matter. Former MP Jaan Kross invited the appointed ministers to start working and expressed his regret at the "politically uncomfortable" situation. Environment Minister Andres Tarand described the situation as a threat of a crisis, rather than a crisis itself. But he claimed that the president is not to decide over the suitability of ministerial candidates. MP Valve Kirsipuu expressed her confidence in Heiki Kranich's ability to handle the functions of the finance minister and described the president's actions as "petty".
