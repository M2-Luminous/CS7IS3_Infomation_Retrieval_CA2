The South Lebanese Army [SLA] provided support for the Lebanese Army post. A number of posts in the Jazzin area, Jazzin, and al-'Ayshiyah came under artillery and rocket fire from saboteurs' positions. The SLA artillery returned fire at the sources located outside the villages, although most of the firing came from inside the villages. Our correspondent notes that the saboteurs passed through Lebanese Army checkpoints in a region outside the border strip to attack a Lebanese Army position. Our correspondent confirms that Hizballah's claims that it attacked five SLA positions are totally false. [Paris AFP in English at 0831 GMT on 25 March in a Sidon-datelined item adds the following: ["Iranian-backed Hizballah guerrillas on Friday killed three fighters with Israel's proxy militia in south Lebanon, security services said. ["The three South Lebanon Army militiamen were killed in the area of Jazzin, which Israel controls, during a dawn offensive by Hizballah against eight SLA positions, they said. ["Hizballah said in a statement earlier that it had seized two small forts, captured two SLA militiamen and destroyed three Soviet-built tanks sent as reinforcements. It said its fighters left "several killed or wounded." ["The SLA's Voice of the South radio confirmed the attacks but did not mention casualties. It said two of its militiamen were taken prisoner at Nab' al-Safa, about one kilometer (0.6 miles) outside Israel's self-declared security zone. ["SLA artillery hit back firing about 200 shells against a dozen villages in the Iqlim at-Tuffah range, a Hizballah stronghold southeast of Sidon, Lebanese police said. ["A mother and her son were killed when a shell slammed into their home in Jba', police added. ["On Monday, two Israeli soldiers and two SLA militiamen were killed in attacks claimed by Hizballah and a hardline Palestinian group based in Damascus, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. ["The retaliatory shelling killed three civilians, including two school children, and wounded 24 others including 15 pupils who were on a school bus."]
