FR940627-0-00166 FR940627-0-00019 The regulated industry provided comments questioning the need for a special provision for experimental F/FAs under this rulemaking because a provision for experimental products already exists under existing registration rules. EPA agrees with the comments received and today's rule relies on existing regulations under 40 CFR 79.4(a)(3) and 79.4(b)(2) for the exemption of experimental F/FAs. 40 CFR section 79.4(a)(3) exempts fuels used for research, development or testing, and 40 CFR section 79.4(b)(2) similarly exempts fuel additives. Based on these existing provisions, any designated F/FA product sold to automobile, engine, or component manufacturers for research, development or test purposes, or sold to automobile manufacturers for factory fill, and not in any case offered for commercial sale to the public, is exempted from the registration requirements of today's rule. B. Relabeled Products A company's product is registered as ``relabeled'' if it is simply a repackaged and rebranded version of a formulation which is already registered by another manufacturer and is procured from that manufacturer for sale or use. Requiring companies which sell relabeled products to conduct the testing program in today's rulemaking would clearly duplicate the efforts of the original manufacturer. Thus, under the authority of CAA section 211(e)(3)(C), which provides that the Administrator may ``exempt any person from such regulations with respect to a particular fuel or fuel additive upon a finding that any additional testing of such fuel or fuel additive would be duplicative of adequate existing testing,'' today's rule includes a special provision exempting relabeled products from the evaluation and testing requirements. For relabeled products, only basic registration information will be required, as described below in Section XII.A. About half of the 4,800 fuel additives registered (as of March 1994) are relabeled products. Manufacturers of these relabeled products will therefore not be required to comply with the health and welfare effects assessment provisions of the F/FA registration program. C. Aerosols Several commenters requested an exemption for aftermarket aerosol additives because of the nature of their mode of application and their low frequency of use. EPA examined available data on aerosol products and concluded that the required testing procedures of this rule are not well suited to this type of product. The evaluation of currently registered additives indicates that aerosols include carburetor cleaners and engine starters that are sprayed into the air intake valve of the engine and are used only intermittently and, even then, for only a very brief period of time (i.e., a few seconds). Because of their intermittent use and method of use, it is unlikely that their recommended application would affect the overall characteristics of vehicle emissions. Direct exposure to the aerosol product itself is likely to be a more important source of potential hazards than is exposure to its combustion or evaporative emission products. Thus, the evaluation of potential health and welfare effects of aerosols would require a different testing regimen tailored to the specific nature of these products. Today's rule therefore establishes a special provision for aerosols. Manufacturers of aftermarket aerosol additives are required to provide only the basic registration data required for all F/FA manufacturers (see Section XII.A), plus a literature survey of existing information on their products and a discussion on the potential exposures. Thus, the standard emission characterization and Tier 2 tests are not required for aerosol products. The literature search (as described in Section VII.A) must include existing data on potential health and welfare effects on the uncombusted aerosol product as a whole and on the individual components of the product. The analysis of potential exposures should be based on the total annual production volume data and the market distribution of the product, as explained in Section VII.C. EPA will review the submitted information and will determine if there is a need to require testing on a case-by-case basis. Thus, if testing of an aerosol is prescribed by EPA, the testing is to be performed under Tier 3. Using this approach, EPA will be able to tailor specific tests (as needed) addressing the particular problems related to aerosol product exposure. D. Small Business Provisions
