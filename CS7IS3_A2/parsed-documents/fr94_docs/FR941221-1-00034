FR941221-1-00034 FR941221-1-00012 With respect to other Federal regulation of infectious substances, RSPA has participated in a number of interagency meetings to exchange information on the Federal regulations and identify any duplication, conflict, gaps, or discrepancies. As discussed in greater detail under Section VI of this notice, RSPA intends to continue to cooperate with other Federal agencies to harmonize requirements on infectious substances. With respect to State regulation, RSPA is aware that many States have regulations on the transportation of medical waste, although the States vary in the extent and scope of their regulation. As discussed in Section VII.B. below, Federal law preempts State requirements applicable to the transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not substantively the same as the Federal requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These subjects include the designation, description, classification, packaging, handling, marking, and labeling of hazardous material. With respect to the ATSDR Report, that report addressed all medical waste generated in the United States. RSPA is concerned only with regulating medical waste that contains an infectious substance, and is proposing to regulate only that medical waste. With respect to COSTHA's petition concerning substances infectious only to animals, in the November 1987 NPRM under Docket HM&hyph;181, RSPA had proposed a shipping description for ``Infectious substances, affecting animals only '', applicable only to international transportation (i.e., identified with an ``I'' in Column 1 of the Hazardous Materials Table in ยง172.101). In the December 1990 final rule, RSPA removed the ``I'', making the description applicable to both domestic and international transportation, and revised the definition for infectious substances to include those affecting animals only. This action was taken to harmonize with the UN Recommendations to the maximum extent practicable. In response to COSTHA's petition, RSPA is providing notice and opportunity to comment on the proposal in this NPRM. Conclusion By initiating rulemaking, including issuance of the ANPRM and this NPRM, RSPA has granted the petitioners' requests to provide notice and an opportunity to comment on provisions concerning RMW and infectious substances that are infectious to animals only. RSPA agrees with the petitioners and commenters that the HMR should be carefully tailored to the hazards posed by these materials, so that they can be safely transported without imposing unreasonable requirements on industry. To the maximum extent practicable, RSPA is proposing to accommodate RMW prepared in accordance with other Federal regulations, as discussed in Section V of this notice. Furthermore, RSPA is proposing to amend and clarify certain provisions that are frequently misconstrued. IV. General Summary of the ANPRM The ANPRM was issued to invite interested persons to participate in the rulemaking process by submitting views and information on issues concerning Division 6.2 materials. RSPA asked 29 questions in the ANPRM. The questions addressed areas in the HMR that were identified as problem areas in comments and petitions received following issuance of the December 1991 final rule. RSPA requested information on a number of complex issues including the burdens of compliance with the HMR and other Federal regulations, the need for revised packaging standards, the need to expand or narrow the definitions for infectious substances and RMW, and the costs incurred to manage these materials in transportation. RSPA requested commenters to provide as much quantitative information as was available concerning costs and benefits attributable to their recommendations. RSPA received approximately 54 written comments in response to the ANPRM and 13 oral comments at the public meeting. Comments were submitted by a variety of organizations, including associations representing hospitals, blood centers and laboratories, disposal service companies, Federal and State agencies, packaging manufacturers, and private individuals. In responding to the ANPRM, some commenters submitted views on issues not specifically addressed in the ANPRM. The commenters provided widely divergent views on the extent to which the regulations should be revised or amended. Some commenters believed that RSPA should adopt a ``universal precautions'' approach, as utilized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor in regulations applicable to bloodborne pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030); that is, all materials that are potentially infectious are treated as if known to be infectious. Others suggested that RSPA should withdraw from regulation of infectious substances and RMW, asserting that other agencies' regulations provide an adequate level of safety in transportation. Several commenters claimed that the regulation of RMW was best left to the EPA, even though EPA regulation of RMW ended in 1991. Several commenters provided information on the overall quantities and costs of disposal for medical waste. However, there was not much useful information as to what portion of that waste stream was subject to RSPA requirements, either before or after the HM&hyph;181 final rules, incremental costs or savings resulting from the December 1991 final rule, or even what portion of the disposal costs were the result of regulatory requirements. Commenters estimated varying disposal costs from $0.10 to $2.00 per pound.
