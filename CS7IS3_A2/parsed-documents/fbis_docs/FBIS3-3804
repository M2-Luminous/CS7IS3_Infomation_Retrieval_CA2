During the session you deputies, proceeding from the national interest as a whole and from the fundamental interests of the people, earnestly performed the functions entrusted to you by the constitution. By emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, we discussed state affairs and spoke our minds freely. Consequently, the resolutions adopted at the session fully reflect the will and inspiration of the people of all nationalities throughout the country. This session demonstrated the great unity of people of all nationalities across the country as well as their confidence in the success of reform and development. This session is one of democracy, unity, truth-seeking, realism, and pioneering spirit. This session will certainly have great significance in advancing the socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization in an all-round manner, with economic construction as the central task. This session examined and approved Premier Li Peng's government work report as well as other reports, and adopted the basic policy and fundamental tasks of the state in 1994. We must uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, unswervingly uphold the party's basic line, fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and carry out the various resolutions and decisions adopted by the current session. It is imperative to seize current favorable international and domestic opportunities; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; and to achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of China's economy. We must also maintain political stability and promote all-round social progress. All kinds of work in China must comply with and serve the central task for 1994. We must correctly handle relations between reform, development, and stability. We must strive to push ahead with reform and development amid stability, and achieve social stability as well as the country's long-term stability through reform and development. This year is an important one for China's economic restructuring because many new reform measures will be announced and put into practice. The task will be formidable. We must work cautiously and conscientiously, spare no efforts, develop careful and well-thought-out plans, and do solid work in ensuring the smooth implementation of these reform measures. It is necessary to further emancipate the mind; conduct everything in line with specific conditions; dare to explore new ways; dare to act; sum up our experience in a timely fashion; and properly resolve contradictions and problems arising in the course of implementing reform measures so as to perfect various reform measures. Localities and departments must have the overall interest in mind; correctly handle relations between the central government and localities as well as between overall and partial interests; subject themselves to the state's overall plan of reform and development; and be effective at implementing the principles and policies of the central government in the light of their specific conditions. They must do a good job in publicizing and explaining reform so all the reform measures will be fully understood and supported by the masses. So long as we are united ideologically and work as one, we will be able to achieve the hoped-for goals of reform. It is imperative to strengthen socialist democracy and legality in order to meet the needs of a socialist market economic system and the modernization drive. We must work hard to build socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics, further perfect the system of people's congresses, and guarantee the rights of the masses as masters of the country. It is necessary to quicken the pace of economic legislation and use laws to guide, promote, and ensure the establishment of a socialist market economic structure and the progress of various undertakings. The Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC has adopted a five-year legislative program. We must earnestly organize people to carry it out and attempt to complete the general framework of laws governing the development of a socialist market economy during its term. People's congresses at all levels and their standing committees must increase inspection and supervision over law enforcement; must put a stop to the non-observance and lax implementation of laws; and must ensure that law breakers are not allowed to go unpunished in order to safeguard the dignity of laws, to establish the authority of laws, and to ensure that reform, opening up, and the modernization drive will advance along the track of socialist legality in a sound manner. The question utmost in the people's minds when the session is over is implementation. All kinds of work must proceed from the interests of the people; they must assist in freeing and developing productive forces, in increasing China's comprehensive strength, and in improving the people's standard of living. Government departments and functionaries at all levels must change their style of work, conduct investigations, go deeply into the realities of life, solicit people's views, and be concerned about their well- being. They should never treat lightly matters of immediate concern to the people, and should solve each and every one of those matters. It is imperative to oppose bureaucracy and boasting, and to do away with formalism. We should do away with meetings and documents that do not solve problems; we should never be content to merely issue general calls for action; we must not make empty talk and platitudes; and we must not report only good news and not the bad. More importantly, we should permit no lies. We should perform our official duties honestly and diligently in order to serve the people. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, immerse ourselves in hard work, rely on the masses, and carry out our work creatively. After this session is over, the deputies will go back to their posts. It is hoped you will actively publicize and implement the guidelines as well as the various resolutions and decisions adopted by the session; will conscientiously perform your functions as NPC deputies; will set an example in abiding by the Constitution and the law; and will plunge yourselves into the great practice of reform and construction. Deputies! China is advancing along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people of all nationalities throughout the country must rally closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus; must work with one heart and one mind; must display the spirit of plain living and hard struggle; and must strive to establish a socialist market economic system and turn China into a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and modern socialist country by the end of the century. Deputies! I now declare the Second Session of the Eighth NPC has come to a successful close.
