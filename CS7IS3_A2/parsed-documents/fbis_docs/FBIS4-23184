FBIS4-23184 "drafr104_c_94035" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 30 May South African Press Review for 30 May MB3005123094 MB3005123094 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "That Mandela and Terreblanche meet and talk is good. But what they have to talk about gives cause for concern," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 30 May in a page-14 editorial. "Terreblanche wants amnesty for a bunch of rightwingers who have perpetrated awful atrocities after the current deadline," and "to enter into discussions with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] on this issue is to dignify his cause with a status it does not deserve." Presenting another side of the argument, the editorial states that "morally, amnesty is no more or less right for today's cases than it was for the Strydoms and McBrides." "But we do not believe that amnesty needs to be extended so far as to cover crimes committed after inclusive negotiations began in earnest in 1992. To do so is to fly in the face of commitments given at the time, to cheapen the sacrifice of those who died and to further the impression that life is cheap in modern South Africa." BUSINESS DAY Question of Amnesty Viewed -- "Justice Minister Dullah Omar probably had no option but to formalise the trading of indemnity for information about those events," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 May in a page-12 editorial. The editorial adds that "several commissions either failed to uncover evidence or had it hidden from them, and even the Goldstone Commission has been only partially successful in peeling open layers of deceit." Mandela's government is partialy discussing amnesty in an attempt to "heal the wounds of the past, to allay fears of retribution and to join former foes in building a new country." However, "a willingness to forgive is matched by a determination not to forget; linked to both is the necessity to know why things were done, but whom on whose orders." Concluding the editorial writes that "what Omar has not said is when the process will stop, when the indemnity date, originally set at October 1990, will not be advanced for any reason. Killers must lose their political excuse, and police know that prosecuting criminality is not a waste of time. The transition cannot go on forever." SOWETAN Judge's Decision in Goniwe Inquest Viewed -- "The feeling of deja vu, considering the historic times we are in, sits rather uncomfortably on the half-expected findings of the now notorious Goniwe Inquest," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 30 May in a page-12 editorial. Such findings "were par for the course" in the past. Now, however, it "defies all reason."
