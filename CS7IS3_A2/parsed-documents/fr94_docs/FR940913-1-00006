FR940913-1-00006 FR940913-1-00002 Background and Proposed Changes The Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) was amended December 14, 1993 (Pub. Law 103&hyph;188. The amendments raised the maximum rate of assessment paid by egg producers to the American Egg Board (AEB) from 10 cents to 20 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The actual rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently 5 cents per case. Any increase from the 5 cents must be approved by producers voting in a referendum. A proposed rule to increase the assessment rate in the Order from 5 cents to 10 cents per case was published in the Federal Register on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31174). Comments were solicited from interested persons through August 16, 1994. Two comments were received; one from a major egg producer organization in support and one from an egg producer in opposition to the increase. The commenter who opposed the increase cited the decline in number of egg producers from 10,000 to 400 since AEB has been in existence and that AEB programs have not halted the decline. However, the decrease in the number of producers paying assessments is the result of several factors. First, when AEB was first implemented in 1976, more than 6,000 producers owning over 3,000 laying hens were on record. By 1989, the number had decreased to approximately 2,000 due to consolidations and bankruptcies during a time when the economic situation was poor. In 1990, the exemption level was changed to 30,000 laying hens, decreasing the number of producers by 36 percent. The exemption level was changed again on August 1, 1994, to 75,000 hens, reducing the number to just under 400 producers. The commenter also expressed disapproval that a large percentage of the proposed increase in funds might be used for advertising, resulting in a temporary boost in demand and that such demand would be quickly swallowed up by expanded production. The commenter also noted that AEB has a function in the industry but must remain lean to ensure funds are spent wisely. The commenter expressed concern that AEB not look for budget expenditures to justify the increased assessment. AEB's administrative costs have steadily remained at approximately 3 percent. Further, as required by the 1993 amendments to the Act, AEB submitted to the Department a marketing analysis showing the need for an assessment increase. The commenter was also opposed to the referendum voting rules. The commenter indicated that the rules allow the number of hens owned to give more weight to the vote, thereby granting larger producers more voting power. The Act provides that a referendum vote will pass if approved by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting or by a majority of producers voting if they represent not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced. The commenter further was of the view that the assessment rate should remain at its current level of 5 cents, that producers should be allowed to voluntarily give an extra 5 or 10 cents, and that refunds should be available. The Act was amended in 1993 to provide that AEB may recommend an increased assessment rate to the Secretary. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, AEB has done so, and the assessment increase as proposed herein will be subject to a referendum vote. It is directed that, in accordance with the procedures for the conduct of referenda (7 CFR 1250.200 et seq.), a referendum will be held beginning September 26, 1994, and ending on October 14, 1994, to determine whether producers favor the increase to 10 cents per case as proposed. Section 9 of the Act requires approval by eligible egg producers engaged in commercial egg production during the representative period and at the time of voting. The representative period for the conduct of the referendum is determined to be May 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. For the Order amendment to be approved, it must be favored by at least two-thirds of the producers voting in this referendum or by a majority of the producers voting if such majority represents not less than two-thirds of the commercial eggs produced by those voting. The agents of the Secretary to conduct the referendum are hereby designated to be Janice L. Lockard and Angela C. Clonts, both of the Poultry Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. The agents may appoint subagents to assist them in performing their duties. Ballots, instructions, eligibility requirements, and other information pertinent to the referendum will be mailed to all known eligible egg producers. In accordance with Public Law 103&hyph;188 and recent amendments to the implementing Order (59 FR 38875), producers owning 75,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments under the Act and are therefore not eligible to vote in the referendum.
