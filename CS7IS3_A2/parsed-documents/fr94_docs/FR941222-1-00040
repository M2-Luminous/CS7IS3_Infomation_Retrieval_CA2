FR941222-1-00040 FR941222-1-00008 E. Waste-Specific Listing Determination Rationales 1. Wastes From the Production of Azo Pigments a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo pigments (K162). Summary EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges from the production of azo pigments. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end individual cancer-risk levels for six hazardous constituents that are equal to or exceed 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens or have HQs equal to or greater than 1 for non-carcinogens for the plausible management practice, an on-site monofill. The combined carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this wastestream is projected to be 6E&hyph;3 for the on-site monofill. In addition, a combined risk of 1E&hyph;4 for multiple co-existing contaminants were identified for the baseline management practice, a municipal landfill. Calculated risks exceeding 1E&hyph;4 also were identified from exposure to four contaminants through ingestion of contaminated vegetables or through dermal contact with contaminated soil. Three additional contaminants pose calculated individual risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 for the on-site monofill, and 4 contaminants pose calculated risks between these levels for the municipal landfill. Six contaminants pose calculated individual risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 from exposures through indirect pathways.
