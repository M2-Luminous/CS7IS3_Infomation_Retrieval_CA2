ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.7 and 43 CFR 1610.2, a draft Resource Management Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement (RMP/DEIS) has been prepared for the Caliente Resource Area.

Decisions relating to management of the Caliente Resource Area generated by this planning process will supersede those currently in the Coast Valley RMP and the South Sierra Foothills Management Framework Plan. Copies of the draft RMP/DEIS can be obtained from the Caliente Resource Area Office, 3801 Pegasus Drive, Bakersfield, California 93308. Copies are also available for review at public libraries in Avenal, Bakersfield, Hanford, Oxnard, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Ventura, and Visalia; and at the following BLM locations: Office of Public Affairs, Main Interior Bldg., RM 5600, 18th and C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240 California State Office, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, CA 95825 Bakersfield District Office, 3801 Pegasus Drive, Sacramento, CA 93308 Background information and maps used in developing the draft RMP/DEIS can be reviewed at the Caliente Resource Area Office.
