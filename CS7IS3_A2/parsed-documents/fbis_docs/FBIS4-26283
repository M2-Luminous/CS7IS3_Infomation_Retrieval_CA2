As we landed at Dongmen Reef, what caught our eyes first were the words "Garden on the Sea," which somewhat surprised us. The small garden, whose diameter is slightly more than a meter long, was built with coral stones collected by the officers and men stationed on the reef from the sea. Decorated with coral stones shaped like flowers and deer horns, as well as shells of various types, the garden looks magnificent. Every pillbox in Nansha is like an ocean of flowers. Because of the high temperature and humidity and the high degree of alkalinity on the reef, the more than 20 types of flowers brought from the mainland by officers and men withered as they could not withstand the harsh environment. Only a small common plant survived the scorching sun and began to bloom in the soldiers' emptied food cans. The officers and men guarding the reef call them sunflowers. Before long, the sunflowers were blooming in all the pillboxes. After consulting each other over the telephone, the officers and men agreed to name this type of flower the Jiaohua of Nansha. In addition to sunflowers, other purple and pink flowers, pine trees, and green bamboos have taken roots at Nansha pillboxes. At (Yushu) Reef, there is a path lined with more than 10 green loquats. Cultivated from loquat seeds by the soldiers, these trees are now over 1 meter tall. Compared with the mainland, life in the Nansha Island is especially hard. Fresh water and vegetables, in particular, are too precious. Every drop of drinking water has to be shipped from the mainland. Soldiers once had sores in their mouths because long periods without green vegetables. Some soldiers longed for green vegetables so much that they drew a pile of eggplants with purple color and a pile of tomatoes with red ink. However, these are things of the past, things from the early days when the soldiers took up their duty of guarding the reef. Now, at every pillbox we visited, we could see soilless vegetable plots made from discarded ammunition boxes, basins, food cans, as well as man-made mobile vegetable plots. In fact, this has turned every pillbox into the well-known Nanniwan Production Team. The largest vegetable farm (words indistinct) measured nine fen [a unit of area equal to 66.666 square meters]. The dirt was partly brought here by soldiers guarding the reef and partly provided by supply ships. The soil was nearly one foot thick. No less than 10 varieties, including water spinach, leaf mustard, three-colored amaranth, pakchoi, wax gourd, pumpkin, peas, and tomato, were in full growth. When Nansha's first home-grown cucumbers -- grown by soldier Wang Shanzhu in a cartridge box -- were ripe, soldiers on the reef held a special cucumber banquet. It was so precious that every soldier was reluctant to eat the piece distributed. Nowadays, soldiers are able to eat vegetables every other day, and each week they slaughter a self-raised pig. The pillboxes, inhabited by soldiers on the reef, have also seen great changes. Soldiers proudly told us that what they inhabited were the third-generation high-foundation houses [gao jiao wu]; the first-generation houses had completely gone. We saw some second-generation houses, which were still retained. To build reinforced concrete high-foundation houses, soldiers guarding the reef have worked painstakingly under the sun; some have dedicated their lives. In building the third-generation houses, the resourceful soldiers designed and built devices that could hold water when it rains. Every square inch of the pillboxes was skillfully utilized to ameliorate the shortages of fresh water in Nansha. Nanniwan on the sea crystallizes the soldier's dedicated service to the motherland. The miracles created on the vast sea by soldiers guarding the reef were footnotes to the poster on the reef: "Make the Reef Our Home, Guard the Territory in the Remotest Frontier With Pleasure!"
