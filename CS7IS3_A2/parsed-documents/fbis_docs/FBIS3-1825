Senior government sources said yesterday they were not expecting China to agree to a meeting of the Sino-British Airport Committee for at least another four weeks. The opinion conflicts with Chief Secretary Anson Chan's statement last week that she hoped a date would be set for talks this week. The future of airport talks was clouded last week when China accused Britain of slamming the door on talks on economic issues by pushing ahead with the second stage of Governor Chris Patten's constitutional reform bill and releasing a White Paper on the 17 rounds of Sino-British political talks. Sources said the Hong Kong government was expecting a month-long war of words between the two sides before tempers cooled enough for talks to resume. The government would have to form a contingency plan in May or June this year for the additional injection of funds into the multibillion-dollar project if China continued to refuse to discuss the issue. The latest injection of funds will carry airport works until July this year but an agreement is hoped for before that time. A senior source said the airport would not be completed by mid- 1997, but if works remained on schedule it should be finished about three months later. Meanwhile, Meeting Point leader Fred Li said the government had agreed that the posts of the Airport Corporation Chairman and the Chief Executive should belong to two individuals. A pro-democracy political faction urged the government to devise a stringent mechanism to control the charges and management of the future airport. The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) submitted its last-minute recommendations on the Airport Corporation Bill to Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu yesterday following the closure of a two-month consultation period on the bill. ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong said the government should establish an effective system to regulate the charges of the new airport. He also suggested one-third of the corporation's Board of Directors should be directly elected legislators.
