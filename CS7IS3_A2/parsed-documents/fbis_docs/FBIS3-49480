The House voted 408 to one against, with one abstention. The law covers all types of intellectual property, including video material and computer programmes, and extends copyright protection to distributors and broadcasters. The law also extends copyright to 50 years after the death of the initiator. The law also envisages the creation of a fund for promotion of creative output, supervised by the minister of culture, and financed by payments from material out of copyright, and from a 3-percent levy on audio- and video-cassettes. It is also intended that new organisations will be established to oversee the copyright regulations. Under the proposals, prison sentences of 2-5 years may be imposed for copyright infringements. Heavy fines, and confiscation of illegal copying equipment, are also envisaged. The law now passes to the Senate for approval. When all legislative hurdles have been negotiated, the new law will become effective after three months.
