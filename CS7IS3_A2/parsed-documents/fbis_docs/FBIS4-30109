It has asked Japan to set up an agency which specializes in carrying out intermediary work on foreign investment in Japan and in providing foreign companies with information on loans by the Japan Development Bank [JDB] and other banks. It has also demanded that Japan promote the deregulation of investment with a new agency playing a leading role. The establishment of the new government agency is one of the U.S. demands in connection with the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. The U.S. Government has maintained that in order to increase direct investment in Japan, the Japanese Government needs to find foreign firms which are enthusiastic about doing business in Japan, as well as to provide information on JDB loans and favorable treatment in terms of taxation. It has demanded that the Japanese Government set up a general agency designed to provide such services and to formulate new programs for promoting investment. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government has rejected the U.S. demand, saying: "The establishment of the new government agency runs counter to the current move to promote administrative reform." It has claimed that the United States should set up a contact office for promoting investment in Japan.
