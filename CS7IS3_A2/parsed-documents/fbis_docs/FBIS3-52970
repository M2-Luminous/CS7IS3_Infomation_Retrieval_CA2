This fact is bound to place grave responsibilities upon it, given the serious position it is occupying. Hence, it is peculiar for it to act just like small states, which are content with engaging themselves in tit for tat to avenge old enemies. What is currently taking place shows that the United States wants to enjoy its current position as the world's sole superpower without shouldering the responsibilities this entails. This has been manifested in what is taking place in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Middle East. For the Clinton administration believes that the current PLO-Israeli negotiations are none of its business. What does this mean? Does such a position reflect a serious attitude? This indisputably reflects the abandonment of responsibilities toward the peace process, which supposedly continues to be sponsored by the United States. Moreover, it is the United States which continues to persistently enlist support for the Declaration of Principles signed between the PLO and Israel. The United States deemed this agreement the first diplomatic success of the current administration. What about the White House ceremony? What about the invitations extended for the first donor conference designed to secure pledges of aid for developing the territories sabotaged by the Israeli occupation? It is impossible for Washington to see its role as that of a witness at a signing ceremony as if it were a protocol official. Likewise, no one would expect Washington to say that it has nothing to do with the implementation of the agreement, just because it was drafted in Oslo. It is to be recalled that it did nothing to deter those who called the Palestinian-Israeli agreement the Washington agreement. Many of those who believed their eyes during the signing ceremony still call the agreement the Washington agreement. Does all this mean that the full partner's role is to be undertaken by Norway? This allegedly objective U.S. impartiality reflects a favorable response to Israeli wishes. It is not objective at all. It is true that Washington is still concerned with the other tracks of the negotiations. However, the experience of the past two years of negotiations has shown that Washington, at times, impeded, rather than aided the peace process. If the Arab negotiators are to speak frankly about this issue, they would say that the five rabbis, the U.S. Middle East peace talks coordinators, at times, wanted for Israel more than it wanted for itself. Indeed, the effort required to achieve this objective was not that difficult. This effort sought to preclude any coordination among the Arab negotiators. The conclusion the Americans might have reached in the aftermath of the Oslo agreement is that the complex of the Israelis unilaterally handling the Palestinians has been, at last, resolved without their intervention, and without their having to provide any guarantees. This thinking cannot be classified as that of a superpower. It has to be recalled that all Arabs, be they supporters or opponents of the Oslo agreement, believe that Washington's role was brought under the limelight when the agreement was signed, and that this role cannot end at that. Although this agreement is flawed, nothing precludes efforts to rectify it. It is a mistake to attempt to address a major conflict involving peoples' rights and the sufferings of successive Arab generations with a mind-set that believes that the strong must emerge as the winner, because it had the skills required to seize the others' territory and rights. Such views should not be espoused by a superpower, for we are in the year 1994. What is more serious than Washington shirking its responsibilities toward the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is that international parties will follow in its footsteps. Consequently, the agreement will fail to enjoy international recognition. We have seen signs of this eventuality. Washington might have failed to see the negative impact of its position. No harm would be done if we remind it that the Arabs were expected to bear heavy burdens for peace. What then would be the consequences of sabotaging an agreement that was concluded out of despair in the first place? Has Washington thought of this, or is it not interested in this, either? It is hoped that the United States will pursue historic solutions on the remaining tracks, instead of seeking to force settlements and take advantage of adverse circumstances. For if it does, it, as a superpower, can then give its ally, Israel, a model to be emulated. That is, it can produce true peace. For, this is better than encouraging Israel to employ tricks that only befit war criminals.
