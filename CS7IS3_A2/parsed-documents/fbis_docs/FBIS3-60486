He announced plans to considerably expand information activities and to coordinate the individual measures in Austria to a greater extent. Thus, 18 million schillings will be available for a broad information campaign on AIDS in 1994 (10 million in 1993). The funds for AIDS relief organization and other institutions will be increased from 31.8 million (1993) to 35 million schillings. The minister described the current situation as follows: "By the end of November a total of 1,077 persons had developed AIDS, and 667 thereof had died. The number of those infected with the HIV virus in Austria is estimated at 10,000 to 15,000. It is assumed that one to two persons are newly infected every day." There is no complete therapy for those who have developed the disease. Realistically, one must proceed from the premise that there will be no vaccine against AIDS by the year 2000. The minister estimated the costs for the treatment of a person who has developed AIDS at 1 to 1.5 million schillings. [passage omitted]
