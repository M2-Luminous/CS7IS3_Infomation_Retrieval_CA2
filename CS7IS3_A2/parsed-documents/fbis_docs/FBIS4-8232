FBIS4-8232 "dreeu070_y_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal Calls For `Equal Treatment' Calls For `Equal Treatment' LD1104163394 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1609 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104163394 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Government on Monday [11 April] most energetically condemned the United Nations decision to engage NATO forces to air raid the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) in the area of Gorazde, and qualified the decision as direct involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Muslims. At a session devoted to the latest development, the Yugoslav Government took the stand that the world organization had assumed the role of a side in conflict and, thereby, set a dangerous precedent which could have far-reaching consequences, the released federal government statement said. The Yugoslav Government underscored that the U.N. had taken the decision on the air strike without previously fulfilling the assumed obligation to demilitarize Gorazde, and that it had, moreover, tolerated the planning and carrying out of the Muslim offensive operations from the U.N.-proclaimed "safe area" of Gorazde on Bosnian Serb positions around that town. Gorazde and five other towns in Bosnia-Herzegovina were proclaimed "safe areas" by the U.N. last spring, upon which they were supposed to be demilitarized. However, Gorazde was used in late March this year for an attack on the Bosnian Serb positions around the town. Around 10,000 Muslim troops were engaged in the atack. The fighting in the area of Gorazde has been provoked by the Muslim side, both according to Bosnian Serb military sources and reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Muslim attack from Gorazde was launched as part of an all-out Muslim spring offensive, with a view to winning territories before the internationally brokered peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina resume. It was only after the Muslim spring offensive failed that the U.N. remembered that Gorazde was a U.N.-protected "safe area" and invited NATO bombers to raid the Muslim-attacked Serb side, the federal government said. "It is regrettable that precisely the United Nations, the organization duty-bound by its charter to preserve peace and international security, has taken a step which threatens the peace process and causes an escalation of war, the [words indistinct] has seriously discredited itself as a peace force in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and assumed the responsibility for all the consequences of possible further uncontrolled developments," the federal government said. The Yugoslav Government reiterated that "the way out of the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina is not the policy of double standards and the siding of the world organization or other factors with any side whatsoever in the Bosnian civil war, but it is in equal treatment of all warring parties and impartial and unselfish assistance to the peace process." "Each and every departure from this principle serves only to strengthen the Muslim side in its conviction that by persistently sabotaging peace efforts and by continuing military hostilities it can win the civil war," the Yugoslav Government statement said. The Yugoslav Government called on the U.N. immediately to abandon the "irresponsible and dangerous policy of joining in the war on the side of the Muslims" and to strive for peace and an immediate, unconditional and lasting end to the war. The Yugoslav Government reiterated its continued commitment to a "principled and peaceful policy in the solution of the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," and said that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would continue to lend the necessary support to all constructive efforts aimed at reducing the current tensions, effecting an unconditional and lasting cessation of hostilities, and achieving a comprehensive and equitable political solution to the crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.
