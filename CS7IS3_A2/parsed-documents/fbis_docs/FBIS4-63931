Speaking on behalf of the "rebel" MPs, Tofik Gasymov, who had been foreign minister under the Elchibey regime, explained that their decision to return to the meeting hall was taken in order "not to provide any more reason to the authorities for slander and blackmail." However, he stated, the group of MPs he represents remain of the same opinion. "We are against not only the Bishkek protocol, but also the introduction of Russian troops into the region in the guise of CIS peace-making forces," he stressed. The Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict should be settled, in his view, within the framework of the United Nations and the CSCE. He also feels that to solve this complex problem it is necessary to return to the trilateral peace initiative of Russia, Turkey, and the United States. As for separation forces and international observers, the MP is convinced that they can be brought in and stationed in the conflict zone, but only after the appropriate decision by the UN Security Council. More hardline was the speech by Etibar Mammadov, the leader of the influential opposition party--National Independence of Azerbaijan--who announced his resignation as a member of the National Assembly. According to his assertion, over recent days the republic has seen a campaign of blackmail unfolding against the opposition, which differs from the authorities in approaches to settling the conflict.
