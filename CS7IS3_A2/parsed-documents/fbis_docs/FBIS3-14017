FBIS3-14017 "drnes055__s94067" FBIS-NES-94-055-S Document Type:Daily Report 10 Mar 1994 INDIAN VIEWS Official Statement, Opposition Response to Kashmir Resolution BK1103010694 Delhi All India Radio Network in English 1530 GMT 10 Mar 94 BK1103010694 Delhi All India Radio Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] New Delhi says Pakistan's withdrawal of its resolution in Geneva is unconditional, and there is no question of linking it with sending of a fact-finding mission to Kashmir. The foreign secretary, Mr. Srinivasan, told a crowded press conference in New Delhi today that India sought an early vote on the resolution as it was confident that the resolution will be defeated. While reaffirming India's readiness to continue dialogue with Pakistan, he said there is no scope for Iran or any other country to mediate on this issue. He said Pakistan has failed in its third attempt to raise the issue in the international fora. Mr. Srinivasan hoped that Islamabad will now embark on a more constructive path of a bilateral dialogue to settle the issues with India. On the Iranian ambassador's suggestion at Geneva for sending a group of ambassadors from Muslim countries to visit Kashmir, the foreign secretary said it cannot be termed as an international fact-finding mission. This facility is already available as no prior permission is needed for all New Delhi-based ambassadors except Pakistan and Libya. He pointed out that a team of 10 ambassadors had been to Jammu and Kashmir. They included four members of the Organization of Islamic Countries. Mr. Srinivasan also said that there is automatic deferment of the Pakistani resolution to the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission as once the resolution is withdrawn, it has to start the process anew. He said 15 countries specifically asked Pakistan to withdraw its resolution after a brief postponement of voting, and five of them wanted India and Pakistan to continue their bilateral dialogue. He said the Indian delegation had done a good job in Geneva. Replying to a question, he said the time is not yet ripe for permitting Amnesty International delegation to visit Kashmir as its report on the Bombay blast was biased. All the major political parties have expressed happiness and satisfaction over the outcome of the Pakistani resolution in Geneva yesterday. The Congess(I) spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, described Islambad's withdrawal of the resolution as a diplomatic success for India. The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Murli Manohar Joshi, congratulating the Indian delegation, urged the government to take firm action to curb militancy in the valley. The CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] General Secretary, Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, expressing satisfaction over yesterday's happenings in Geneva, has called upon the government to find a political solution to the Kashmir issue. In a statement in New Delhi today, the National Executive of the CPI has asked Pakistan to refrain from internationalizing the Kashmir issue and make an honest effort to resolve it within the framework of the Shimla Agreement. *
