FR940216-0-00129 FR940216-0-00010 Various commenters objected to the proposal that refiners would be presumptively liable for downstream violations, including those found at downstream facilities that display the refiner's brand name. One commenter stated that the proposed regulations would impose an irrebuttable presumption of liability in violation of the Due Process clause of the Constitution and Amoco Oil Co. v. EPA, 501 F.2d 722 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (`` Amoco I '') and Amoco II. The commenter claimed that the presumption was in practice irrebuttable due to product fungibility and the very high cost of testing required to avoid liability. The commenter also observed that refiners lack sufficient control over downstream parties to lawfully impose vicarious liability on the refiner, in part due to the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. EPA disagrees. The defense elements established in the final rule set forth reasonably attainable criteria to rebut a presumption of liability for violations detected downstream of a refinery. The final rule provides that refiners must demonstrate: (1) That the refiner did not cause the violation; (2) that product transfer documents account for all of the gasoline found in violation and indicate that the gasoline met relevant requirements; and (3) that the refinery has conducted a quality assurance sampling and testing program. Where the violation is found at a facility carrying the refiner's brand name, the refiner must show, in addition, that the violation was caused by: (1) An act in violation of law; (2) or an action in violation of a contractual obligation imposed by the refiner; or, (3) the action of a carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for the transportation of gasoline, despite specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner reasonably calculated to prevent such action. Addressing the above defense elements seriatim, EPA believes the information necessary to demonstrate that the refiner did not cause a violation determined downstream is reasonably within the control of a refiner through review of its production testing and shipping records. Further, refineries may reasonably provide in contracts with downstream parties for the refiner to conduct quality assurance sampling and testing at the downstream facility. Such testing would be limited to determining that maximum/ minimum and other applicable standards are met. Branded refiners, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble, are held to a more stringent standard for establishing a defense to downstream violations due to the enhanced control such refiners have over branded downstream parties. First, EPA anticipates that a brand refiner is able to exercise sufficient control over its downstream affiliates so as to prevent any violation other than one arising from a violation of law (other than a violation of this final rule). EPA also anticipates that a branded refiner will possess contractual leverage to be able to impose contractual obligations on downstream parties necessary to assure that violations will not occur under the terms of the contract. Finally, EPA anticipates that a brand refiner will possess contractual leverage to impose handling requirements on non-brand carriers or other distributors not subject to the refiner's brand but engaged by the refiner for the transportation of gasoline, and to allow specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner reasonably calculated to prevent such action. As with branded downstream parties, EPA believes that a conservative quality assurance program will deter violations downstream of the refiner by creating an atmosphere of oversight presence and quality assurance by the refiner. Further, EPA believes that quality assurance is in the refiner's self-interest in guaranteeing the quality of its product in the market. One commenter suggested that downstream quality assurance requirements might adversely affect the positions of independent distributors by allowing branded refiners to tighten up on contracts with the independents and force them out of the market. However, EPA believes that most distributors will conduct quality assurance programs regardless of any involvement by branded refiners, because of the distributor's potential for liability for violations that exists independent of the refiner's liability, and because most distributors are concerned about product quality for reasons that are independent of the reformulated gasoline requirements. As a result, EPA does not believe that contractual provisions requiring quality assurance imposed by branded refiners constitute a significant additional burden on distributors. Moreover, the defense provisions related to branded refiners requires contracts only with branded resellers or retailers. As a result, refiners are not required to impose contractual quality assurance provisions on distributors who are not identified with the refiner's brand name.
