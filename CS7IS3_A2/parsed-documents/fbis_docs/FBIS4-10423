One of the trip's main objectives was to renegotiate Cuba's $33-million debt with Uruguay. Robaina believes that his contacts with the highest-ranking government and banking authorities, entrepreneurs, and businessmen, was a first step toward the solution of this problem. To this end Robaina explained his government's policies regarding the opening to foreign capital as one more alternative in facing Cuba's current economic difficulties. The main idea behind this decision is to attract capital, technologies, and markets in certain branches such as tourism, oil, nickel, communications, science, and others, according to his explanation in interviews. During the next few months entrepreneurs and businessmen will travel to Havana, invited by Robaina, to explore investment possibilities. The other purpose behind Robaina's stay in Montevideo is to explain Cuba's situation, especially following the end of the socialist bloc and a stepped-up U.S.-imposed economic, trade, and financial blockade, which has been in force for more than three decades. Regarding this, Robaina referred to the efforts of Cubans to face the adversities and find solutions through the common resolve to increase production and exports. The local media highlighted the visit of the head of Cuban diplomacy with a balance that could be considered favorable to Cuba's interests, according to observers. Tomorrow, Foreign Minister Robaina and his retinue will make a technical stopover in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where they will spend all day. Television, radio, and newspaper reporters will take advantage of this to obtain exclusive interviews, which are already planned, according to Cuban delegation sources. By dawn on Saturday, Robaina will begin his official visit to Peru, the second stage of his South American tour, which will be followed by visits to Argentina and Paraguay.
