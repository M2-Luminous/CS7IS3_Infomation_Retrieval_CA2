Ageyeva: "R50,000--Is This a Lot or Not? What the Ordinary Taxpayer Needs To Know About the Nebulous Concepts of the Budget"] [Text] As reported, several items on the agenda of the Supreme Soviet session involve the social sphere, that is, your pocketbook and mine: on changes to the program of targeted social support for the population, and the draft laws on the minimum wage. Debates on this topic began even before the session. We have reported that the Supreme Soviet's Planning, Budget, and Finance Commission did not support the draft on the minimum wage on the grounds that it "requires additional consideration and the introduction of companion acts not only from the standpoint of the budget, but also from the angle of affecting the situation and interests of industrial enterprises, first and foremost in the defense industry." A few figures from the commission's conclusions: In the event of shifting to a R50,000 minimum wage, expenditures on sectors financed from the Tatarstan budget will amount to R100 billion over seven months; additional payments to institutions of higher learning and vocational secondary schools--R35 billion; and the republic social protection fund's expenditures will increase by more than 10 billion. There is an opinion that the government, which proposes to raise the minimum wage, is an interested party, because in this case there will be an increase in budget revenue from various duties which today are pegged to the minimum wage. However, the deputy commission came to the opposite conclusion: The tax base will shrink, resulting in a loss of approximately R200 billion. Thus, additional expenditures and losses will amount to R350 billion, or R50 billion a month. The actual state of the budget shows that real revenue will amount to R80 billion a month on average. Undoubtedly, some people will gain. This includes those who will be receiving this minimum wage. One of draft laws submitted for the deputies' consideration assumes employers' liability in the event they do not pay even R50,000: The administrative fine will equal 10 times the value of the minimum wage on the first occurrence, and on repeated occurrence within one year--double that amount. However, if all other grades are left unchanged in the Unified Pay Scale, which is the basis for setting salaries in most budget-financed organizations, the imbalance in the ratio of labor remuneration for low-skilled and highly skilled labor will reach threatening proportions. Several versions of increasing pay for all others were submitted to the deputies: add R20,000 to all grades above the minimum; make the base pay for the first grade R30,000 or even R50,000 and then set salaries in accordance with established coefficients; and so on. That is, on the surface, everybody wins. The deputy commission says, however, that increasing the minimum wage to R30,000 in February-May did not result in a substantial increase in average earnings. Their decline over the past months has become catastrophic: Average earnings for March and April differ by only R1,000. And this is considering that prices went up for everything! And the last consideration on this account. At a recent press conference M. Sabirov mentioned that the republic budget may simply not be able to cover this innovation. That is, R50,000 will be set by law, and then, as has already happened before, people will not see their pay for months. The harsh reality is this: The budget treasury in the republic and in Kazan is quite depleted. Meanwhile an increasingly greater number of urban and rural residents are falling into the low-income category every day. The materials distributed to the deputies provide numerous interesting details in this respect. As long as store prices and residential rents in Tatarstan were lower by an order of magnitude than in other regions of Russia, we had good grounds to say that we lived better. Today the picture has changed. The average monthly income of one worker in our republic amounted to R151,800 in April and fell by 1.3 percent as compared to March. Social and labor benefits here account for only 6 percent. The average wage earned in April amounted to R142,800 and increased as compared to last April by 5.2-fold, and as compared to March--by 1.3 percent, while prices for consumer goods and services increased 5.8-fold and by 12.8 percent respectively. Let us arm ourselves with patience and give some thought to several more figures: Of the cities in our republic, with respect to average wages Kazan was in fifth place (R153,069--raise your hands: Who gets how much?). First is Bugulma (R174,267), followed by Naberezhnyye Chelny, Zainsk, and Nizhnekamsk. If we compare the indicators of changes in the standard of living in 1993-1994 in Tatarstan and the Russian Federation, everything is less here than in Russia. I do not even want to quote the figures so as not to traumatize people unnecessarily. I do not want to add my voice to those who are yelling that this is all the result of the treaty with Russia: We are being robbed as before, they say. Neither does it make any sense to contend that Tatarstan reformers are worse than Russian ones. Apparently we have not prepared well for the stage of transition from "soft" forms of the market to hard ones, although all this time we have been talking of the need for such preparation. That is, individuals have prepared, and some have learned to live for months without pay, but the republic budget, burdened by production decline and insolvency, has been literally brought to its knees. As the banker T. Abdullin pointed out at the session, we are not rich enough to continue to provide for a "soft merge" into the market. We did so as long as we could. But President M. Shaymiyev warned prophetically: We will end up where Russia is. So why all of a sudden so much talk about a crisis? And the last observation on the subject of the session documents. As one can see from the table we publish below, in both republics people of the same category have more or less the same standard of living in both republics. Financiers, those handling the pension and insurance pie, and bureaucrats are paid well everywhere (the latter are paid more in Russia, by the way), while doctors, teachers, and people of science and culture are paupers everywhere. How else can one put it, considering that the minimum consumer budget today stands at R164,000, and their salaries do not exceed the R130,000 mark? Prime Minister M. Sabirov said a few days ago that this was the first time he had heard that journalists are also not paid much. Yes, we live like the majority of the population. A typical salary in an editorial office is R97,600. So we have to study the session materials most attentively--otherwise, how will we learn whether the deputies care for our interests or their own?
