The special envoy of Russia's president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, said so in an interview with INTERFAX before his departure for Geneva. According to him, "very intensive" consultations were conducted in the past few days in the framework of preparations for the Geneva round of talks. This issue was discussed at the meeting between the Russian and American Presidents in Moscow, and at the parallel negotiations between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev. According to the diplomat, progress reached in the talks on territorial concessions is the principal positive factor in the efforts to resolve the crisis. Some 33.5 percent of the territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina claimed by the Muslims have been guaranteed to them at last. It was a key demand of the European Union, and a top- priority issue at the talks, Churkin said.
