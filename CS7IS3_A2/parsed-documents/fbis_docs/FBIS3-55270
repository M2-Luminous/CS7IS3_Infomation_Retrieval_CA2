Baturin, 44, Dr.Sc.(Law), a graduate of the Moscow Physic- Technical Institute, the Moscow Law Institute and the School of Journalism of Moscow University, has been the president's legal aide. The introduction of the new position is in line with the Constitution, which calls for a strong presidency, the president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told Interfax's Vyacheslav Terekhov. Furthermore, this is a natural continuation of the personnel policy in the post-Soviet period. Kostikov placed special emphasis on the fact that national security would be the responsibility of a civilian. IF Note: According to a reliable source, Baturin was an adviser to Georgiy Shakhnazarov, an assistant to ex-USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev on foreign policy matters. Baturin was instrumental in drafting Yeltsin's key decisions last summer and autumn. In the opinion of a number of experts, he took part in working out in September of 1993 the presidential decree to dissolve the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies and schedule new parliamentary elections. On the threshold of the opening session of a new parliament, the president has taken a number of decisions concerning his close aides. On Tuesday, he decreed relieving Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Mityukov, Mikhail Poltoranin, and Ekaterina Lakhova of their duties because of their future parliamentary work. This has been reported by the president's information service. Mityukov has up until now led the Presidential Committee on Legislative Initiatives. Poltoranin has been in charge of the Federal Information Center, Yushenkov has been Poltoranin's first deputy, and Lakhova has been a presidential adviser. By yet another decree, Yeltsin has dismissed his envoy to the Maritime Territory, Butov. Earlier, he sacked two advisers -- Sergey Stankevich (on political affairs) and Aleksey Yablokov (on environmental problems).
