FBIS4-28372 "dreas112_i_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Cambodia Finance Ministry Accused of `Interference' Finance Ministry Accused of `Interference' BK1006095794 Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in Cambodian 10 Jun 94 pp 1, 11 BK1006095794 Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA Cambodian BFN [Text] On the morning of 8 June, Trade Minister Va Huot made a surprising outburst toward Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi after the Economy and Finance Ministry issued Notice 057, dated 28 May 1994, dealing with a new regulation to take effect on 1 July 1994. According to this notice, a number of goods will be subjected to testing before they can be imported into Cambodia. The Economy and Finance Ministry assigned the ITS and FTS companies to conduct the testing required by this notice. Mr. Va Huot considered this action to be rude interference in the Trade Ministry's affairs. He and several top officials of the Trade Ministry's specialized departments called the new five-point regulation an error in judgment by the Economy and Finance Ministry. In its five points, the regulation says that crude oil, natural gas, all types of medicine and medical equipment, merchandise belonging or relating to the Royal Government, products categorized as relief or humanitarian aid, and so forth worth $1,000 or more must be inspected by the FTS company or another company called "Inchcape Testing Service International Limited," or ITS for short. Mr. Va Huot stressed that the Economy and Finance Ministry should not interfere to this extent in the Trade Ministry's domain. The Economy and Finance Ministry's notice and regulation constitute a gross violation by one ministry against another. He claimed the regulation may have been initiated because the Economy and Finance Ministry wanted to dissolve some units under the Trade Ministry's jurisdiction. Concerning the import and export of goods, the Trade Ministry already has all the necessary departments to check and test merchandise. As for the import of petroleum products, the testing of crude oil and natural gas has been carried out over the last dozen years by CAMCONTROL utilizing a laboratory purchased by the government for $100,000 to test imported petroleum products. Currently, CAMCONTROL is coordinating its operations with France's DGCCRI, a major organization known around the world. This organization has cooperated with CAMCONTROL on the basis of an agreement signed in 1991. Up until now, the organization has assisted us in such tasks as the quality testing of counterfeit goods and drafting laws to control counterfeit goods. A Trade Ministry official said: The most interesting thing is that our cooperation with an important organization recognized by the government has not even been concluded, but someone, instead of helping enhance this cooperation, is already seeking to usurp the rights and tasks of other agencies. What does this all mean? Minister Va Huot added: "I have always supported every specialized department in the Trade Ministry." He went on to say that the Finance Ministry should have known what work has already been done in compliance with Royal Government decrees, meaning that the Finance Ministry should not seek to create new problems. If the Finance Ministry wishes to carry out any enterprises it deems beneficial to the national community, it would be commendable if the two ministries talked with each another first to bring progress and success to these important enterprises. The minister also mentioned the agreement signed between the Finance Ministry and the French company Total, saying it is pressuring the CKC company under the auspices of the Trade Ministry into a joint venture with Total. Such a move can only create problems, he said. The Finance Ministry should not intrude in the Trade Ministry's domain. He wondered whether similar actions taken by the Finance Ministry in the past had ever born any fruit or seen any success at all. It is not known yet whether Mr. Va Huot's reaction to Mr. Sam Rangsi was officially presented to the Royal Government. Nonetheless, we hope this disharmony will be settled by the Royal Government soon.
