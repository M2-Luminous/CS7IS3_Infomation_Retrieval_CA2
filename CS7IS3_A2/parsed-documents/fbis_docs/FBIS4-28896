National Air Defence Command (Kohanudnas) spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Widoso Sabarno said in Jakarta Monday that the exercise took place in the air territory under the Air Defence Sector Command I [Roman numeral one] covering Jakarta and its surroundings. Also taking part in the event, he added, were a number of C-130 Hercules giant transport planes and Boeing 707 aircraft, in addition to radar units, with Flight Lieutenant Colonel Tahir Harita in charge of control and supervision. Widoso said the main purpose of the exercise was to enhance the combat readiness of the air defence potential of the particular region. The ability and preparedness in the detection, control, and interception of enemy aircraft under the air defence operation procedures and control command mechanism, have really been tested during the exercise, he said. The exercise was also to train combat pilots in quick reaction, target identification, action against a target including cashing [as received] away, forcing to land up to shooting down, Widoso said. In the exercise, the A-4 Sky Hawks acted as the enemy, flying from their base in Pekanbaru, Riau, for penetration to Jakarta. The A-4 jets were detected by ground radar, then `met' by the F-5 combat planes, and eventually chased away. The exercise was officially closed by Kohanudnas Commander Rear Marshal Sujitno.
