Mr. Robaina, who is leading an eight-member government delegation, told newsmen that the international community is ignorant about the difficulties the United States blockade of Cuba has imposed on the people during the past 35 years. That is why the government has launched a worldwide diplomatic offensive to let the world know the truth about the embargo. He said the blockade has denied Cuba her rightful place on the international market because it has virtually been impossible to open the country up for foreign investment. Mr. Robaina said in the face of all these atrocities, Cubans believe that they have been able to survive the worst of tests. He said no other form of pressure, apart from respect for the dignity of Cubans can resolve the island's impasse with the United States. The foreign minister repeated that Cuba is ready for dialogue. However, she will negotiate under one condition only, and that is mutual respect for each other's dignity and sovereignty. He added that his visit to Africa will afford him the opportunity to update his knowledge about the region and consolidate the bonds of friendship and cooperation between Cuba and Africa. Mr. Robaina will also visit Namibia, Angola, and Zimbabwe.
