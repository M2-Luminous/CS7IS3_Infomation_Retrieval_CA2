Its authors expect that the information security concept will be finalized by November, but even at this stage they kindly suggested that the press familiarize themselves with its basic provisions. According to Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, without an "adequate solution" to information problems "it is hard to talk about national security." Among such problems Mr. Rubanov mentioned the exercise of the citizens' right to information. "This problem should be resolved for political reasons" at least because these rights of citizens have been set forth in the Constitution, "but the existing structures cannot ensure them." Mr. Rubanov said also that for the purpose of protecting Russia's intellectual potential a possibility should finally be given "to registering information as a commodity." Among other things, the draft concept calls for the recognition of information as an object of ownership and its introduction in "economic circulation." In addition, Mr. Rubanov called for a conception of "protectionism" in the area of production and distribution of information, warning that far from all distributors of information, including a number of firms specializing in data bases, act "in conformity with Russia's vital interests." In other words, the state is seriously concerned by the leakage of formerly secret materials of scientific-technical or economic nature to its "partners," former opponents of the USSR. The Security Council will apparently urge the introduction of licenses and certificates for the distributors of information, particularly exporters. It seems encouraging that the Security Council, at least the part of its staff that deals with working out the information security concept, thinks it necessary publicly to declare that if citizens are to exercise their constitutional right to information, it requires appropriate legislation, including direct-action laws. Just as important, information has been introduced "in economic circulation" as "a crucial national resource comparable with energy resources" (in Mr. Rubanov's words). Maybe this will correct to some extent the usage of the term "commodity producer," which is currently applied to those who produce "material values," not to designate those who actually manufacture marketable products. Naturally, the preliminary presentation of the concept has also left numerous questions unanswered. According to Mr. Rubanov, power structures will have an "auxiliary role" to play when the concept and enforceable enactments on its basis are worked out. If this is really so, so modest a role for the special services will be a first, of sorts. Of course, one will be able to find out how "auxiliary" it is only when private and commercial producers and buyers of information face the consequences of this idea in practice. For the time being, however, materials presented showed the desire to pass "between the Scylla of secrecy and the Charybdis of misappropriating information resources with no holds barred." Since the drafters of the concept concede that it would be more advantageous for the state to establish "a high level of secrecy," the other components of society should evidently champion the "no- holds-barred" approach, so as not to veer off toward Scylla.
