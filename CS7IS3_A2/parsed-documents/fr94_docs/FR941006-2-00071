FR941006-2-00071 FR941006-2-00055 Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for the Proposed Barton Creek Development, Austin, Travis County, TX AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: F.M. Properties Operating Co., Inc. (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number PRT&hyph;782833. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of and operation of a 4,684-acre commercial and residential development on a 9,000-acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas. The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6) DATES: Written comments on the application and draft EA/HCP should be received on or before November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy by writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103. Persons wishing to review the EA/HCP may obtain a copy by contacting Joe Johnston, Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 611 East Sixth Street, Suite 407, Austin, Texas 78701 (512/482&hyph;5436). Documents will be available for public inspection, by written request and by appointment only, during normal business hours (8:00 to 4:00) at the Southwest Regional Office, Division of Endangered Species/Permits, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

Please refer to permit number PRT&hyph;782833 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe Johnston at the above Austin Ecological Services Field Office address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species, like the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. The Applicant plans to build a Residential-Resort and Commercial development located just west of Capital of Texas Highway 360, south of FM 2244, and north of Highway 290, Austin, Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 4,684 acres. These activities will permanently eliminate about 1,036 acres of the 3,830 acres of occupied and/or suitable warbler habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via acquisition and donation of 3,923 acres of land, provision of operating and maintenance funds for these preserve lands, minimize impacts to warbler habitat, avoidance of direct impacts to warblers, preservation of undeveloped areas, and environmental monitoring. The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three of them because they were not economically viable. John G. Rogers, Jr., Regional Director, Region 2, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
