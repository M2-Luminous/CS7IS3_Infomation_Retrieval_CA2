It was learned that as a first step in this context, Syria has forced Apo to leave Damascus and that the PKK leader is in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. [Begin unidentified reporter recording] It is a known fact that Syria does not want to lose its PKK trump card against Turkey. However, Hafiz al-Asad, who wants to integrate with the West and who openly expressed this intention to Clinton, is expected to further hem in on Apo. According to available information, Syria took its first step on this issue recently and forced PKK leader Apo to leave for the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Apo currently is being kept under control in Beirut. Considering Syria's influence on Lebanon, however, it appears that al-Asad will not give up its Apo and PKK trump cards, at least until he gets Turkey's consent for an agreement on river water. Sending Apo off to Beirut is perceived by Ankara as an indication of goodwill from the Damascus government. However, Ankara believes Damascus has to take more positive steps. Ankara is now getting ready to launch a diplomatic offensive in Washington to further pressure Damascus on the PKK and Apo. [end recording]
