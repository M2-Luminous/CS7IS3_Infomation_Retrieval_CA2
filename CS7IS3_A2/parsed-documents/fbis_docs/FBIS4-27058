At present, at least 100 million of China's total 300 million urban residents rely on the grain produced by the three provinces of the area, namely Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning. Last year the area produced 60 billion kg of grain, or 13.14 percent of the national total. About half of the grain is marketable grain, which accounts for one third of the national total of such grain, which is supplied to the country's urban residents. It is especially noticeable that Liaoning, an old industrial province where urban residents account for 73 percent of the total population, has produced more than 15 billion kg of grain annually for four years in a row. Last year its grain output reached 17 billion kg, 40 percent more than in the 1980s. Thus, the province has become self-sufficient in grain for the first time. Furthermore, last year it supplied 2.2 billion kg of rice to southern China and exported some rice to Japan. At the same time, the outputs of other varieties of farm produce such as meat, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit have also increased rapidly. In recent years the milk and aquatic products supplied by the northeast China area have accounted for 30 percent and more than 10 percent, respectively, of the national total. Liaoning, which has 14 large- and medium-sized cities, used to be short of farm produce. Only a dozen years ago each urban resident in the province had a rationed supply of a mere two kg of rice, 1.5 kg of flour, 0.15 kg of edible oil and 0.25 kg of meat besides a supply of coarse food grains every month. When an urban resident of the province travelled to other parts of the country, he often carried back large amounts of pork, which was scarce at home. So, at that time people in the other parts of the country nicknamed the people travelling from Liaoning Province "hungry tigers from the northeast." But now the supplies of meat, vegetables and other varieties of farm produce in the free markets of Liaoning Province are sufficient and the prices are reasonable. The province has not only become self-sufficient in the supply of farm produce, but also has surpluses. Last year Liaoning supplied 300,000 pigs to other parts of China. The three provinces of northeast China cover an area of 787,000 sq [square] km, equal to the total territories of Britain and France. It used to be China's metallurgical and machine-building base. About 50 percent of the total population of nearly 100 million people are urban residents, quite a large proportion compared with the other regions of China. Meanwhile, the area has 16.29 million ha [hectares] of farmland. In recent years the leadership at various levels in northeast China has attached great importance to the development of agriculture. All the three provinces have increased their investment in agriculture. In the past four years Jilin has invested a total of 18.4 billion yuan (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars) in agriculture, showing a yearly average increase of 11 percent. In one year the province even invested one fourth of its total revenue in agriculture. The provinces have also made efforts to promote advanced farming technology. Heilongjiang has spread high-yield technology for growing maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Liaoning has made great efforts to optimize the composition of fertilizers, interplanting and irrigation. Calculations show that scientific farming accounts for 40 percent of the factors leading to increases in grain output. Attention has also been paid to mechanization of agriculture and to the development of a diversified economy, including the development of fisheries, forestry, animal husbandry and rural industrial enterprises, so as to increase the farmers' income and arouse their enthusiasm for production. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that the speedy development of agriculture in northeast China in recent years has not only made the rural economy develop in an all-round way, but also greatly supported the economic reform and industrial development in the urban areas. Besides, the rapidly growing agriculture in northeast China has also played an important role in stabilizing the grain markets throughout the country after the central government relaxed controls over the grain prices earlier this year. In the past four years northeast China has supplied over 100 billion kg of marketable grain to other parts of the country. A senior central government official has praised the three provinces in northeast China, particularly Liaoning, for their success in developing agriculture, saying that they have set an example for the country's industrially developed coastal areas to develop agriculture too.
