It will not come to the rescue of the occupation and its leaders. This intransigence will inevitably lead them to perdition. It seems the occupation and its leaders do not yet understand that their foolhardy actions will kill the peace process in the region and wipe out any future aspirations for peace. This will open the doors to war and violence. They are mistaken to believe that by wasting time and avoiding commitment to the schedule for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles -- which is the only historical opportunity for establishing just and comprehensive peace in the region -- they can succeed in finding a way to undermine the Palestinian national struggle and obstruct the PLO's political bodies. If we reach a dead end, our steadfast and lofty people, with their nationalist and brave leadership, will submit new options. Then, and only then will the occupation and its leaders realize that they are the only party that is responsible for wasting the historic opportunity for establishing just and comprehensive peace in the region. It is true that we are patient, and that we work for a just and comprehensive peace. However, our patience has its limits. The occupation and its leaders will be the losers. As for our people, who continue to sacrifice their sons, they will ultimately attain their just and legitimate objectives of freedom, independence, and life. The occupation and its leaders should always keep in mind the conspicuous fact that victory is the lot of our people and that defeat and loss is for the occupation and its leaders.
