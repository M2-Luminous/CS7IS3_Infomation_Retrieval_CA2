FR940606-2-00036 FR940606-2-00023 II. The Proposed Refund Procedures A. Refund Claims We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 10 Notice to the crude oil subpart V proceeding that is the subject of the present determination. As noted above, $870,000 of an alleged crude oil violation is covered by this proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $174,000, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties. The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined products. E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co., 14 DOE ¶ 85,475 (1986) ( Mountain Fuel ). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, a covered product is any product that was either covered by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. §§751&hyph;760, or if the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery. See Great Salt Lake Minerals & Chem. Corp., 23 DOE ¶ 88,118, at 88,305 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price controls. E.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 15 DOE ¶ 85,495, at 88,893&hyph;96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. E.g., Berry Holding Co., 16 DOE ¶ 85,405, at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury. E.g., New York Petroleum, 18 DOE at 88,701&hyph;03. Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the Report by the Office of Hearings and Appeals to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, reprinted in 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines ¶ 90,507 (1986). Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds under subpart V. Mid-America Dairyman, Inc. v. Herrington, 878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989); accord Boise Cascade Corp., 18 DOE ¶ 85,970 (1989). Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined products will be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived by dividing the alleged crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination ($870,000) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons). Mountain Fuel, 14 DOE at 88,868 n.4. As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will be required to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds. E.g., Allerkamp, 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another application. That previously filed application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 F.R. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed within this deadline at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants that filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds. E.g., Seneca Oil Co., 21 DOE ¶ 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the Federal Register . B. Payments to the States and Federal Government Under the terms of the SMRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision, or $696,000, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement. It Is Therefore Ordered That: The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Dane Energy Company pursuant to the Consent Order executed on April 8, 1993 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.
