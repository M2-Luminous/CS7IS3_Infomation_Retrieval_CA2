[Fabbri] It is up to the UN Secretary General to make a decision; this time he can take this step without the Security Council pronouncing on the issue first. [Fontana] Butrus-Ghali seems to have decided. [Fabbri] The green light has not yet been given. The tragedy of the marketplace in Sarajevo seems to have brought some prospect of a slackening of the tension. There could be a chance that Sarajevo might be demilitarized. If there is, we must do all we can to find a settlement. But there is one nonnegotiable point: Even in the face of this potential opening, the West must demonstrate that it really is ready to use military force as well. [Fontana] There are those who compare the European democracies' attitude toward Bosnia to their behavior toward Nazi Germany. [Fabbri] I will note what we Italians will do. Our bases are ready to support military initiatives, as they did with the "no-fly-zone" operation. As a politician, I do not want to feel ashamed in a few years' time of having retreated into realpolitik in the face of an unparalleled tragedy, the only precedent for which is the Holocaust. We must show the same determination displayed in Kuwait, otherwise the free western democracies and the international community will have no excuse. [Fontana] Is military intervention, in other words bombing the artillery posts that are pounding Sarajevo, "technically" feasible? [Fabbri] We must use all the means at our disposal, including military means, as the foreign affairs minister has rightly said. Italy backs the "Juppe ultimatum." [Fontana] But is intervention possible? [Fabbri] There is no decisive or conclusive intervention. One might imagine military initiatives triggered by failure to comply with the ultimatum or by the UN ascertaining that the entire responsibility for the marketplace massacre is to be laid at the Serbs' door. Military experts, too, have mentioned the possibility of air strikes against the main "sources of fire" that are strangling Sarajevo, the helpless victim of genocide from above. Of course, we cannot rely too much on the investigation into the marketplace massacre; there may be no "technical proof," as lawyers used to call it, but there is no lack of "deductive proof" that the bombs were fired by the Serbs, as they always have been. [Fontana] So what sort of military operation might be decided on? [Fabbri] One might imagine air strikes against the gun posts and air raids in support of the UN forces, if they come under attack. NATO has been asked to plan an operation and it has done so, and the Italian bases are ready. [Fontana] Would Italian planes take part in the operations too? [Fabbri] We have been asked to provide logistic and operational support, which is in place and is complete. This is no negligible contribution, and we are ready to provide effective support both for the air strikes and for the other operations. [Fontana] So there is no talk of troop intervention on the ground? [Fabbri] None at all, at the moment. We have to see which targets might be knocked out with air strikes, whether the fighter planes have to hit "top priority" targets, by which I mean the gun posts, or "secondary priority" targets as well, munitions dumps and so on ... These are the options open to us. The United States is right to ask Europe to do its duty. This time we cannot delegate everything to the United States; in the face of a war on our own doorstep, Europe must play its part. [Fontana] How might Italian public opinion react to the decision to carry out air strikes? [Fabbri] The operation would be authorized by the United Nations and carried out by NATO. The Italians would welcome it as a rightful decision, there would be a sense of relief. No one is pretending there would be no risk, no danger, no consequences; but we must not forget the lessons of the thirties. [Fontana] However, Moscow does not agree. [Fabbri] We in the West must not allow ourselves to be unduly swayed by Russian diplomacy's benevolence toward Serbia. Russia has condemned the massacre in the marketplace, but we know what Moscow's position has been in the long Yugoslav tragedy. Let us take it into account without giving it too much weight. The West cannot betray its duty. Last but not least, I should like to repeat that the Italian navy and air force are ready to step up their humanitarian aid operations, transporting civilians and the wounded. Peace is not just around the corner. We must get ready for a massive humanitarian aid operation. [Fontana] Minister Fabbri, another Italian has fallen in Somalia. They are shooting at the soldiers. A few days ago, you said that "intelligence sources" gave grounds for fearing this sort of thing. What is happening in Mogadishu? [Fabbri] There are attacks and assaults on the UN forces, protest marches. The tension is mounting again. The Italians have carried out widespread operations confiscating weapons from the factions. The Somali armed groups think that once the western forces have left they can resume their armed warfare, and they are trying to get back the weapons that we have taken. The moment of withdrawal is the most sensitive and difficult moment. Unfortunately, we were expecting these fresh outbreaks of guerrilla warfare. We have planned withdrawal according to a schedule that we will adhere to. There are those who say, "Bring them all home immediately," but we cannot because we have agreed our schedule with UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] and the Germans, who are unarmed and are leaving with us. We shall be keeping our eyes wide open.
