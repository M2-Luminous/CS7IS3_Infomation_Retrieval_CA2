FBIS4-48262 "drafr095_e_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria CD To Mark First Anniversary of 12 Jun Elections CD To Mark First Anniversary of 12 Jun Elections AB1705084494 Paris AFP in French 1312 GMT 16 May 94 AB1705084494 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Lagos, 16 May (AFP) -- A Campaign for Democracy [CD] official told AFP today that the organization has prepared a three-day program to commemorate the first anniversary of the June 12 presidential election that was annulled by the former military regime. The CD is made up of about 40 pro-democratic and human rights movements. The 12 June election, which Yoruba billionaire Moshood Abiola claims to have won, was annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida's regime on the grounds that there were irregularities. The organization's secretary general, Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, said the CD is calling on Nigerians to wear black badges during the three days of commemoration as a sign of mourning in memory of those who died last year "in the name of democracy." The commemoration period will also be used to protest the return of the military to power following the cancellation of the election. Last year the CD said it favored the installation of Moshood Abiola as president. Mr. Akhaine further said his organization supported the aims and aspirations of the National Democratic Coalition [NADECO], a new pro-democratic organization which was established in Lagos on 13 May. NADECO has given General Sani Abacha up until 31 May to hand over the task of forming a broad-based government to Moshood Abiola.
