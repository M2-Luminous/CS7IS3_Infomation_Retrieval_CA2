The 14 members of the certification committee, which include renowned Chinese aerodynamicists, academic committee members, chief engineer of the China Aerospace Industrial Corp., Prof. Zhuan Fenggan, Prof. Dai Changhui, Prof. Lin Yunpei, and other experts believe that the high Reynolds number transonic wind tunnel developed by the Institute of Mechanics matches leading wind tunnels of the world in terms of technical standard and performance. The key simulation parameters in an aerodynamic test are the flight Mach number and Reynolds number. A conventional transonic wind tunnel can usually simulate the proper Mach number, but the simulated Reynolds number is typically one or two orders of magnitude lower than actual flight values. Therefore, some of the aircraft designed in the 1960s based on data obtained from conventional transonic wind tunnels developed problems. In an effort to avoid these problems, the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan have invested huge sums of money since the 1970s to develop and construct high Reynolds number wind tunnels. In the early 1980s, having developed an impulse type aerodynamic test facility and corresponding experimental techniques, experts of the Institute of Mechanics proposed the idea of building a high Reynolds number tubular wind tunnel; the initial design effort was led by Prof. Zhuan Fenggan. In 1988, the project was approved by the CAS. With limited funds, members of the research and development group were determined to make this project a success. During the construction, they found innovative approaches that were compatible with China's limited industrial and economic resources, and succeeded in building the wind tunnel with a small investment and very short development cycle. The overall design has also built-in provisions for further improving the performance and expanding the utility of the wind tunnel. The success of this project has paved the way for future development of high Reynolds number transonic wind tunnels in China.
