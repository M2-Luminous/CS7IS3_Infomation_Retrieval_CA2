"Theirs was the same case. Why not let Chen Ziming free?" said Wu Yongfen, the mother of Chen, who like Mr Wang was sentenced to 13 years in jail for allegedly being one of the "black hands" behind what the Chinese Government calls an attempt to topple the Communist Party five years ago. On Saturday, China announced the release of Mr Wang, allowing him to travel to the United States for medical treatment. "It was a deal for MFN [Most Favoured Nation trade status]," Ms Wu said of Mr Wang's release. She said her family would press for the release of Chen. "We want more foreign pressure," she said. The Chinese Government says the nation's laws make provision for the release of prisoners on humanitarian grounds but, in fact, China has used these legal provisions primarily as an excuse to make human rights concessions when it sees a political advantage from doing so. While Mr Wang's wife Hou Xiaotian, had single-handedly launched a tireless campaign for the release of her husband, frequently meeting with the foreign press in on-the-record interviews, the families of Chen and other dissidents have kept a far lower profile. Since the beginning of Chen's imprisonment almost five years ago, he has contracted a series of ailments, including a skin disease, high blood pressure, and heart trouble. His hair is falling out and his teeth are coming loose. Chen, ex-head of the Beijing Social and Economic Sciences Research Institute is being held in the Beijing No. 2 Prison. "We want him to get the same as Wang Juntao. The case was the same. Wang Juntao was ill, so is Chen Ziming. Why let one go abroad and not let the other out on parole for medical treatment in China?" said Ms Wu. "My concern is, who is the next?" said Bao Pu, the son of Bao Tong, the principal secretary of ousted Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang. The elder Mr Bao is serving a seven-year sentence for allegedly "leaking state secrets." Mr Bao has had 17 polyps removed since being imprisoned in Qincheng Prison in 1989. The authorities say the polyps have so far been benign. His white blood cell count is well below normal and his carcinoembryonic antigen level has been increasing to well above normal, suggesting cancer. Doctors say Bao has thyroid tumours and suffers from salivary gland atrophy. Recently Bao has been transferred to a hospital for treatment. While on the face of it, the principle of fair treatment would suggest that Chen, Bao, and other political prisoners should be released, analysts said the Chinese authorities might well decide to keep them in jail if they saw the release of Mr Wang as being enough to sway U.S. opinion towards renewing MFN.
