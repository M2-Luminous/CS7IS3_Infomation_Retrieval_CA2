The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) reported on Thursday a survey it recently held of 150 leading export firms showed that 75 firms, just half of the companies surveyed, said they fear their exports would be adversely affected by the NAFTA. Only 19 firms or 12.7 percent of the total said they expect no impact at all. On the other hand, 13 companies (8.7 percent) said they believe NAFTA would have a favorable effect on their exports. As major factors behind negative effect, 69.6 percent of the firms questioned gave tariff removal among three NAFTA countries, 25.6 percent "country of origin" rules, and 4.8 percent the opening of investment and service. Of the firms surveyed, 30.1 percent replied they believe the country's exports would decline by 1-5 percent due to NAFTA, 28.2 percent by 5-10 percent, and 19.4 percent by more than 10 percent.
