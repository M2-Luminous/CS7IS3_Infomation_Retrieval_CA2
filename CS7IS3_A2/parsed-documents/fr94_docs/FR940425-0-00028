FR940425-0-00028 FR940425-0-00018 C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information. The NPRM was divided into two segments: (1) Vehicle requirements that addressed the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements that addressed the safety of the fuel containers themselves. NHTSA decided to model the proposed requirements for CNG fueled motor vehicles on Standard No. 301, Fuel System Integrity. Standard No. 301 specifies performance requirements for vehicles that use fuel with a boiling point above 32 ○F (i.e., liquid fuels under standard temperature and pressure). Both gasoline and diesel fuel have a boiling point above that temperature. Since CNG has a boiling point below 32 ○F, vehicles manufactured to use only CNG are not subject to Standard No. 301. Standard No. 301 limits the amount of fuel spillage from ``light vehicles'' 2 during and after frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests and a static rollover test. The Standard also limits fuel spillage from school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds after being impacted by a moving contoured barrier at any point and any angle. By adopting a CNG rule based on Standard No. 301, the agency would afford passengers of CNG vehicles a level of safety comparable to that provided passengers of vehicles fueled by gasoline or diesel fuel. 2 Light vehicles include passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPV's), trucks, and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less. NHTSA proposed that the fuel system integrity requirements for CNG vehicles would include frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles, and a moving contoured barrier crash test for large school buses. The agency proposed that fuel system integrity would be assessed by measuring the fuel system's post-crash pressure drop, instead of fuel spillage as under Standard No. 301, since CNG is a gas. The allowable pressure drop for CNG fueled vehicles would be equivalent, as measured by the energy content of fuel, to the allowable spillage of fuel during Standard No. 301 compliance testing. With respect to the ``equipment'' requirements applicable to CNG containers, NHTSA proposed a definition for ``CNG fuel tank'' and performance requirements for such fuel containers manufactured for motor vehicles, including aftermarket containers. 3 The Agency proposed that the CNG containers would be subject to a pressure cycling test to evaluate durability and a pressure burst test to evaluate strength. In addition, the NPRM proposed equipment requirements to regulate how the container may ``vent'' its contents under specified conditions of elevated temperature and pressure. 3 Among the terms used to describe CNG fuel tanks are tanks, containers, cylinders, and high pressure vessels. The agency will refer to them as ``containers'' throughout this document. II. Comments on the Proposal NHTSA received a large number of comments addressing the CNG proposal. The commenters included manufacturers of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses, research organizations, State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies. In addition, NHTSA met with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and had telephone conversations and meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed in the public docket. The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and fuel containers was necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container manufacturers stated that NHTSA needs to issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. The commenters generally agreed with most of the vehicle-oriented proposals including those related to the standard's applicability, the formula used to determine the allowable amount of CNG leakage, and the barrier crash tests. Nevertheless, commenters were concerned with the inability of commercially available measuring devices to measure what they viewed as the extremely small pressure drops allowed by the proposal. III. Agency's Decision A. Overview In today's final rule, NHTSA is issuing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles. It specifies vehicle performance requirements applicable to the fuel system of a CNG fueled vehicle. As explained in the NPRM, and summarized above, the fuel system integrity requirements are comparable to those requirements in Standard No. 301. Like those requirements, the CNG requirements specify frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds.
