Despite the ramified talk about these services, which are numerous and broad, AL-DA'WAH editorial staff decided to address these questions and queries to His Highness Dr. 'Alawi Darwish Kayyal, the minister of posts, telephones, and telegraph. The undeniable fact is that these questions received the attention of His Excellency, who focused light on them point by point, discussing them frankly and explicitly, as shown by this dialogue. His Excellency noted that there is a huge program to modernize the kingdom's communication network technology, stressing that portable [al-naqqal] telephone service will be available next year, God willing. His Excellency also pointed out that the problem of the long wait that precedes acquisition of telephone service in some areas will disappear shortly. He also stressed that the ministry is about to expand further the pager and mobile [car, al-sayyar] telephone service. The dialogue has also covered other points. [al-Qadi] Your Excellency, some authorities have said that there is a plan to develop the kingdom's communication means. How will this be done? [Kayyal] Yes, there is a program to modernize the kingdom's communication network technology to move this network from what is known as the analogue technology to the digital technology, to which most countries of the world have turned. The new technology opens broad horizons for services that can be rendered by the network, especially high-speed information transmission services. This is the technology that has accompanied the world of computers, which have become a characteristic of the age in which we live. The fact is that this modernization program is a complete and comprehensive program. It includes a network of telephone exchanges in all parts of the kingdom, a microwave network, an underground cable network, and a satellite network, as well as all the subsidiary systems and networks connected with these four networks. Communication Expansion [al-Qadi] Tell us, Your Excellency, about the ministry's plan to expand telephone service and about future telephone projects, their costs, and number of lines. When will they begin, and when will they end? [Kayyal] Communications play an influential and effective role in our modern life. Hardly anybody can dispense with communications in one form or another. Rather, communications have become a mainstay of national security, economic development, and the social contact. This is why the demand for communication services is rising and why the ministry has worked to develop a major program to expand the communications utility in a manner that enables it to meet the citizens' demand for its services. The ministry presented this program to His Majesty King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the two holy mosques, who has given it his noble patronage. The plan has also been approved by the Council of Ministers. The size of this expansion amounts to nearly one-half million lines, and there is a strong possibility that this number will be doubled. This program will make up for the deficit in urban and rural telephone lines. It will also secure the service to nearly 2,000 new villages. This expansion will coincide with the program to modernize all components of the existing networks--a program to which I referred in the preceding answer. It is expected that the costs of both programs will amount to 10 billion Saudi riyals. God willing, this program will start in 1415 of the Hegira [1994] and it will be completed within five years. But it will start producing fruits in the second year of the project, i.e., in 1416 of the Hegira [1995]. Posts [al-Qadi] What is new in postal services, and what are their future projects? [Kayyal] The postal service has the government's attention because it is an important service sector. This is why the government supplies it with the requirements it needs to perform its role. We in the ministry pursue whatever is new in the postal service world to ensure the continued improvement of our postal service. This is being accomplished by establishing in the various parts of the kingdom postal centers equipped with modern postal automation equipment, such as sorting, binding, and filling equipment. After building the three main postal complexes in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Ad-Dammam--which are the main terminals for mail--we proceeded to build similar complexes, but on a smaller scale, in the venerable Mecca, the luminous Medina, At-Ta'if, al-Qasim, and Tabuk. Postal service premises are being now constructed in nine other cities. We will proceed along this path gradually until all parts of the kingdom are included. [al-Qadi] What is the mail volume received in the kingdom? Are all letters sorted automatically; and what is the letter loss percentage, if any? [Kayyal] in 1413 of the Hegira [1992], the postal service handled nearly 680 million postal items, including 375 million outgoing items and 305 million incoming items. Nearly 60 percent of the mail is sorted automatically. The rest is sorted by hand, because it consists of printed materials, newspapers, and magazines that have dimensions that don't fit into the automatic sorting machines. The loss rate is extremely low, almost nonexistent. If loss exists, then it is in the single figures, and it amounts to no percentage when compared to the mail volume. [al-Qadi] Many people complain of the difficulty of acquiring a post office box. Why has this problem not been solved? [Kayyal] Post office boxes are available and located in quarters, but not in streets. We are eager to spread them so they will be available to every user in the place he wants them to be. Long Waits for Telephones [al-Qadi] When, in the opinion of His Excellency the minister, will the long wait to get a telephone line end? [Kayyal] God willing, the wait problem in major cities will be solved in two phases: the first during the second half of this year and during next year through the urgent expansion program being implemented currently. The second will begin in 1416 of the Hegira [1995] through the approved expansion program to which I referred in a previous answer. This means that the wait problem will disappear, God willing, within three years. Here I would like to point out to my brother citizens that it is not as easy as some people imagine to provide the service. Lots of money is spent, silent efforts are exerted, and much time is consumed to provide the service to a certain area, beginning with the building for every telephone exchange and the external network boxes, which extend to every street and reach every home through trenches dug into the ground, and ending with the means that link an exchange to the network and to other exchanges within the same city, with exchanges in other cities, and then with foreign exchanges. The time needed to do all this is estimated at three to four years. Pager and Mobile Telephone [al-Qadi] What is new regarding the pager and mobile [car] telephone service? Will they undergo future expansion? [Kayyal] Yes, they will undergo future expansion. A contract has been concluded to expand the general wireless calling (pager) network. This expansion will produce fruits at the beginning of next year, God willing. A contract will also be concluded within six months to expand the mobile [car] telephone network capacity greatly. Portable Telephone [al-Qadi] Is there a plan to introduce other services similar to the pager service, such as the portable [al-naqqal] telephone service, for example? [Kayyal] I have said in a previous answer that the ministry seeks to pursue whatever is new in the communications world in order to introduce any of this world's new products that befit us. Portable telephone service will become available by the end of next year, God willing. [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the phenomenon of the sale and purchase of communication services? [Kayyal] I see it as unhealthy. However, it is a product of the imbalance between service supply and demand. Rest assured that this problem will disappear shortly, when the new capabilities about which I have talked are made available. Overlapping of Lines [al-Qadi] Some people complain of the overlapping and jamming of lines when calls are made. What is Your Excellency's opinion? [Kayyal] The ministry is aware of this problem, and it is exerting maximum efforts and using all the resources it can to eliminate or reduce this problem. It hopes that the problem will disappear completely when the modernization and expansion programs to which I have referred previously are completed. This problem is due to some outdated equipment in the communication network. This equipment has reached the end of its operational lifespan; part of it has been in operation for more than 20 years and needs to be replaced. The problem is also due to the extreme pressure experienced by the network as a result of the ever-growing use of this network. Complaints [al-Qadi] How does Your Excellency view the complaints published in the press about communication services? [Kayyal] I see them as a healthy phenomenon, even though some people exaggerate the matter and some superficialize it. One finds people who say that the service standard has deteriorated to a level that makes it impossible for one to make any call. Is this true? One finds others who say that all that is needed to solve the problem is to get a small part from some country and all that it takes to get this part is the signature of an individual who does not report to his work. This is a form of superficiality that is devoid of the simplest rules of logic. We at the Ministry of Posts, Telephones, and Telegraph do not deny that there are some negatives. But these negatives amount to nothing when compared with the positives. If it were not for the positives in work, any work, nobody would mention the negatives. Anyway, it is a human tendency to talk about the negatives. Those who do are the ones who get criticized. Those who do not do are mentioned by nobody. [al-Qadi] There are some base-minded people who eavesdrop on mobile [car] telephone conversations. What has the ministry done about this phenomenon and about protecting conversations? [Kayyal] The current mobile [car] telephone system will be scrambled in the near future, and then the base-minded will not be able to engage in their disgraceful curiosity. Moreover, the expanded mobile telephone system will be totally scrambled.
