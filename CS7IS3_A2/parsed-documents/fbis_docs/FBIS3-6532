Japan will send the monitors in response to a request by the South African Government, recognizing the historical importance of the April 26-28 election for the international community, spokesman Terusuke Terada said. The election observers to be dispatched by the Japanese Government will be joined by 10 U.N. volunteers and several people from the private sector, he said. A special assistant of the permanent mission of Japan to the United Nations will also be dispatched as a liaison officer to the U.N. Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA), he said. Japan has so far extended a total of about 34.8 million yen in aid to nongovernmental organizations working in South Africa to help voter education and provide vehicles for election observation, he said. In a related move, a private Japanese aid organization, the Japan International Volunteer Center, also plans to carry out a project in connection with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to offer vocational training to assist the resettlement of returnees to South Africa, he said. The project is aimed at giving training in woodworking, welding, plumbing and computer operation, he said.
