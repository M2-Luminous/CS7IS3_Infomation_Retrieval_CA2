Ms. Albright was accompanied by high ranking officials of the National Security Council of the State and Defence Departments. [passage omitted] President Berisha stressed that Albania is grateful to the U.S. for the support that the U.S. Government, institutions and citizens have given to Albania during this period of time. "We consider the cooperation with the U.S.A. as very important not only for the historic relations and the fact that this country is a main pillar of the freedom and democracy in the world, but also because we consider the U.S. presence as vital for peace and stability in our continent, that is not only for the Albanians but for all the others." President Berisha expressed his approval to sign the Partnership For Peace, stressing that he considered it as a stage of active integration of Albania into the Atlantic Alliance. "But we shall insist on becoming a NATO member," he said. "The creation of the enterprise fund in Albania is a very good news for the Albanians and it will be a powerful support for the reform in our country," Mr. Berisha said. He called for acceleration of procedures for the approval of the bilateral investments treaty. Mr. Berisha expressed Albanian's resolution to observe sanctions against Serbia despite the damage it causes to the Albanian economy. "Any toleration in the embargo would be a support for the militarist policy of Milosevic," he said. Mr. Berisha demanded on the basis of the UN Charter compensation for the losses caused to the Albanian economy by the embargo regime. President Berisha pointed out as of great importance for peace the definition by President Bush and President Clinton in regard to Kosova, as a red line for the Serbian aggression. A special role in this direction has been played by the U.S. troops in Macedonia and the U.S. insistence in the observation of the UN sanctions against Serbia. Expressing his thanks to Ms. Albright for her role in the Security Council, for the resolution which imposed the embargo against Serbia and the call for the return of the CSCE observers to Kosova, President Berisha stressed that acceptance of the UN observers in Kosova is indispensable. He asked that the lifting of the embargo should be also conditioned with the resolution of the question of Kosova. "The question of the Albanians in the Balkans is a key to stability of the peninsula," he said. "The embargo is at present the only means to force such solutions." President Berisha discussed with U.S. officials cooperation in the military field, expressing his will for further promotion in this aspect. He also called for the support of the U.S. Government in regard to solution of the problem of Albania's foreign debt and other projects. President Berisha conveyed his cordial wishes for President Clinton and the Deputy President Gore and expressed his desire to welcome them to Albania. During the talks, they also dwelt on other bilateral questions and the situation in the region.
