Today our correspondent met the leader of the delegation, Jaba Ioseliani. We now present an excerpt from an interview which will be shown fully after this information program. [Begin recording] [Ioseliani] We knew from the outset that they would not agree to talks. Well, they would agree to talks, but they would not sign anything. We knew this very well. We were meeting them anyway, so that the world would know who we are dealing with, what their demands are and what they want. This is because people abroad do not understand what is happening. We are five million, while they are 70 [thousand]. How can they have done anything at all? We must be the culprits. This is because they are using everything, while we are not using anything. If they were in our position, they would trumpet their cause abroad, they would shout, cry and all that. We are not doing this. We knew the (?situation) very well and acted little by little. Still, they find it hard to understand the situation. There have been three meetings, right? British, Americans -- our friends were there. They were sympathetic, but they also thought that we must be saying something wrongly. They thought: not everything is as they [Georgians] say. When there are two parties, both must be guilty of something. That is how it is in general. But after they saw it this time, they went almost mad. Look what kind of people they [Abkhazians] are, they said, [words indistinct]. I did not say a word; I sat quiet. Are you really giving them autonomy, they asked us. Of course, we are, I said. But what else do they [Abkhazians] want, they asked. Ask them what they want, I said. [end recording]
