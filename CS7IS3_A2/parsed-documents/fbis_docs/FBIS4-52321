The move will dispel any doubt that the party will simply blindly jump to the defence of its member and let the case be swept under the rug after the embattled MP has made the denials. Notably, the internal investigation on the drug dealing charges was the first taken by the party executive committee under a new helmsman, Mr Banhan Sinlapa-acha, who assumed the party leadership Saturday. Mr Banhan also called upon people to come forward to see him if they have recriminating evidence against any other Chat Thai MPs who may have a hand in shady or illegal activities. Such uncharacteristic straightforwardness should be a healthy sign especially for the Chat Thai Party and also for the political atmosphere in general. Mr. Thanong's denial of all the charges made against him by the DEA and his announcement that he is ready to fly to the US to defend the case are not unexpected. Yet, these pronouncements by themselves cannot dispel all doubts that may still linger in the minds of many people who are well aware of the MP's background or who heard what he said during the much-publicised press conference at the Parliament last Friday. He could repeat the same denials 100 more times anywhere in this country, but it will simply be a self-deception if he expects more people to take him seriously. The lingering scepticism is not likely to vanish unless he shows his courage to prove his innocence by deed rather than words -- that is to face his accuser in the US district court. It is not impossible that the whole saga may be a well-calculated ploy to discredit the Chat Thai Party and to divert public attention from all the problems and negative events confronted by the Government as suggested by some Opposition MPs. But this is a totally different issue from that of Thanong's. A clear answer must be put forward by the Chat Thai Party before the case could be put to rest. The party's five-man committee to probe the drugs scandal has been assigned with a daunting task to find out the facts and to make public the result of the findings. At stake is not the reputation of Thanong, but, more importantly, that of the party which has been tarnished more or less. Therefore, the probe team must be impartial and, at the same time, broadminded. To get the facts, it is necessary that the committee must seek information and evidence from the accuser which is the DEA, the Office of Narcotics Control Board, the Police Department or even the National Security Council. In the meantime, the embattled Nakhon Phanom MP who should be regarded as innocent until proven otherwise, must be given the opportunity to prepare his defence. Mr Thanong's predicament is, after all, just the tip of the iceberg of the shady or illegal business activities that several of our politicians, senior police and military officers and senior civil servants are believed to be involved in and which are yet to be exposed -- if they ever get to be exposed at all. There have been talks or reports of some parliamentarians acting as mafia bosses, operating illegal casinos and surrounding themselves with bodyguards or gunmen, or MPs who talk persuasively about forest conservation in the Parliament but who own and operate sawmills which clandestinely accept illegal logs. Ironically, these men can manage to stand tall in society and accorded due respect. Chat Thai is a big party which is made up of members of diverse backgrounds and business activities -- some of whom are known to be involved in unlawful or unethical activities. The party should also be well aware of its problem of reputation and recognition, especially among the well-educated public. If the party is to gain the trust and recognition of the public, its first priority should be to clean up its image which, in the past, has been tainted by its close association with or its subservient attitude toward politically ambitious military officers and the lack of political conscience. With a new leader in charge, the Thanong case will hopefully provide a fresh start for the Chat Thai Party to project a new image and to take a new political course that will be more acceptable to the general public.
