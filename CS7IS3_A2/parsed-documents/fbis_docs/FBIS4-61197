After three hours of talks held behind closed doors Deputy Chairman [as received] of the Azeri Parliament Afiyaddin Dzhalilov answered journalists' questions. "It is difficult to say yet whether any document will be signed during the meeting. A discussion about the withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the Azeri territory, return of refugees and the establishment of a reliable ceasefire is underway," Dzhalilov said. Chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko said in a television interview that for the success of the talks Karabakh should be considered a party involved in the conflict. Asked about the attitude of the Azeri delegation to this statement, Dzhalilov pointed out that "we proceed from the assumption that the conflict has turned into a war and Azerbaijan and Armenia should settle it by peaceful means. What is at issue today is that the problem should not be "buried in sand" since the war is going on on the territory of Azerbaijan. A million refugees are living in tents. Therefore, common sense should prevail," Dzhalilov said.
