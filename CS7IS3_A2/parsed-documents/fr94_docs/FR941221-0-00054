ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule makes final an interim rule published on May 3, 1994. The May 3, 1994 interim rule amended HUD's section 8 regulations for newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated housing projects to provide for the system of occupancy preferences in certain section 8 assisted housing authorized by subtitle D of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. Subtitle D allows owners of section 8 projects originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families to provide preferences to elderly families in selecting tenants for available units in those projects. Owners that elect to provide preferences to elderly families as authorized by subtitle D also must reserve no less than a statutorily determined number of units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly families. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 20, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara Hunter, Acting Director of the Planning and Procedures Division, Office of Multifamily Housing Management, Office of Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 6184, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone number (202) 708&hyph;3944 (voice) or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD). (These telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22916), HUD published an interim rule that adopted the system of occupancy preferences authorized by Subtitle D (sections 651&hyph; 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (``HCD Act of 1992''). Subtitle D, entitled ``Authority to Provide Preferences for Elderly Residents and Units for Disabled Residents 1 in Certain Section 8 Assisted Housing'' and codified at 42 U.S.C. 13611&hyph;13620, allows an owner of a covered section 8 housing project to elect to provide preferences to elderly families in selecting tenants for available units in the project, subject to certain statutory requirements. An owner who makes this election also must reserve a percentage of units, not to be less than the percentage determined according to a formula set out in the statute, for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. 2 1 Definitions for ``elderly families'' and ``disabled families'' are codified in section 3(b) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act). Section 3(b) was amended by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act. Where the definition for ``elderly families'' has, since 1974, encompassed disabled families, the amended section 3(b) now defines ``elderly families'' as families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons at least 62 years old. Thus, under the revised definition, a disabled person does not qualify as an elderly family solely because of the person's disability. Section 3(b) defines ``disabled families'' to mean families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons with disabilities. ``Person with disabilities'' is defined to mean a person who: (1) Has a disability as defined in section 223 of the Social Security Act; (2) is determined pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of HUD, to have a physical, mental or emotional impairment which is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration, substantially impedes his or her ability to live independently, and is of such a nature that such ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions; or (3) has a developmental disability as defined in section 102 of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act. The Department's regulations for the terms defined in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act for the assisted housing programs are published at 24 CFR part 812. The 1992 HCD Act amendments to section 3(b) of the 1937 Act will be reflected in changes to 24 CFR part 812 that will be made by separate rulemaking. Accordingly, unless the context indicates otherwise, reference to the terms elderly families, disabled families, and near-elderly families in this preamble is reference to thee terms as defined in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act. 2 Under section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as revised by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act, the term ``near-elderly families'' is defined as families whose heads (or their spouses) or sole members are persons who are 50&hyph;61 years old.
