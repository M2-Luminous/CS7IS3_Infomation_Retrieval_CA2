The president of the organisation, Rony Brauman, also accused the UN of "shamelessly capitulating" in the face of the Bosnian Serb offensive against Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia which has now all but fallen. "While Gorazde was drowning under a barrage of fire, we were being told that a ceasefire was agreed on the ground, that we were headed for a peaceful settlement, and that all was well," Brauman said. "What is at stake is the fate of other so-called safe havens," he said. What was to stop Serb forces from attacking other UN-declared safe havens in the wake of their success at Gorazde, he asked. Meanwhile some 200 wounded were awaiting evacuation from Gorazde and two Medecins sans Frontieres doctors still operating in the town's hospital were working in horrendous conditions, Brauman said. Two International Committee of the Red Cross representatives and four from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees also remained in the town where 65,000 residents and refugees underwent renewed shelling Monday morning. "At the hospital, it's chaos. Bullets are whizzing through the windows into patients' rooms, shells are exploding in the hospital garden sending deadly shrapnel into the rooms of this so-called neutral area," Brauman said. The emergency room is full of dead and wounded, civilians and soldiers," according to the MSF doctors on the spot.
