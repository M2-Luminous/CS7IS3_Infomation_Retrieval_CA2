A committee on general and municipal elections has recently started operating at Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in East Jerusalem. The committee, headed by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, deputy head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington negotiations, is working on the structure and powers of the council and on the manner in which the elections will be held. The committee members, some of whom are lawyers, represent the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Center for Statistics, set up several months ago in Jerusalem, has started drafting lists of Palestinian residents in the territories which will help in the preparation of voters lists. The elections committee is about to send 30 Palestinian academics to Germany to study the issues of general and municipal elections. The studies, sponsored by the Germans, will include the management and conduct of elections, methods of defining constituencies, and so on. The course will start at the beginning of June and will last three weeks. At the end of the course, the academics will return and serve as instructors in local classes. According to the Declaration of Principles [DOP] of 13 September 1993, general elections for the Palestinian self-government council are to be held in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank nine months after the DOP goes into effect and after the negotiations on the council and the elections are completed. According to the DOP timetable, the elections were supposed to be held in July but, due to the delay in the completion of the negotiations on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, the elections will probably be postponed. Palestinian sources have reported that municipal elections may be held in the territories before the elections to the autonomy council take place.
