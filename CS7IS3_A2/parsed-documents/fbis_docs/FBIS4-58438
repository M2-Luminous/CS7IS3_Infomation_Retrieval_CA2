This meeting cut off the meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and 'Arafat. The forum of the Rabin-'Arafat meeting was expanded to include Ministers Peres and Sarid and Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli peace delegation, on the Israeli side, and Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, on the PLO side. Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign Ministry, and Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, later joined the talks as well. While the meeting between Christopher and 'Arafat is going on, the meeting Ministers Peres, Sarid, and the Israeli delegation members are holding with the Palestinian representatives, headed by Nabil Sha'th, is continuing. Our correspondent Arye Gus notes that the inclusion of Savir and Singer indicates that the sides have reached the formulation stage.
