Certain Army and government officials, declaring that the PKK has been rendered ineffective, have hinted a certain victory this summer. Despite repetitive attacks by security forces, the PKK survived last winter with losses in personnel but little loss of support and new recruits. Reports from sources close to the PKK are that once more the organization is preparing for a series of spring attacks. Observers had mistakenly expected, on the basis of PKK statements, that the local elections and Newroz would be eventful. Instead, the PKK has not done what it threatened to do. Sources close to the organization argue that the reason for this partly lies behind PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's call for a cease-fire to the Kurdish Conference held in Brussels last month. This, however, is not the whole aspect of the case. The main reason for PKK's silence is the unexpected deployment of new troops and security forces in the troubled region. Approximately, 400,000 soldiers, police officers, special teams, intelligence units and village guards are on duty in the area. The PKK currently is trying to avoid drawing any attention to itself and in the process is avoiding organized attacks. It is aware that the smallest attack would face a large military operation. The organization, not wanting to suffer any further losses, chooses to stay inactive or, rather, to lie in wait for the time being. The second reason behind this passive mood is that there has been an international diplomatic reaction to the issue of Turkey's "solution" for the Kurdish problem. Especially the lifting of the immunity of pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) deputies, followed by their arrest, has caused concern in Western Europe and the United States. It should not be ignored that PKK attacks at such a time would not have done the organization any good. The fact that the DEP deputies who were expelled from the political arena tried to solve the problem through political means with contacts with Europe and the United States was also effective. When DEP members caused attention to focus on Ocalan's proposal for a political solution and the arrest of their deputies, the Western world placed more emphasis on their demands that a political solution be found to the problem. The view of the Western world that Kurds seeking legal solutions faced oppression strengthened. Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who claims that she influenced the West in its banning of the PKK, missed one aspect of the issue: The Western countries, while stating the reason for the banning of the organization, recommended that a political solution be found as soon as possible. Recent developments imply the time given to Turkey for this is expiring. The lack of violent attacks by the PKK in southeastern Turkey also implies that the legal and illegal Kurdish movements want to boost their "diplomatic drive." The PKK is waiting in ambush, ever ready to return to violence. But while waiting, it is also planning new tactical policies. Although the PKK claimed that the election results were as they had expected them to be, this organization's call for a boycott of the March 27 elections was not as successful as it predicted. But it has to be admitted that the participation in the elections was not as high as the state had thought it would be. The PKK is now trying to establish a dialogue with the newly elected mayors. According to reports coming from the region, the PKK is relaying its demands to the newly elected mayors and telling those who refuse to meet these to leave the region. Sources claimed this week that Diyarbakir's newly elected Welfare Party Mayor Ahmet Bilgin actually wanted to withdraw his candidacy before the elections but was prevented from doing so under pressure from Regional Governor Unal Erkan. In conclusion, it can be said that despite the blows it has received, the PKK has managed this year as well to survive the winter. The organization is now laying in ambush, trying to avoid the blows delivered by Turkish forces. But the Kurdish problem is still there, needing more than ever to be solved.
