A. Trakhtengerts, Institute of Control Problems, Moscow; UDC 62-50:658.512] [Abstract] This paper gives a general overview of the use of computers in the design of multi-component systems. The article begins by describing the concept of computerized teleconferencing, where all participants see the same thing on their screens and can act on it while communicating in real time. It is noted that collaborations of researchers are no longer limited by geography, and that international collaborations are becoming more and more common. The problem of evaluating the complexity of a task is discussed. Breaking down a project into parts which can be worked on by different teams speeds the design process, as does the use of expert systems. Limits on the number of designers and workstations require coordination of resources and efforts. A flow chart shows how work can be organized. The process of limiting the number of variants to examine and selecting the best variant is described mathematically. Integration of components and selection of optimal designs from the point of view of integrating them with other components are addressed. Basic concepts involved in the design and construction of a network for designers are outlined, as well as the connection of separate networks with gateways or by uniting them into one network. Multitasking and servers are described. Figures 5; tables 4; references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
