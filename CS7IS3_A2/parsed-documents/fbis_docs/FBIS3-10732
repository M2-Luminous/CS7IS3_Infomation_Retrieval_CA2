During a brief ceremony in the Camellia Garden at La Moneda Palace, Minister Molina pointed out the most important points of the new law. [Begin Molina recording] This law introduces a contracted or dialed multicarrier system that will allow the public to choose the company with which they want to place their long distance calls, both national and international. This choice may be made from call to call, by dialing the identification code of the carrier the user chooses, or by signing a contract with a determined carrier to channel all their calls through that company. [end recording] The law also establishes the obligatory interconnection of telecommunications networks, in the case of public services, and the mediating services offered by the long distance service. [Begin Molina recording] Another important step taken by this law is the adoption of measures facilitating the modernization of the telephone networks, which will mean cheaper telephone fares. The telecommunications development fund plays an important role in giving the entire public access to telephone services, in that it includes low income users whom market laws did not accommodate. Despite this important step there still remain pending tasks, like strengthening the government's ability to control and establish norms in order to surmount the imbalance existing between the regulating agency and the regulated companies. This is therefore a pending challenge for the incoming administration. [end recording] Molina recalled the difficulties in approving this bill, mainly as a consequence of litigation among the telephone companies, which were overcome thanks to the support of everyone. After the ceremony President Aylwin did not wish to speak with the media.
