The source added that Perez Lopez was forced aboard a truck on Sunday and taken to La Florecita Farm, Chicomucelo. His whereabouts are unknown. The local human rights ombudsman [words indistinct] was kidnapped after he accepted an invitation to visit La Piedad Farm, where ranchers are accused of violating peasants' rights. The charge was filed in the Chiapas town of Comitan, about 1,400 km southeast [words indistinct] of Mexico City and about 200 km from the region of Los Altos, where an armed group emerged on 1 January.
