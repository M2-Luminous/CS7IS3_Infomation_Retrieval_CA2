FR940504-0-00011 FR940504-0-00003 Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments would reduce regulatory burdens imposed by Regulation Y and the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority and have no particular adverse effect on other entities. Effective Date The provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 553) relating to notice, public participation, and deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments because the changes to be effected are either procedural in nature and do not constitute a substantive rule subject to the requirements of that section, or grant an exemption and reduce regulatory burden. The APA grants specific exemptions from its requirements relating to notice, public participation and the deferred effective date requirements in these instances (12 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3)(A) and (d)(1)). Final Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) are contained in these changes.
