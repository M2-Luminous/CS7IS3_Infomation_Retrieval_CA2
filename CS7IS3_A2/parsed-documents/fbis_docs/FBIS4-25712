The construction of the Great Stupa and Memorial Hall for the 10th Bainqen was completed and a solemn inauguration ceremony was held. The management of religious affairs was strengthened and the regime and procedures on the administration of temples were worked out. In the meantime, efforts were made to guide a large number of people professing religious beliefs to contribute to social stability and economic development. Thanks to the profound concern and direct guidance of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council as well as the joint efforts of party and government organizations across Tibet, work for carrying out policies had been completed. During the period from 1980 to 1993, a total of 220 million yuan was spent for carrying out various policies, including nearly 100 million yuan for temples. The autonomous regional people's government has conscientiously implemented resolutions adopted by the regional people's congress and its standing committee and actively subjected itself to supervision. It has earnestly handled motions submitted by people's deputies and members of the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as well as letters and visits from the people. The autonomous regional people's government has submitted six local laws and regulations to the regional people's congress for examination and approval, and drawn up a number of administrative regulations. It has extensively launched a campaign for popularizing the laws; thus constantly enhancing legal concepts of the broad masses of cadres and people. The competition in creating model dual-support counties and cities, the joint armymen-policemen-civilian activities of constructing and creating spiritual civilization, and the work of resettling and giving special care to dependents of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen have made new progress. The education aimed at nurturing a new type of citizen with high ideals, moral integrity, a better education, and a strong sense of discipline and characterized by patriotism, socialism, and Marxist national and religious concepts was further popularized in depth. New achievements have been made in constructing socialist spiritual civilization.
