FR941003-0-00053 FR941003-0-00013 H. Section 314.101_Filing an Application and an Abbreviated Antibiotic Application and Receiving an Abbreviated New Drug Application (21 CFR 314.101) 63. The agency, on its own initiative, is revising §314.101(e) to add a new paragraph stating that the agency will refuse to file a 505(b)(2) application or receive an ANDA if the drug product that is the subject of the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA is protected by a 5-year exclusivity period under section 505(c)(3)(D)(ii) and (j)(4)(D)(ii) of the act. This amendment is consistent with the statutory language and §314.108(b)(2). I. Section 314.107_Effective Date of Approval of a 505(b)(2) Application or Abbreviated New Drug Application Under Section 505(j) of the Act) Proposed §314.107 was intended to codify the requirements under section 505(c)(3) and (j)(4) of the act regarding the effective dates of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA. For example, if the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant certified that there are no relevant patents, that patent information has not been submitted, that the patent has expired, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, and the patent owner has not brought suit for patent infringement, proposed §314.107(b)(1) would treat the date FDA issues an approval letter as the effective date of approval. If the 505(b)(2) applicant or ANDA applicant certified that the patent would expire on a specific date, proposed §314.107(b)(2) would treat that specific date as the effective date of approval. Proposed §314.107(b)(3) described several situations in which the effective date of approval could vary, depending upon the disposition of patent litigation. Proposed §314.107 also implemented the ``180-day exclusivity period'' described in section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act. In brief, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act states that if an ANDA contains a paragraph IV patent certification (declaring the patent to be invalid or not infringed) and the ANDA is for a drug for which a previous ANDA containing a paragraph IV patent certification has been submitted, approval of the subsequently submitted ANDA will be made effective 180 days after the date FDA receives from the previous ANDA applicant notice of the first commercial marketing of the drug or the date a court holds the patent that is the subject of the patent certification to be invalid or not infringed, whichever date is earlier (see section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act). Proposed §314.107(c) provided that an applicant must be the first ANDA applicant to submit a substantially complete application with a paragraph IV certification and must have been sued for patent infringement in order to qualify for 180-day exclusivity. 64. One comment asked FDA to permit any person to contact FDA informally to determine whether the listed patent information was correct and later petition the agency to correct any errors. As proposed, §314.107 did not provide for inquiries concerning patent information. Sections 314.53(f) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii) describe the procedures that an applicant can use to question the validity of patent information. In brief, if an applicant disputes the accuracy or relevance of patent information, it should first notify FDA in writing and state the reasons for the disagreement. FDA will then request that the relevant NDA holder confirm the validity of the patent information, but will not change the patent information itself unless the NDA holder withdraws or amends the patent information. The agency believes that these procedures for determining the validity of patent information are sufficient, and, therefore, declines to adopt the change suggested by the comment. 65. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended §314.107(b)(1) to state that an approval will become effective on the date FDA issues an approval letter except as provided under paragraphs (b)(3), pertaining to approvals resulting from the disposition of patent litigation; (b)(4), pertaining to approvals where an applicant has submitted multiple certifications; and (c), regarding subsequent ANDA submissions. These changes are to clarify that there are other situations that may make an approval effective. 66. Two comments would revise proposed §314.107(b)(1)(iv) regarding a certification that a patent is ``invalid or will not be infringed.'' The comments would have this certification state that the patent is ``invalid and will not be infringed.'' FDA declines to adopt the suggested language. The provision simply paraphrases the statutory language for a paragraph IV certification (see section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) of the act). The agency has, however, amended the provision to account for a certification that a patent is unenforceable and, as stated earlier, removed the language regarding consent from the patent holder. 67. One comment asked FDA to amend proposed §314.107(b)(1)(iv)(B)( 2 ) to require NDA holders to have a role in or consent to licensing agreements between patent owners and ANDA applicants. The proposed rule would consider the effective date of approval for a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA to be the date FDA issues an approval letter if, among other things, the drug product is covered by a patent licensing agreement and the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA contains a statement that the applicant has been granted a patent license and a statement from the patent owner that it has a licensing agreement with the applicant for the proposed drug product and that the patent owner consents to an immediate effective date. As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA believes that the negotiations surrounding licensing agreements and the parties entering into such agreements are outside the scope of this rule. Additionally, as stated in the response to comment 43 above, the agency has deleted the provisions in §314.107(b)(1)(iv) relating to consent by a patent owner to an immediate effective date of approval for a licensee. 68. The agency, on its own initiative, has made minor grammatical changes and other revisions to §314.107 (b)(2) and (b)(3). These revisions replace ``Upon patent expiration'' with ``Patent Expiration'' and ``Upon disposition of patent litigation'' with ``Disposition of patent litigation.'' Additionally, the changes specify that the patent owner must receive the notice of certification and clarify, in §314.107(b)(3)(i)(B), the effective date of approval. 69. Proposed §314.107(b)(3) described the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA upon disposition of patent litigation. Under proposed §314.107(b)(3)(i)(A), if an applicant certified that the relevant patent was invalid or would not be infringed, and the patent owner or its representative brought suit for patent infringement, the effective date of approval for the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA would be 30 months after the date of receipt of the notice of certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement by the patent owner or its representative unless a court extended or reduced the 30-month period. Proposed §314.107(b)(3)(i)(B) described the effective date of approval of a 505(b)(2) application or an ANDA upon disposition of patent litigation when the patented drug product also qualified for 5 years of market exclusivity. Proposed §314.107(b)(3)(ii) through (b)(3)(iv) represented additional modifications to the effective date of approval due to court decisions or orders. One comment concerned the proposed language in §314.107(b)(3)(i) regarding the 30-month period. The comment would amend this provision to shorten or lengthen the 30-month period pursuant to a court order.
