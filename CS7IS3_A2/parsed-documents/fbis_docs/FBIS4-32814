The demand was made after the United States renewed its most-favored-nation trading status with the PRC. The Foreign Ministry underscored in a declaration issued in the Chinese capital after Washington announced its decision that the renovation will create favorable conditions for strengthening and expanding bilateral economic and trade relations. Before the Clinton administration's announcement on trade with the PRC, U.S. businessmen had warned that interrupting trade relations would cost U.S. consumers more than $10 billion. Diplomatic sources in Beijing do not rule out that the existing ties could be reinforced by a visit by U.S. President Clinton to Beijing sometime this year.
