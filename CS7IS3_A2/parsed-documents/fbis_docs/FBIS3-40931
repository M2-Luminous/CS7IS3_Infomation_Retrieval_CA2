Commenting on the possibility of signing any final document on eliminating nuclear arms on Ukrainian territory during the talks in Moscow between the U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian presidents -- as hastily reported by Ostankino Television -- and on a bilateral meeting between the Ukrainian and U.S. presidents, Yuriy Serheyev, chief of Foreign Ministry Information Department, in particular said: [Begin Serheyev recording] As of today, I cannot say that a final document has already been drafted; I cannot say what form this document will take. That is why the scheduled tripartite conference in Moscow may have any form. If the final [draft] of the document is not completed, the Moscow conference is likely to be of consultative nature and aimed at coordinating aspects which still need to be coordinated. If the Moscow meeting manages to resolve uncoordinated issues, the document should take some form. I want to draw your attention to [word indistinct] commentaries, or I would rather say biased commentaries regarding the translation of Mr. Gore's statement which can be interpreted as an agreement or a treaty. As you see, at this stage, it is better to speak about a document rather than agreement or treaty. [Serheyev continues] Discussions over the form and essence of this document are still continuing, in Ukraine's governing circles as well. I want to stress that the Moscow summit will be preceded by a short meeting in Kiev. The possibility and likeliness of such a meeting were discussed very thoroughly through diplomatic channels. I also want to point out that as stated in yesterday's declaration by the Council of Ministers' and presidential press service, the main theme of the meeting will be the discussion of a wide range of issues concerning bilateral relations. This is very essential. Moreover, this statement is not unilateral; it was coordinated. There is a mutual desire on both sides to discuss bilateral relations at this meeting. This is not a bad example and not a bad result demonstrating that prospects are opening for a more constructive dialogue and more constructive relations with the United States in the spheres discussed in the course of Mr. Christopher's visit to Kiev. In particular [we should] balance our relations, direct them into the stream of military-political cooperation, and in the first place, economic cooperation. This visit once again emphasizes the attention paid Ukraine and importance of developing bilateral relations with her. Naturally, in the course of the [Kiev] meeting, issues tackled in Brussels and those to be tackled in Moscow will be discussed. [end recording]
