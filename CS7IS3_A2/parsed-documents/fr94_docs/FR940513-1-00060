FR940513-1-00060 FR940513-1-00015 Public Participation The policy of the National Park Service is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding this proposed rule to the address noted at the beginning of this rulemaking. The Grand Teton National Park staff will also be making public notices in local papers and contacting representatives of the local climbing community. Drafting Information The primary authors of this proposed rule are Colin W. Campbell, Law Enforcement Specialist, and Mark L. Magnuson, Jenny Lake Sub-District Ranger. Paperwork Reduction Act This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Compliance With Other Laws The Department of the Interior has determined that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), because it deletes an existing requirement and gives more discretion to the park visitor. The NPS has determined that this proposed rulemaking will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment, health and safety because it is not expected to: (a) Increase public use to the extent of compromising the nature and character of the area causing physical damage to it; (b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature and characteristics of the area, or cause physical damage to it; (c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or (d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants. Based on this determination, this proposed rulemaking is categorically excluded from the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by Departmental Regulations in 516 DM 6, (49 FR 21438). As such, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared. This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.
