Do you believe that the intervention you have been advocating since yesterday can be of some use? [Juppe] I hope so, with all my heart. We have been very much involved in the last few weeks, ever since this tragedy, which goes beyond the limits of horror, began. First of all, on the humanitarian front, you must know that there are already a number of nongovernmental organizations, the Red Cross, the UNHCR, with the help of France... [Correspondent, interrupting] Excuse me, Mr. Juppe, but it is quite clear that humanitarian operations are not much use -- they are not, at any rate, sufficient... [Juppe, interrupting] One moment, I would like to explain what we have done, because we cannot simplify things. We did this. We must remind people of this, we are still doing it today. There are people on the ground doing this, trying to evacuate young orphans from Kigali in order to get them to safety from the threat of extermination. Second, we have tried to obtain the dispatch of a United Nations force, and we had to fight for this in New York, but it is still not on its way. Finally, we tried to obtain a cease-fire. It was signed on paper yesterday in Tunis, thanks to all the diplomatic efforts we made. [Correspondent] Yes, but it does not seem that it is being respected. [Juppe] It is not being respected, and this is why today, faced with the impossibility of imposing a cease-fire, faced with the delays at the United Nations regarding the 5,500 men due to be sent to Rwanda, France has said: We are prepared to go in. We are prepared to go in because we have to put an end to the daily massacres. [Correspondent] Very well: Is France prepared to go in alone? [Juppe] No. We think that we have to go in with our European partners and with.... [Correspondent, interrupting] With whom, then, since the Belgians today... [Juppe, interrupting] Hang on, we cannot rush this, this is a serious matter... [Correspondent, interrupting]. No, but this is an important issue, because we would like you to answer our questions. The Belgians today said that they were not prepared to go in -- logistic aid, perhaps, but certainly not men... [Juppe, interrupting] You do know a lot, don't you? [Correspondent] This is what we have heard from Belgium. Great Britain also says no. Can you name any countries? [Juppe] If you allow me to say so, I would like to say that as soon as we broached this idea, without rushing into it, seriously of course, we tried to make some contacts. Those contacts were made this afternoon with our European partners, the Italians, the Belgians, the Spanish, and others, and we are currently examining what the response might be to France's initiative. There must also be African countries taking part in this operation, and we have already received positive responses from several countries that I will not name because you must realize that this is a complex and dangerous operation, and a degree of discretion is necessary. [Correspondent] By when do you expect results? [Juppe] We have to move quickly, I think, but, I repeat, this operation is dangerous and it must be properly organized, in cooperation with officials in the Defense Ministry. This is why the president, the prime minister, the defense minister, and I discussed this issue yesterday, as soon as the idea had been broached with our partners. [Correspondent] Do you envisage these soldiers being sent to Rwanda itself, or will they be based in neighboring countries for specific operations? [Juppe] This is a humanitarian operation. We are talking about going in to save people. In your earlier report, we saw the survivors fleeing on the roads; others are surrounded, under immediate threat of extermination, and these are the people we would like to protect. This is not a political intervention to separate one side from the other. It is a humanitarian operation to save people. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Even the Tutsi population, for whose protection this operation would be mounted, is not ready to welcome you. [Juppe] I perfectly understand this reaction. The massacres and the horror were such that a good dose of passion and misunderstanding resulted. We have to remove this misunderstanding. We are talking to Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials in Brussels and Rwanda at this very moment to try to clarify the situation with them. I heard this RPF official saying that we are going to occupy Rwanda. As I explained to you a short while ago, it is quite the contrary. We are not about to mount a political operation in favor of one side or another, but on the contrary, to protect the entire population, the Tutsi population, first and foremost, when it is threatened. I hope that in clarifying this, we are talking about the same objective. [Correspondent] Do you think that in this country, where an unimaginable level of barbarism has been reached, humanitarian work can be done without the backing of a military operation? [Juppe] Yes, obviously, it depends on what we do. We should know what we want. Forty-eight hours ago, or three or four days ago, France was accused of not doing enough. Today, we are the only country to say we are ready to go in there and we are still being told this is not enough. I think the decision -- which is a proposal, I must stress -- should be coordinated with our partners, with the green light from the United Nations, for a limited period of time and on the basis of clear objectives. We are not going to war in Rwanda, that is not the objective, let us be serious. We are going to mount an operation to save lives within the framework I described earlier. France is the first to make such a proposal; I think this deserves to be taken into consideration. If everyone says no, then everyone will assume their own responsibility. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] A final question, on Bosnia. Will our troops be back soon, has a date been set for their return from Bosnia? [Juppe] Everybody knows that if nothing happens this summer, we will have to draw the necessary conclusions. People mention only the negative aspects of the conflict at the moment, in the vein of: What if it does not work? I would like to stress one point. A cease-fire has been holding for 10 days now. It took effect on 10 June and it has been observed. Some insignificant skirmishes have taken place here and there, but generally, peace has been restored, or at least the cease-fire is holding. Sarajevo is living again. The European Union has been busy laying down conditions for rebuilding the town of Mostar, devastated by war, with police forces working under the banner of the Western European Union. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] So our troops will remain there for the moment? [Juppe] Yes, our troops will remain there. [passage omitted]
