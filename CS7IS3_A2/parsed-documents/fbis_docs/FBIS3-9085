The Muslims are also hoping that NATO's threats last month will be effective. NATO recently threatened to bomb the Serbian heavy artillery positions if it is not withdrawn to a distance of 20 kilometers from the besieged Bosnian capital or placed under the supervision of the UN forces. Despite what has been said about the agreement between the Muslims and the Croats being fragile, and that observers believe that this agreement does not mean the complete end of the fighting between the two sides, there is great optimism regarding an extended truce. This truce, if it is destined to continue, is enough to relieve the pressure on the Muslims in central Bosnia and give them a chance to concentrate on the territories occupied by the Serbs. It is also natural for the Bosnian Army to continue preparing to build a strong military base to confront any future dangers. That army's preparations are expected to rely on supplies coming through the center of Bosnia and Croatia -- as was the case before the war erupted between the Croatians and the Muslims -- in light of the cease-fire and the political understanding between the two sides. Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said he hoped that NATO will maintain its credibility regarding the warning it issued to the Bosnian Serbs. He called for lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia so that it can defend itself. He believes that Britain is putting pressure on the United States to weaken the enthusiasm of U.S. President Bill Clinton for the Muslim Bosnians. Ganic strongly attacked the European Union's mediator in Bosnia, David Owen. He said: "We do not want to deal with this arrogant Briton, who becomes more and more arrogant every time he appears on the international television networks." In an interview with AL-SAFIR conducted at the presidential palace in Sarajevo, Ganic said: "We hope that NATO will keep its credibility. If NATO strikes the Serbs, we will be very grateful. If it does not, we will remain steadfast and fight until our territory is liberated. All we ask of the West is to let us defend ourselves and lift the embargo. Sarajevo is not the whole of Bosnia. Over 70 percent of our territory needs to be liberated. Getting back this territory is our duty to our people." He added: "Everything the crazy Serbs are doing is being permitted and accepted because they have not encountered anyone to deter them. The international organization [UN] is playing the role of the doctor who is trying to cure the wound superficially because he does not want to remove the microbe that causes it. We in Bosnia are telling them to let us do that for ourselves. We do not want your help, but do not get in our way and hamper us." [Maghniyah] Do you believe that the West really wants to defend the Muslims in Bosnia? [Ganic] I believe that the West is concerned about maintaining its credibility and appearing in history as an honorable party. World public opinion is on our side and supports our cause. However, nowadays we are living in a fascist age. Ethnic cleansing is now condoned in the eyes of the Europeans. If the Serbs insist on altering Bosnia's borders, we will have a real state of chaos in the whole of Europe. Russia today supports the Serbs. There is a prevalent opinion in Europe hoping that the Serbs continue to kill the Muslim Bosnians so that Europe will have ample justification to deal with them once and for all with the approval of the Russians. However, all this will happen at the expense of our people. I personally believe that Britain is putting pressure on the United States to undermine the Clinton Administration's enthusiasm for backing the Muslims. France was not on our side but it was not able to oppose striking the Serbs. But Germany had an honorable and very clear stand in our favor. This is why I am somewhat optimistic regarding the fate of the Muslims in Bosnia. [Maghniyah] It is said that you head the extremist Muslim current. [Ganic] I am a nationalist, not an extremist. I am an educated man who studied in the United States. But today, I lead my people because they are being killed. I asked the Muslims to train to fight because the Briton Lord Owen would not negotiate with us if we had no weapons. When the battles between the Muslims and Croats started, I asked Lord Owen why he was negotiating with the latter. He said because they had weapons. We are defending ourselves and they are accusing us of extremism. [Maghniyah] Do you want to establish an Islamic republic in Bosnia? And are you really Muslims? [Ganic, after a long silence] This is a cheap question. We are Europeans and we believe in our religion and respect all other religions. However, Europe's disregard for us has created some extremist currents. The Europeans discovered about two years ago that we are Muslims. This is why they are not helping us. To confirm this, some Muslims in some Islamic countries told us that Europe will annihilate us even if we change our names and identities. These days, we find some individuals in Bosnia actually becoming religious because they are afraid of the results of war. But talk about an Islamic republic is not accurate. Only the Muslims agree among themselves in Bosnia now; and I believe that this will cause future economic problems with all those who are fighting the Muslims. As for extremism, I say: Yes, there are many hundreds of Muslim fighters who have come from various parts of the Islamic world to fight alongside us. But I told them to go back home. I said: You are only a few hundred, no more. Had you been 50,000, I would have led you into battle in the name of Islam. [Maghniyah] Your stance on the Serbs is clear, but it is not clear on the Croats. Why is that? [Ganic] No. My stance on the Croats is also clear. We fight anyone who follows the policies of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. But there are some Croats fighting alongside the Muslims. I tell all the Croats right now: If Bosnia had not existed, Croatia would have had to create Bosnia to protect itself. Anyone who stands in our way will be dragged along with us. We have many options that we have not yet used. We are keeping them until the appropriate time. [Maghniyah] What are these methods? [Ganic] I do not want to talk about them. They are forcing us into a gangster war. I do not want to add anything more. [Maghniyah] Who are they? [Ganic] The extremist Serbs and Croats. If they push us in this direction, no one will be saved. The war will go on for many years. Whoever takes land by force will not be able to keep it. However, we shall not abandon the principle of negotiations; and the way to peace is open to whoever wants to follow it. Lord Owen destroyed the theory of "land for peace," as has happened in Palestine. We do not want to have any dealings with this arrogant Briton. But the problem is that we did not appoint him, therefore we cannot dismiss him. He appears on the television screens every day, which only makes him more arrogant. [Maghniyah] Do you still want an outlet on Nayum Sea [name as published]? [Ganic] Nayum is Bosnian territory. We cannot accept being besieged. We want an airport and a port. When I am in an airplane and we fly over Bosnia, I see the flames of democracy burning here. Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and will always be the capital, just as Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine. War has caused many woes for everyone in the former Yugoslavia. We want these woes to end. We have no other choice, and we want an outlet on the sea. If they do not give us this outlet, we will drown everyone else along with us. I ask the Arab and Islamic countries to put pressure on the United States, France, and Britain. There are many ways to boycott Western goods and freeze Western projects. I thank the Muslims for standing at our side. I tell the Muslims to be careful. There is a great deal of discrimination in Europe if you are Muslim. I did not know this when I was young because I did not grow up like that. But, this is a sad reality.
