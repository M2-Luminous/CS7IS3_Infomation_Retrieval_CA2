So far this year, 150 people have been arrested and 18 clandestine landing strips destroyed. The latest raids have weakened the cartel's powerful communications system. The first communications base was raided north of Cali. The Candelaria Limitada brick company was used as a front for the operation. The "National Newscast" has learned that alleged drug trafficker Diego Montoya Sanchez, alias Don Diego, owns the company. The authorities are currently pursuing Montoya. During the raid, the authorities located checking accounts, financial statements, seven hand-held communications radios, battery chargers, and batteries. They also found documents of (Acetel Limitada), another communications company, with the registrations for 20 hand-held radios and permits from the Communications Ministry. The authorities found copies of checks for over 500 million pesos. The Joint Special Command raided a second company, (Compania Conalviver), also north of Cali. The communications center had no permit from the Communications Ministry. The command seized four screens, monitors, communication radios, and other equipment. According to the state's intelligence corps, these communication companies cover the entire Valle del Cauca Department and serve as fronts for the Cali Cartel to make transactions and contact drug traffickers at the service of that cartel.
