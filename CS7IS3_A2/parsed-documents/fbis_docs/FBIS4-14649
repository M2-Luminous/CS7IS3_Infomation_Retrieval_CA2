He had occupied this post since the establishment of the ministry and had been responsible for the ministry budget and provisions. According to Vasiliauskas, no disagreements had been between him and the former and present ministers. "I could not do my job very good with such small sums of money the ministry had," Vasiliauskas told ELTA. Last year, for example, the ministry was allotted 131 million litas to maintain the people. The only way out, according to Vasiliauskas, was to diminish the defence system. Vasiliauskas admitted that he did not envy the one who would occupy his former post. Vasiliauskas is going to have a private job.
