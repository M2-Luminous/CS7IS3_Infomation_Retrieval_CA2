FBIS3-7425 "dreas060_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 Thailand Prime Minister on U.S. `Charge' on Prostitution BK2503125694 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in Thai 0530 GMT 25 Mar 94 BK2503125694 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network Language: Thai Article Type:BFN [Text] Asked about the U.S. charge that Thailand has not made any serious efforts to solve the problem of prostitution, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that he had read the report on this matter from the Foreign Ministry. In fact, he noted, the United States has not made any criticism of Thailand. The government has established clear guidelines to solve this problem. He said: [Begin Chuan recording] As a matter of fact, the United States has not criticized Thailand. The report disseminated by the news agency was inaccurate. I read the report early this morning. The government has established clear guidelines to deal with this problem, including the presence of foreign prostititutes in Thailand. Last week, the authorities reportedly arrested British prostitutes here. We do not want prostitutes from Burma or any neighboring countries coming to earn their living in Thailand. We are monitoring the problem closely. I forwarded this matter to the Interior Ministry, because whenever they bring this issue up they always charge that our police are profiting from the business. I am asking our police authorities to do something, because the problem really tarnishes our country's image. I believe that some policemen, not all of them, are corrupt. The allegations of prostitution in Ranong Province and that of hill tribes girls being lured into prostitution are partly true. After all, the report is about the human rights issue which happens to cite the problem of prostitution, not criticism of Thailand. I reaffirm that it is the policy of this government to make serious efforts to solve the prostitution problem. Give us some time. [end recording]
