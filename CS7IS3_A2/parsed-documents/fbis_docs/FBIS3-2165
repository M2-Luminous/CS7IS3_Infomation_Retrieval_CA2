As a financial company with world-wide experience, Merrill Lynch should go on providing China with assistance and advice in the financial sector, said Chinese Premier Li Peng. He was speaking at a meeting here this morning with Daniel Tully, the Merrill Lynch Group's chairman and chief executive. Recalling his meeting with Tully's predecessor, Williams Schreyer, last spring, Li noted that Merrill Lynch had done a lot in helping to determine China's credit rating and in its bonds issues on overseas markets. "Much has been achieved and we are satisfied with our cooperation with your group," Li told the U.S. visitors. People in the United States are optimistic about China's economic prospects, Tully said. After on-the-spot investigations, Merrill Lynch concluded that lots of projects in China have favorable conditions to attract overseas investment. Merrill Lynch is willing to serve and advise China in sectors such as electricity and iron and steel. Chinese Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli took part in the meeting. Founded in 1802, Merrill Lynch is the No. 1 securities company in the U.S. and has been ranked on top of the world's stocks and bonds institutions in recent years, sources said. Last year, it set up a representative office in Shanghai and its Beijing office is to be officially established in the near future.
