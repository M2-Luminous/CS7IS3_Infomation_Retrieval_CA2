Milan Knazko was elected first deputy chairman, and Roman Kovac and Viliam Vaskovic were elected deputy chairmen. Rudolf Filkus was also a candidate for the post of deputy chairman, but he did not gain the required number of votes. The proposal submitted by E. Bartosova that the number of deputy chairmen be increased to four to include J. Budaj was not passed. The delegates elected a 50-member DEUS Republican Council. R. Filkus and J. Budaj are members of it. Following Saturday's assembly, DEUS has 18 deputies in parliament. In the morning, each entity held a separate meeting, at which its delegates voted for the merger. We have learned that, shortly after the AD SR meeting, one of its delegates, Jozef Olejar, walked out. In response to a question from SME on the reason for his departure, M. Knazko said at a news conference that he was "not informed about it." According to him, Mr. Olejar probably "drew the conclusions for himself" from the vote on the merger. The joint meeting of the two entities was then held. At the beginning, 133 of the 140 delegates (70 each from the AD SR and APR) agreed with the merger, six abstained, and one was against. According to its adopted program, DEUS would like to represent a broad spectrum of liberal political views and values that express the idea of citizen-community-state. The program considers the most important objectives in the economic sphere to be ongoing support for the economy's restructuring and modernizing and speeding up privatization and making it more transparent so that the majority of state property becomes privately owned as soon as possible. DEUS wants to support the citizens' individual responsibility for their own social situation, and the priority in the foreign policy sphere is the Slovak Republic's orientation toward European integration. J. Findra, head of the Office of the President, read out to the assembly a letter of greetings from the president of the Republic. In it, the president emphasized, among other things, that politicians should set an example of correctness, tolerance, and polished manners. "Let us show that crudeness and demagoguery have no place in our politics. Let us show that decency and understanding are the characteristic traits of the citizens of our country and not big gestures and intolerance." DEUS Chairman J. Moravcik said after his election that the one failing of the Slovak political scene is its atomization. After the assembly, Deputy Chairman M. Knazko said the following in connection with speculation that a second Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] has been formed by the merger: "Do not speak of the devil; one is enough." He emphasized that "this merger was not short-term and purpose-oriented but was proceeded by a natural process from the Public Against Violence Movement via the HZDS." In response to a question from SME on whether representatives from all of the political parties were invited to the assembly and why a representative from the Christian Social Union [KSU], which is holding talks with the HZDS about a preelection coalition, was invited, Knazko said: "We invited the chairmen of both the HZDS and the Slovak National Party, but, to everyone's disappointment, they did not attend the assembly. The KSU, yes; we invited all of the parties that are mentioned in public opinion polls and may become our partners." [passage omitted]
