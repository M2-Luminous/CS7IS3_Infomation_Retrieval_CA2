Apart from the anticipated criticism from the opposition parties, her standing with the constitutionally neutral president, the powerful businessmen's lobby, TUSIAD, her junior coalition partner, SHP [Social Democrat People's Party], and even her own party, appears to be deteriorating. Despite her calls for a consensus on a war of economic salvation, opposition against her is growing visibly, fed with allegations of mismanagement and even corruption. Does anyone support Ciller, who came to power a year ago with promises of change? The Association of Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen (TUSIAD) does not. The prime minister, who once referred to the members of the lobby as "traitors," has already burned her bridges. President Suleyman Demirel, who drew Ciller into political life as his protegee, has been angered by her efforts to put the blame for the economic difficulties on the previous government, which was under his own leadership. She has also started a serious controversy with the president with her calls for extending the term of Chief of Staff Dogan Gures. Despite the displeasure shown by political circles at "alternative government formulas," including a scenario that involves the formation of a government by a team of technocrats -- a throwback to 1971 -- some True Path deputies continue their opposition to Ciller. Allegations about the involvement of her husband in state affairs further fuelled tensions, as well as the ambiguous financing of her trip to the United States for the graduation of her son. A schematic look at the mounting opposition reveals the following highlights: Mother Path Formula Following the 27 March local elections, business circles represented by TUSIAD met with opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz, to feel his pulse on a "Mother Path" coalition between his Motherland Party and Ciller's True Path. Yilmaz, who has habitually advocated a Mother Path coalition on the condition that Ciller leaves the party leadership, interpreted the move as a signal for fiercer opposition to Ciller, calling her "a finished-off prime minister." But he maintained that they would form a coalition if she left her post. Yilmaz also disclosed that business circles, who had been warm at first toward Ciller's April 5 package, now wanted him to "topple the government." "They think Ciller should resign right away. Each day she is in office costs the nation three months," Yilmaz said. "Considering the mess she has made, it would be better that some one who was not an economics professor was prime minister." But he also allowed that he was powerless to topple Ciller. "This should be done by the True Path deputies," he said. Yilmaz's call did not fall on deaf ears. Two True Path deputies, Koksal Toptan and Ibrahim Gurdal, said Ciller's resignation would be the "best thing that could be done for Turkey." Koksal advocated the Mother Path coalition. TUSIAD and Treason Ciller, defending her package, said that business circles were against it because it had not been in their interests. "Not supporting this package would be treason," she said, adding insult to injury. TUSIAD's answer was no milder than the prime minister's remark. The association, which has a long tradition of severe opposition to governments (it had taken newspaper ads to criticize Ecevit government in the pre-1980 era) this time used the television. TUSIAD Chairman Halis Komili said there were two keys to escaping from the economic crisis in the country -- the meticulous implementation of decisions, and confidence. "The government has lost on both counts. It gives no confidence and has no credibility," he said. Within 10 days, Osman Unsal, the undersecretary of Treasury whom Ciller called "half of her brain," quit his job. Gures Crisis Ciller received another setback when her conversation with two of her ministers on extending the term of Dogan Gures was leaked. Demirel fervently opposed the idea, saying the decision was anyway his. Ciller, however, maintained that it was entirely up to her to extend the term or not. The debate ended with Gures' own remarks: "This is no time for heroism nor gracious gestures. When the time comes, one has to transfer one's duties to someone else proudly." Gures said a week later that he would be resigning on September 1. But Demirel's insistence that Ciller should see "whether she can extend the term" created some serious discord between Demirel and Ciller, which was displayed in Ciller's pointed absence from the ceremony to see Demirel off on his trip to Egypt. Meanwhile, Yilmaz accused Ciller of trying to draw the Turkish Armed Forces into a political debate. Ozer Ciller Controversy "Wherever I dig, out pops Ozer Ciller," complained Ekrem Pakdemirli, the vice chairman of the Motherland, who deals with economics. Ozer Ciller's yacht, claimed to be worth TL [Turkish lira] 30 billion, was also used by Yilmaz: "Will those who cruise around in billion-lira yachts save the people who are stricken by poverty?" he asked. Ciller's own party adopted a similar line: "I wish we could take you out in disguise, so you can see the queues for bread," Irfan Koksalan, True Path's Ankara deputy, said in a party group meeting. "The present situation is due to inefficiency. People curse you and the True Path." Koksalan also targeted Ozer Ciller, saying he should not allow himself to be pictured in luxurious yachts. "It is claimed that your husband is influential in the appointment of bureaucrats and even ministers. You are the prime minister, give him a ministerial post and let's stop the allegations," he told Ciller. The prime minister, who took the rostrum after those remarks, defended Ozer Ciller. "The yacht is not new. We bought it long ago, but repaired it recently, so he can get some sea air. Is this a crime?" She was quoted as saying. "It is only worth one-tenth of the amount that is claimed." But according to press reports, Ciller gave her ministers a good scolding, accusing them of "not rising to the defense of Ozer Ciller." A daily claimed that Ciller charged the ministers of being glued to their chairs and red-plated cars. "But no one is indispensable," she allegedly hinted. The press was not spared Ciller's harsh words for their articles about her husband. "You have criticized him in everything. He could not even talk to friends. He cannot go out. Should he just play around to pass the time?" she told a group of journalists from HURRIYET. Blame-Throwing Game Ciller's less-than-constructive statements, coupled with her repeated attempts to lay the blame for the economic crisis on the previous government, sent True Path delegates to President Demirel. A subtle change was seen in the attitude of the president, who had generally refrained from criticizing the prime minister. Demirel drew attention to the fact that Ciller had been the state minister responsible from the economy in the previous government. "If someone has been in power for 11 months, wouldn't other people ask her what she has been doing during that time?" Demirel said in an interview. Demirel's criticism continued. "There is always the possibility of resignation," he said, implying, too, that Ciller could have resigned from the past government if she did not like the policies adopted. He also took a tough stance against attempts to get the military involved in politics. "Whoever wants to use the military as a means of support will regret the day he was born," he said. The Bill for U.S. Trip The latest controversy to appear is over who would foot the bill for Ciller's "private visit" to the United States in which she was to attend her son's graduation ceremony. The Prime Minister created much speculation by taking a large delegation of advisors, although she claimed the visit to be private. She defended herself by saying that the group of advisers, including her foreign policy adviser Volkan Vural, would have "gone anyway." While the opposition and members of her party criticized the visit, True Path Deputy Esat Kiratlioglu said since she was the prime minister, "she could do whatever she liked." "She is not the woman next door, she is our prime minister. Of course the state will foot the bill" he said. Ciller ended the controversy with a statement saying that she would pay the whole bill herself, including the cost of the 10 rooms being kept empty on the floor of her Boston hotel.
