The behavior of the French Government in the Rwandan affair is so well known that it is almost impossible for France to envisage (?deploying) its troops in our country. The French Government has never stopped supporting those who committed the atrocities which erupted and continue in Rwanda, mainly by remaining silent. This is a conniving silence in the face of all the massacres which destroyed and still destroy human lives in Rwanda, particularly since the beginning of the war in 1990, through its military support in terms of men and weapons. A large quantity of weapons deployed to exterminate the Rwandan population has been provided by France to the bloody Kigali regime. France also gave intensive military training to Presidential Guards and to Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militias which have caused such misery to befall the Rwandan population.
