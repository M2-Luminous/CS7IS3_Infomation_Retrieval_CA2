General Viljoen compares President de Klerk's actions to that of a "poor actor" trying, in a "one-man show" [preceding two words in English], "to regain support lost among his own people from other communities." This letter was in reaction to a challenge by President de Klerk on Wednesday at Postmasburg for General Viljoen to have the courage of his conviction and to do his duty by assuring that the "reasonable majority" of the Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] participates in the election. Shocking Tone Yesterday, in a written reply President de Klerk expressed his shock at the tone of Gen. Viljoen's open letter: "Malicious intent, personal insults, belittling of political opponents, and spite does not become you. This diminishes the good image so many South Africans have of you." In his letter Gen. Viljoen says: "Important components of the South African electorate, the Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Boers had to hear that they had missed the train. "In endless bilateral and trilateral talks they are taken from deadline to deadline, facing the arrogance of those `high up' who will `meet them' somewhere possible, like waiting at some side station for a train where you decide the time of arrival, and where they just have to fit in, whether or not their demands have been met. Where the people do not accept your concessions they are branded as `spoilers'." To this President de Klerk replies: "You lump together the Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Afrikaners as if they all share the same viewpoint. Nothing is further removed from the truth than this. Also, I am convinced that a majority in each of these three groups reject your viewpoint. As far as Afrikaners are concerned this has already been proven in two elections and two referendums." On the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Gen. Viljoen writes: "For this reason we asked: Give us a homeland before 27 April which would eventually house the larger portion of our people. When you and the ANC [African National Congress] refused, we asked: Give us the necessary constitutional guarantees so that we can get our homeland if we pass the necessary test to prove support for this homeland. However, in this regard we must have absolute certainty. As far as this issue is concerned I must say that we received more understanding from the ANC than from you and your party." To this Mr. de Klerk replies: "You are looking for an Afrikaner homeland with majority rule. Where would the borders for such a homeland be drawn in order to achieve your goal? Will all South African citizens, despite race or color, enjoy full political rights within those borders? Can you give the assurance that there will be no form of discrimination on the grounds of race or color in such a region? During our numerous discussions you have never succeeded in giving a sensible or convincing answer on this issue." General Viljoen takes the president to task for the "revolutionary climate which developed under your leadership because you have lost control. They (the Afrikaners) do not share your bravado because they know that a simple one man one vote system will result in them losing permanent control over their futures." In President de Klerk's reply he refers to the "clear framework" being created in the constitution "for the promotion of a homeland and self-determination, linked to a certain territory. This is the strategic option you have asked for." President de Klerk repeats his Postmasburg plea and renews his call to Gen. Viljoen not to allow himself to be "dragged along by the wild elements of the National Front who ... have already decided on resistance, rebellion, and protest." In what appears to be a direct reference to Gen. Viljoen's letter, President de Klerk said yesterday at The Strand: "If Gen. Viljoen wants to speak to me on Monday then my door is open to him. Each of the amendments to be made to the constitution this week is no gimmick, but addresses the fears of the Freedom Alliance in a practical manner."
