Mr. Tong said that China was reforming its banking system and owing to the state-owned pofessional banks being in the process of being switched to becoming state-owned commercialized banks, permitting foreign-funded banks to operate RMB-related business would be unfair competition prior to the establishment of the commercialized bank system in the country because of the great discrepancies in ways of management and the tax rate between foreign-funded banks and the domestically-funded banks. The opening to foreign banks by any country, he said, should be based on its own realities and China, in line with its own situation, first permitted foreign banks to operate foreign currency business and would later create the conditions for them to open to RMB-related business. Such opening, he added, would not be overall at the beginning. Places like Shenzhen and Xiamen, however, were permitted to open first since the ratio of major state-owned enterprises there was small, the economy there mainly dominated by the market economy and most of the banks there were commercial banks.
