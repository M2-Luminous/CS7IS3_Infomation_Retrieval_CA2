The Libyan paper AL JAHAF AL AHDAR carried part of his New Year address elucidating a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The paper noted in the preface that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is related to the maneuvers of the United States. Last year the U.S. and its followers, it said, led the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by inventing the "suspicion of nuclear development by North Korea" in an attempt to stifle Korean-style socialism centred on the masses. However, the Korean people who have experienced the superiority of socialism to capitalism through their life rose as one to defend their choice, gains, national dignity, the country and its independence and countered the moves of the enemy by declaring withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a semi-war state, the paper pointed out, and added: Their response was an unexpected, surprising blow to the provokers. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can cover be solved by means of pressure and threat. The New Year address was also reported by newspapers and radios of India, Zambia, the Netherlands, Britain, Nepal, China, Burundi, Guyana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Yemen. The Cameroonian paper LE CHEMIN carried the full text of the address.
