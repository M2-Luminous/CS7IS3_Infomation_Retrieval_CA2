FBIS3-13438 "drnes049_r_94001" FBIS-NES-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 India New Delhi Renews Dialogue Offer With Pakistan BK1103160794 Delhi All India Radio Network in English 1530 GMT 11 Mar 94 BK1103160794 Delhi All India Radio Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] New Delhi today renewed its offer to have a dialogue with Islamabad at various levels to resolve bilateral differences. It has, however, rejected the suggestion for allowing any fact-finding team of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] to visit Jammu and Kashmir. The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and his deputy Mr. Salman Khurshid have expressed the hope that Pakistan will now return to bilateral dialogue following its setback in Geneva. Mr. Dinesh Singh told reporters that New Delhi is waiting to hear from Pakistan about the resumption of the foreign secretary-level talks. On the outcome of the UN Human Rights Commission meeting, the external affairs minister said India has been able to convince international community about the false propaganda on alleged human rights violations in Kashmir. He said Iran, China, and the European Union, besides the United States, had advised Pakistan against pressing its resolution. Replying to a question, Mr. Singh regretted Saudi Arabia's decision to cosponsor Pakistan's resolution. He made it clear that the help of China and Iran at the Geneva meet to India does not imply that a new axis is emerging in the region. The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Khurshid, who returned from Geneva last night, also denied entering into a tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable the withdrawal of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. While ruling out any fact-finding mission of the ICO to Kashmir, he said India has invited ICO permanent representative in Geneva to visit New Delhi for discussions. He said it is wrong on the part of Pakistan to say that its resolution has been deferred to the next meeting. In fact, the resolution has lapsed, he said. Replying to a question, he said the leader of the opposition, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, leading the Indian delegation, sent a clear signal that all sides in India speak with one voice on the Kashmir issue. Talking to newsmen, Mr. Vajpayee asked the government to consolidate the gains of the Geneva meet by taking concrete steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley. He brushed aside Pakistan's claim that its resolution is yet alive and termed it as preposterous. Mr. Vajpayee said for the first time, the international community has come to know in full detail about the terrorist atrocities in Kashmir. Nongovernment agencies of the valley have also ably presented the correct picture to the delegates of the Geneva meet, Mr. Vajpayee added. The Congress-I Working Committee has congratulated the prime minister on the country's success in thwarting Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir in Geneva. The party spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, told newsmen that the Congress-I has decided to launch a public awareness campaign on Dunkel proposals to counter the opposition propaganda. He said a five-member action committee is being set up to revamp its electoral machinery for the forthcoming assembly elections. Mr. Gadgil disclosed that the next session of the AICC [All India Congress-I Committee] will be held in Gujarat. He said the reports of the Karunakaran Committee and the Janardhan Committee on last assembly elections were discussed in detail.
