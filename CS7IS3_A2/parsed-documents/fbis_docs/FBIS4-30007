Commenting on the U.S. Government's tilt toward freezing the DPRK's current nuclear program, he said: "My personal view is that freezing North Korea's nuclear program alone is not enough. As a neighboring nation of the DPRK, Japan will not be satisfied with freezing North Korea's nuclear program without verifying that country's past nuclear developments."
