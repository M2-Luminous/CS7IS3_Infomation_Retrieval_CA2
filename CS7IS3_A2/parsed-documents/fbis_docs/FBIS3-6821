Nguyen Ho, one of the most prominent internal opponents of Vietnam's communist regime, was re-arrested early this month at his home in Ho Chi Minh City, sources in the southern city said. Ho -- a former Viet Cong guerrilla, trade union leader and party figure -- had penned and circulated an article calling for greater democracy and respect for human rights in Vietnam, according to the US-based human rights group Asia Watch. Ho, who is in his 70s, was held under house arrest from September 1990 to May 1993 after trying to form a veterans' association independent of the Communist Party. A number of other members of the organization were also arrested this month in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, said the sources, who did not provide their names. In Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry could supply no information on Ho, who is reportedly in poor health. But a source close to the communist leadership acknowledged that Hanoi had decided to tighten the screws on dissent to prevent any destabilizing effects from the lifting of the US embargo, expected to increase foreign influence as well as investment in Vietnam. "There is a real risk," the source said. "Socialism in the Soviet Union crumbled under the combined effect of foreign pressure and the breakdown of the domestic system." Since the embargo was scrapped in February, the official press has stepped up its warnings against "peaceful evolution" -- a Cold War term for the subversion of communist regimes through economic and social change. Vietnamese authorities insist on the need for political stability to complete their program of "doi moi," or economic renovation. They have confronted internal dissent -- whether it be religious (Catholic or Buddhist) or political -- while rejecting "external interference" in the country's affairs. They are highly suspicious of overseas Vietnamese, particularly those from the million-strong exile community in the United States, made up largely of families who fled Saigon after the 1975 communist victory. But Vietnam, which keenly needs their expertise as well as their capital to develop its fledgling market economy, is looking for ways to lure the "Viet Kieu" back while minimizing the risks. "Ninety percent of the Viet Kieu are patriots who left for economic reasons," said an unofficial government spokesman. "But the others, with links to the old American (client) regime, want to return to make contact with anti-socialist forces, especially reactionary Buddhists and Catholics. Perhaps the most serious threat to the government comes not from those who were on the losing side of the war but from some of the winners -- disgruntled former communist guerrillas, soldiers or party cadres, generally southerners. Figures such as Ho, former General Tran Van Tra or former Politburo member Tran Xuan Bach have shown varying degrees of opposition to democratic centralism with its refusal of political pluralism and limits on human rights. The secret police are keeping several dozen such revolutionary veterans under strict surveillance, Vietnamese sources said, suggesting that purges were recently carried out within the party and state apparatus. But it would be difficult to prosecute or jail men with such illustrious revolutionary credentials, said a veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We're not dogmatic. Political renovation will follow economic renovation. But we will never accept Western-style multiparty politics," said the source, who is close to the leadership.
