FR940711-2-00126 FR940711-2-00052 [Docket No. STN 50&hyph;456] Commonwealth Edison Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;72 issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo, the licensee) for operation of the Braidwood Station, Unit 1, located in Will County, Illinois. The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood, Unit 1, Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the condition limiting operation of the facility to 100 days during the present fuel cycle when T hot is greater than 500 ○F and to restore the reactor coolant dose equivalent Iodine-131 limit to 1 microcurie per gram of coolant from the present value of 0.35. Both the limit on permissible operational time and the reduction in the permissible level of Iodine-131 were incorporated into the TSs by Amendment No. 50 issued to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;72 for Braidwood Station, Unit 1, on May 7, 1994. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T hot greater than 500 ○F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of main steam line break (MSLB) leakage predicted in Braidwood Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic method of draft NUREG 1477, ``Voltage Based Interim Plugging for Steam Generator Tubes_Task Group Report,'' with the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 microcurie per gram (μCi/gm) to 0.35 μCi/gm. However, WCAP 14046; ``Braidwood Unit 1 Technical Support for Cycle 5 Steam Generator Interim Plugging Criteria'' (WCAP&hyph;14046), docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal, has shown using the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Leakrate Correlation that projected End Of Cycle (EOC)&hyph;5 MSLB leakage is 3.1 gallons per minute (gpm) which is less than the allowable limit of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP&hyph;14046. Thus the Unit 1 100-day operating limit and reactor coolant dose equivalent iodine restriction imposed by Amendment 50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required. In addition to the 100-day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report (SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated below. As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging criteria applied at Braidwood 1. ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights from the draft Braidwood Individual Plant Examination (IPE). Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June 30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical. While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust to allow a validation assessment of the impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit 2 dated August 19, 1993. The values calculated in WCAP&hyph;14046, for Beginning of Cycle (BOC) 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 Probability Of Detection (POD) were used to develop a cycle average burst probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6 for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD on core damage frequency. The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E&hyph;5 per reactor year with a total contribution from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E&hyph;8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective. The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications. The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB. Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.
