The appearance of this pleasing phenomenon not only demonstrates a deepening of people's understanding of the connotation of establishing a socialist market economy structure, but also reflects people's strong demand for a healthy, sustained, and rapid development strategy for the national economy, having suffered several economic fluctuations. Recently, the experts and scholars of the project team of the Institute of Quantitative and Technical Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' which is devoted to analyzing and forecasting the economic situation, (hereafter referred to as the Project Team) have studied this issue. Their principal viewpoints are excerpted in the following. Considering that the 1994 economic growth rate remains at a rather high level, the general measure of macroeconomic regulation and control should be the policy of a "soft landing." The Project Team believes that the policy of appropriate retrenchment, which was implemented in June and July of 1993, has obtained a certain effect. It will cause the 1994 economic growth rate to fall back somewhat. However, currently the investment growth rate, currency growth rate, etc., are still too high, and the balances of financial income and expenditures and of foreign trade, and so on, have not fundamentally improved. Therefore the 1994 economic growth rate will still remain at a relatively high level. Reasons for this are: 1. Investment will remain fairly large-scale. Large numbers of newly started projects of the past two years need to continue, so that the scale of projects under construction is rather large, while at the same time, some new important projects are waiting to be launched. The adjustment and optimization of the industrial structure, and the intensified construction of infrastructure and basic industries still require the input of large amounts of funds. People's savings deposits continue to increase in large quantities, and the banking system -- after consolidation -- also has a fair concentration of capital. This has provided investment with domestic sources of funding. The investment of foreign businesses is now at a second peak. The first peak was between 1985 and 1988, during which the growth rate of foreign capital used was 30-48 percent of the fixed-asset investment growth of society as a whole. Beginning in 1992, the second peak of foreign investment occurred. The growth rate achieved by foreign capital reached 44.5 percent. Currently, economic revival in the world's major industrial countries is weak, and large quantities of capital are looking for new locations to invest. The social, political, and economic situation in China looks good and offers advantageous conditions to attract foreign capital. In this foreign investment peak, foreign investment is not limited to the coastal regions only, but has penetrated to the interior. It has not been restricted to processing industries, but has expanded to infrastructure and basic industries. 2. The people's consumption demands will increase steadily. In the last two years, the people's income level has seen a new rise, the consumption structure also is attaining new heights, and the need for choices in shopping has strengthened further. These are intensifying and rejuvenating competition in the consumer goods market, which was sluggish a few years ago when economic growth was at a low point. The increase in people's consumption will promote growth in industries and tertiary industries. 3. Beginning in the latter half of 1993, the contradiction between supply and demand in transportation, energy, and certain major raw materials was somewhat alleviated. In 1994, viewed from the perspective of the production capacity and import-export adjustment of these bottleneck departments, a GNP growth rate of around 10 percent likely will be sustained. 4. If a certain speed of growth is maintained so that the economic growth rate falls back smoothly, a large drop between two years can be avoided. This is beneficial for ironing out economic fluctuations and can prevent major chain reactions and shocks between various links of social reproduction as a result of excessive slide. Based on these analyses, the general measure of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 should be one of "soft landing," that is to say, an appropriate retrenchment policy -- neither forceful expansion, nor total retrenchment. One must be very cautious of the weight of macroeconomic regulation and control. The major economic indicators of macroeconomic regulation and control should be set as follows: The GNP growth rate should be controlled at around 10 percent and the industrial output value growth rate at around 16 percent. Fixed-asset investment of society as a whole should be set at around 1.36-1.4 trillion yuan, with a 20 percent nominal increase over 1993. Deducting the price-rise factor, the actual increase should be at around 12 percent, which is slightly higher than the GNP growth rate, but slightly lower than the industrial growth rate. Newly increased loans should be set at around 550 billion yuan, an increase of around 20 percent over 1993. New increases in issuing currency should be set at around 100 billion yuan, with an increase of 17 percent over 1993. Given the soft restraints of structure and the hard restraints of bottlenecks, it is a fundamental measure of long-term significance to change the structure, readjust the industrial structure, and strengthen bottleneck departments. Since reform and opening to the outside world, compared with before, China's economic fluctuations have seen profound changes in certain respects, while in other respects, no fundamental changes have occurred. The Project Team believes that the changes that have occurred include: In terms of the nature of the fluctuations, the past domination of a classical fluctuation has changed to the domination of a growth-type fluctuation. The so-called classical fluctuation implies that in a period of economic contraction, major economic indicators such as the GNP, national income, or gross industrial output value, all demonstrate a drop in absolute volume, i.e., negative growth. The so-called growth-type fluctuation implies that in a period of economic contraction, major economic indicators do not demonstrate a drop in absolute volume, but show a slowdown in growth rate. This change in the nature of economic fluctuations indicates that China's economic development has acquired a stronger power for growth and for combating decline. The scale of the fluctuations obviously has been reduced. This indicates that China's economic development has gained a certain degree of stability. It also indicates that the government has made great progress in deciding the direction and force of macroeconomic regulation and control. In terms of the generating mechanism for industrial fluctuation, the role played by state-owned industry already has been reduced, while the role played by non-state-owned industries grows stronger day by day. In industrial fluctuation, non-state-owned industries already have become the leading wave. In terms of the generating mechanism for investment fluctuation, with the diversification of investors, investments from independently raised funds and from bank loans already have become the leading wave in investment fluctuation. In terms of transmitting information on the fluctuations, price signals have began to play a role. In the following two important aspects, however, no fundamental changes have occurred. One is the soft restraints of the structure. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in the past, the source of the investment scale inflating out of line with the country's capacity lies in the traditional planned economic system, which lacks responsibility and control mechanisms. The problems created by the high-speed economic growth rate in the first half of 1992 are rooted in the delayed reform of the investment, banking, and fiscal and tax systems, and the delayed reform of state-owned enterprises. That is to say, the "chaos" in the economic order caused by structural factors is the root of economic "overheating." Therefore, the basic solution is to accelerate both reform and the pace of building a socialist market economy structure. The Project Team believes that whether or not the "soft landing" of 1994 can succeed, and whether or not the economy can grow steadily will be an objective test of whether these reforms are successful. The second aspect is the hard restraints of bottleneck departments. Viewed from China's economic fluctuations in the past -- apart from political, structural, and policy factors -- as far as the material factors are concerned, most economic expansions eventually have had to slow down because of the hard restraints of such bottleneck departments as agriculture, transportation, energy, and important raw materials. Therefore, an important step to iron out economic fluctuations, raise the efficiency of the entire national economy, and guarantee the sustained and steady growth of the economy is to make great efforts to readjust the industrial structure and to fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these bottleneck departments. The Project Team points out that in light of historical lessons, what is worth mentioning is that one must not misunderstand this alleviation of problems as success in adjusting the industrial structure, or that bottleneck restraints no longer exist. There are two types of adjustment of industrial structure: one is adaptive adjustment with only short-term significance, i.e., after the high-speed expansion of the economy, the proportionate relations among various departments are temporarily balanced on a lower demand level by suppressing demand. When the next round of high-speed expansion takes place, this balance is quickly broken again. The other type of industrial structural adjustment is a fundamental adjustment with long-term significance, i.e., to persistently strengthen the construction of bottleneck departments and fundamentally break through the restraints of bottlenecks, hence pushing forward the growth of the entire national economy. The various cost pushes generated by price adjustments and price deregulation during the transition to a market economy still objectively play a considerable role in commodity price increases. Thus, controlling both investment expansion and the over-issuing of currency becomes a crucial link. To forecast price trends during 1994, one first must analyze the major causes of price increases during 1993, and then see if these causes are still operating in 1994, and to what degree. There were four major reasons for price increases in 1993: The first was a long-term deep-level cause, namely, the transition from the original planned economy to a market economy, which inevitably brings price increases. The second is the direct influence of price adjustments and deregulation. The third is the demand-push by investment expansion and the over-issuing of currency. The fourth is the chaos in economic order, especially the influence of the chaotic banking order on price increases. In 1994, the fourth cause mentioned above is being resolved. The first and second causes, namely, the various cost-pushes generated by price adjustments and deregulation in the transition to a market economy, will still objectively play a considerable role in pushing prices up. The remaining, third cause, namely, the demand-push of investment expansion and the over-issuance of currency thus has become a crucial link. This is where we will see the effect of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994. If, in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994, we can appropriately curb investment expansion and the over-issuance of currency so that the economic growth rate can be brought down a little, then the scale of price increases may be reduced somewhat. On the other hand, if the growth rate of investment and currency, and of the whole economy, bounce back too early and too high, then the scale of price increases will increase even further on the basis of the first and second causes.
