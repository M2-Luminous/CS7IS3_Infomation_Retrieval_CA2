Lord Tebbit, the former Cabinet Minister, belatedly marked the fifth anniversary of Lady Thatcher's Bruges Speech in September 1988, with a robust repudiation of closer ties in the EC. But Mr Clarke, Chancellor, painted a much more positive picture of Britain's future inside what he preferred to call the European Union in an address to economists in Paris. Lord Tebbit, whose hostility to the Maastricht Treaty has not abated -- he equated the measure last night with the retreat from Dunkirk -- said he believed the tide of affairs was flowing once again in favour of the nation state rather than a grand European design. "It is notable that some of the states which mouth the slogans of federalism and centralism in accents most exquisitely communitaire are now pursuing -- even if it involves cheating and breaking the law of the European Community -- policies of naked self-interest," he said. "On that basis the day of the nation state is far from over." Lord Tebbit, speaking at the Reform Club in London, said that before Europe could move to economic and monetary union -- the precursors of political union -- there would need to be a single language, something unacceptable to individual member states. "Until Europe enforces a single language policy, we Euro-sceptics know that our views will be proved correct and attempts at union will fail," he added. Lord Tebbit also called for overdue reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP]. "It is really time there was a sense of outrage against the unmitigated wickedness of the CAP," he said. In Paris, Mr Clarke -- speaking in French -- said Britain's growth prospects were intimately connected with Europe's and linked to the economic aims contained in the Maastricht Treaty. However, he took the opportunity to swipe at moves to force Britain to subscribe to social and employment policies that he felt would hinder competitiveness. Mr Clarke, a Euro-enthusiast, voiced the concern of senior ministers that developments such as the social chapter -- from which Britain has opted out -- will play into the hands of the freer market economies of the Far East. But his message was essentially one of moving forward, in contrast to Lord Tebbit's belief that the existing structure would begin to unravel. Mr Clarke said: "As fellow members of the European Union, we share a common commitment. We now have to help ensure that the Union is pointing in the right direction. It must tackle its deep- seated problems of competitiveness, recession and unemployment. We can only do that by allowing private enterprise and markets to realise more of their potential." The Liberal Democrats launched their campaign for the European elections yesterday with a claim to be the only party with a positive approach to closer ties in the EC, writes Phillip Johnston. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said: "We are the only party that has been consistently and unashamedly pro-European and we are proud of our record. Our task is to show that Britain needs to take a lead in making Europe work for people." Mr Ashdown called for a common security policy and military command for unified action in crises such as Bosnia. The party also wants: Action on jobs via a European recovery programme; Better exploitation of EC regional fund assistance; Stricter Green standards; Gradual steps to one currency; A stronger European parliament. The Liberal Democrats are confident of gaining between three and nine MEPs [Members of European Parliament] -- their first.
