The statement further points out that "the most dangerous aspect of this act is that Milosevic is actually offering a so-called defense union, which is really a military pact. Considering the international circumstances and Milosevic's personal reputation, the proposal will justify all the critics in the world who insist that a war-mongering policy predominates in Serbia. Such a major move, with such far-reaching consequences, cannot be made by a single individual anywhere in the civilized world, particularly not secretly. This offer became known to the Serbian public through Romanian sources. Therefore, the Serbian Renewal Movement demands that the president of the republic, who created this latest scandal, pushing Serbia further into isolation, come before the National Assembly and explain what is going on.
