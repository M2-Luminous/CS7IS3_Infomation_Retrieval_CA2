It is clear that the Serbs are very reluctant to hand their heavy guns over to the United Nations. Does this mean that, if they do not hasten the handover of heavy artillery, we will decide to bomb them when the ultimatum expires next Monday [21 February]? [Balladur] [passage omitted] We have made multiple efforts to bring the parties to negotiate among Serbs, Croats, and Muslims to find an agreement and a territorial settlement. Until now, we have not succeeded. France is the country with the most soldiers in Bosnia, the most UN soldiers. It is out of the question for us to carry on delivering humanitarian aid if the fighting is to continue for another five, 10, or 15 years. The presence of our soldiers would become totally meaningless. We therefore had to spell out to our partners that we had a duty to make one last effort for peace, and for the different parties in conflict to come to some agreement. For 10 months -- I found this file in the state that it was in, and I am not making any judgement on that -- for 10 months, we have been making efforts to get the international community interested in this affair. At the Copenhagen summit, everyone said they would send extra troops, and only France did so, and a month later I wrote to all our partners to ask them what they were up to; and let's not talk about the setting up of safe havens. Now, we have succeeded in mobilizing the international community to ask the belligerents -- I think this is the right term to describe them -- first of all to withdraw their heavy weapons, and, second, to reach a definitive territorial settlement so that we can finish with this war once and for all. The European Community, and in particular the North Atlantic alliance accepted -- following the proposals put forward by France and the United States.... [de Virieu, interrupting] By France in particular. [Balladur] By France in particular at the beginning, but the United States rallied to our proposals. We have a deadline of seven days ahead of us for all the heavy weaponry to be withdrawn or grouped together. When this deadline expires, we shall see what the situation is.... [de Virieu, interrupting] We -- in other words who? [Balladur] We, the members of the Atlantic Alliance.... [de Virieu, interrupting] And the United Nations. [Balladur] And the United Nations, and the countries that are most present on the ground in Bosnia, which, I think, have more to say on the subject than others -- which means France, above all. If, as I hope, and I cannot envisage the opposite, the warring parties return to the negotiating table, agree to talk, withdraw their arms as we have demanded, then there is a hope. If they do not, then it goes without saying that what was threatened will have to be carried out. [de Virieu] This means that the ultimatum will not be extended by a single day? [Balladur] It will not be extended by a single day, but I will be particularly attentive, as I have been for the last 10 months -- together with Defense Minister Francois Leotard -- I will be particularly attentive to the position of our soldiers, who are carrying out a humanitarian mission, certainly, but one which is nevertheless extremely dangerous. We must take every precaution to face every possible outcome.... [de Virieu, interrupting] Does this mean that we would withdraw our troops if there were to be air strikes? [Balladur] I am not saying that. We must take all necessary measures for their safety. This is the reason why Francois Leotard went to Sarajevo on Friday. [de Virieu] Prime Minister, will we be the only ones to leave our nationals, our diplomatic mission in particular, in the former Yugoslavia? I see that the Americans, the Germans, the Dutch are studying evacuation measures. What about us? [Balladur] We will probably not be the only ones to stay. [passage omitted] [de Virieu] Last month France agreed to a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, that is the currency used in 14 former French colonies in Africa. The decision had been requested by the World Bank for a long time. Isn't it a heavy responsibility to accept this devaluation which will make things worse in Africa? Was it necessary to make such a large devaluation? [Balladur] No, Mr. de Virieu, this will not make things worse in Africa. Things had got worse in the last ten years or so precisely because the CFA franc was overvalued and this had prevented investment. This decision was taken by African countries, but naturally, let us not be hypocritical, at France's instigation, let us be clear, because it seemed to us to be the best solution to help the development of these countries. [de Virieu] It will enable them to export more cheaply. [Balladur] It will enable them to export more. [de Virieu] Indeed, but they export very little. [Balladur] No, some of them export.... [de Virieu, interrupting] they are importing much more than they are exporting. So their imports will be more expensive. [Balladur] Imports will be more expensive, but for many of them exporting oil, raw materials or food products this should normally bring in additional resources, especially for farmers. [de Virieu] Is this failure of African economies you are describing also the failure of France's African policy? [Balladur] I do not believe so, I do not believe so at all. One thing is perfectly clear, France has not only interests in, but also a moral obligation towards African countries. It colonized them, it brought them a great deal, particularly in the infrastructure and training spheres. Thirty years of decolonization have gone by, the first 20 went smoothly, the last 10 less so since the world's economy changed and since the infrastructure of these countries was no longer adapted to the changes in the world economy. France will increase its aid to African countries, it managed to obtain a ten-fold increase in their aid to Africa from the IMF and World Bank. This is confirmation that there is no question of abandoning Africa, on the contrary, it will help it return to the path of progress. [de Virieu] Jean-Marie Colombani. [Colombani] Good evening Prime Minister. [Balladur] Good evening. [de Virieu] Before getting into purely internal issues I would simply like to make two short incursions into the news. You will soon visit China, it is the last large communist country, it is a country which requires exit visas from foreign nationals.... [Balladur, interrupting] I hope I will get one. [de Virieu] I hope so too. Does France need to follow in the steps of the last remaining large communist country? Are we not becoming a very restrictive country in that respect and this in the name of the fight against illegal immigration? Are we not going too far? [Balladur] We are combating terrorism, not illegal immigration. We should bear something in mind, when we say that we should control the arrival of foreigners in France and combat illegal immigration we are not morally [word indistinct], in any case, some are telling us that. But when we are saying that someone should not leave -- not without authorization -- without having previously told us so that we know where he is going and that we know for sure that he really left, we are also being told that this is improper. You know, let us bear in mind what we are doing, we are living in a world where terrorism is spreading in an extraordinary manner and we are close to countries which are often terrorist in habits and interests and it is perfectly normal -- and I fully support the interior minister, Mr. Pasqua, for having so decided -- it is quite normal we should take all the necessary steps to combat terrorism. As far as the comparison on this issue with communist China is concerned I repeat that a visa is one thing and to inform is another one. [Colombani] Concerning this issue again, exit visas are also required from Palestinians, this news is made public when Alain Juppe is visiting Israel and when visa are no more required from Israeli nationals. Is this a trademark of a balanced policy towards this region of the world where the two parties are making peace? [Balladur] Listen, I believe that this problem concerning Palestinians will be solved very quickly because for them, like for nationals of other countries, the issue is -- I repeat this -- not to prevent them leaving but to ask them to let us know when they are leaving. I believe that Mr. Juppe himself said in Israel that he found both issues perfectly compatible. [passage omitted] [Colombani] You are operating within the framework of cohabitation. Is this second cohabitation closer to your ideal model than was the first one? [Balladur] Mr. Colombani, cohabitation is hardly an ideal model. It is a situation born of two contradictory elections, presidential and parliamentary. From that moment, the leaders have a duty to ensure that the country does not suffer from their coexistence. How can you imagine, especially when we have 6,000 soldiers in Bosnia, who are in a dangerous situation, imagine if we were to squabble at the head of the state. It would be quite unacceptable. In these circumstances, as far as I am concerned, I am doing everything to ensure that things work out as well as possible. The French people have chosen new policies. I have the mandate to carry them out, the Constitution gives the government the means to implement them; I am using these means, while respecting the prerogatives of the president, and everything is perfectly simple and clear. [Colombani] Very well, but that is your side of the story. When the president calls you to draw up a new social contract, or when he warns you of deep-seated revolt, do you think that he is overstepping his role, or do you expect this kind of behavior? Does it annoy you, does it lead to tension, or is it just the day-to-day routine of cohabitation? [Balladur] I think that there is no need to exaggerate the significance of this. There is no secret: Mr. Mitterrand is a socialist, and I am not -- he said so himself. In these circumstances, our views of a certain number of problems are not the same. We are nevertheless both committed to serving our country as best we can, especially in international and military affairs, as is the case at present. I express my point of view, I carry out the policies which the French people have chosen. The government has the support of a large majority in the assembly. I cannot expect everyone to shut up. I have nothing to add on this subject. [passage omitted] [Colombani] Let's talk about the presidential elections. You imposed a law of silence on your ministers, you requested silence from your party. Does this mean that on 2 January 1995, let's say, everyone will be freed from this constraint? [Balladur] [passage omitted] The French people are not on the edge of their seats waiting to see who will be the next president. Let me assure you that the question does not haunt their sleep and their every thought.... [Colombani, interrupting] It depends who you're talking about. [Balladur] But I wasn't talking about you. [passage omitted] [de Virieu] Can we return to the draft bill on military programs, because I said just now that Jean-Marie Colombani would be speaking to you about it, and evidently the subject does not inspire him; so, anyway, the day after tomorrow there is a cabinet meeting on defense, which is going to examine -- from what I have read in LE MONDE, which is a good paper....[pauses] In any case you are going to be examining the white paper, it does not matter so much when. This white paper has been drafted to examine the new military threat in the world and its conclusions are going to be used by Mr. Leotard to draft a military programs bill. I saw that there is some question of France changing its military doctrine to agree to be more fully involved in NATO where its peacekeeping operations are concerned. Is this true or not? [Balladur] No, this is not what it is about, not at all. In the white paper which Francois Leotard is preparing, and in the military programs bill, it is anticipated that in specific cases, and by the decision each time of the president and the prime minister, the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Armed Forces may take part in this or that meeting, but in response to the needs of the situation each time and not automatically, or as a general rule. That is the first point. The second point: As for knowing whether or not France will take part in operations within the framework of NATO, it has already done so, to a certain extent -- during the Gulf war. That was not within the framework of NATO, but by using NATO's means -- we are playing on words a little here. Moreover, the French-German corps, which, it is anticipated, may....[pauses] which is at the disposal of the Western European Union, but may also be used by NATO, is also a means of making things more flexible, but, basically, France's position must remain as it was defined in 1966: it is a member of the Alliance.... [de Virieu, interrupting] By General de Gaulle. [Balladur] By General de Gaulle, and maintained by his successors, his three successors. France is a member of the alliance, it takes part in a certain number of activities within this alliance, but it is not integrated into the alliance's command, and we must be very careful to preserve our autonomy, even our independence in this matter, and furthermore we have been able to see in the Bosnia affair precisely how much the fact that we are autonomous gives us greater weight in the eyes of others. [de Virieu] Thank you, Prime Minister. That was "The Hour of Truth" with Mr. Edouard Balladur. [passage omitted]
