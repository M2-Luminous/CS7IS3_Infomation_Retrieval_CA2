MacLennan] [Text] Berlin March 10 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel said on Thursday [10 March] afternoon there was talk that a coup had begun in Bisho, Ciskei. Speaking in Eastern Cape town of Berlin, he apologised for cutting his electioneering meeting short. "There are problems in the Ciskei at the moment in Bisho. There's talk of a coup." He said he was was going to see what was going on. "Let's hold thumbs it doesn't lead to bloodshed." However, spot telephone inquiries to people working in Bisho late on Thursday afternoon did not reveal anything unusual in the Ciskei capital. A lawyer in Bisho told SAPA "nothing extraordinary" was happening. He said he had a bird's eye view of the town's main etreet from a hill in neighbouring King William's Town. A businesswoman said she had heard "talk of toyi-toying [protest dancing] by NEHAWU (the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union". Soldiers had been coming and going throughout the day, but there was nothing unusual in that, she added. A local bottle store was "as busy as heck" shortly before 5pm, and civil servants were among the customers.
