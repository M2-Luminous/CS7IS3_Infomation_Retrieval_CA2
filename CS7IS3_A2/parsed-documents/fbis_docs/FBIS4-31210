It seems that it is waiting in vain. In accordance with the new law on foreign trade in military hardware, four ministries--Industry, Interior, Defense, and Foreign--have been making their views known on such requests since April. Meanwhile, it is apparent from unofficial reports that at least three of the aforementioned departments--Defense, Foreign, and Interior--do not approve of granting a license to the RDP Group. The Cernin Palace obviously cannot overlook the scandal last December when the chairman of the RDP Group board, Lubomir Soudek, offered Iranian fundamentalists not only conventional weapons but also components for their nuclear program. And, [Defense Minister] Baudys's department again has unsettled accounts with the consortium's director general, Jan Vlcek. A definitive decision should be made next week. A great deal of money is at stake for the RDP Group's top brass, and, therefore, anxiety is increasing with the approaching date. The most recent development indicates that the company is still trying at the last moment to improve its image before state officials: On Friday, 27 May, Director Vlcek was recalled. Half a Billion Dollars Into the Bargain At the end of January 1994, Jan Vlcek turned to Industry Minister Dlouhy with a request for support in a lucrative order for Iran: The RDP Group wanted to export a repair assembly line for tanks for $0.5 billion. Vladimir Dlouhy asked [Interior Minister] Jan Ruml, [Foreign Minister] Josef Zieleniec, and Antonin Baudys for their opinions on the contract. Of course, Vlcek's letter came at a time when the worldwide reaction to Lubomir Soudek's Teheran "atomic mission" had still not died down, so the ministers were very constrained and all of them objected to the deal. The Army was most acerbic: It was astounded that the RDP Group director had proposed a state military enterprise as the final supplier for the order without even consulting the Defense Ministry first. Thus, Vlcek, and his company along with him, acquired yet another inauspicious reputation on top of the incommodious contract: "In view of the consortium's reckless business activities, I consider its participation in Czech Army projects to be completely out of the question," wrote Antonin Baudys to his colleague Dlouhy. An arms company that cannot sell its products and services to the army of its own country has, of course, according to the experts, absolutely no chance in the market. At roughly the same time that the RDP Group received a negative response from the Industry Ministry to its Iranian request, the consortium's management founded the RDP Group Marketing subsidiary limited company. "The explanation is simple," claims Jaroslav Skrobanek from the company's management. "Our founding documents were very vague about trading in arms, and this may not be enough in possible negotiations on a license for a specific order. Therefore, a subsidiary company was founded whose main function is commercial activity." According to the economic experts, however, another explanation is also possible: The subsidiary company is intended to detract attention from the RDP Group itself; its reckless activities "spread" among the public, and the consortium was faced with the risk that it would not obtain any license for trade in military material. In view of the fact that the RDP Group board alone controls the Marketing company and not the general assembly, possible business deals will become, on top of this, "more unintelligible" to the shareholders. There are now more than 40 of them; altogether, these are enterprises involved--to a greater or lesser extent--in arms production. Cherchez la Femme So, instead of the RDP Group, its subsidiary company applied for general permission to conduct trade, as the new law prescribes for military hardware. Then, within the framework of other "purgative" measures, along came the aforementioned recall of Director General Vlcek. He was replaced by Viktorie Hradska, the former chairwoman of the Liberal Democratic Party and an unsuccessful candidate for the post of ambassador to Hungary. RDP Group representatives have described her "ability to conduct negotiations" as the new director's main qualification for the job. Whether these modifications to improve the company's battered reputation will suffice will become apparent in the very near future. The head of the department for special materials at the Industry Ministry, Josef Gregr, who is responsible for granting licenses, already has at his disposal all of the points of view from the key departments. At the moment, in view of the continuing administrative proceedings, he is refusing to divulge any information about the future of the RDP Group Marketing limited company.
