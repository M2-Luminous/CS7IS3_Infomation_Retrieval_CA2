The call, he said, concerns Rwandans in the country as well as those throughout the world. Mobilize to defeat the French treason plan, Jacques Bihozagara -- who is a member of the RPF's political desk -- said. You have to live or die in Rwanda, and nowhere else, he said. Today, I quote, France, completing its plan, is flying to the aid of the executioners in their desperate plight. The RPF delegate also warned those African countries which might be tempted to take part in the French-led intervention, and called on the international community not to be accomplice to a project over which it was not consulted.
