The inflation reduced drastically to record low at 1.3 percent in 1992-93, said the annual report of the Bangladesh Bank for 1992-93 released on Wednesday [5 January]. The Bangladesh Bank report said that the foreign exchange reserve in the country registered an unprecedented increase at 2,121 million U.S. dollar equivalent to six months' import expenditure in 1992-93. But the report depicted a dismal picture in the total investment and said that it did not achieve the desired success in spite of the deregulation and free market economic policies. The reasons for the low investment were attributed to dilatory process in the implementation of the policies, rigid and extra cautious stand of the banking institutions, strict lending policies without risks and introduction of harder rules in the realisation of the bank loans. Total law and order situation and the labour unrest were also shown in the report as other reasons for the slow investment. The entrepreneurs apprehending tough competition in the liberalised foreign trade did not show adequate interest for investment, the Bangladesh Bank report observed. The rate of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) registered a growth of 4.3 per cent as against 4.2 per cent in the previous year. The per capita income in 1992-93 stood at 212 U.S. dollar as against 208 U.S. dollar in 1991-92. The report said that the demand for bank loans remained tremendously low as the investment did not gain momentum. The broad money supply registered a rise of only 10.6 per cent reaching a total of Taka 31,535.6 crore. The money supply increased by Taka 3,009.7 crore in 1992-93. The foreign exchange reserve in the country registered a rise by 513 million dollar. The rise included receipt of 81 million dollar from International Monetary Fund (IMF), 30 million from IDA [International Development Association], 59 million dollar from Japan. Above that the rise in the remittances from the Bangladesh expatriates and export earning were 84 million and 234 million dollar respectively. The import expenditure increased by 523 million dollar in 1992-93. The reserve money in the Bangladesh Bank increased by Taka 2,082.7 crore. The huge cash of the commercial banks and financial institutions was deposited with the Bangladesh Bank since they could not invest it in the economic activities. The export earnings in 1992-93 increased by 12.3 per cent over the previous year. The total earning from the export during the year was 2,138 million dollar. The deficit in the current account balance increased to 780 million dollar in 1992-93 from the previous 605 million dollar. The overall surplus in the balance fell by 19 million dollar and stood at 595 million dollar from 614 million dollar. A total of Taka 814 crore was disbursed in the country as agricultural loan as against Taka 749.59 crore in 1991-92. In the foreign trade the deficit in 1992-93 rose by 289 million dollar and stood at total 1,848 million dollar. In spite of the increase of 234 million dollar in export earning the import expenditure was higher by 523 million dollar. In 1992-93, the export earning was 2,138 million dollar while the import expenditure was 3,980 million dollar leaving a total deficit of 1,848 million dollar. The report apprehended that the effort to make the country self-reliant in food production might be obstructed as the farmers failed to make over the production cost of their produce. This would constraint them to use increased inputs including adequate fertilizer, seeds and pesticides.
