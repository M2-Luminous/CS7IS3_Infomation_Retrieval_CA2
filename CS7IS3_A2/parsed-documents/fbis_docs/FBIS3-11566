Nevertheless, Cuba's initial explanations were ignored by the right-wing Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO and other forces that strive, both within and outside of the South American nation, to spoil the friendly atmosphere between the two nations. The highest-ranking Cuban authorities confirmed that no rebel leader, or even Bishop Nel Beltran, attended the fourth solidarity meeting held in Havana in June when, according to EL TIEMPO's version, they reportedly held a summit. Cuba's swift investigation of the Colombian newspaper's allegations, which were repeated by some of that country's officials, shows the Cuban Government's intention to expose a maneuver that could very well be connected with the extremist groups of Cuban immigrants in the United States. One cannot forget the reaction, tinged with hysteria, of ultra-conservative members of that community who are threatening to boycott Colombian products in the United States. Miami radio stations that respond to the interests of the extreme right-wing groups in the Cuban immigrant community have not stopped speaking about the eventual sale of Colombian oil to Cuba, which both parties were negotiating to the subsequent disgust of those who struggle to paralyze the island by the lack of fuel. The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO's allegations have many dark facets, including attributing them to a military intelligence report which was later denied by the head of that department, Gen. Fernando Tapia. Also, Bishop Nel Beltran and other witnesses that remained with him in Miami during the time of his alledged stay in Havana with guerrilla leaders have rejected the prelate's participation in a meeting or his trip to the Cuban capital. The scandal unleashed by EL TIEMPO has two chapters, the last of which has the character of a counteroffensive. It is to be expected that truth will prevail and that the newspaper will not subject its readers to a third episode of such a destructive story.
