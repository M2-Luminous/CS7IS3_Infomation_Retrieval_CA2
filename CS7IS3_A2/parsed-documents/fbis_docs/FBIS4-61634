The ministry thinks that oil exports will guarantee that Western banks will give loans to restructure the coal industry and to close mines that have no future prospects. At present, the Fuel and Energy Ministry and the Rosugol company are conducting talks with representatives of German and Portuguese firms and the World Bank on possible cooperation in the implementation of this program.
