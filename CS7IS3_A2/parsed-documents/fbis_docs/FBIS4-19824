A country that subordinates all action to an election in spite of the urgency of existing problems is not a "modern democracy," he comments, for its fate depends "on a throw of the dice." While the government is announcing a significant legislative program, parliamentarians will instead devote their time to evaluating the chances of various presidential candidates. According to whether they follow Prime Minister Edouard Balladur or Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, or whether they support French Democratic Union (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing or Senate President Rene Monory, their conduct will lead to the fragmentation of the parliamentary majority, Reinhard contends. He warns that parliamentarians ought to let the government govern at least until the vote on the 1995 budget, as "quarreling in public can only serve the interests of a Left whose convalescence is distinctly faster than its adversaries seem to think." According to an article in the 6 April satirical Paris weekly LE CANARD ENCHAINE, Chirac supporters have launched an "insidious" campaign by attacking Balladur's physical and psychological state, which they contend has deteriorated "now that everything is going badly." They are spreading the rumor that the "increasingly tired and discouraged" prime minister will not complete his term in office. The article cites Eric Raoult, one of Balladur's harshest critics and vice president of the RPR in the National Assembly, as saying that Balladur "can resign on a moment's notice." Chirac supporters also contend that were Balladur to leave, Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe would be his likeliest successor, since he maintains good relations with President Francois Mitterrand and has no presidential ambitions. According to the article, after Alain Juppe's reelection as secretary general of the RPR National Council, the defense minister presented his activities report, in which he expressed satisfaction that the party has become "the most important French political force." He then turned to the 1995 presidential elections, affirming that the RPR is "loyal to Edouard Balladur and faithful to Jacques Chirac" and pointing out that "our party possesses all the trump cards to win the presidential elections, but the surest way to waste them is to compromise our unity by giving in to the delights of clans." For his part, Chirac called for "unfailing support" for the prime minister, stating that "I would like to tell him in a friendly manner: Do not be alarmed, dear Edouard, by the suggestions that members of your majority may make to you, for they are dictated only by the desire to succeed together." In an interview with National Assembly President Philippe Seguin by Frederic Gerschel published in the 14 April Paris weekly PARIS MATCH, Seguin was asked whether the government would not function more "serenely" if, "rightly or wrongly," presidential ambitions were not attributed to Balladur. Seguin replied that Balladur himself stated in June 1990 that a prime minister who renounces publicly from the outset to run for president gains both efficiency and authority. When queried whether his favorite candidate for president is still Chirac, Seguin pointed out that the problem is less that of candidates, of whom "there is a plethora," than of a presidential project, of which there is still a distinct lack. The presidential election, he added, must be the occasion for a renewed "elan," which can only be founded on a clear project. The French people will thus base their choice on the quality of the candidate, but also on his capability to bring new answers to the present great challenges, Seguin concluded.
