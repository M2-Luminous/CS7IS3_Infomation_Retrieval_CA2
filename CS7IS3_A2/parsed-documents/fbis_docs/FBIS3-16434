The processing of radioactive materials may cause serious damage to the environment. Today, we learned that warheads from the Ukrainian missiles are being sent to the town of Arzamas-16. Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, the Minister of Natural Resources: [Begin Danilov-Danilyan recording] Only to Arzamas-16. It is the enterprise that specializes in these particular things. From the point of view of the general safety of Russia it is better to bring Ukrainian warheads to Russia, to dismantle them and process what they contain, rather than to leave them in Ukraine. My honest word; this is better. If another incident should occur there, consequences will be far greater than from Chernobyl. [end recording]
