The number of attacks carried out by this gang on the birthdays of Abimael Guzman and Mao Zedong last December in Lima shows that the SL "commemorated" Mao's birthday with a greater number of actions than they did for "President Gonzalo," which demonstrates the deterioration of his image. This can be understood from statistics recorded by the Institute for National Defense Research (Iniden). According to Iniden, during the second half of 1993 Shining Path carried out 346 actions, killing 308 people -- including civilian and military -- which is a lower figure compared to the same period of the previous year. In a document sent to this newspaper, Iniden states that most of the SL actions in December were concentrated near two dates: December 3, Abimael Guzman's birthday, and December 26, Mao's 100th birthday. Faithful to the purest SL style, the document states, the two "commemorations" consisted of a wave of terrorist attacks. This means that from 2 to 5 December, the Shining Path carried out 18 attacks, and from 24 to 29 December, 24 attacks. By the quality of the targets and the number of attacks, the document states, it can be deduced that Mao was much more "commemorated" than Guzman. Iniden states that the attacks must not be considered as the Shining Path's last resort, or as isolated attacks, although "it must not be ignored that such low figures for SL attacks have not been seen since 1992." In a long, thorough analysis Iniden reports that the Shining Path has ceased to be a threat to Peruvian political feasibility. It nonetheless counsels the public not to be overly optimistic given the escalation of its attacks. The document states that for some people the new wave of SL violence was carried out apparently with the pretext of "commemorating" the birthday of Abimael Guzman and Mao's 100th birthday. For some analysts, the escalation of the violence was meant to "maintain Guzman's negotiating capacity" and to make the SL members in prison considered political or war prisoners, in order to obtain their freedom once peace is "negotiated." The document also points out the existence of a radical SL group that does not accept a solution other than continuing with the "armed struggle," a situation that does not allow them to carry out negotiations for peace. "This latter group does not think in the same way as the imprisoned SL leaders and their followers," the Iniden document states.
