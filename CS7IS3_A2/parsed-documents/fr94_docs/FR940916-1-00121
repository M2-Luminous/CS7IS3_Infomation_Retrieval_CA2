FR940916-1-00121 FR940916-1-00016 Subpart J This proposed subpart contains the tests and procedures required to introduce new train brake system technology into revenue service. Several parties commented that the technology necessary for the introduction of advanced braking systems is quickly developing. These new technologies include various forms of electronic braking systems, a variety of braking sensors, and computer-controlled braking systems. In order to allow for and encourage the development of new technology, FRA proposes guidelines regarding the tests and procedures required for introducing new brake system technology. These proposed guidelines require the submission of design and test plans as well as subsequent operational plans for the introduction of new technology. Parties will also be allowed to petition FRA to convert some of the brake system design and maintenance requirements into performance-based standards to accommodate the use of electronic braking systems. Comment is urgently sought as to means by which new technology may be qualified and regulated without the delay normally associated with rulemaking. Section 232.901. This section contains the general parameters as to what type of new train brake equipment and technology may be introduced pursuant to the tests and procedures contained in this section. This section is only applicable to new train brake system technology that comply with the statutory mandates contained in 49 U.S.C. §§20102, 20301&hyph;20304, 20701&hyph;20703, 21302, and 21304, formerly codified in the Locomotive Inspection Act at 45 U.S.C. 22&hyph;34 and the Safety Appliance Acts at 45 U.S.C. 1&hyph;14, 16, but which are not specifically covered by these proposed regulations. Any type of new equipment which requires an exemption from the requirements of the Locomotive Inspection Act or the Safety Appliance Acts in order to be operated in revenue service cannot be introduced into service pursuant to this section. In order to grant a waiver of the Safety Appliance Acts, FRA is required to follow the procedures contained in 45 U.S.C. §1013 as well as any FRA procedural requirements contained in this chapter. Section 232.903. This section details the requirements for pre-revenue service tests of new brake system technology. The purpose of requiring pre-revenue service tests is to thoroughly demonstrate in a controlled fashion that new train brake system technology is capable of operating safely in the railroad environment. FRA proposes to require an extensive information-exchange and planning period to prepare for pre-revenue service tests of new train brake system technology. FRA must have adequate information and lead time to determine that the proper safeguards are being taken to conduct the tests safely. FRA must be assured the tests are designed to adequately and clearly demonstrate the technology is capable of safe operation in the railroad environment. FRA intends to create a thorough and well documented planning process that produces not only a plan for pre-revenue service tests, but also an inspection, test, and maintenance program as well as training and qualification requirements for the new technology. Section 232.905. This section contains the requirements for introducing new brake system technology into revenue service. Prior to introducing new train brake system technology to revenue service, FRA proposes to require a thorough analysis of the pre-revenue service test results. FRA also intends to require that railroads submit proposed performance standards to serve as the basis of safety regulations for the new technology. FRA views this as a potentially effective means to move toward the performance-based safety regulations that the industry desires but has been unable to achieve. In addition, FRA proposes to require the development of detailed and well thought-out operating plans, training and qualification programs, and inspection, test, and maintenance programs based on the lessons learned during the pre-revenue service tests. FRA feels this formal process for the introduction of new train brake system technology will help ensure any safety problems caused by the introduction of the new equipment are not serious. Section 232.907. This section provides the requirements for following up on new brake system technology introduced into revenue service. FRA believes that railroads should be required to carefully monitor the performance of new train brake system technology for the first two years after its introduction to revenue service. The careful planning and caution required by the process of testing prior to revenue service test and of later introducing the technology to revenue service may not catch all the safety-related problems with new systems and equipment. Vigilance is required until adequate operating experience is obtained. Appendix A This Appendix is being reserved until the final rule. At that time it will contain a penalty schedule similar to those issued by FRA for all of its existing rules. Because such penalty schedules are statements of policy, notice and comment are not required prior to issuance. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)). Nevertheless, interested parties are welcome to submit their views on what penalties may be appropriate. Appendix B This Appendix contains the proposed procedures for requesting a change in the required time interval for periodic brake tests. As stated in the discussion of §232.611, FRA proposes to provide an incentive for railroads to develop quality programs for the test, inspection, and maintenance of brake systems that will keep the failure rate of periodic freight brake tests and single car tests below a certain target value. The method for increasing the time between the required tests will be based on a statistical analysis that establishes that the failure rate for these scheduled tests is below a target value. The target average failure rates, the required confidence bands around these target value rates, and the increment of change per statistical analysis period are contained in Table 1 below.
