SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which amended the Farm Credit Act of 1971, the Corporation was created, among other things, to manage the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) which was established to ensure the timely payment of principal and interest on insured notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations issued on behalf of the Farm Credit System (FCS) Banks. The Corporation must be appointed as the conservator or receiver for any FCS institution placed into conservatorship or receivership by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) after January 5, 1993. The Corporation has the authority to examine, as it deems necessary, FCS banks, direct lender associations, and FCS institutions in receivership. These proposed regulations set forth procedures to be used in requesting access to and responding to requests for Corporation Privacy Act records. As required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), the Corporation is notifying the public of the proposed regulations. They provide that all requests for access to Corporation Privacy Act records must be in writing and signed by the subject of the record, adequately describe the material sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia. The proposed regulations delegate to the Privacy Act Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning requests for access to records. The proposed regulations provide procedures for requests for amendment of records and the appeal of an initial adverse determination on a request to amend a record. The proposed regulations also recite the statutory bases for exemption from disclosure. Finally, the proposed regulations provide a fee structure.
