Partnership for Peace offers Central and Eastern European countries closer military cooperation with NATO and envisages that they agree to gradual expanding of their cooperation with NATO and not insist on immediate admittance to the Alliance. Klaus said these countries should bear in mind that for the United States and other NATO member states, Russia is a power which should be taken into consideration. Klaus was reacting to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement today in which he warned NATO of a possible negative reaction by the Russian public to NATO's probable expansion eastward. Yeltsin described the arguments of countries seeking membership in NATO as "unconvincing." Klaus said he knew that "Russia considered this issue to be a sensitive one," but added that the question was not urgent because "nobody is offering us membership in NATO." Klaus said that from the first moment when it become known that on his way from Brussels to Moscow Clinton will stop in Prague and meet representatives of the Visegrad countries -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- it was clear that the talks would be separate. Speculations that the Czech Republic was preventing or not preventing coordinated talks to be held are superfluous, he added. Klaus was thus reacting to reports which appeared in the Czech and foreign media that the Czechs do not support the idea of joint talks between high-ranking Visegrad officials and Clinton during his January 11-12 visit to Prague. At its meeting today, the Czech Government approved the programme of Clinton's stay in Prague. The U.S. delegation will meet for bilateral talks with delegations of the four Visegrad countries. Bilateral talks between Klaus and the Polish, Slovak and Hungarian premiers will take place in Hrzansky Palac. After Clinton's departure from Prague on January 12, Czech President Vaclav Havel, Klaus and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec will give separate dinners for their Visegrad colleagues, Klaus said.
