FR940830-1-00103 FR940830-1-00015 The Department understands that there will be some instances where households are hooked up to public utilities, such as heat and water, but are unable to use these utilities for whatever reason, such as non-payment of utility bill. The Department believes that as long as a household is using a vehicle to carry fuel for heat or water, access to public utilities should have no bearing on the vehicle exemption. Accordingly, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1) to add a new paragraph (vi) to exclude as a resource the value of a vehicle that a household depends upon to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported fuel or water is the primary source of fuel or water for the household. Households will receive this resource exclusion without having to meet any additional tests concerning the nature, capabilities, or other uses of the vehicle. Furthermore, the household will not be required to provide documentary evidence, as required in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(4), unless the basis for the exclusion of the vehicle is questionable. If the basis for the exclusion of a vehicle is questionable, the State agency must require documentation showing that the vehicle is used to carry fuel for heating or water for home use. Also, the Department is proposing a technical amendment to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(6) to correct an oversight in the summary of how vehicles are handled. The Department failed to list vehicles necessary to transport a physically disabled household member as an exclusion. The Department proposes to add this exclusion in addition to the exclusion for a vehicle used to carry fuel or water. Vehicles Needed To Seek and Continue Employment and For Household Transportation Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3), in accordance with section 5(g) of the Act, require that all licensed vehicles be evaluated to determine their fair market value over $4,500. The fair market value over $4,500 is counted as a resource for one vehicle per household and for vehicles used for work, training or education, or to seek work. For other vehicles, the fair market value over $4,500 or the equity value, whichever is greater, is counted as a resource. 7 CFR 273.8(h) excludes a vehicle as a resource if the vehicle is used primarily for income producing purposes; annually produces income consistent with its fair market value; is necessary for long-distance travel that is essential to employment; is used as a household's home; or is necessary to transport a physically disabled household member. The Department has received numerous comments from State agencies, the general public and advocate groups about the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion, which has remained unchanged since the enactment of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. The comments expressed the belief that the $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion is too low and does not accurately reflect changes due to inflation, and thus was detrimental to food stamp households. Section 13923 of the Leland Act amended section 5(g)(2) of the Act to increase the fair market value resource exclusion of vehicles in the following manner. The current $4,500 fair market value resource exclusion will remain in effect through August 31, 1994. On September 1, 1994, the resource exclusion will increase to $4,550 and be effective through September 30, 1995. On October 1, 1995, the resource exclusion will increase again to $4,600 and be effective through September 30, 1996. On October 1, 1996 and on every October 1 thereafter, the fair market value resource exclusion of vehicles shall be adjusted annually, using a base of $5,000, to reflect changes in the new car component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending the preceding June 30th, rounded to the nearest $50. In order to implement Section 13923 of the Leland Act, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.8(h)(3) in accordance with the timetable prescribed by Section 13923. The Department would provide the yearly fair market value resource exclusion for the period beginning October 1, 1996 and thereafter to State agencies on an annual basis.
