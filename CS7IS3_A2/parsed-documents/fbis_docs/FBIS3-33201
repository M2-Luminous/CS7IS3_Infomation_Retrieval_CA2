Although the talks between the 19 EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Front] delegates headed by Subcommander Marcos and Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis will formally begin today, some meetings were held yesterday. According to reports released yesterday and early today, three groups were formed to define negotiation mechanisms. Although the reconciliation process formally begins at 0900 [1500 GMT] today, the first phase of the meeting will be private and accredited reporters will not be allowed coverage. We do not expect to receive any information on the first direct meeting between the 19 EZLN delegates, among whom are four women, Commissioner Camacho Solis, and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz until midday. The EZLN representatives have spent 18 hours inside the San Cristobal de Las Casas cathedral, which is now being called the cathedral of peace. Standing guard at the cathedral are unarmed military policemen, Red Cross volunteers, and members of nongovernment organizations. These three circles were established on Saturday, and they operate day and night with changes every four hours. Working in these circles are approximately 450 volunteers, a similar number of persons from nongovernment organizations, and approximately 500 soldiers.
