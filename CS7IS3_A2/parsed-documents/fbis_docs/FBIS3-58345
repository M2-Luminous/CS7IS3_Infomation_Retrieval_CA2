The Berlin-based research institute does not expect a quick economic upswing. On Thursday [6 January], the DIW said that a gradual upward trend can be expected to start in summer, at the earliest. The recession has not yet been overcome. German economic policy is characterized by illusions and wrong assessments in this area, the DIW said. In western Germany, the GNP is expected to decline by an estimated 0.5 percent this year. The number of unemployed in eastern and western Germany will go up to a total of some 4 million. In the DIW researchers' view, the debate about Germany as a business location overrates the alleged crisis of costs faced by German companies. No study has yet been able to prove that German industry has a severe lack of international competitiveness. The decline in profits is a "phenomenon exclusively due to economic cycles." Some impetus from abroad is possible; but export hopes can refer only to overseas markets. Besides, the European countries can only overcome the recession "marching in step." The role monetary policy plays in the development of recession is underestimated. Relaxing monetary policy is the key to an increase in investments. In the DIW's opinion, short-term and long-term interest rates should be approximately 2 percentage points apart. According to the DIW, the economic policy debate concentrates too much on wage policy. "Cutting wages" alone is a defensive strategy that is unlikely to succeed. This year, the institute expects moderate wage settlements "in the region of 2 percent." In 1996, wage increases could return to some 4 percent, a rate that will be appropriate in the medium term. Private consumption will go down by some 1.5 percent in 1994, which will have an enormous effect on the economy. The government's envisaged austerity measures will also have a restrictive impact on the economy. Considering this, 1994 is an unsuitable time for consolidating public budgets, the DIW said.
