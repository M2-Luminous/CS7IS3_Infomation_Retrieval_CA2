The message from the French minister to his interlocutor was very clear: France says "No" to any unilateral trade measure of this type. The minister also expressed his concern to obtain fairer treatment in European-Japanese trade relations. After the reinstatement of the Super 301, Toyota declared that it was ready to import U.S. spare parts worth $6 billion, a prospect which worries the French minister. Yesterday, he expressed this worry to French car component manufacturers operating in Japan, and today he is going to raise this issue with Toyota President Tatsuro Toyoda. "I fully agree that Japanese manufacturers buy products in the United States, but this should not be done to the detriment of others," he stressed. In this respect, Gerard Longuet announced the organization, this year in Paris, of a seminar involving Japanese purchasers and French car component manufacturers. He also let it be known that, in the current dispute between the United States and Japan, Europe could play a "mediating role." Yesterday in Brussels, Leon Brittan proposed the creation of a trilateral body involving Europe, the United States, and Japan which would establish macroeconomic targets for the Japanese with a view to pressing them to reform their economy, rather than imposing targets expressed in exact figures for each sector, as the Americans do. For the first time, Mickey Kantor found the idea interesting.
