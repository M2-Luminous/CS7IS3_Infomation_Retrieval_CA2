We are a very united family as I am certain all Mexican families are. We love each other very much. We have been married for many years; we got married very young. We have been married for almost 20 years; our 20th anniversary will be in May. My wife has always been at my side, giving me her support in everything. I would like to tell you that we met when we were students; she was also an economics student. She was my student. In the first class I taught at the Higher Economics School, she was my student. I must confess, however, that before she was my student she was my girlfriend, we had met before. Fortunately, she was in the first group I was assigned at the school. She has done everything with me. When we went to study in the United States, she gave me a great deal of support. These were times of hard work, of big challenges. She has always been at my side encouraging me to make a big effort. She has supported me during my whole career. She has not only been a wife; she has been my friend, and many times she has been my adviser, this is very comforting. Above all, she made a decision many years ago. She was a very good student but she put set aside her profession to do this. The family you see here, these five children who we love very much are the reason for our existence. She left behind her profession to build something that for both of us represents a great deal of happiness, that is, these children. We are a normal family, we are not anything special and this is what makes us a family like any other. We participate together in many activities, within many time constraints. You mentioned sports. Well, this is known because my sons Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, and I are members of a mountain bicycle club. We practice or we attempt to practice this with some regularity. This is why we are seen riding around on bicycles. Something that characterizes Mexicans is that the family concept is not limited to the immediate family, parents and children. We have what is called an extended family. Three years ago we went to Colima -- my wife is from Colima -- where a family reunion was held as practically all her family resides there. The number of people assembled was impressive; the number of cousins and uncles. This really appeared to be a political meeting; which in fact we did turn it into as we had invited the then candidate for Colima governor. He was impressed to see so many people from one family. [Reporter] So you have many votes in the family? [Zedillo] Well, yes; I hope they will vote for me. I have to make sure, I will have to conduct an effective campaign among the family members, right? I hope all of them will help me in that respect. [Mrs. Zedillo] Ernesto said something that I appreciate. He said I was a good student. The truth is that I enjoyed economics very much. There are some subjects that I like very much. I believe that by being at home, I have had the opportunity to read. Now, I like literature, history. I think a housewife does not have to separate herself from such things as learning. When I had my children, I had to quit working, but I like it. Staying at home is also a profession. It takes some effort, it entails much devotion, and one must be determined to do it. I like it, that is why I did it. I come from the provinces, and early in the century, families were very large in the provinces. My father comes from a family of 11 brothers and sisters, and so does my mother, and there are all of their cousins. It is a large family. Ernesto also comes from a large family. Of course, they will help us.
