Mr. Filimonov believes that "the competition was conducted to the detriment of Russian oil men" and that the Swiss IMEG Management S.A. consortium was announced as the winner of the competition on the basis of unwarranted advantageous rules. According to Mr. Filimonov, he found out about this competition only a month before the results were announced and, therefore, Tomskneft was not able to participate in it. Representatives of the Geointertek Joint Enterprise, the company that conducted the competition, told correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that the rules governing the competition did indeed change somewhat over a period of two years, but that the Joint Enterprise did not hide this fact. According to Geointertek representatives, this competition was, on the whole, not very attractive to investors, because the development of disputed deposits would probably be unprofitable. The Strange History of the Competition The first international tender for the barely-explored Pudinsko-Parabelskiy deposits was presented in the city of Denver (USA) back in the summer of 1992. At the time, packets with geological information for tender applications were purchased by seven foreign companies, and the first results were to have been received in January 1993. Several companies, however, in anticipation of preferential tax rates from the Russian government, asked that the tenders be delayed until July 1, 1993. Preferential rates were not received by that time, and the tenders--due to unprofitability of the project for foreign investors--were not offered. In March 1994, however, after Boris Yeltsin's decree of December 24, 1993 ("On Issues of Agreements Regarding Allocations of Production in Using Mineral Resources"), which changed the tax policy in the oblast, this competition again became attractive to investors. For this reason, in March of this year the Tomsk Oblast administration announced an "extension" of the competition with all the former rules still in effect. These rules were rather strict. The entire competitive territory was divided into 20 parcels--"blocks"--and applications for "a territory less than one block in size" were not accepted, but the amount of the bonus was calculated on the basis of each square kilometer of a block. It was also assumed that bonus payments would be made immediately after the results of the competition have been made known, but in the event a contract was not signed with the winner, the Russian side had the right to keep 20 percent of the bonus as a security payment. Nevertheless, as a result of the competition, the winner--the IMEG Corporation--received only parts of the 9th, 10th, and 17th competitive blocks, the territory of which has known oilfields amounting to 23 million tonnes. According to data from experts, these are the most convenient "pieces" for which other companies--that had intended to participate in tenders back in 1992--could have fully competed. Requests to clarify what the bonus consists of were not fulfilled either; for example, that a part of the sum was definitely a security payment. According to the results of the competition, the consortium is obligated to pay $2.5 million out of its bonus only "when an agreement has been signed and implemented between the Russian and foreign parties," and another $6 million of the bonus to be paid to "the Tomsk Oblast fund for social support when a certain level of extraction of hydrocarbons has been achieved, which will constitute a subject for negotiations." According to experts, thanks to the afore-mentioned "negotiations," the payment of most of the bonus can be simply delayed for an indeterminate period of time. [Boxed item] The Pudinsko-Parabelskiy part of Tomsk Oblast is in the south and center of the oblast. It is divided into 20 sections--blocks that range from 2,000 to 6,000 sq meters each. Approximately 20 deposits of oil and gas are found here. Oil reserves that can be extracted from them range from 0.4 to 4.0 million tonnes and more. It has been admitted that development of these oilfields is not profitable for the Tomsk Oblast oil refineries, but profits could be made if modern Western technology were to be used. The total amount of reserve oil that can be extracted for industrial purposes in the Pudinsko-Parabelskiy area is 28.6 million tonnes; average reserves of oil in the oilfields is 1.6 million tonnes; extractable reserves of gas condensates total 13.1 million tonnes; and extractable reserves of gas total 72,346 billion cubic meters. From a geological perspective, only 30 percent of this section has been studied.] The Oblast Administration Is Happy With the Results of the Competition Only two companies participated in the last competition. The second one, the Russian Konventsiya Joint Stock Company together, with its co-investor, the Norwegian firm Skaninvest (Scandinavian International & Investment), did not provide information about its financial and technological capabilities. In addition, Konventsiya proposed $2.2 million in bonus payments and $10 million for conducting geological exploration work during 1994-95 in an area of 7,400 square kilometers. Meanwhile, the IMEG consortium pledged to pay a bonus of $8.5 million, as well as to spend a minimum of $46 million only on exploration of deposits in an area of 2,870 sq kms during the first five years. According to the IMEG proposal, the Russian share of the project's profits would be 64-66 percent. According to Vladimir Ponomarenko, first deputy chief of the Tomsk Oblast Administration, IMEG's victory in the competition--one condition of which was participation in developing new deposits for the Tomskneft Joint Stock Company and the Tomskneftegazgeologiya State Enterprise--will result in creating new employment, saving the geological service, and implementing a program for supplying the oblast with gas. In addition, the Russian side is counting on receiving 25 percent of the extracted raw material and, moreover, around two thirds of all payments tied to exploration and development of deposits will remain in the oblast. The oblast administration estimates that capital expenditures alone by foreign investors to implement this project will amount to $300-400 million. A significant portion of this money will "settle" in the oblast. Tomskneft Is Not Happy With the Results of the Competition Leonid Filimonov, general director of Tomskneft, announced at a press conference, that the day before he had had a "tough talk" about the results of the competition with Viktor Kress, head of the Tomsk Oblast Administration, who had signed off on the results of the competition. Mr. Filimonov declared that he found out about the competition only one month before the results were announced. So, even if Tomskneft had participated in the competition, it could not have prepared itself well enough to compete with the foreigners. More than anything else with regard to the results of the competition, Mr. Filimonov was indignant about the fact that a foreign concern became the owner of a license to develop the territory. Mr. Filimonov believes that the administration should have given "a priority to local forces, to the union of oil men, oil technicians, and geologists, and then we could have invited foreigners...". The head of Tomskneft declared that he "thinks that the consortium will not invite me to work, but will invite its own foreign workers." In his words, Tomskneft "is the enterprise that we are establishing to supply the oblast with gas, and it should receive a priority license for exploring deposits." [Boxed item] Over the last two years this is already the second scandal revolving around Russian tenders, organized by the Geointertek Joint Enterprise. On November 20, 1992, KOMMERSANT-DAILY wrote that a certain Commission for Financial and Legal Control and Struggle Against Corruption, under the then Premier Yegor Gaydar, had been checking the results of oil tenders in the Republic of Komi, organized by Geointertek. The competition was won by the American Occidental Oil Company, which pledged to pay a bonus of $10.5 million. A check was written for the first $2.02 million. However, as the Commission found out, in 1992 this money did not go to Russia. Edvard Gendelman, deputy chairman of the Geointertek board, deposited the entire amount of the bonus--in two parts--in the account of the Central Bank in Denver. Then, according to information from the Commission, "notwithstanding the demands of the Central Bank to transfer the given amount to Russia," it was transferred to the account of the Nafta/UK/LTD Company in the Indosuez Bank in London. But after five days, the entire sum was transferred to the account of Ukhtaneftegazgeologiya in Komi. Members of the above Commission declared that this occurred thanks to their efforts and pressure on the directors of Geointertek. The results of the Commission's investigation were handed over to the prosecutor and the Directorate of Internal Affairs of Tomsk Oblast, but nothing came of the verification that took place there. Meanwhile, the directors of the Joint Venture itself do not see anything illegal in any of these maneuvers with the $10.5 million. According to Mr. Teplitskiy's explanation, the bonus was not supposed to be transferred to Russia prior to the signing of the documents testifying to the results of the competition. With regard to "throwing" the money to London, well, this was done so that the money could be sent directly from there to a bank in Komi. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, the Joint Venture has statements from banks in Denver and London to the effect that the money could not have been used in any way by Gendelman. Mr. Teplitskiy believes that the efforts of Gaydar's commission did not at all facilitate the transfer of the money to Russia: "It would have come without all that." Incidentally, by decision of the Komi Council of Ministers, for organizing this competition the Geointertek Joint Venture received about $2 million that came out of the bonus payments.] Organizers of the Competition Are Happy With Everything Vladimir Teplitskiy, acting head of the Geointertek Joint Enterprise, which conducted the competition, told the correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY that "the scandal surrounding the results of the competition was caused by political motives and attempts by certain forces to compromise Governor Viktor Kress." Mr. Teplitskiy insisted that the rules of the competition were not violated, but simply changed over these past two years and were related, in part, to conditions for paying out bonuses. According to him, even under these new conditions Geointertek had great difficulty in attracting the attention of foreign firms towards this competition because the Ministry of Economics had concluded that the development of these territories was unprofitable. In any case, Mr. Teplitskiy admitted that studies of this area were very weak and that it might be possible to find large oilfields at deeper and older strata, which--for all practical purposes--have not been studied here at all. Huge investments are needed for this. For this reason, Mr. Teplitskiy considers the results of the competition as a great victory, all the more because the IMEG project will provide work to the poverty-stricken Tomsk oil geologists. Be that as it may, in addition to the term "a block of territory," the rules of the competition also had the term "a single block"--an area of 100 sq kms from which large blocks were formed. According to Mr. Teplitskiy, it was not allowed to subdivide precisely these single blocks, but any of the large 20 blocks could be subdivided. At any rate, he admitted that it was possible to have a "double meaning" from reading this text. In Mr. Teplitskiy's words, the announcement about renewing the competition was published well in advance in the bulletin of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy and the Russian Geology Committee, so anyone who was interested had time to participate in the competition. It is true, he admitted, that nothing was said about changes in the rules or conditions for the competition in this announcement.
