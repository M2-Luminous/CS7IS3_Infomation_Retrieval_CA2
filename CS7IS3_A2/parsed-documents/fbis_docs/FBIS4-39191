This is announced in a statement Interfax received from the Tajik Movement for Islamic Revival (MIR). The statement was signed by one of the movement's leaders, Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda. According to the statement, the assertion of Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoly Adamishin, that the opposition was involved in terrorist acts launched in Tajikistan, runs counter to reality. Adamishin made the statement in an interview with INTERFAX on 27 May. "Certain circles are used to blaming everything on the opposition," the statement says. "Acts of terror and violence committed in Dushanbe and other areas of Tajikistan reflect intrigues by the forces which are not interested in resolving the conflict peacefully, and which seek to hinder the process of talks. It's they who unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for the purpose of seizing power, not for the purpose of restoring peace, law and order." The MIR hopes that "Russia will not divide Tajik citizens into friends and enemies." "A mediator should be neutral, disinterested and just. If he departs from these principles and takes the side of one of the parties concerned, he loses the right to act as a mediator," the statement says.
