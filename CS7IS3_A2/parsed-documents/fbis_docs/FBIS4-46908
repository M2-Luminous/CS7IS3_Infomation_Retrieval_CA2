This Statute establishes unified regulations throughout the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan with regard to privatization of housing in state-owned and municipally-owned housing holdings, terms for the payment of compensation in the form of an additional amount of individual privatization deposits to citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan who have substandard living conditions, as well as the fundamental principles for payment of expenditures for the maintenance and repair of housing that has undergone privatization. 2. The fundamental principles governing privatization of state-owned and municipally-owned housing are: -- acceptance of housing ownership on a voluntary basis; -- free transfer to citizens of housing occupied by them in state-owned (or municipally-owned) housing units, regardless of the total amount of living space or the commercial value of the housing; -- preservation of the key elements of the previous system for the use, repair and maintenance of privatized housing; -- payment of compensation in the form of an additional amount of individual privatization deposits to citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan who do not have housing or have housing conditions that are below the average level achieved in this republic (16.2 sq. meters of total living space per capita), regardless of the form of housing ownership. Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in housing that is not slated for privatization or who has living conditions below the average level of housing provision in the republic (16.2 sq. meters per capita) has a right to receive compensation in the form of additional means of payment, usable for purposes of privatization. A citizen has the right to receive compensation once, regardless of the form of ownership of the housing occupied by that citizen. Compensation will be provided in the following amounts: -- for citizens without housing (renters in privately-owned buildings and buildings belonging to housing construction cooperatives; persons subletting in state-owned and communal housing with no other residence permit): R40,000 [rubles] in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens without housing who are living in specialized buildings (in buildings belonging to the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Social Security, the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health or the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Internal Affairs, and who have no permanent residence permit outside those institutions): R40,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens with no housing who are living in dormitories (with the exception of seasonal and temporary workers and individuals working under temporary contracts, as well as citizens who are resident in connection with study): R40,000 rubles in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens living in housing classified (according to legally established procedure) as hazardous and dilapidated: R40,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens living in closed military settlements and in official housing: R30,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens with less than 5 sq. meters of living space (inclusive) per person: R30,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens with between 5 and 10 sq. meters of living space (inclusive) per person: R20,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); -- citizens with between 10 and 16.2 sq. meters of living space (inclusive) per person: R10,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits). Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in a building belonging to a housing construction cooperative has a right to receive compensation in the form of additional privatization payments in the amount of R10,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits). 3. The right to privatization of housing in state-owned and municipally-owned buildings belongs to the citizens who are permanently registered in those buildings, including citizens who are temporarily absent but have retained a legal right to the housing in question. Citizens who have reserved housing have a right to the privatization of housing at their place of reservation. 4. Housing may be privatized only with the written consent of all the adult citizens living in the housing in question. Privatized housing becomes the joint property of all the citizens living in it, including minors. Minor citizens must be listed among housing owners. In the event that citizens move to other state-owned (or municipally-owned) housing for the purpose of improving their living conditions in accordance with current legislation and have taken up residence in that housing on the basis of a lease, the citizens in question have a right to privatization of the housing previously occupied by them. A housing privatization contract may be dissolved with the mutual consent of the parties to the contract, or in the event of a dispute, by a court on the basis of a suit filed by one of the parties. Any citizen who dissolves a housing privatization act through legally established procedure retains the right to free privatization of the housing in a state-owned (or municipally-owned) building which that citizen occupies under the terms of a housing lease. 5. Housing units in buildings in need of capital repairs are to be privatized on the usual terms. 6. Housing which is in a hazardous state or is located in dormitories, specialized buildings or in buildings at closed military settlements may not be privatized. Local soviets of people's deputies, in conjunction with enterprises, institutions and organizations and with consideration for the opinion of trade unions (as expressed by appropriate bodies thereof) or, in the absence of such, the opinion of workers' direct representatives who have been properly elected and authorized in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Tatarstan, shall determine the portion (list) of official housing that is not subject to privatization. Privatization of housing (apartments) in buildings which are historical or cultural monuments must be carried out in accordance with the "Statute on Procedure and Terms for Privatization of Buildings Which Are Historical or Cultural Monuments." 7. Housing in communal apartments may be privatized with the consent of all tenants. In such cases rooms occupied by tenants become the property of their residents, but kitchens, hallways, bathrooms, etc. remain common property. 8. As a rule, interviews with citizens and the preparation and issuance of documents establishing property rights are to be carried out by housing maintenance enterprises and their subordinate units (susequently to be referred to as HMEs), ministerial (departmental) enterprises, organizations and institutions which have state-owned housing on their books, and HMEs under local soviets of people's deputies which own municipal housing. Special centers (agencies, bureaus) for the privatization of state-owned and municipally-owned housing may be established to perform work connected with document processing relative to housing privatization in cities (or rayons). 9. Local soviets of people's deputies shall establish regional commissions to oversee and organize housing privatization processes. A housing privatization commission operates pursuant to the "Statute on Commissions for the Privatization of State and Municipal Housing," as approved by the Republic of Tatarstan State Committee for State Property Management. 10. During the preparatory period, i.e. prior to enactment of the law, HME specialists shall fill out a draft "Contract on the Transfer of Housing to Citizens" for each housing unit that may be privatized. This draft contract is to be signed and registered by the head of the city (or rayon) administration, and also be registered with technical inventory agencies. Upon completion of this preparatory work, HMEs shall inform each area's population of the business hours and location of the office that will conduct interviews with citizens. 11. Citizens must submit to the appropriate HME an application for privatization of a housing unit signed by all the adult citizens who live together in that unit. In view of the fact that every citizen has a right to acquire a housing unit in a state- or municipally-owned building free of charge as part of the privatization process only one time, in the event of changes of residence a document must be attached to the application certifying that the housing unit previously occupied by the citizens in question has not been privatized. 12. A specialist will verify the correctness of the application form and correlate the information inidicated therein with corresponding information contained in the previously prepared draft contract. If no comments are to be made, one copy of the completed contract will be issued to the applicant. A second copy of the contract will remain with the HME, and a third will be sent to technical inventory agencies so that they can maintain state-mandated records of housing according to established procedure. 13. In cases of discrepancies between information provided by the applicant and information contained in the draft contract, documents pertaining to privatization of the housing unit in question shall be handed over to a regional commission for consideration and resolution. In such cases decisions on housing privatization matters must be made not later than one month from the date the documents are submitted to the HME. 14. Payments for processing of documents pertaining to the transfer of housing ownership will be made by citizens at a single rate equal to 0.4 times the minimum wage. 15. In the event that a citizen's rights are violated in connection with housing privatization matters, that citizen has a right to appeal to a housing privatization commission or to a court. 16. Rules for record keeping regarding citizens, including those living in privatized housing units who require improvement of their living conditions, as well as assignment of housing units in the Republic of Tatarstan, shall be governed by current legislation. 17. Owners of privatized housing units in buildings that are state-owned or municipally-owned constitute building users with regard to physical plant and common areas, and owners joined together in societies or other associations constitute co-owners in proportion to the area of the building occupied by them. 18. Maintenance and repair of privatized housing units (apartments), buildings which contain privatized housing units (apartments), and entirely privatized residential buildings are to be performed in compliance with existing regulations and standards governing housing use and repair. 19. State HMEs retain their obligations with regard to the maintenance and ongoing and capital repairs of privatized housing units (apartments) and buildings containing privatized housing units (apartments) which were serviced by them prior to the start of privatization. 20. Owners of housing units (apartments) in a multi-unit apartment building are required to share common expenditures for the maintenance and repair of the structure (residential building), its physical plant and areas adjacent to the building in accordance with the "Contract on Transfer of a Housing Unit to Citizen Ownership." 21. For the purpose of efficient maintenance, servicing and repair of privatized housing, owners may form societies or other associations operating on the basis of bylaws. 22. Prior to the formation of a society of apartment owners (co-owners of a building), relations between apartment owners and the HME that administers the multi-unit apartment building in question with regard to servicing and repair of the building, adjacent areas and privatized apartments shall be based on a contract covering services to the building, adjacent areas and privatized apartments. Under that contract the HME pledges to perform a number of jobs in connection with the maintenance and ongoing and capital repair of the building and adjacent areas in accordance with the requirements of the "Regulations for Housing Use and Maintenance of Housing and Adjoining Areas" on the terms specified for state-owned and municipally-owned housing, and also: -- conduct preventive inspections of plumbing fixtures in apartments twice annually; -- repair plumbing fixtures at the request of the apartment owner using the owner's materials or in exchange for additional payment, if the HME supplies materials. The property owner is required to make monthly payments for the HME's services and for municipal services equivalent to the payments (rent and payment for municipal services) as established for renters in state-owned and municipally-owned housing. A schedule of monthly payments for building maintenance, municipal services and other services to the apartment owner must be attached to the contract. 23. Owners of privatized housing units are required to pay a tax in accordance with current tax legislation. 24. A society of apartment owners is a co-owner of a multi-unit apartment building, and the terms of this co-ownership must be set forth in a "Contract on Joint Ownership of Housing and Share Participation in Its Maintenance." The entity on the balance sheet of which the building is listed and other legal persons that are co-owners of the building are required to conclude the aforementioned contract. 25. When concluding a "Contract on Joint Ownership of Housing and Share Participation in Its Maintenance" an HME may, by decision of the building's co-owners, delegate to the society a portion of its rights and obligations with regard to maintenance and repair of the building and adjoining areas. The society may act as customer when contracts are concluded with contractors for municipal services, ensure participation in all expenditures connected with property maintenance and repair commensurate to each co-owner's share of ownership, ensure timely payment of funds set aside for those purposes, represent the co-owners' interests before state and other institutions, etc. 26. After all the apartments in a multi-unit apartment building have been privatized, the apartment building, with the exception of attached or adjoining non-dwelling structures, may be transferred to the ownership of the citizens who have joined together to form a society. Only in that case may the building be transferred from the balance sheet of the HME to that of the society. Transfer of ownership of an apartment building is to be performed by the entity on the balance sheet of which the building is listed by agreement with the owner or a body authorized by the owner, in accordance with current legislation. 27. Relations between the client -- the society of apartment owners -- and the contractor -- the HME or other organization that repairs or maintains the building and adjoining areas -- are to be established on a contractual basis. 28. Communications networks inside apartments, physical plant and other facilities are not subject to privatization. 29. The owners of privatized housing units are responsible for their maintenance and repair in accordance with current legislation. 30. Monitoring of the condition and timely repair of privatized housing is to be carried out by local soviets of people's deputies.
