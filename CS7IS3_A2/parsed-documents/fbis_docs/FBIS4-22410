Their principle is that a lie that is told fourteen times becomes more convincing than a truth that is told once--but they forget that the truth is a sharper sword than a lie. The embassy's work has a closed and unseen side which, like an iceberg, is much bigger than what is visible. I will not say anything about it here; diplomacy does not like to be advertised. Its results will speak for themselves. The main object, the embassy's prime task until now, has been accomplished: two sovereign states--Georgia and Russia--have concluded a major agreement and other agreements; we have created the juridical base for cooperation on an equal footing. This is an historic event in the life of Georgia, and our embassy has made its own contribution. Now I will say something about the visible part of the work of our embassy and myself as the ambassador. For more clarity, I will cite some comparisons: The ambassadors of 166 countries are now accredited in Moscow. I can affirm that all of them together in the past 10 months have not held as many press conferences as Georgia's ambassador and embassy have, or given so many interviews to the mass media as Georgia's ambassador and embassy officials have. All of the 166 ambassadors together have not appeared on Russian television as often as Georgia's ambassador has. Those embassies have not made as many statements to the media or sent as many notes (verbal or written) to Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry as the Georgian embassy has, concerning our country's most urgent questions. No other ambassador has done more than Georgia's ambassador to contact, negotiate, and talk with Russia's and Moscow's leaders about our country's economic, political, military, social, and other issues--leaders such as Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, Soskovets, Shokhin, Shakhray, Kozyrev, Grachev, Kolesnikov, Gromov, Luzhkov, members of Russia's former Supreme Soviet, and other high officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. No other ambassadors and embassy diplomats in Moscow have had so many meetings and talks with the ambassadors of other countries (including ambassadors of the Big Seven) and embassy diplomats to clarify their countries' position, as have Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats. That is the truth, and if that isn't diplomatic activity on our part, what is? Now let us talk about other aspects. No other embassy does more about its country's economy than Georgia's embassy. No other country's embassy and ambassador (including those of the CIS) has received and entertained so many official, business, unofficial, and non-business delegations, businessmen and non-businessmen, members of parliament, and lower-ranking officials and our own ordinary citizens countrymen (generally without prior appointment, people who happen to be in Moscow), as Georgia's ambassador and embassy have. All the ambassadors and embassy diplomats of the 166 countries together have not taken in so many refugees as Georgia's embassy has, as many countrymen arriving in Moscow or going to other countries via Moscow, as our embassy has, or had to cope with as many headaches as our embassy staffers. And that is the truth! After all that, how can anyone with a trace of elementary human decency say barefaced that Georgia has no embassy or ambassador in Moscow? Now let's look at the conditions under which our embassy and its staffers have to work. None of the 166 embassies in Moscow have such poor and wretched conditions in material, financial, and technical terms as does Georgia's embassy. The embassy has lived on charity all year. Georgia's embassy in Moscow is in fact an embassy's embassy because of Russia's importance to our country. This is where independent Georgia's vital questions are decided. And the workload on the embassy's staffers is many times greater than that of any of Georgia's embassies in other countries, and it is commonly agreed that Moscow holds first place in the world in terms of the cost of living. It costs more to live there. Hence, Georgia's embassy in Moscow leads everyone else in terms of its importance, its workload, and the cost of living. And yet, our own government has set salary rates for its Moscow embassy personnel that are only one-thirteenth--yes, that's right--one-thirteenth the rates set for Georgian diplomats in any other country. On top of all that, none of all the 166 countries' ambassadors and embassy diplomats together have to take as much abuse as do Georgia's ambassador and embassy diplomats in Moscow, which shows how much our work is "appreciated." That's how we Georgians are! Enough, I think! Indecency has gone on long enough! This is not to give the impression that our embassy in Moscow is doing ideal work. It has many shortcomings, and Georgia's head of state has pointed them out, in a spirit of good will, with the desire to correct them. As for our other "friends," however, we advise them to follow his example and stop abusing the embassy and the ambassador. If they really care about the work of Georgia's embassy in Moscow (and not about the ambassador's chair), let them help it financially and with technical assistance, and if they can't then let them kindly refrain from giving us advice (if they have the ability). Anyway, it won't work for them, because those on whom the fate of the embassy and its personnel depends are not going to listen to idle talk, and this is the only happiness in our hellish work.
