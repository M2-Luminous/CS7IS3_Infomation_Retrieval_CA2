The computer model was built using FORTRAN programming language. Data based on assumptions, task times and lapse times were input into the model. In making assumptions, the team relied on historical data to the extent that such information was available. The Team also relied on an April 1993 OWA study that outlines the current disability claim process, including all administrative appeals, and describes the tasks performed by line-employees in the seven operational components that are involved with the disability claim process.
