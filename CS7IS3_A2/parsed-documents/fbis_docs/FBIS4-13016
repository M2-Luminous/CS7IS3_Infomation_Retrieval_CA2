The motion tabled by CPI and Janata Dal members sought to discuss the signing of the GATT agreement. The deputy speaker, Mr. A.B. Subramaniam, while refusing permission for the motion said that the subject does not come under the purview of the union territory's assembly. The lone CPI member attended the session with a black towel on his shoulders to protest the signing of the GATT accord today. In Kerala, the 12-hour statewide bundh [strike] called by the CPI-ML [Communist Party of India-Marxist Leninist] today evoked little response. Barring some minor incidents of stone throwing, the bundh was by and large peaceful. Some shops and business establishments remained closed. However, traffic plied as usual. The bundh call was given in protest against India signing the GATT agreement.
