If this does not happen, we will reach an impasse, according to the chief of staff. Lieutenant General Baraq also said that even if full peace and security arrangements are achieved, Israel will still need to preserve its military power and superiority for many years to come in the 21st century. He also said that terrorism will accompany us for a long time to come, and that we must also prepare to confront nonconventional dangers emanating from Iraq, Iran, and Libya. Our correspondent Haviva Roger reports that the chief of staff was addressing Haifa Technion graduates.
