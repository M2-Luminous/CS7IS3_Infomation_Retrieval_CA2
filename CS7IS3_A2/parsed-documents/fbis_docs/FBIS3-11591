FBIS3-11591 "drlat056_k_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-056 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Mar 1994 SOUTH AMERICA Argentina Government Believes Tucuman Incident `Overcome' PY2203135294 PY2203135294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish on 19 March carries, on page 13, a 500-word article by Mariano Obarrio which notes that "the Interior Ministry did not officially comment on the attack on the Tucuman Congress building, although high-level officials are aware of the details of the incident." Interior Ministry Spokesman Julio Macchi explained, however, that it was a strictly provincial problem and that this ministry cannot interfere unless the provincial authorities ask. Macchi said that on 17 March Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf met with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega who commented that "the problem had been overcome." The same page of this newspaper carries a 400-word article by Hector Domingo Padilla datelined San Miguel de Tucuman on the heated meeting held by Tucuman Congress during which the Executive Branch was held responsible for the attack on 17 March. Prior to the session, which ended with a declaration voicing confidence that the corresponding investigations will be made and those responsible punished, "acting Provincial Congress President Mario Cristian Saracho was visited by a group of leaders of the regional CGT [General Confederation of Labor] who apologized for the recent incidents and expressed respect for the democratic regime." On the same page is another 450-word unattributed report which notes that "while Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega yesterday rejected charges by the opposition that the serious incidents caused by some 200 workers on 17 March against the provincial Congress building were a maneuver to intervene this body, the court ordered the arrest of Tucuman CGT Secretary General Miguel Brito and his secretary Luis Gonzalez for their alleged participation in the incident." Governor Ortega denied that the incident had political connotations like those in Santiago del Estero last December and commented that among the demonstrators were people who had nothing to do with La Florida Sugar Mill. Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 on 19 March, on page 5, carries a 550-word interview with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega by Hector Ali in San Miguel de Tucuman during which Ortega blurted out that "it is time legislators started to show courage and stopped seeking political profit from the peoples' needs and anguish." He notes that Tucuman's problem is quite different to the one in Santiago del Estero where public servants did not get paid for three consecutive months. He also refutes criticisms by Radical Legislator Gumersindo Parajon who said the incident was a maneuver to justify the intervention of Congress and added that he is not concerned about rumors that the riots are orchestrated in Buenos Aires in an attempt to thwart his intention to run as vice president.
