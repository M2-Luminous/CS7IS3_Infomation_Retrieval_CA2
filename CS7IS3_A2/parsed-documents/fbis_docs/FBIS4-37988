"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are eager to see Yemeni brothers put an end to their destructive war," 'Abdallah said during a stopover in Abu Dhabi. 'Abdallah met with his United Arab Emirates counterpart Shaykh Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan following a meeting in Jeddah with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal. 'Abdallah said: "It is up to the Yemenis to decide" their future, referring to the south's declaration of the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21. The secession was implicitly recognised by five members of the GCC -- Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrein and Kuwait -- which said unity could not be imposed by force. 'Abdallah said the UN Security Council, currently chaired by Oman, is examining a draft resolution on Yemen. "The project is the subject of consultations between the five permanent members of the Security Council," he said without elaborating. Oman and Saudi Arabia played a key role in the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 924 of June 1, which called for an immediate ceasefire. [passage omitted]
