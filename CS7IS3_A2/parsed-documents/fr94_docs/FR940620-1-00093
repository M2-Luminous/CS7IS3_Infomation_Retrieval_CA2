(f) Marking requirements. The contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f) (6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at subparagraph (f) (2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at subparagraph (f)(3), the SBIR data rights legend at subparagraph (f)(4), or, the special license rights legend at subparagraph (f)(5); and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402. (1) General marking instructions. The contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software shall not be inserted in the software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, unless the contracting officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproduction of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.
