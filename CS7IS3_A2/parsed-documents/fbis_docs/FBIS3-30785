On the basis of a joint decleration, jointly signed by the representatives of Yugoslavia and Croatia in Geneva on January 19, a Yugoslav bureau will also be opened in Zagreb. The bureaus should secure communication between the two governments, ease the resolution of open issues, build up mutual trust and establish the normalization of good-neighbourly relations, cooperation and stability in the region, the Yugoslav government said. The Yugoslav Government also adopted a platform for talks between the Yugoslav and Croatian vice-premiers -- Zeljko Simic and Mate Granic -- in Zagreb on February 12 and empowered Simic to sign a document on the status of the bureaus which will employ eight people each.
