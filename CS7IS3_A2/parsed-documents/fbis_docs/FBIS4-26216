The number of pilot law firms from foreign countries and from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will be increased from the current 41 to around 100 by the end of 1995, said Shen Bailu, director of the ministry's lawyers administration department, in an interview with XINHUA. "They will be allowed to open offices in more coastal cities and provincial capitals than the current five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou," Shen said, adding that the move is part of China's effort to meet the rising demand for foreign trade and economic cooperation. However, the official noted, so-called "human rights lawyers" or "democracy lawyers," who might jeopardize China's social stability and investment environment, "will be barred from coming in." Shen said China holds a tight rein on the operation of overseas law firms in the country, because "restrictions in the field of legal service are just common practice in the world." Through pilot schemes, China is drawing experience on the administration of overseas law firms in China, he said. Relevant laws and regulations will be made to govern them in the next several years to safeguard the Sino-overseas exchanges and cooperation in the field of legal services, shen added. The official said the overseas lawyers' offices have played an important role in introducing investors and projects to China. They have also handled quite a number of cases for Chinese clients and provided consultation for both government organs and enterpreneurs. According to Shen, some 120 overseas law firms have lodged formal applications to his ministry to set up offices in China, whose economy is booming and where business opportunities abound. While overseas law firms are coming in, their Chinese counterparts are planning to set up offices abroad, shen said. So far, two Chinese law firms have opened offices in the United States and Singapore. But shen said his ministry will be strict in approving such offices to avoid random set-ups and only those with good business prospects might be ratified to venture into overseas markets. The business operations of the two law firms abroad were both ranked "very good" by the ministry official.
