This fully demonstrates the high importance that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach to agricultural and rural work. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Handling well this year's agricultural and rural work is of particularly pressing and practical significance. China truly needs a stable social and economic environment since this year is an important year for implementing the "Decision" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and for establishing a socialist market economy. Social and economic stability depends first of all on the development of agriculture and stability in rural areas, on the abundant supply of sideline agricultural products, and on achieving market stability. Past experience shows that whenever agricultural development exists, stability prevails in rural areas, stability exists in the entire society, and reform and development can be smoothly promoted. Therefore, we should make every effort to promote agricultural and rural work. Only when the agricultural base is consolidated and when the rural areas enjoy stability can there be stability in the entire country, can the reform be smoothly carried out, and can the economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Last year, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council adopted a number of important measures whose major aims were to solve such problems as the issuance of "IOU's" in the procurement of sideline agricultural products and the problem of excessive burdens on farmers. Those measures have protected and mobilized farmers' enthusiasm for farming and have been instrumental in helping maintain excellent development momentum for agriculture and the rural economy. At present, the general situation in rural areas is good. But we should also know that we cannot afford to overlook some problems and contradictions in agriculture and rural areas. They include: low efficiency in the production of grain; difficulties in fulfilling this year's production plan for such staple agricultural products as grain and cotton; slow growth in farmers' incomes; and the widening income gap between urban and rural citizens. Therefore, the entire party and all levels of government departments should attach great importance to these problems and contradictions and adopt timely measures to solve them. It should be pointed out that definite goals for agricultural and rural development have been set, and various concrete principles and policies have been adopted. The key now lies in effectively implementing them. At present it is necessary to implement every concrete measure in a step-by-step manner in line with arrangements worked out by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, to promote this year's rural economic development, to increase the income of farmers, and to bring social stability to rural areas. This is the basic task of this year's agricultural and rural work. First, we must give priority to doing a good job in grain, cotton, and edible oil production and in the "shopping basket" project; we must increase the effective supply of agricultural sideline products; and we must contribute to the alleviation of inflation pressure. We must maintain stable grain production growth because grain is a special commodity and has an important bearing on stability in a country. In a big country like ours, we must strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain production and attain a rough balance between supply and demand in grain. Major grain growing regions should do a good job on grain production. Developed coastal regions should also strive to prevent a further shrinkage in the acreage of land available for grain production and stabilize grain output and the grain inventory. All levels of governments should attach great importance to cotton production and try for a big increase in cotton production this year. Mayors of all large and medium-sized cities should include the "shopping basket project" on their major agenda and ensure an abundant supply of non staple food and price stability. In addition, effective measures should be worked out to promote comprehensive development of the rural economy and to bring about a large increase in the incomes of farmers. We must take the resolute step of developing high-output, high-quality, and high-efficiency farming. On the premise of stabilizing grain and cotton production, great efforts should be made to promote multiple farming operations and to comprehensively develop farming, forestry, animal husbandry, agricultural sideline products, and fisheries. The development of diverse forms of secondary and tertiary industries, including agricultural sideline product processing, should be greatly encouraged. At the same time, support should be given to developing a number of "locomotive" enterprises and businesses that integrate trading, industrial, and agricultural operations. Separate guidance should be given to village and township enterprises according to their lines of operation. Particular attention should be given to supporting the development of village and township enterprises in central and western regions of China. We must continuously do a good job in lightening the burdens on farmers and earnestly implement the "State Plan to Move 80 Million People Out of Poverty in Seven Years." Promoting further development of the rural economy requires the main line of deepening reform to be firmly upheld. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Committee's rural work conference last October have made arrangements for that. Localities should proceed from reality, boldly explore, and carry out promotional work vigorously. On the premise of a stable policy, we need to improve the basic operating system in rural areas; give vigorous support to, offer correct guidance to, sum up the experiences of, standardize, and healthily develop the various shareholding and cooperation systems. It is necessary to further reform the grain procurement system; enhance the state's macro regulation and control over grain; ensure grain supply; prevent big upheavals in grain price; deepen reform of the financial system as well as the supply and marketing system in rural areas; and promote development of the rural economy. The strengthening of agricultural status and the development of the rural economy are inseparable from the importance attached to them by various levels of leading organs. The latest CPC Central Committee rural work conference has defined responsibility and decided that in assessing future performance, agricultural and rural work will be made an important criterion in evaluating the political performance of all levels of leading cadres. This is an important measure to further enhance the leadership of all levels of party committees and governments for agricultural and rural work. Tackling agricultural and rural work requires not only dealing with economic development, but also grassroots organization building, spiritual civilization building, and comprehensive management of social order. It is our belief that the entire party and society will surely help bring about a new and prosperous phase in our country's rural areas through their joint efforts.
