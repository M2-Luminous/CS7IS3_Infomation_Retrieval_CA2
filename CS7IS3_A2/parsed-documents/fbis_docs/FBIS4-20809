Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical Academy, to which the Techonin institute belongs, was reacting to articles published by the Czech press on Thursday [17 March] and today, according to which the institute developed dangerous species of bacteria and viruses destined for the production of biological weapons. The right-leaning daily CESKY DENIK reports that such substances have been stored in several places in the Czech Republic. "Biological weapons have never been developed, produced or stored here. The institute was not constructed for such activities. The institute has never been asked to do such work," Fusek said. The Czech Republic has fulfilled -- without exception -- the convention which bound it not to develop, produce or store chemical weapons. The premises of the mentioned institute were opened to an international inspection in May 1990, he stressed. Fusek also dismissed the allegation by CESKY DENIK that germs of cholera, plague and other dangerous substances were used in the institute. The Czech Defence Ministry has not so far commented on the issue, which, according to a ministry spokesperson, will be taken up at a ministry press conference today.
