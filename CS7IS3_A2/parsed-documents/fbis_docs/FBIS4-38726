He told the Federation Council that this would be inflationary. According to Shokhin, the budget revenue was eight trillion rubles short of the target in the first four months of the year. The debts to banks amounted to 6.5 trillion rubles, to the suppliers, 23 trillion rubles and to the customers, 28 trillion rubles in the first quarter of 1994. Shokhin said that reducing the inflation rate, which has ranged between eight and nine percent a month, and issue of treasury bills to pay 800 billion rubles of the state debt to factories were the priority steps in resolving the debt crisis. He added that the government would continue centralized crediting of factories; in particular, the Central Bank had allocated four trillion rubles for that purpose. Shokhin promised that the government would follow through on the procedure of declaring insolvent factories bankrupt. Twelve factories out of more than 1000 are under close scrutiny the results of which will be discussed by the government in mid-June, he said.
