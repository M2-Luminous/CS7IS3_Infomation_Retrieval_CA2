On top of the agenda are four huge reservoirs -- Guanyinge, Dongfeng, Baishi and Yanwangbizi -- the first of which will be able to hold 950 million cubic m of water, official sources here said. River water will also be diverted into Jinxi and Dalian, to relieve the water shortages in the two major manufacturing cities in the province. Another diversion project is planned to start in 1998 to supply 1.88 billion cubic m of water a year to the western part of the province from the eastern. As one of the Chinese provinces with the largest industry, Liaoning's available water resources per person are only one-third of the national average. Its industry is losing 10 billion yuan a year from water shortages, according to the sources. The province plans to invest as much as 11 billion yuan in these projects, which will be completed by the year 2010. To secure its water demands up to the year 2030, Liaoning also plans to divert water from neighbouring Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, the sources said.
