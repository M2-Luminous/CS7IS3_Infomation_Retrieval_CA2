The bill was submitted by opposition MP Katrin Linde. Peeter Lorents, chairman of the defense commission, said the bill was turned down because it contained contradictions with the Constitution. Lorents said it was possible that Linde would bring the draft in line with legal standards and submit it to the parliament for a second time. Lorents added that discussion of the draft had taken place in a peaceful parliamentary atmosphere. Linde's suggestions were met with irony ranging to taunt at Monday's meeting of the parliament. [sentence as received] The draft suggested the dismissal of Aleksander Einseln and revoking the earlier law on his appointment to office. [passage omitted]
