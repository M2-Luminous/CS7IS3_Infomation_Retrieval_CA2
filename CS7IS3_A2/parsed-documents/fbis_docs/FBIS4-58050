On that day, they realized an unprecedented historic achievement. They accomplished the greatest and most fundamental democratic and strategic mission along the road to a united Yemen, and toward establishing the foundations of its shura-inspired and democratic system of government on the basis of political pluralism and a multiparty system, and in accordance with the principle of universal suffrage, and direct and secret balloting. This sought to consecrate the principle of popular participation, as well as the peaceful and democratic exchange of authority. Our people have accomplished this great mission with matchless success, and in an honorable democratic competition, the fairness of which was attested to by all fraternal and friendly parties which closely watched the [words indistinct] elections. Thus, our people managed to occupy their special position among all peoples of the civilized community of nations in the course of efforts to build a democratic community on the basis of free choice, as well as peaceful and democratic competition. By so doing, our people demonstrated that there was no longer any room within their ranks for any form of tyranny, (?parochialism), or tribalism, which could rehabilitate the imamate regime, colonial rule, and the humiliating partitioning, particularly since the injustice and darkness of these worn-out totalitarian systems of government have been cast away by time, and brushed aside by the winds of change and transformation. On this occasion, the General People's Congress [GPC] appeals to all Yemeni national forces [words indistinct] to reiterate their commitment to the democratic course being pursued by our people and our unified state. Since the inception of the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990, the GPC has sought to epitomize this course in order to set a splendid example in terms of respect for and compliance with this course for other national parties and political organizations. It has been doing so by democratizing its action programs. There is no denying that the GPC has encountered several difficulties along this road since the beginning of the transitional period on 22 May. Nonetheless, the GPC was careful not to allow these difficulties to become an excuse for abandoning this course, or for revoking its commitment to hold the elections in order to enable the people to cast their votes and to make their choices through the election of their representatives to the first elected legislative body. Given all this, the GPC has spared no effort to do all that could have been done to convince others of the need to promote the march of unity and democracy to help implement the constitution of a unified Yemen, which was approved in a national referendum, so that Yemen may establish its political system on the basis of the constitutional legitimacy gained through direct and free elections. In this regard, there is no need to explain the efforts the GPC has made, or to detail the extensive dialogues and meetings it has held, or even to the moves it has made to safeguard the dignity of all sides, particularly [words indistinct] to reassure them, and help them overcome the fears they had about their future in the context of the political pluralism of united Yemen. The strongest evidence of this was the fact that the GPC leadership and bodies expressed a willingness to merge with the YSP so the two parties could share the same destiny and fate, not to mention that the GPC proposed other formulas for [words indistinct] alliance with the (?YSP). However, all these proposals have not, regrettably, met with any measure of favorable response or understanding. There is no doubt that our people are well aware that our partners in the unity deal actually agreed to take part in the elections only after the GPC had provided them with guarantees, made concessions to them, and demonstrated goodwill toward them. When the elections were held under the close scrutiny and observation of Arabs and international agencies, those who supervised the election process had no doubts at all about the fairness and honesty of the elections. Although some undemocratic practices were committed by some people during their election campaigns and the balloting process, the overall election process earned the admiration and appreciation of the entire world community. It never dawned on the GPC that its landslide victory in these elections would provoke the grudges of some parties, particularly in the aftermath of the emergence of the Yemeni Reform Grouping as a major political force in the country. Out of a desire to ward off some of the consequences of this development, the GPC gave up some of its constitutional rights to safeguard and promote national unity. Consequently, it [words indistinct] with the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping in a national government coalition that epitomized the spirit of sharing the burdens of national responsibilities. It also agreed that the prime minister of this coalition government would be a YSP official, and the speaker of the parliament [words indistinct]. Moreover, the GPC gave up a third seat it was entitled to hold on the Presidential Council [words indistinct) to be agreed upon and approved by the House of Representatives. Once the agreements regarding these amendments were signed, the GPC, just like other national forces and organizations, as well as all local, Arab, and international quarters, were surprised by the return of YSP Secretary General brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid from [words indistinct] homeland to the city of Aden. By his action, he refrained from taking the constitutional oath as vice president. He made this move to avoid assuming his duties within the Presidential Council. Since then, he has been in a new seclusion, the aim of which is to preclude the endorsement of these agreements, obstruct the work of state institutions, and flagrantly undermine the results of the elections held on 27 April, not to mention other serious practices and transgressions that are jeopardizing and prejudicing the unity of the homeland. We should also recall the desperate and flagrant attempts being made by some renegade and separatist forces to misrepresent facts in order to cover up for their positions, which are diametrically opposed to the results of the general parliamentary elections. These forces are demonstrating indifference to and boastful disregard for the people's will, decisions, and unionist and democratic choices, which they made on two occasions: First when they headed for polling stations to vote in favor of the draft Constitution of unified Yemen, and then when they headed for polling stations to elect their representatives to their legislative branch of government. It is peculiar that some of these isolationist leaders have relished this crisis. They do not have any sense of shame, any conscientiousness, or any honorable [words indistinct] that could deter them from proceeding with their efforts to mislead the public, deceive citizens, and promote their false allegations, which aim to tarnish the image of the historic accomplishment made by our people on 27 April 1993. These forces also seek to obstruct the determined efforts of [words indistinct] our homeland to promote its unity and build its democratic political system of government, oblivious to the fact that these reckless attempts will always fail to undermine the people's awareness. Likewise, they will not make us budge a hairbreadth from our positions and democratic course, which we chose and adopted when the Republic of Yemen came into being on 22 May 1990. On the first anniversary of the general parliamentary elections, the GPC would like to extend its heartfelt congratulations to the masses of our Yemeni people, who forged the 27 April victory, in which the eternal [words indistinct] vindicated their democratic option, their will, and their strong and unswayable faith in the unity of the homeland. Similarly, the GPC would like to reiterate its firm commitment to respecting our people's constants with regard to unity and democracy. Likewise, it reiterates its adherence to its legitimate constitutional right to defend all the gains [words indistinct] of our masses. It announces once again its firm convictions that any solution to the current impasse in the country should not undermine any of the sacred historical national constants cherished by our people, chief among which are the following: Compliance with the Constitution of unified Yemen, the only text that enjoyed national consensus; the activation of the legitimate elected bodies, headed by the House of Representatives; the holding of meetings by the state's leading institutions so they may perform their duties; expediting the full implementation of the accord document; and ending once and for all military, political, and media repercussions of the crisis. The GPC would like to reiterate that these constants are the only tenets that can safeguard our people's unity, democratic option, and eternal revolution. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. [Signed] The GPC [Dated] 26 April 1994
