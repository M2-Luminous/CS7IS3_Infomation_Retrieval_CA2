The leading Japanese electronics manufacturer said it is the world's first microchip capable of processing moving images produced by video cameras. With current technology, a desk-size computer system would be needed for similar processing. NEC said potential applications of the chip include a computer- based multimedia terminal that would handle image and voice data, as in teleconferencing. The chip, 15.1 by 15.6 millimeters, comprises 10 million transistors, 64 processors for image processing and a two-million- bit memory device, NEC said. The processors, through parallel data processing, make it possible to perform 3.84 billion calculations per second, NEC said.
