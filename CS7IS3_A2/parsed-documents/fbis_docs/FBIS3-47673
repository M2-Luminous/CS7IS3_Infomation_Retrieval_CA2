The government has been studying the move as a means to help absorb excess shares in the market and boost sluggish share prices, they said. The surplus shares, issued during the "bubble economy" period in the late 1980s, have been blamed for keeping the stock prices depressed. According to the government's plans to revise the commercial code, companies hoping to buy back their own shares will be first required to change their articles of association with approval from more than two-thirds of their shareholders. So far, such a change has required approval from all the shareholders, a rule that has served as a major obstacle. Then they will have to put a buyback proposal to another vote that would require approval by more than half of the shareholders. The shares to be bought back will have to be purchased on the stock market with the companies' own funds. No borrowing will be allowed for that purpose. Up to 3 percent of the outstanding shares is the ceiling set for such purchases. In addition, the shares so bought cannot be sold to third parties and must to be sold to in-house shareholding organizations of employees within one year, the sources said.
