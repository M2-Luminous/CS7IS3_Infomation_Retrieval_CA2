"There is an enormous potential still waiting to be tapped in this area," Mr. Romulo said during a meeting with officials of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). He pointed out private sector representatives are best positioned to develop meaningful cooperation among themselves in order to pave the way for more significant economic ties between Manila and Rangoon. "Let me add that in my position, I will do my best to stimulate more trade and business contacts for the mutual benefits of our two countries," he said. Mr. Romulo told SLORC officials government is "encouraged by the moves taken by Myanmar to work closely with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and individual ASEAN (members), in the spirit of good neighborliness and friendship." He likewise assured the Burmese government of Manila's continued support for the one-Southeast Asia concept which will include the six ASEAN states of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand plus Myanmar and the three Indo-Chinese states of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. "You may be assured that in every forum, the Philippines has always supported the concept of one Southeast Asia which will no longer be divided by ideological boundaries of the Cold War, but working together towards greater cooperation for the common welfare of all the peoples of the Southeast Asian region," he said. He noted ASEAN at the moment is facing the "exciting challenge" of enhancing regional cooperation among its members and its dialogue partners. "In this effort, we more than welcome the valuable contributions that Myanmar can make in the interest of promoting regional peace, progress and harmony. Let us join hands and forge a more dynamic and progressive Southeast Asia," he said.
