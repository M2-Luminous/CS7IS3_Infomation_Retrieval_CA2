States are disappearing or are being created, and it leads in some cases, particularly in the Balkans, to a very dangerous situation. For the first time since 1945, we have a war in Europe. What does it mean to divide states along ethnic criteria, change borders by force, and create national states based on ethnic homogeneity? President Kucan, this is a question addressed straight to you. How did you live through that period of time in Yugoslavia? Three years ago did you have an inkling of the closeness between the desire for freedom and the possibility of war? [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] I think it was not difficult at that time to think of these two realities as being close to each other. Initially, it seemed the conflict was limited by Yugoslavia itself. It must be forcefully declared that what happened in Yugoslavia and what is now happening in the Balkans is a defeat of (?Roehmer's) principles. I am sure that the defeat in this specific case can become a lesson for the whole of Europe. Many mistakes were committed here and three of them are exceptionally important. The first is the misunderstanding and the unwillingness to understand that Yugoslavia had to disintegrate. It functioned only temporarily in the form of a multinational state. Yugoslavia could exist only while centralism existed. Disintegration was inevitable the moment this ceased. The second mistake was linked to the incorrect interpretation of this war, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as an internal war between ethnic groups, because this does not correspond to the basis of this war. The third mistake, connected with the first one, is that there was never a real interest in looking into the real essence of instability in the Balkans -- and in consequence -- of instability in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] It is necessary to seek the reason for this instability. The reason lies in Serbia's very complicated ethnic and especially national problem. I suppose the Serbs wish to resolve the national question which is, of course, as legitimate as in the case of other nations. However, there is a question mark over the forms and methods used to solve this question. From the point of view of the Paris (?meeting) and [word indistinct] principles this method of ethnic cleansing and of forceful border changing is in effect a genocidal matter. This is all absolutely inhuman. Everything which is done to solve a problem in isolation, in isolation from the basic internal problem of the Balkan region -- by which I mean resolving the ethnic questions -- creates an acute danger of war. An attempt must be made to stabilize the Balkan region on a more permanent basis. [passage omitted on past conflicts] I think that what is happening now, as a result of direct pressure from Washington and Moscow, is the most important way towards a halt to the war. This is enormously important, but there is something even more important here, and that is the talks with the right partners, which means talks with Belgrade, Sarajevo, and Zagreb. This would represent a recognition of the real nature of this war. Two years ago, when the war started, it was possible to delineate the framework of this war. [passage indistinct] Then, of course, Croatia was not involved in this war in Bosnia in the way it is today. If the diagnosis was made correctly at that time, the price would not have been so high, there would not have been 100,000 people dead, 600,000 people expelled, and a huge number of people wounded, incapacitated, and damaged by other means. This all could happen, but now a real solution of the Balkan crisis is at stake. [passage omitted on Klestil discussing unacceptability of ethnic cleansing and suggesting that agreement between the West and Russia might lead to pressure on Belgrade] [Rupnik] Russia is not returning only to the Balkans, but also to the near abroad [blizke zahranici]. How do you assess this development in Russian policy and what does it mean for Central Europe? President Walesa? [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech] Of course after the period of division into two poles, Russia and Europe are seeking solutions by means of evolution. The time is coming when we should define certain principles and points where our minds meet. If we do not do this, then Yugoslavia must be considered as a challenge and as a warning. Let us imagine the countries of the post-Soviet Union. And there [words indistinct] for example, in Latvia, 40 percent support Russia's Boris Yeltsin. If something similar happened elsewhere, then we would be confronted with a total catastrophe. So, it is necessary to mark the danger [bodovat], it is necessary to discuss interests and (?human) categories. If we fail to reach such agreements as have been reached in Central Europe and Europe overall, if we fail to submit these problems jointly and of course assess them, then of course it will be an incentive for Russia to settle things in the old way. We need here the democratic principles recognized by Europe. And in this sense, we have to help Russia in this direction. However, the Russia that puts forth conditions, wanting to be a partner, but not a real partner; the meaning of which they do not understand.... [pauses] If one is a partner, the same principles and conditions should apply and not [word indistinct], not a policeman or something undefined. This all has to be discussed jointly and certain values have to be defended jointly. Then we will avoid the Yugoslav example and [word indistinct] with part of Russia. This will be the right thing for Russia and a blessing for us all. If we fail to do it, certain groups in Russia will take advantage of the indecision in parts of Europe. [Rupnik] Mr. President, do you think the Partnership for Peace program is the right solution for the security of Central Europe and, among other things, its relationship with Russia? [Havel] I think Russia is and always will be, or will be for rather a long time, a great Eurasian superpower, a superpower which even possesses nuclear weapons. I cannot imagine peace in Europe, or in the world, without some kind of relationship based on partnership between the West and Russia. Perhaps the Partnership for Peace program can serve as a starting point for creating that kind of partnership. There is, however, a difference between this and the position of our states which feel they belong to the West and, because they are small, they need certain security guarantees and ties. We understand Partnership for Peace both as an opportunity and as the beginning of the path towards NATO membership. We cannot be merely NATO's partners, we want, indeed we must, be a part of it. We are in a completely different position from Russia. I think that some of the ideas now emerging in Russian politics should be really sharply criticized and denounced. I mean ideas to the effect that, somehow, just because Russia is such a big state, it kind of owns us and automatically enjoys the right to advise us, its closer or more distant neighbors, and tell us whom we are or are not allowed to join. This must be rejected quite unequivocally. Our countries are particularly sensitive to this sort of thing and, simply, we want to be a part of something we feel we belong to in the first place. This does not mean that we are against anybody or that we do not wish to have a good relationship with Russia. On the contrary, let me reiterate that good relations between the West and Russia are the necessary prerequisites for virtually everything else, for any European integration processes. Don't you think that Russia ought not claim superpower status on the one hand, while at the same time enjoying the same rights as the small Central European countries? Russia really cannot keep saying -- Why can you be NATO members but we cannot? Well, this is quite absurd, isn't it? [passage omitted on von Weizsaecker on the European Union's political and security dimension, Partnership for Peace] [Rupnik] President Kucan. [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] I think that what we heard from President Havel was very important. The point is that we want more than just a partnership. I believe it must be recognized that where we live in the world must be taken into account. We want more than just a partnership -- namely NATO membership and participation in the system of collective security in Europe. From this point of view, it is very important that the Partnership for Peace program is not concerned with security alone. All participating states are obliged to attain a high level of democracy and this gives rise to the question -- How do we tackle the issues of the political neutrality of the army, the transparency of the armed forces' numbers, and the question of the joint functioning of the army and society in the sense that there is adequate control over the armed forces. It is indeed necessary to ensure complete control over the armed forces. The danger, the possibility, that certain armed forces or certain countries can be drawn into solving issues concerning all citizens still exists. At the time of gaining its independence, Slovenia, too, went through a complicated stage. It was necessary to wage a war, albeit a short one, and now a rather complicated situation has come into being. With all respect for the army, it is necessary to establish adequate control over it so democracy can fully develop and it is absolutely clear that we respect all the values of all citizens, including the issue of the armed forces. [Rupnik] President Goncz, if you please. President Kovac to follow. [Goncz, in Hungarian with simultaneous translation into Czech] I absolutely agree with Presidents Havel and Kucan. The Partnership for Peace program alone is not enough. It is a certain step towards peace, it is an important step which makes open cooperation, even military, possible. But we perceive the issue of peace and partnership in a different way. Apart from the military sphere, there is also the sphere of human rights and environment as mentioned by President Walesa a while ago. There is also the issue of nuclear power stations. I would also like to bring up the issue of security in terms of the society. Our country is wrestling with difficult economic problems. Headway should be made on the path of modernization and if this headway is not made, then we cannot guarantee the security of society. To this end it is necessary to understand the Partnership in a broader context of European politics. We shall be unable to develop our own markets until markets are opened to us. On the contrary, our markets will contract and while they are contracting, we ourselves will not represent a good market either. We want market for market. Europe is economically intertwined. So far, Europe has been an impenetrable market for us. [Kovac, in Slovak] I think the issue of Central European security involves two important processes. These processes should run concurrently. One of them has already begun and was generated by our interest in NATO membership and by our joining the Partnership for Peace program. But what is of equal importance is that NATO, Western Europe, and the United States of America should cooperate as closely as possible with Russia. We realize that overrating some of these processes and underrating others might not necessarily result in a feeling of security in Central European countries. It might possibly yield potential hotbeds for a certain destabilization of the situation in Europe. From this point of view we realize that nowadays, to consolidate democracy in Russia, it is very important to help Russia tackle her economic problems. The other thing I have in mind is closely linked to this issue, and that is Ukraine should be helped to preserve its sovereignty. All these factors are very important, because apart from our gradual rapprochement to NATO, they could give us -- the countries stuck in the middle of this region -- a fuller and more lasting feeling of security. [Rupnik] Thank you. President Klestil. [Klestil, in German with simultaneous translation into Czech] It is difficult to answer questions to which we do not have specific answers. In 1996, the European Union [EU] is supposed to discuss the future of common security and foreign policy. On the other hand, we are seeing developments in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and we do not know in what direction they are going to continue. Therefore, it is important to take small steps in the West, but we must think about Russia and Ukraine being nuclear powers and we must involve them in the process of all European security considerations. If we talk about security, about the danger people fear, then it concerns nuclear power stations. We should set ourselves a long-term aim of creating a nuclear free zone in Central Europe. As it is impossible to attain this aim from one day to the next, it would be necessary to make a list of security measures, measures to deepen trust. They should be similar to those on which we agreed yesterday with President Havel regarding the Czech Republic and Austria; for example, on opening nuclear power stations for inspections, introducing a telephone hotline, early warning systems. All this would, in my opinion, help to reduce public fear of danger. [Rupnik] The fall of communism presented a challenge to Europe as a whole. Some of you have already mentioned security integration, or in other words NATO and Partnership for Peace. Integration into the EU is also linked to it. How do you see this process? Can European integration be enlarged eastward, or is there not a danger that the disintegration processes from the East might spread westward? After all, this is a game for time. How do you see current prospects of economic integration? Does the EU meet your expectations? [passage omitted on Walesa comparing European integration to the movement of a car; Weizsaecker comparing integration of former East Germany into West Germany with integration of Central Europe into Western Europe; Klestil on the need to show solidarity and patience with post-communist countries] [Rupnik] President Kovac, if you please. [Kovac, in Slovak] When expressing our desire to become integrated into Europe, we realize this should not be an integration that would weaken existing European structures and the objective of every integration should be to consolidate these structures. In this respect, I think that as far as integration into the EU is concerned, the EU has been taking positive and accommodating steps. [passage omitted] But from this point of view, it seems to me that the issue of incorporating into the EU -- in particular into its economic part -- is one thing, while incorporating Central European countries into the political and security structures is yet another. At the same time, the process of economic incorporation is a more difficult and more long-term affair. Most of us realize that it is not a question of two or three years. But during the in-between period, we do not wish to be in some kind of vacuum regarding the precise definition of our incorporation. That is why I think certain measures should be reassessed in this respect. Naturally, the Partnership for Peace amounts to a certain testing of our abilities. However, as long as we do not possess straightforward criteria and positions on this issue, we will still have a very strong feeling of being in danger. That is not good, I think, because this process could, in effect, bring certain disillusionment among our citizens. At the same time, we know the citizens of Central European countries are displaying an almost spontaneous will to be incorporated into both political and security structures. [passage omitted] [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech] I think we should try to answer another question: Whether the integration should be continuous or whether it should be an integration in leaps. It has become clear that at present continuous integration is probably more suitable. [passage omitted] I think we have to consider continuous integration with its strategic points outlined. This will be wise and it will provide an option of future development for all of us. [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] I perceive the question, our dilemma, as a question of whether every extension of EU membership -- and that is something necessary -- is strengthening its internal qualities. The fact is that until the Maastricht Treaty, this was a difficult process and now it will be even more difficult. However, despite everything, this is the only way to progress. [passage omitted] To halt the integration would in practice put an end to the existence of the West. However, it is necessary to respect the fact that Europe is still divided, to a certain degree. [passage omitted]
