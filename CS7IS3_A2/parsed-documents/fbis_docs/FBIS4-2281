FBIS4-2281 "drchi068_h_94005" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 West Europe Spokesman Cites Li Peng Remarks Spokesman Cites Li Peng Remarks HK0704140294 Hong Kong AFP in English 1346 GMT 7 April 94 HK0704140294 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [By Tiffany Bown] [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur gave assurances Thursday [7 April] his government would not "interfere" in China's internal affairs, including the human rights issue, a Chinese official said. "France has no intention to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and France is willing to discuss the issues with other countries on an equal footing," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Balladur as telling Premier Li Peng Thursday. Wu said the comment came as the two leaders discussed the issue of human rights during talks between their delegations. "It is obvious that China and France have different views on the human rights issue. We also noted that the French side will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said Wu. The spokesman said Balladur, on the first official visit here by a French premier in 16 years, did not bring up the arrest last week of China's leading dissident Wei Jingsheng. Balladur spokesman Bernard Brigouleix said later that during the meeting the French prime minister had recalled that France "has a traditional interest in human rights everywhere in the world." Brigouleix also said Li had agreed to Balladur's suggestion of a private meeting, together with their foreign ministers, after the working-level talks to discuss human rights including the issue of Tibet, but gave no details. The two premiers also discussed the development of bilateral ties following the January normalisation of relations, which turned frosty in 1992 over the previous French administration's sale of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to China's rival Taiwan. That contract, worth several billion dollars, resulted in the closure of the French consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou in January 1993 and the exclusion of French companies from bidding for lucrative Chinese contracts. The Chinese have agreed to reopen the consulate, Brigouleix said, although no firm date has yet been set. Wu did not confirm the reopening, but quoted Li as expressing China's "appreciation" for the "great efforts" of Balladur's administration to improve ties. On the economic front, the Chinese premier said French companies had "their advantages" in the fields of transport, energy and telecommunications, all of which were priority development areas. But he added that they must do more if they wish to compete in the "fierce" Chinese market. "French enterprises are quite competitive in certain areas, but also lack competitiveness in comparison with other countries," Wu quoted Li as saying. The spokesman announced that French Minister of Industry, External Trade and Telecommunications Gerard Longuet would soon lead a business delegation to China. Wu also said Beijing would give "positive consideration" to requests from Paris for China to buy French wheat. The two premiers also discussed the North Korean nuclear crisis, with Balladur calling for China to exert its influence over its Stalinist ally to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection. Li responded by reiterating Beijing's stand that "China has only a limited role to play" and urging a resolution through dialogue between the parties directly involved. The foreign ministry spokesman described the atmosphere of the talks as "very good," saying the two premiers had pledged to keep up the momentum of high-level exchanges. However, Wu was unable to announce that Balladur had extended an invitation to Li for a reciprocal visit -- in a conspicuous departure from usual protocol. Balladur, whose four-day visit coincides with the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties between France and China, is accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Longuet. He is to meet Friday with President Jiang Zemin, before leaving for Shanghai Saturday.
