The assertion of the business quarter appears, at first sight, to have propriety in logic. First, in the event that the labor- intensive light industry of South Korea, whose competitive power is falling behind with each passing day, is moved to the North or subcontracts with the North Korean side, production costs would be drastically reduced. In other words, as North Korea has cheap, good-quality, well-trained labor power in abundance, it would offer an excellent opportunity to revitalize our light industry. In addition, since the price of land in North Korea is not burdensome, one's investment of capital in North Korea would undoubtedly be successful. Besides, some businessmen in the South believe that when they expand their enterprises by properly managing their business in North Korea, their influence and pressure would certainly help the North Korean regime turn to the moderate line from the hardline. The theory put forward by the academic circle pertaining to the separation of economic cooperation from the nuclear issue appears to be emphasizing only the idealistic point of view. In other words, since North Korea is suffering a serious food shortage, we should seek improved relations with the North by starting an agricultural exchange first, thus separating it from complex political and security issues. This theory stresses that we should also enable the Korea Agricultural Corporation and other various farmers' organizations to come forward for agricultural cooperation with the North. Another pretext put forward by the academic circle for promoting economic cooperation is the urgency in the long- and short-range economic development plans of North Korea. According to a recent report, research organizations and advisory organs in the United States and Japan, not our country, received requests from the North Korean Government for working out long- and short-range plans for national land development and economic development in North Korea. If this report is true, unique, independent plans, which are not linked with the South Korean economic structure and land utilization situation, would be adopted. As a result, even after our nation is reunified, economic division would persist, thus hindering the nation from becoming one country in actuality. This would cause the people's concern. Therefore, the assertion stresses, economic exchange with North Korea should be realized even before the nuclear problem is resolved. All these allegations sound reasonable at first glance. However, if we evaluate them in a cool-headed manner, we will come to realize that these are indeed dangerous and immature. There is no change, first of all, in the Kim Il-song dictatorship whatsoever, and North Korea is overflowing with the so-called chuche idea, stressing that "Korea is one and it is under the benevolence of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il." Even if our business firms and organizations propose economic cooperation, it would not be accepted so easily as we expect. This would be possible only through the benevolence of Kim Il-song and his son. Thus, our proposal would be reduced to merely a "begging." The North Korean regime is attempting to use the humanitarian standpoint heightened in our side as a weak point. The North Korean regime, in an emergency, would apply various restrictions to our business firms that advanced to North Korea, and would threaten with such disadvantageous restrictions in a bid to use them as a negotiation card. What is important is, above all, for our government, while maintaining a cooperative system with world nations, to urge the North Korean regime to make a change in its policies. However, North Korea will not make such change voluntarily. The change would be possible only when North Korea hangs out a white flag toward the whole world or when internal confusion occurs within its system. Therefore, the act of hastening economic cooperation with North Korea will only reduce the probability of its change, and will not be helpful in achieving reunification.
