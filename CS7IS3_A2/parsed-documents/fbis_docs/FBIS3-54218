As in the previous statements, the majority of the Security Council could not justify the continuation of the blockade. This time, however, the ambassadors of some member states of the Security Council expressed strong protests. The Chinese ambassador called strongly for the lifting the blockade, while the ambassadors of Spain, Brazil, and Nigeria reiterated this stand. The French ambassador, as well as the British ambassador, noted the positive stands adopted by Iraq. Despite this, the Security Council issued a statement, without introducing any amendments, because of the U.S. ambassador's insistence on this. The U.S. ambassador expressed her government's concern over the security of Iraq's neighbors. We, in Iraq, realize that the blockade no longer has any justification, and our friends realize this, as well. Now, the camp of the enemies has begun to collapse and some of its members have become aware of the dangerous political game played by the managers of U.S. interests and their agents in the region, who are besieging Iraq at the expense of their people and at the expense of the interests of other nations and countries. We also are aware that the Americans want us to guarantee the security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait governorate and Saudi Arabia. They want us to relinquish the rights of our people and nation in Palestine, imagining that the wisdom and necessity of implementing the Security Council resolutions -- despite their injustice -- will make Iraq accept whatever it is asked for. The Iraqis will not say more than what leader Saddam Husayn said on the third anniversary of the aggression: They will not turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and despair. The Iraqis will not remain silent at the continuation of the blockade and the violation of Iraqi airspace. We will never abandon our people in northern Iraq. If we become certain -- despite our patience and the good offices exerted by our friends to end the abnormal situation resulting from the blockade and the violations of Iraqi sovereignty in the north and south -- we are capable of bringing the game back to the beginning. [sentence as published] We are the original people in this region and we are the ones who own everything on our land. We will not allow the agents, lowly people, or coveters to encroach on what we own, on our rights, and on our dignity. As the leader said, the punishment of the criminals will be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. The Arabs say: "Beware of the patient man's rage."
