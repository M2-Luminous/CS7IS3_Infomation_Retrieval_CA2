FR940413-2-00163 FR940413-2-00072 NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A(b)(3)(C) 3 of the Act because it increases the opportunity for NSCC's participants to be involved in the administration of NSCC's affairs. 3 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact or impose a burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others No written comments have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Section 17A(b)(3)(C) 4 states that the rules of a clearing agency must assure a fair representation of its shareholders (or members) and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. The Commission believes that the proposed increase in the number of directors on the board is consistent with NSCC's obligations under section 17A because the result will be a board which reflects, to a greater degree, NSCC's participants. As a result, participants will be afforded additional opportunities to raise, discuss, and help resolve issues that effect them. 4 Id. NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change because it will give NSCC the opportunity to have the additional participant member elected and possibly participate in the next board meeting, which is scheduled for April 1994. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;03 and should be submitted by May 4, 1994. It Is Therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 5 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;03) be, and hereby is approved. 5 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 6 6 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
