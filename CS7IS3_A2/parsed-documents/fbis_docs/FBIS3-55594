The document makes changes to the procedure for electing farm leaders. From now on, collective farmers are deprived of the right to independently nominate candidates for election to collective farm chairmen at general meetings. This can only be done by the district head of administration. Without his permission, the members of the farm also have no right to remove the chairman from his post. According to INTERFAX, over the last two years the number of collective farms in Uzbekistan has doubled.
