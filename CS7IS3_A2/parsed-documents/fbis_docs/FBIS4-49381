At the same time, Major General Anatoliy Varliya [3907 6849 7161], a former deputy chief of the Bureau of Treaty and Law under the Russian Defense Ministry, revealed to Pinhov that in the rear areas along the border, the mainland's military strength is six times greater than Russia's military strength in the Far East, and the mainland also has three times more the fighter planes there, but there is no sign of major movement so far. Pinhov said to this newspaper that Rozykov confirmed for the first time that within 100 km of the 4,000-km border in the east, the Russian side has deployed 150,000 troops, which include border defense forces that are not regular Russian military units, and that the mainland has only 50,000 armed personnel, made up primarily of the Armed Police, local militia, and some regular military units. However, in the rear areas, to a depth of about 300-400 km, the mainland side has concentrated a large number of troops. Rozykov said that since 1990, the mainland has kept refusing the disarmament plans for cutting "military groups at the military region level," as proposed first by the Soviet Union and then by Russia, as well as the suggested "disarmament within 25 km of the border." Even now, there are still technical difficulties during the disarmament negotiations, such as the way to distinguish regular units from other kinds of armed forces. He personally thought that as a compromise plan, both sides might cut 20-30 percent of the armed personnel currently deployed within 100 km of the border. Varliya pointed out that the disarmament within 100 km of the border will not include the Russian garrisons in Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. According to him, what is important is that both sides have built up mutual trust, and do not view each other as enemies, while the direct links between the military regions of the two countries also have been strengthened as a result, whereas the first batch of Chinese military observers entered Russia last year.
