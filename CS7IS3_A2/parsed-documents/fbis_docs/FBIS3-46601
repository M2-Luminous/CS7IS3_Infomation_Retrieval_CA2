"The launch of an Islamic interbank money market and cheque-clearing system completes the setting up of the world's first full-fledged Islamic financial system in Malaysia," said Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser to the central bank, Bank Negara. Predominantly Moslem Malaysia, he said, was also the only country to have a Moslem financial system that ran parallel to the conventional banking system practised by the West. Many bankers, however, see the Moslem system as a sham to hide interest payments or "wiba" which are forbidden under Islamic law. Nor said the launch capped a year of planning by the central bank to work out the financial instruments. "The Islamic interbank money market operates on the basis of Al- Mudharabah or profit-sharing, which simply means that the provider of funds will earn a profit from his investments instead of being paid interest," he said. Bankers also began Monday to trade in short-term bankers' acceptances on a profit-sharing basis. The profit earned from the money lent would be shared between the provider and borrower on a ratio that could range from 70:30, 80:20 or 90:10 depending on the loan-period, he said. "The profit-sharing ratios will be liberalised by the central bank in due course when everybody is comfortable with the new system to allow the ratios to be negotiated between the investing and receiving institutions," he said. The other countries which have an Islamic banking system are Pakistan, Iran and Sudan, but they do not have the conventional banking system and an Islamic interbank money market facility. Indonesia, which has an Islamic banking system running alongside the conventional banking practices, also does not have an interbank money market facility, Nor said. Bankers say the Malaysian development is a significant move that should be emulated by other Moslem countries to stem the large outflow of funds from Islamic countries to non-Islamic banks in the West. "It is an irony that some Islamic countries are borrowing substantially from non-Islamic institutions in the West, while other Islamic countries are depositing funds with them," said central bank governor Jaffar Hussein. "The western non-Islamic banks are just recyling funds belonging to the Moslems to other Moslems and making a big and hefty profit in the process," Jaffar said recently. Islamic banking in Malaysia was pioneered by the country's sole Islamic bank, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, which was set up in 1983. Since then 20 other financial institutions in the country have adopted the Islam-sanctioned banking facilities alongside conventional banking. Bankers see the difference between the Moslem banking practice and the conventional banking system as "pure cosmetic." "Under Islamic banking, the bank lends you money, but in a slightly different way," said Bank Islam's managing director Halim Ismail. "Take the common housing loan. The bank will buy the house on your behalf and then sells the house to you at a price which includes the cost and a margin of profit, but still allows you to make deferred payments." "That extra amount that you pay will be more or less equal to the extra amount that you will pay when borrowing from commercial banks," Halim said.
