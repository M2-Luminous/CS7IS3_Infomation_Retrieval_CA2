FBIS4-7923 "dreeu068__a94010" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria WEU Official Meets With Defense Minister WEU Official Meets With Defense Minister AU0704082394 Sofia BTA in English 1515 GMT 6 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704082394 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- At the meeting of the foreign and defence ministers of the member states of the Western European Union [WEU] in May, Bulgaria will probably be invited to ratify its "enhanced status" of a WEU associate member, Sir Dudley Smith, president of the WEU Assembly, told Bulgarian Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov today. The WEU delegation arrived on a visit here on Monday at the invitation of the Bulgarian National Assembly. Right from the beginning of its association, Bulgaria could get a place on the WEU's Operational Planning Group and, later on, in the so-called Western European Armaments Group. Bulgaria's inclusion in the WEU Armaments Group will relieve the dire straits in which the Bulgarian Army has been plunged by the economic crisis, Sir Dudley believes. According to Mr. Aleksandrov, Bulgaria's military-technological and technical dependence on the former USSR makes the military and military-technological need of the country's inclusion into the WEU structures all the more pressing. In the near future, contacts with the WEU must advance from their get-acquainted stage to cooperation in substance, Mr. Aleksandrov stressed at the meeting. Membership in the WEU for Bulgaria is comparable to membership in NATO, Sir Dudley told Bulgarian MP's yesterday. What matters more than signing an association document, however, is to take practical action for the country's actual integration into the Euro- structures, he told Mr. Aleksandrov today. Such action is all the more needed in view of the current situation in Europe and, specifically, in the former Yugoslavia, according to the president of the WEU Assembly. In Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] there is a risk of a repeat of the Bosnian events, he noted yesterday at the meeting with the Bulgarian parliamentarians. According to the WEU, Bulgaria is a leading power in the eastern part of the Balkans, Sir Dudley pointed out. The WEU countries are members of an organization intended to guarantee peace and security, he recalled. Later in the day, the delegation visited Ruse (on the Danube), where they met with the WEU German and Spanish teams monitoring the observance of the Yugo-embargo on the Bulgarian sector of the river. Sir Dudley told a news conference that he was pleased with the close cooperation of the Ruse executive authorities with the European officials and of the understanding showed by the public. He confirmed that he is aware of the difficulties which Bulgaria and Ruse in particular are experiencing as a result of the observance of the sanctions and could not promise but would try to help make arrangements for compensations. The only problem which he found was the bad communications between the WEU teams in Calafat, Romania, and Ruse.
