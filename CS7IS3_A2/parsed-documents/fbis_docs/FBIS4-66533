FBIS4-66533 "jpnea020___94041" JPRS-NEA-94-020 JPRS Near East & South Asia 13 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA French Senate Delegation Meets Press French Senate Delegation Meets Press 94AS0229E Madras THE HINDU in English 13 Feb 94 p 1 94AS0229E Madras THE HINDU English CSO [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 12--The visiting French Senate delegation says it is "convinced that dialogue (between India and Pakistan on Kashmir) is necessary and the exclusive (only) way to approach a solution." This was stated by the delegation's leader, Mr. Xavier de Villepin, at a press conference here soon after the team had a meeting with the Prime Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, here on Friday. The influential French Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and the Armed Forces is to report its observations on the Indian position with respect to Kashmir, human rights and terrorism, besides non-proliferation and security-related issues, to the French Government. Mr. de Villepin said he delivered a letter to Mr. Rao from the French Prime Minister, Mr. Edouard Balladur, in which the French leader had suggested "across-the-border" intensified cooperation with India in the political, economic and cultural fields. In response to questions, Mr. de Villepin said "We also have respect for India's policy on Kashmir. We have no reason to criticise the position. We will objectively report what we have seen here. In France we are very concerned with human rights, but we are against terrorism in the world. France has also suffered on account of terrorism." Answering another question, Mr. de Villepin said, "After being briefed by the Prime Minister we understand the situation much better than before and appreciate the risks and dangers involved, should the dialogue process suffer." At their "cordial" meeting, the Prime Minister, reportedly stressed the overriding value of continuing dialogue with Pakistan in dealing with all contentions bilateral issues, including Kashmir. No development should be permitted to intervene that could hurt the nascent process of dialogue that commenced only last month, he said. In the context of the publicised Pakistani intention to bring forward an anti-India resolution on Kashmir at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) in Geneva. In this context it is noteworthy that the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, told his Pakistani counterpart, Mr. Asif Ali, who was in Paris on a private visit about a week ago to canvass support for his country's proposed resolution on Kashmir, that any resolution would be worth considering and supporting if it furthered the prospects of ongoing dialogue. When the resolution comes up for voting, members of the European Union (EU) are expected to take a common position, rather than individual country stances. The French view attains significance in this overall framework. EU sources here also suggest that member countries have not been impressed by a Pakistani note accompanying a copy of its proposed resolution being circulated among the 53 members of the UNCHR. The note is remarkable for suggesting that India is impervious to the human rights situation in the Kashmir Valley. "This does not ring true," sources observed. Delegation sources later said they did not appreciate the idea of the kind of resolution Pakistan was proposing at a time such as this as it could distract from ongoing discussions to solve a very intricate problem. "Just look at the Middle East. It is a great lesson. Where would we all be if the dialogue between the contending parties had broken down?" a Senate Committee source observed. Mr. de Villepin said cooperation between France and India could cover a wide field including defence, high-tech areas such as satellites, telecom and electronics, and agro-business and vaccine development, covering commercial arrangements in both public and private sectors.
