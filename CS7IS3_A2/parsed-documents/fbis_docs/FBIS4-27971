"The Philippines believes that the security of the region is based on the principles affirming the right of every state to an existence free of external interference and to determine its own future," DFA spokesperson Susan Castrense said. During the peace talks, the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge agreed to form a standing committee to begin meeting this 15 June so that issues dividing the two sides in Cambodia's civil war could be dealt with. Foreign affairs officials pointed out the Philippines has played an active role in seeking a "comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political settlement" of the issue on Cambodia through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It will be recalled that Manila dispatched 702 security personnel to Cambodia as part of its contribution to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia after the UN-sponsored Paris Agreement was signed in December 1991. On the level of ASEAN, the Philippines participated in the Asia-Japan Tripartite Cooperation in Cambodia in response to an invitation made by the Japanese Government. Manila also contributed $100,000 to the UN Trust Fund for the Cambodian peace process in response to an appeal made by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The Philippines recognized Kampuchea in April 1976 as the legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people.
