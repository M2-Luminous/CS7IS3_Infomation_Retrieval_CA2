FR940720-0-00046 FR940720-0-00002 The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;15&hyph;01␣General Electric Aircraft Engines: Amendment 39&hyph;8972. Docket 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;07. Applicability: General Electric Aircraft Engines (GE) Models CT7&hyph;5A2, &hyph;5A3, &hyph;7A, &hyph;7A1, &hyph;9B, &hyph;9B1, &hyph;9B2, &hyph;9C, &hyph;9D turboprop engines, with propeller gearboxes listed by serial number in GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994. These engines are installed on but not limited to Construcciones Aeronauticas, SA (CASA) CN&hyph;235 series and SAAB-SCANIA SF340 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: (a) Perform a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft flange outer diameter (OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore for subsurface metallurgical defects, and replace, if necessary, with a serviceable part, at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or prior to October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. Perform the ultrasonic inspection, and replacement, if necessary, in accordance with GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994, on propeller shafts listed by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) in Table 2 of that SB. (b) Perform a one-time borescope inspection to identify all markings on the propeller shaft at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or prior to October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. Perform the borescope inspection in accordance with GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994, on propeller shafts listed by propeller gearbox S/N in Table 3 of that SB, and before further flight, proceed as follows: (1) For those propeller shafts that are determined to be suspect, perform a one-time ultrasonic inspection, and replace, if necessary with serviceable parts, in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350, Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994. (2) For those propeller shafts that are determined not to be suspect, no further action is required. (c) For the purpose of this AD, a shop visit is defined as the induction of the engine into the shop for maintenance, or separation of the propeller for maintenance. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (f) The inspections, and replacement, if necessary, shall be done in accordance with the following service document: ␣ 1Document No. 1Pages 1Revision 1Date GE (CT7&hyph;TP Series) SB No. A72&hyph;350 1&hyph;40 3 June 9, 1994.
