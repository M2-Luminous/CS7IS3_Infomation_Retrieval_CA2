This is how (party secretary) Ottaviano Del Turco closed the "PSI General Assembly." Reiterating "the clean and final break with the party's old leadership," Del Turco said that the PSI's place is in the new progressive alliance (dominated by Democratic Party of the Left, PDS). PDS secretary Achille Occhetto arrived unexpectedly in the conference hall. The choices made by the PSI will be ratified at the party conference to be held on 1 May.
