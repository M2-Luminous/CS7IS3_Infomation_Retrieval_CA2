They were speaking at tonight's launch of the international mediation initiative, an exercise which is being brokered by the Consultative Business Movement. Conrad Burke has the story: [Begin recording] [Burke] They gathered tonight, seven international mediators and representatives of South Africa's three major political parties. The task over the next 10 days: to break the constitutional deadlock between the IFP and the ANC, something that has eluded South African negotiators. IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC representative Jacob Zuma sounded positive notes. [Buthelezi] I call for a new spirit to descend upon us, to inspire our actions and the actions of the mediators. You must find a just and fair constitutional compromise under a constitution which is a constitution for all freedom-aspiring South Africans. [Zuma] We believe there will be a solution, because we believe that all parties, with all the difficulties, are keen to reach a settlement in this country. [Burke] Foreign Minister Pik Botha offered government assistance. They'll probably be asked to pick up the tab. But the government is not yet directly involved in the mediation exercise. It wants the terms of reference to be clarified first. Leading the mediators, Dr. Henry Kissinger said what was happening in South Africa was important for all mankindd. [Kissenger] We in turn will make every effort to bridge the remaining distances, because we are all in sight of a tremendous achievement of the human spirit. [Burke] The mediation team includes Lord Peter Carrington and five leading international experts. They'll be meeting at a closed venue near Johannesburg. [end recording] Solutions reached during mediation had to be translated as amendments to the interim constitution to enable the IFP to take part in the elections. Reiterating his commitment to democracy, Mr Buthelezi said he hoped that in this way the IFP would be allowed a stake in the constitution "so we can also see it as our own". Mr Zuma said the ANC trusted the integrity of the mediators. "Nobody will think there's anything up the sleeve. We will all take your views honestly." Mr Botha said the presence of the seven mediators, all of them eminent in their own right, showed the first world had not forgotten South Africa and wanted it to succeed. Indian Chief Justice Mr Justice P N Bhagawathi told SAPA after the conference the mediators had not yet received their terms of reference. In a statement on Monday, the Consultative Business Movement, which is co-ordinating the mediation, said all outstanding matters regarding international mediation had been successfully resolved at an IFP/ANC joint working group meeting on April 10. Some analyists, notably Anthea Jeffrey of the South African Institute of Race Relations, have said that before the mediation gets to "outstanding constitutional matters" it will first have to address the deadlock between the two parties on the election date. The ANC has said the April 27 deadline is "sacrosanct"; the IFP has said constitutional compromises mean little if it has no time to prepare itself for an election focused on the compromises. Asked about this issue at the conference on Tuesday night, Mr Buthelezi told SAPA he was not totally [word indistinct] with the terms of reference. "But in my opinion it (postponement of the elections) is absolutely vital if we are going to get an all-inclusive solution." When asked about the same issue, Mr Zuma offered no reply. Information about where the mediation will take place is being carefully guarded. The mediation team is: Mr Justice P N Bhagwati, India; Lord Peter Carrington, United Kingdom; Mr Justice A Leon Higginbotham, United States of America; Prof Paul Kevenhorster, Germany; Dr Henry Kissinger, U.S.; Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola, Italy; and Prof Jean Antonie Laponce, Canada.
