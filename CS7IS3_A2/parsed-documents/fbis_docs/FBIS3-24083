According to Vladimir Yeremenko, the representative of the Russian Party and three other St. Petersburg residents detained together with him have not yet been charged; nevertheless, after the detention period (three days) expired, the procuracy found it necessary to formally place Bondarik under arrest. "We have all the grounds to bring a murder charge against him within 10 days," said the city procurator. Nikolay Bondarik and his three comrades are suspected of murdering one of the Russian Party members, Tsikharev, whose body was found in the Karpovka River in May of last year.
