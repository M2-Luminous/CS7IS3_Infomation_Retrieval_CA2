[Unidentified correspondent] The five-day exercise was held under the supervision of the commander in chief, Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk. The main events took place on maps at the Defense Ministry's training headquarters. This first conceptual training involved all of Ukraine's ministries and state departments. Understandably, the main organizational measures on territorial defense are taken by security organizations. Operational groups of the Defense Ministry, the State Committee for Protection of State Borders, the Security Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Guard, and the Civil Defense went over the entire package of issues related to defense of our state's territory. At today's session, Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, commander of the Strategic Missile Forces, was promoted to colonel general. Also today, after summing up the results of the strategic command staff exercise, the commander in chief, President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, approved the country's territorial defense plan. [Begin Kravchuk recording] We proceed from the premise that Ukraine is a peaceful state and will pursue a peaceful policy, a policy of friendship, cooperation, trust, and fulfillment of all international commitments. Therefore, we conclude that we cannot have enemies, since we do not threaten anybody, do not have any territorial claims against anybody, and pursue a peaceful policy, overcoming all obstacles on the way toward nonnuclear status. This is the concept. But life itself is much more complicated and manifold than a concept. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that somebody could develop an urge to test their power on our state and our people, and we must prepare to defend our state and our people, which is envisioned in our concept. The strategic task we set before ourselves today is the defense of Ukraine, and the readiness of both the armed forces and others for this sacred task of state defense. [end recording]
