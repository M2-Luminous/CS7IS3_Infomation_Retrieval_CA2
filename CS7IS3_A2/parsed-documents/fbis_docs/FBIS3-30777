In the pages of the weeklies ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA, the defense minister together with other officers of the Romanian Army, are described and called names in the most aberrant possible manner. The PRM senator's saraband of curses and slander has a very banal cause: Every available means must be taken to promote his brother, that is, Colonel Marcu Tudor, to the rank of general because that is what Corneliu Vadim Tudor wants. General Niculae Spiroiu considers the request of the PMR senator as aberrant. Because he dared to defy Vadim, the minister of defense became the mocking subject of the ROMANIA MARE and POLITICA magazines. After a letter addressed to Oliviu Gherman, the president of the Senate, in which he requests that Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor's behavior should be discussed by the Commission of Discipline and Immunity of the Senate, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu is back again. Yesterday, on 2 February, he addressed an open letter to the presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, in which he broadly discusses the scandalous situation in which the Romanian Army and its minister are placed. Niculae Spiroiu requested that the Commissions in change of defense, public order, and national security should be convened in a meeting and thus, he should be given the opportunity to explain the aberrant situation and the very serious accusations of the PRM senator. Until now, presidents Adrian Nastase and Oliviu Gherman have had a more than tolerant attitude toward Vadim Tudor's abnormal attacks directed against the Romanian Army.
