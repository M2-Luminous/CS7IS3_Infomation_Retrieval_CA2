Total production of mixed and blended feeds reached 40 million tons, a 5 percent increase over 1992. According to a person in charge of the National Feed Industry Office, in 1993 China's feed industry production and sales had the following characteristics: First, although overall production rose, overall returns declined. Second, the greatest decline was in production and returns of commercial grain system feed enterprises. Their production share declined from 80 percent to 50 percent, but both the production and the returns of livestock-raising, aquatic-product, and small town, and individual enterprises, and "three kinds of foreign-invested enterprises," increased rather greatly. Third, the demand for feed for high-quality, high-grade fowl, fish, and special animals was vigorous and full price mixed feed's share of total production reached 80 percent. Fourth, the mix of feed products was further adjusted and the tendency toward serialized and standardized, and concentrated, and pre-mixed feeds increased by about 50 percent, respectively, over the year before last. Fifth, farmers' understanding of mixed feeds further improved. Since reform and opening up, China's feed industry has developed very rapidly, the feed industry system has gradually improved, and it has become an important support to sustained rapid growth of the livestock industry. Because of the large-scale use of mixed and blended feeds, the remuneration from feed greatly increased. To produce only the same amount of livestock products, can save 8 million tons of feed grain annually throughout the nation. Despite this, there still are numerous problems currently in China's feed industry. The main ones are: 1) The supply of feed resources, especially protein resources, is tight and the prices have risen a great deal, greatly increasing feed costs, but the prices of feed products cannot keep pace, causing feed enterprise operations that formerly made only slight profits to experience losses, and economic results have generally declined. 2) Some large- and medium-sized state feed enterprises, faced with market competition, have been unable to convert their operating mechanisms in a timely fashion. The enterprises lack vitality and production and economic returns simultaneously slide. 3) Macroeconomic controls are not strong and industry administration is weak. Because industry administrative departments lack the necessary administrative methods and rules and regulations, duplicate development, blind growth, and the existence of counterfeit and inferior goods are serious, seriously affecting the healthy development of the feed industry. So, the National Feed Industry Office has explicitly proposed the guiding thought for 1994: Further intensify reform and rely on scientific and technical progress and improvement in product quality, adjustments in the industry and product mix to strive to attain a production volume of 42 million to 43 million tons for mixed and blended feed and an 85 percent share for full-price mixed feed. In the light of the current state of the industry, while enhancing industry administration and further improving standards, rules and regulations, and the service system regarding the feed industry, it is important to adopt the following measures: 1. Strictly control low-quality duplicate development. In areas where feed processing capacity essentially satisfies demand, generally do not set up new feed processing factories. 2. Progressively upgrade the technology of some processing enterprises. Plan to use four years and invest 2 billion yuan to upgrade technology for a 20 million ton feed processing capacity. 3. Speed up development of protein resources and feed additives, mainly: Using 300,000 tons of cotton and rapeseed cakes, 100,000 tons of feed yeast, 600 tons of vitamin A, 800 tons of vitamin E, 200 tons of vitamin B[.sub]2[/], and 25,000 tons of calcium hydrogen phosphate, and 10,000 tons of lysine, and setting up a 3 million mu soybean base for comprehensive use. 4. Speed up the conversion of scientific and technical achievements to productivity. In more than ten years of tackling scientific and technical problems, we have a large batch of scientific research results in such areas as feed resource exploitation and make up, and feed additives and we urgently need to organize the total area and expand its utilization. This year we will select a group from them and expand it to improve the overall technical level of the feed industry. 5. Continue to intensify surveys and research and more intensively research major problems that affect the development of the feed industry such as adjusting the import and export policy and the purchase and sales policy for feed resources and striving for various preferential policies and proposing adjustments in the mix of crops planted and expanding feed crop production.
