Pro-Beijing legislator and Preliminary Working Committee member Tam Yiu-chung said Hong Kong's relationship with Beijing would be helped by keeping out people China believed were subversive. The British Consulate-General in New York last week rejected visa applications for Hong Kong from Liu Binyin and Ruan Ming to attend a seminar coinciding with the fifth anniversary of Beijing's June 4 crackdown at Tiananmen Square. The United States-exiled Chinese said the consulate had refused them visas on instructions from Hong Kong's Immigration Department. Mr Tam said the move would help a smooth transition to Chinese rule in 1997. "Sino-British relations would be improved if Hong Kong keeps out people who China feels are subversive or antagonistic towards the mainland," Mr Tam said. Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress Liu Yiu-chu said the government's decision to refuse visas was due to the need to cooperate with China for a smooth transition. Ms Liu attacked the two dissidents for trying to "rock" Hong Kong by importing "their political fight." Exiled Mr Liu earned notoriety for revealing government corruption as a People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] reporter. Mr Ruan was secretary to former Chinese Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang, whose death in May 1989 triggered the Tiananmen protests. While pro-Beijing groups welcome the government's stand, Governor Chris Patten is set to come under fire from liberal legislators when he returns to Hong Kong this week. Several said they would raise the issue at the Legislative Council on Tuesday [31 May]. Independent legislator Christine Loh said she was not surprised at the visa rejection as the territory had a history of turning away "subversives". Ms Loh argued the "one country, two systems" concept of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong may disappear as China tries to dictate to Hong Kong. Independent legislator Emily Lau said she could not understand why the two exiled scholars were refused entry. "They're not raving subversives. It's quite ridiculous," Ms Lau said. Last Thursday Acting Governor Anson Chan said Hong Kong should not be used as a base for subversive activities for the June 4 anniversary. Last week China revealed a softening stance towards Hong Kong by indicating its willingness to allow four foreigners to sit as judges on the territory's Court of Final Appeal.
