Pedro Fernandez Cespedes: [Fernandez Cespedes] For Javier Solana, this ultimatum from the Atlantic alliance is the one that was expected following the international community's frustrating experience in Gorazde in recent days and after the repeated cease-fire violations by the Bosnian Serbs. [Begin Solana recording] I think that we have -- I don't think that we have, I am certain that we have -- the obligation to send a clear message to the parties in conflict, basically to the Serbs, that the zones that have been declared safe and defensible by the UN will be defended. A decision will not be the only one or the last one. I think that in the coming hours there will certainly be further resolutions, which will take measures in relation to other enclaves, other zones protected by the UN, so that a situation like the one that has occurred in Gorazde cannot be repeated. [end recording] [Fernandez Cespedes] Although the same conceptual approach exists among the member countries of the Atlantic alliance, Minister Solana believes this further resolution may be delayed a little longer because of the difficulties of a technical nature, which have to be overcome. Although he has not been able to contact his Russian opposite number, Javier Solana is convinced that, if NATO carries out the strikes to defend Gorazde, the complaints of the Russian Government will not be repeated on this occasion: [Begin Solana recording] My impression is that the Russian political and military leaders agree with this approach. What they must do is the same thing that they did in the case of Sarajevo: try to get the Serbs...[pauses] Pressure them to comply so that this resolution does not have to be implemented. But if they do not comply, without any doubt whatsover, it will be implemented. [end recording]
