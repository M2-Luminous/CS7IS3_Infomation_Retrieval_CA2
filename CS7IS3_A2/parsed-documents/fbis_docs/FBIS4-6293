FBIS4-6293 "dreas075_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 North Korea Kim Il-song Calls on U.S. To Resume Talks Kim Il-song Calls on U.S. To Resume Talks OW1804142294 Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese 1024 GMT 18 Apr 94 OW1804142294 Tokyo NHK General Television Network Japanese BFN [Announcer-read report over video on DPRK President Kim Il-song's written reply to NHK inquiries; and interview with DPRK Major General Kim Yong-chol by "Western news media" on 18 April -- place not given; Major General Kim speaks in Korean, with Japanese subtitles; translated from the Japanese; from "NHK News 7" program] [Text] Today, North Korean President Kim Il-song provided written answers to questions from NHK. In the written response, President Kim said the nuclear issue will be settled if the United States abides by the agreement between the two countries. In this way, he called on the United States again to unconditionally reopen high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. [Begin report from Pyongyang by Toshiro Kishi] [video shows still photos of Kim Il-song] President Kim said as follows: The United States is applying pressure on us by wrongly accusing North Korea, who has never had nuclear weapons and who even accepted inspections by the international organization. The United States also deployed nuclear weapons in the South and is intimidating North Korea with nuclear threat. It is the United States who has been fueling suspicion about North Korea developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can only be settled through direct talks between North Korea and the United States. The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can be settled smoothly if both North Korea and the United States observe and carry out the principles clearly shown in the joint statement between the two countries. We only hope that the United States will sincerely abide by these principles together with us. Of late, Japan is strengthening its policy of treating the DPRK as an enemy nation by taking advantage of the anti-DPRK racket [sawagi], in which the United States claims that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. In order to improve and formalize the relations between the DPRK and Japan, the Japanese Government should stop considering North Korea as an enemy and abandon its anti-DPRK stance. Prospects for improving relations between North Korea and Japan will emerge only when the Japanese Government actually changes its policies toward the DPRK. [end recording] In this connection, Major General Kim Yong-chol of the North Korean Defense Department held an interview today [18 April] with Western news media, including NHK, and said as follows: [Begin Kim Yong-chol recording] [video shows General Kim in military uniform] The United States has not made it clear whether or not nuclear weapons are still deployed in South Korea. This suggests that nuclear arms have not been removed from South Korea. I believe that nuclear weapons in South Korea can be used at any moment. A U.S. aircraft carrier armed with more than 50 nuclear warheads has made a port call at Yokosuka in Japan. These factors represent a nuclear threat against North Korea. [end Kim Yong-chol recording] [Begin Kishi recording] As you have just heard, North Korea is saying they cannot believe the United States has taken away nuclear warheads from South Korea. As for the nuclear issue, it is inevitable that the UNSC will discuss early next month the possibility of imposing economic sanctions against North Korea if North Korea does not accept additional inspections by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. Because of this, attention is focused on how North Korea will act next. As far as the written response President Kim Il-song sent to NHK today, and comments by authorities concerned, it is almost impossible to imagine that North Korea will unconditionally accept further nuclear inspection. As a condition of returning to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty issue, it has been disclosed that North Korea is calling for removal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella on Japan and the ROK. Because of this, we can say it has become difficult for the United States to seek a compromise on further nuclear inspections by resuming dialogue with North Korea for the time being. Therefore, it seems difficult to settle the North Korean nuclear issue at a stroke before the UNSC holds its meeting early next month. [end recording]
