The failure has led Islamabad to announced that as result it is not ready to schedule future talks with New Delhi though in principle it agrees that dialogue is the only answer to Kashmir. This is indicated in the sketchy joint statement released to the media which appears as a mere formality but which Shaharyar M Khan described as a "step forward even though it was a small step". "We are as far apart on the core issue (Kashmir) as we were earlier. Because of this divergence it is correct to say that on the central issue there has been no forward movement. We shall not schedule any talks at the Foreign Secretary or any other level unless there is a qualitative and visible change in Kashmir" commented a determined Shaharyar M Khan at the Islamabad Airport after seeing off his Indian counterpart J N Dixit. The latter agreed when he said, "We are in the same position as we started. But it is not necessary to accomplish something for achievement. To say that there has been no accomplishment is a valued judgement". In all nearly six hours were consumed in the four rounds between the two countries wherein both sides maintained their traditional stands. Official sources here described the talks as "those which in no way made any headway and nor did the Indian side give us andy assurances". They also maintained that Pakistan had a choice either to announce these parleys as a "failure" or to keep the option in its hand for the future. It opted for the latter which is indicated in the last paragraph of a joint statement which says that "the two sides will consult each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign Secretary or other level". Earlier both Shaharyar and Dixit met with the media flanked by their two High Commissioners and senior officials of the Foreign Office, Shafqat Kakakhel and Munir Akram. Dixit disclosed that he had held some preliminary discussion on some suggestions which both sides will now ponder over on how to proceed further with. Shaharyar elaborated that in about two weeks time they (Indians) will come back to them on other outstanding issues like the Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage and Sir Creek. "We will look at the position papers but Pakistan's position is well known and we will now see the position adopted by India. We will take position after that", Shaharyar added. The media was unprepared for the manner in which Dixit chose to reply to their queries. It is rare that the press is faced with such "diplomatic rudeness" in response to some very relevant questions. The Indian Foreign Secretary last his [words indistinct] when [words indistinct] Delhi's stand ond the UN Resolution on Kashmir. Earlier he had not elaborated on the issue except to say that: "Indian position on the relevance of the UN Resolution has been articulated more than once. The provocative question does not need an answer." However Shaharyar made it a point to meet with the media once again after his Indian counterpart had left for home to elaborate Pakistan's point of view. Referring to the UN Resolution on Kashmir he said "I made it very clear that no matter how old the UN Resolutions are, they are as valid today as they were before. The same argument goes for the Simla Accord. If it has not led to any result one does not say that it cannot be applied. We are ready to discuss the modalities of the UN Resolution." Dixit refused to come to terms with the conditions, that Pakistan insists are the Prerequisite for any meaningful dialogue on Kashmir. He felt. "We are aware of these four conditions. I conveyed to the Foreign Minister that when you are negotiating an intractabable problem you cannot do so without preconditions. "Source indicate that the Foreign Minister did not mince his words on his government's stand in his meeting with the visiting Secretary. Shaharyar later said that for Pakistan the people of Kashmir are the "central players" and pointed out that Pakistan believed that everyone concerned at the Secretary level talks agreed with this. Dixit felt that "for any any political solution the people of Jammu and Kashmir would be taken into confidence." Shaharyar reiterated tht plebiscite was essential for the people of Kashmir. Dixit was informed that lowering of tensions meant that first the Kashmiri jailed leaders should be released. "People of Kashmir should be allowed to breathe and put across their point of view. We believe that as elsewhere the leadership should participate in their destiny", he said. Shaharyar in the presence of Dixit maintained that Pakistan retained its option to table its resolution on human rights before UN which it had withheld so far. Dixit did not let this opportunity pass when he added, "the government and people of India are ready to live with the UN Resolution whether it is tabled or not." Pakistan meanwhile still sees a silver lining in future talks as Shaharyar said, "as long as we can sit and talk the other dangers would recede."
