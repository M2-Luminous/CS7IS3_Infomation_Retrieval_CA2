Applicants proposing to perform activities in more than one State should immediately contact the Single Point of Contact for each of those States and follow the procedure established in each of those States under the Executive order. A listing containing the Single Point of Contact for each State is included in this appendix. In States that have not established a process or chosen a program for review, State, areawide, regional, and local entities may submit comments directly to the Department.
