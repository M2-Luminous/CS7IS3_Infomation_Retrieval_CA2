Juppe, presenting his New Year wishes to the press, said North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders at their summit meeting next Monday and Tuesday should "reflect on a new initiative, either to guarantee implementation of the peace plan, or force the parties to give up their warlike plans and find an accord." Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats are to meet in two weeks in Geneva to resume peace talks. Juppe also stressed the need to maintain pressure on the Bosnian parties and for the United Nations to find an "urgent response" on the role and means of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia. On Monday, French General Jean Cot, commander in chief of the 30,000-strong UNPROFOR in ex-Yugoslavia, complained of the "humiliations" suffered by the UN troops and said the force was ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia. "I understand the feeling of revolt and anger" of UNPROFOR officials, Juppe said. "We cannot allow ourselves to be discouraged."
