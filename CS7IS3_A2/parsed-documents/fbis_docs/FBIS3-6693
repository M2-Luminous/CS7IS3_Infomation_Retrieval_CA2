Hosokawa, talking with reporters on a flight back from China, said he only spoke generally about Japan's position. He denied any intention of criticizing the United States which links improvement of China's human rights record with the renewal in June of its most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. Japanese officials, briefing reporters about talks between the Japanese and Chinese leaders at a banquet in Beijing on Saturday, said Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights record. The officials quoted Hosokawa as saying that the international community recognizes human rights as a universal value. But China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin offered a different version of Hosokawa's comment, saying the Japanese leader "expressed his view that it is not sensible for Western countries to impose their own values of democracy upon other countries." "He also pointed out that various countries in the world should make joint efforts to realize the principles and spirit enshrined in the Declaration (on Human Rights)," Wu quoted Hosokawa as saying.
