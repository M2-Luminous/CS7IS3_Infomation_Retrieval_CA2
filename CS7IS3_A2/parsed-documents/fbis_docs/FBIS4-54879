They will be joined by another nine UNPROFOR members on Sunday. This is the result of the talks held today between Sergio de Mello, the UN deputy special envoy for civilian affairs and Nikola Koljevic, the vice-president of the Bosnian Serb Republic. The military delegations were led by Dutch Colonel Jup and commander of the [Serbian] East Bosnia Corps Gen Novica Simic. The observers on the Serb side will be deployed at four points in Brcko and will be able to communicate with their fellow observers who will be deployed on the Muslim side. Our main objective is to prevent confrontations around Brcko and, following the Gorazde crisis, to prevent crises in general, Sergio de Mello told reporters. We want to show that we do not want war and that everything can be resolved through political negotiation, Koljevic said. The result of the talks today was also that the commander of the [Serbian] East-Bosnia Corps Maj-Gen Novica Simic and the commander of the [Muslim] Second Corps Nazim Sadic will most probably meet soon. They will try to agree on a cease-fire, to put into practice the agreement reached by Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi Akashi, it was said at the press conference. [passage omitted]
