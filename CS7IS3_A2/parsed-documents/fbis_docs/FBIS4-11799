Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that many thousands of people participated in the rally, among them the heads of the Knesset opposition factions and Knesset members [MK's]. The organizers distributed registration cards urging participants to defend Hebron if a decision is taken to evacuate Jews from the city. Border policemen prevented several young Kakh supporters from hoisting Kakh flags during the rally. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1600 GMT 31 March, reporting on the Qiryat Arba' rally, adds the following: "MK Ari'el Sharon, who addressed the massive rally, said that as far as he is concerned, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is no longer the foreign minister of the Jewish state, but rather the foreign minister of the state of Palestine. According to Sharon the Israeli Government is not a Jewish and Zionist government, and as far as he is concerned, Shim'on Peres -- who is returning the Gaza Strip and Jericho to 'Arafat -- can stay there with the head of the PLO." "MK Binyamin Netanyahu called on the audience to oppose the evacuation of Jews from Hebron by all legal means possible. MK Refa'el Eytan demanded that the government hold elections prior to such a move."]
