In accordance with Article 39 and Law No.5/91 of 20 April, published in the GAZETTE OF THE REPUBLIC No.16, first series, all those violating the law and orders or instructions from the Angolan National Bank could be sentenced up to two years in prison and fined 5 million new kwanzas, apart from other appropriate measures which could include a total ban on exercising activities in any financial institution. 2. The Angolan National Bank has been issuing some notices which could be viewed as government decrees. They contain norms and instructions which must be carried out. These include Notice No. 6/92 of 12 August, which defines conditions for opening foreign exchange offices and institutions whose exclusive objective is to carry out the purchase and sale of foreign currency and travelers checks; Notice No. 8/93 of 27 May which authorizes commercial banks and licensed foreign exchange offices to purchase and sell foreign currency at the free market rate; Notice 11/93 of 16 December, which establishes forms in which commercial banks must carry out these operations; as well as Notice No.12/93 of 16 December which clarifies regulations to be observed by commercial banks in their foreign exchange operations at free market rates. 3. The purchase and sale of foreign currency can only be legally carried out by institutions which have been duly authorized by the Angolan National Bank, which is exclusively charged with the task of providing license for this activity. Also in force is Notice No.6/93 of 12 August, which contains necessary prerequisites for the provision of licenses to foreign exchange offices. 4. Necessary conditions have, therefore, been created for the legal operation of the foreign exchange activity. It will not be justifiable, therefore, to carry out this business outside the legal perimeters, as has been the case on the streets and other unsuitable places, endangering public order and the personal security of the people involved in it. 5. Thus, the Angolan National Bank and the National Police General Command announce that in terms of the authority conferred on them by law they will deal with all those engaged in the illegal purchase and sale of foreign exchange or travelers checks. They, therefore, advise them to stop this activity at once. [Signed] Generoso de Almeida, governor of the Angolan National Bank, and Santana Andre Pitra Petroff, National Police general commander.
