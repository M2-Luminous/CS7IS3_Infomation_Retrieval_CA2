He added that Grzegorz Kolodko, the new deputy prime minister for economic affairs and finance minister, was a guarantor of this policy. The prime minister said that concrete facts constituted the best information policy of his government, as opposed to paper facts such as conferences or press statements, which were past and gone very quickly. In Pawlak's opinion, "protests are easier for the government to pass over, while matter-of-fact and serious negotiations are much more difficult." The prime minister stressed the role of the Tripartite Commission (government-employers-employees) in resolving disputes. He recalled that OPZZ deputies had contributed to the setting up of the commission. Replying to censure of the government's indecision on the popiwek [excess wage tax], the prime minister admitted that his cabinet had been divided on the issue. "The issue of the popiwek has not been a matter of losing virginity, but a more complex one," the prime minister said, arguing that the new bill was not a "repetition of history." In his speech, the prime minister also recalled decisions made by the government, including the third revalorization of old age and disability pensions this year, because -- as he put it -- we are not giving in to the atmosphere created by the media that we do not keep promises and have no program. The prime minister added that if economic processes developed in accordance with the government's expectations, there would be a further improvement in the situation of pensioners and public sector employees. "I am glad that there will be no umbrella over our government; we shall have to be careful not to jump from the frying-pan into the fire," the prime minister said, commenting on an earlier statement by Ewa Spychalska, who announced that the OPZZ would not open a protective umbrella over this or any other government.
