The alternative is to implement newly conceived measures for combatting unemployment. Finland cannot afford to let thousands of 15- to 24-year-olds get used to scraping a living from the welfare system while doing this and that to keep busy. Although 80,000 young people were moved into training programs between last August and January of this year, the number of their unemployed companions remained at 89,000, and the percentage of youth unemployment rose to 40. This is a horrendous figure that decisionmakers can no longer ignore. Since the majority of young people are still interested in finding a job or getting training, it is worthwhile to make sacrifices to provide them the systems for obtaining these. A few years from now it will otherwise be necessary to provide rehabilitation and expensive therapies to create new self-esteem and energy among those once displaced. The official view of a growing demand for labor around the turn of the century is of no assurance unless we can maintain the work abilities of youth. A report prepared by the Prime Minister's Office entitled "Alternative to Unemployment" offers the government and parliament numerous measures to tackle this serious problem, if the will is there. Jobs, training slots, apprenticeships, or practicum places could be arranged for young people, but these programs will all need money. This first report, which contained a range of possible measures, which was submitted in December, was rejected as being too expensive, and those in the prime minister's chancellory were told to make their proposals more specifically targeted. The cost of the new three-year program they came up with trims outlays from 8 to 4 billion [markkas], meaning a cut in training and job slots by nearly half. Will these cuts be sufficient, or will the package keep shrinking in new versions, as in the proverbial snows of last winter? The proposal of report drafters to increase the training slots to over 30,000 is economically sound and reasonable. Since employers would like to take on more trainees than their budgets permit, and since job training interests youth lacking vocational education, investing in this promises to be an excellent use of funds. There seems to be no better way to combat unemployment than training. Training stimulates even better than public works. It is labor-intensive and increases the market for many types of products. Ever more complicated skills are demanded from workers, and especially the ability to train in new ways. A well-trained worker handles his job better than others and also is better able to keep his job. A work force with augmenting knowledge and skills is the best way to assure product quality and competitiveness. Society would not want to see those having received its dearly paid resources go back on the welfare roles. Even short employment periods can maintain skills and be used to learn new ones, so that the report's proposed 50,000 markkas for each job is more than justified. If nothing is ventured, then neither can anything be gained.
