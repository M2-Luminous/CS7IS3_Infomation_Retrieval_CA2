In the struggle for power between different groups, hundreds of civilians have been uprooted from their homes and are fleeing in panic to safe places. In the latest round of fighting which broke out on the New Year's Day for control of the Afghan capital Kabul, dozens of people have been killed and more than 1,700 injured. Those involved in the affray are troops loyal to Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his newfound ally. Gen. Dostam who are pitted against those loyal to the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The latter has reportedly fled the capital. Since infantry battles are raging not only around Kabul but also in the northern province of Balkh, rockets and shells are raining down on the Afghan capital at the rate of six or seven a minute, and military aircraft are carrying out bombing raids on different locations, the destruction the country is facing can well be imagined. At the same time, the death toll is likely to reach alarming figures. Food and medicines are already in short supply in the country and if the fighting prolongs, the Afghan people would suffer tremendously. Although a large number of those who had fled their homes during Soviet occupation have returned to Afghanistan, the present fighting there may again cause outflows to Pakistan and India and other neighbouring countries. It is unfortunate that neither the world community nor the organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) has taken any serious notice of the civil war in Afghanistan and done nothing to bring it to a halt. It is only Pakistan which has expressed its grave concern at the situation, made an appeal to Afghan leaders to stop fighting and renewed its earlier offer to mediate a settlement between the rival factions. It has warned that military success by one faction over the other would be of a transient nature and may enlarge the fighting undermining national unity. The only happy news from Afghanistan is that the warring factions have agreed to a truce in response to an Iranian offer to evacuate some of the wounded from Kabul. The Afghan leaders must realise that the use of force is not a viable option to resolve political differences and disputes. Having taken the initiative, Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali should visit Afghanistan as soon as possible and make every effort to bring about cessation of hostilities in that country and help the rival factions to settle their differences through peaceful means.
