Manuchehr Mottaki, Iranian deputy foreign affairs minister for legal, consular and parliamentary affairs said the reason for the changing of passports was to insert concepts of the Islamic system and stop possible misuse. Mr. Mottaki added: The new diplomatic and service passports will be introduced as of 1 April, and ordinary passports from the second half of the current [Iranian] year [beginning 21 September]. He added: The diplomatic and service passports of the government employees serving abroad are valid until the end of the current year [ending 20 March 1995] and the government employees who have received visas from other countries and are still in Iran will be given new passports. On the characteristics of the new passports, Mr. Mottaki said: The new passports are smaller than the old ones. They have been given special numbers, and certain chemical substances have been used to reduce the possibility of forging or misusing them to zero. He stressed: In order to expand our consular cooperation and ties in a principled manner, we welcome the removal of visa restrictions with some countries.
