FR940602-2-00085 FR940602-2-00046 As proposed in the Plan of Operations, the project would be a conventional open-pit mining operation with an average daily production of 16,500 tons of ore. Ore would be crushed and processed on site to produce a copper concentrate that would be transported off-site for further processing. Waste rock and tailings produced by the proposed project would be placed in disposal facilities located on site. Water for mining and processing purposes would be provided from production wells located approximately 8 miles east of the mine site. In addition, ground water entering the pit would be pumped out to facilitate mining operations. The project is expected to have a life of at least 10 years and would employ approximately 150 people. During the EA process, BLM identified four areas to be addressed in the EIS: (1) Potential impacts to the ground water system from pumping of the production wells; (2) potential impacts to the ground water system from dewatering of the pit; (3) potential impacts on ground water quality from placement of tailings in the tailings impoundment; and, (4) potential impacts to surface and ground water quality from drainage from the overburden and waste rock disposal areas. ELM is soliciting comments on these and other issues and opportunities to be addressed in the EIS. BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) identification of viable alternatives, and (3) notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies the proposed action and significant issues being considered to be distributed to those on the mailing list and available upon request.
