FBIS3-87 "drafr040bb_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 INTER-AFRICAN AFFAIRS Aidid Holds Talks With OAU Official AB2802201594 Dakar PANA in English 1914 GMT 28 Feb 94 AB2802201594 Dakar PANA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Addis Ababa, 28 Feb (PANA) -- Somali faction leader, General Mohamed Farah Aidid, Monday [28 February] in Addis Ababa, held a 30-minute discussion with the OAU assistant secretary general in charge of political affairs, Tobias Muparanga, on the situation in war-torn Somalia. "He briefed me on the efforts he has been making with other Somali factions towards resolving the Somali crisis", Muparanga told PANA after the meeting in an Addis Ababa hotel. Aidid arrived in the Ethiopian capital on Sunday from Eritrea where he briefed the Eritrean leader, Isayas Afewerki on efforts by his Somali National Alliance (SNA) to end the impasse in Somalia, which has not had a central government since the fall of President Mohamed Siad Barre in January, 1991. Since the failed Somali informal political consultations in Addis Ababa in December 1993, Aidid has been staying in Nairobi, Kenya, where he has met several Somali factions and briefed Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on the outcome of the Addis Ababa consultations. He also travelled to Uganda to brief President Yoweri Museveni. According to the OAU official, Aidid will also visit Tanzania in efforts to brief the leaders of the sub-region on the future of Somalia when American troops withdraw and the destruction of the country's infrastructure. Muparanga led an OAU fact-finding mission to Mogadishu in November 1993 where he met Somali faction leaders as well as civic leaders and discussed with them efforts by the continental body to end the Somali crisis. Since the United Nations Security Council lifted the hunt for Aidid, for alleged killing of Pakistani peacekeepers serving with the UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in June, blamed on his supporters, he has been on a diplomatic offensive to drum up support from the leaders of the region for a future government in Somalia in which he is to play a leading role. Aidid's aide said he is expected to meet the Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi, Tuesday before returning to Nairobi to continue with further consultations with the Somali factions. President Meles was mandated by the 1993 June summit of the OAU in Cairo to resolve the Somali crisis on behalf of the African leaders. American troops and those from other Western nations are due to withdraw from the war-torn east African country by the end of March.
