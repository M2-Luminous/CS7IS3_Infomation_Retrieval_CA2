Li Lanqing said: Quality is not only the lifeblood of enterprises and foreign trade but also an important matter that bears on a country's reputation, national quality, and a country's economic and social development. People should be aware of the need to "develop the country by improving quality." Product quality, which is primarily the business of enterprises, should be improved scrupulously so that "coarse food grains will be turned into delicacies." However, commodity inspection departments bear heavy responsibility for checking quality. Our country's reform, opening up, and development of foreign economic relations and trade have increased the responsibility of commodity inspection departments. Although their main duty is to inspect quality, these departments should also take necessary measures to help and prod enterprises to improve the quality of their commodities. Commodity inspection departments should be impartial and incorruptible, should not be kind-hearted, and should be "fastidious." They should not "raise their hands" to allow substandard goods through, and should firmly prevent those goods from leaving the country. They should also continue to inspect the quality of imported goods in accordance with the law, so as to reduce unnecessary losses to the state and business operators. They should keep expanding the scope of commodity inspection and increase the inspection rate. In addition, they should further improve the quality and efficiency of their work, and serve units that engage in production and foreign trade. They should increase exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts, strive to bring themselves into line with international norms, and act according to international practice. Domestically, commodity inspection departments have approved more than 400 laboratories in various lines of business, which should be allowed to perform their functions fully. Although they are the "main force," commodity inspection departments should make full use of social resources to compensate for their own limited resources. Li Lanqing noted emphatically: Commodity inspection departments should further build up their ranks. They should pay attention to training various types of qualified personnel; they should not only cultivate senior- and mid-level personnel but should also strengthen in-service training, placing particular stress on the training of law enforcement personnel. Commodity inspection departments should never slacken their efforts at building clean government. Without a highly disciplined commodity inspection team which possesses a stringent work style and enforces laws impartially, it is impossible to accomplish our tasks. We should study and draw up several strong, easy-to-implement measures in light of the distinct features of the commodity inspection sector, and should implement those measures relentlessly. In closing, Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about and supportive of commodity inspection work; party and government leaders in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government also take such work seriously. This attests to the increasingly important role of commodity inspection work in national economic construction and foreign trade. We hope that comrades in commodity inspection departments will redouble their efforts and make fresh contributions to national economic construction and foreign trade.
