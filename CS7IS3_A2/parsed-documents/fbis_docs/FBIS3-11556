Prior to Walker and Garcia's arrest, several members of the third U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan crossed the U.S.-Mexican border with a satellite communication system and several other electronic supplies. (Errol Edwards), coordinator of Pastors for Peace, stated that the significance of the event was not the fact of having transported the equipment from the United States to Mexico, but that it represented the weakening of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. The members of the caravan, headed by Walker, returned to Laredo from Havana where they handed the Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial Center a donation of more than 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected in more than 100 U.S., Canadian, and Mexican cities.
