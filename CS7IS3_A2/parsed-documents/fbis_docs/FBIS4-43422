He denounced North Korean communist dictator Kim Il Sung as one of a brand of "unpredictable tyrants with chips on their shoulders" who threatened post-Cold War peace. And he told foreign diplomats in London that unless a lasting peace was reached in Bosnia "in the next couple of months" United Nations troops--including the British ground force--might be forced to pull out. In a grim assessment of world affairs, Mr Hurd gave a chilling warning that the cloudless summer of 1914 ended in the disaster of the First World War. "This is not 1914, but it will not be an easy summer. Our skills, patience and resolve will be tested," he said. But as North Korea lurched relentlessly towards violent confrontation over allowing inspection of its nuclear facilities, Mr Hurd warned that the international community would not be intimidated. The United Nations Security Council would not be deterred from carrying out its international duties and would offer a "resolute response" to North Korean sabre-rattling. "Security is only possible in a world where weapons of mass destruction are not widely available," he said at the annual Diplomatic Banquet. "Unpredictable tyrants with chips on their shoulders must not be allowed to flout their treaty obligations--but this is exactly what North Korea has been doing for the last 18 months." Britain would back Security Council measures to persuade the North Koreans to comply with their nuclear obligations. "They should understand that compliance is in their own interests. But they should be under no illusion--we will not be deterred by threats of war from doing what is necessary, including extensive sanctions. Any unwise move by North Korea will be met with a resolute response." Mr Hurd told the banquet held at the Foreign Office that North Korea was only one of a number of potential flashpoints across the world--and time was rapidly running out to reach a lasting peace in Bosnia. The ceasefire was "fragile and threatened" by people who thought they could gain more from war than peace. Britain and France remained deeply concerned for the safety of their troops as Russia faced pressures to give unquestioning support to the Serbs and the United States considered lifting its arms embargo. The pressures at work were "understandable but dangerous" and had far-reaching consequences for the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). "They make it inevitable that Bosnia faces a fork in the path," he said. "Either there is a settlement soon, in the next couple of months, or there is a real risk that the arms embargo will be lifted, weaponry will flood in to both sides, UNPROFOR's position will become impossible and will have to withdraw." The war could then spread unchecked into neighbouring regions.
