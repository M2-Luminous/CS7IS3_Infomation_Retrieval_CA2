No, the problem is not the aging of nursery-school chicken-pox, but that the ``contingent behind barbed wire'' has gotten younger. This didn't happen overnight, by the way. It was not just yesterday that the juvenile detention and distribution centers were created, where police stand guard over youngsters from 3 to 18 years old behind high walls and barbed wire. This is simply the sign of our troubled, unhappy times, when gunfire is heard on your own street, when your father is taken hostage, when a youngster is tempted with lots of money, and an 8-year-old girl is made to lie down for sex--these days, life is increasingly more strained in juvenile detention centers, and the stories of their lodgers are becoming ever more bitter. In the one I visited, young Muscovites, their neighbors from the capital's oblast, and youngsters from adjacent countries are serving their standard 30-day sentences. Up to 50 young runaways, criminals and prostitutes are delivered daily. Here they undergo a unique kind of sorting: Some are returned home, while others are sent to correction facilities when their guilt is established. What typifies this unfortunate contingent today? First of all, its rising numbers. In previous years the number brought in daily was half of what it is now. If the flow doesn't lessen, the center workers assert that it will be impossible to deal with it. All the more so because the children's collective has to undergo quarantine. There are those with chicken-pox, as mentioned above, those with German measles, and those with hepatitis. No quarantine is imposed here on venereal diseases. Practically one out of every two young boys or girls has gonorrhea. They ``love'' this disease, and they try to catch it on purpose, so that while en route to the venereal disease hospital many of them could escape from the ambulances. They also flee from the hospital--it isn't kept under guard, after all. Who are these children, these inhabitants of the juvenile detention center, these unfortunate youngsters, our hope for the future, lousy and plagued by scabies, brought in from train stations, and caught in basements and attics? The main group, from 7 to 11 years of age, consists of ``travelers.'' There are children from 3 to 18 years of age who have left home for various reasons. An unsettled home life, perpetual drunkenness of parents, and now more rarely a child's longing to see the world, compel the children to abandon the hearth and set off on a distant journey of tens and even hundreds of kilometers, without money or clothing. They travel chiefly in trains, on baggage shelves or in vestibules. As they travel their long road, people give them food and money. But when all of this ends, they begin to steal. In train stations the guests to the capital come together into juvenile gangs, which then disrobe and rob other adolescents, and sometimes even adults, if they are drunk. Fourteen-year-old Sasha rode in from the Urals. A man at the train station asked him: ``Do you want to earn some money? You can sell beer.'' And so a new ``station'' life begins. Money, lots of it. The children steal from passers-by and divide the loot among themselves. And when there's extra money, you can drink, and you can spend some time with the young girls in the station--there are many of them here, and they're cheap. Station girls are 14-16 years old for the most part, but recently 12-year-olds are encountered more often as well. The station life of an adolescent doesn't last long--the police catch the children and send them to the detention and distribution center. Here they are bathed, deloused, fed and sent for treatment. In 6 months the center housed 2,812 persons; 1,582 of these children were returned to their parents. To those who hadn't had their parental rights taken away from them. To those who could be located. In recent months many children have been arriving from zones of conflict. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to send them back home. Inquiries take a long time, and often without success. The center's associates work on the basis of personal contacts--after all, prior to the USSR's disintegration they had worked in this system for several years, and so old ties and acquaintances help to solve the problems. The question is, how much longer will this system work? In the Baltic states, in Georgia and in Chechen, there is a unique attitude toward children from the detention center. An Estonian or Georgian child will be picked up quickly, while a Russian one is not, because, they say, its parents are part of an occupying force. The children go around here in pairs. To lunch, and for exercise, under the escort of police. As I looked at these pairs under convoy, I experienced pain and shame. Days go by, but the pain and the shame do not pass.
