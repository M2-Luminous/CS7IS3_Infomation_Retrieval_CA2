The parties presented an open letter to the president of the Republic concerning the prevailing situation of insecurity in the country. Two parties whose names appear in the text of the letter did not sign it and were not represented either. They are the Malian Party for Development [PMD] and the Rally for Democracy and Progress [RDP]. Seidou Guindo discloses the content of the communique issued at the end of the meeting. [Guindo] The signatories of the open letter indicated that a system of violence has been established and is characterized by blind repression, state terrorism, and censure. In the face of this the situation, the signatories appealed to the president of the Republic, the guarantor of Republican institutions, for an immediate end to all violence: ransacking, arson, physical aggression, threats and insults, and acts perpetrated by private militia. They pledged to search for the appropriate means to ensure their own protection and that of their leaders and to take every action to counter the activities of the private militia of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali if the militia is not immediately disbanded. The signatories also called for the reopening of schools, independent Radio Kaira, release of university and high schools students and all other arrested or kidnapped citizens in order to create a conducive atmosphere for the resumption of dialogue. They also called for an immediate holding of a national debate on the current social and political crisis facing the country which threatens the very existence of the nation. The president of the Republic thanked his guests for the initiative. He recalled all the efforts made by the country's authorities to stifle the crisis and check any excesses that may be detrimental to the democratic process. [passage omitted] He deplored the silence observed by certain partners and called on all and sundry to join in fighting violence which, he said, is the worst enemy of democracy. This is why, he added, the Republican laws must be enforce and they will be. The essential this is that all must be done according to the norms of a state where there is the rule of law. Addressing opposition party representatives on education, he said it was tragic that schools have been closed down. He regretted that during his tenure conditions are not ripe for students to be asked to return to classes which have been desperately empty for a long time. He called for dialogue to be pursued. Despite the suspension of dialogue by Association of Malian Students and Pupils, the president of the Republic reaffirmed his desire to strive for the reopening of schools under conditions that are more conducive for academic work. The president of the Republic also touched on the question of the closure of Radio Kaira and referred to the operational program for independent radio stations. He expressed his unflinching attachment to press freedom, a mainstay of democracy. During the talks, the president of the Republic stressed the need for all democrats and patriots to understand the necessity of the security forces's role in preventing excesses linked with self-defense or with the emergence of private militia. I would not tolerate the existence of any private militia, no matter the origin, the president said. He then called on the party representatives to produce evidence of the existence of such militia and arraign them before the Republican institutions. He said he himself will see to the strict respect of rights and public information. [passage omitted] Speaking on allegations that the president has been exercising pressure on magistrates, he called on his detractors to reveal, on their honor, the identity of those who were subjected to such pressure and expressed his concern, as chairman of the Higher Council of the Magistrature, to ensure that the judiciary is independent and reliable as the case is in a state where there is the rule of law. Finally, President Konare said he welcomed proposals from all quarters relating to education, devaluation, and even to state media management. To conclude, he asked the party representatives not to view this meeting as a mere formality or just a way of calling the national and international communities to witness only for each side to turn coasts later and stick to its earlier position instead of striving to find a lasting solution to the present situation.
