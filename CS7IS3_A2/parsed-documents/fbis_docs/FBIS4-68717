Russia also maintains its interests there. How do you, Minister, evaluate the possibility of joint, concerted action on the part of Moscow and Ankara in this region which might correspond to the interests of the peoples living there? [Cetin] I would like to emphasize first of all that Russia is for us an important neighbor. Both Russia and Turkey undoubtedly perform a key role in this region, primarily from the viewpoint of the preservation of peace there. It is for this reason that our countries should cooperate. I believe that this is precisely how matters stand there at the present time and I believe that this will be the case in the future also. There has recently been a number of meetings of the leaders of our countries, my meetings with Mr. Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow and Ankara included. Our president, Suleyman Demirel, and, subsequently, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also paid official visits to Moscow, during which negotiations were conducted with President Boris Yeltsin. In the course of these meetings, talks, and negotiations we discussed our policy in respect to the newly sovereign Turkic republics. We were persuaded that Russia, like Turkey also, is interested in these republics being independent and truly sovereign. For my part, I would like to mention especially that Turkey has no intention of governing them. They will do this themselves. But Russia and Turkey could play an important part in their upswing. And we have the opportunity to cooperate with Russia here. Truly, aside from the long-standing traditional ties to Russia, these republics have things in common that link them with Turkey also: language and cultural, historical, and religious traditions. For this reason we are trying to make our contribution to their development also. But in performing this duty of ours we are by no means competing in the region with Russia. We are cooperating with Russia. And the events taking place there confirm that for these countries' independence and their economic development and political stability cooperation with Russia is vitally necessary. [Koritskiy] Quite recently even voices were being heard in Turkey quite often and at quite a high level about the "threat from the north." Do you, Minister, perceive this threat today? [Cetin] I see no threat emanating for Turkey from the north. There can be no question of such a threat at the present time. An analysis of the events occurring in the Caucasus, the Near East, the Balkans, and in other regions shows that there is an insistent need for the close cooperation of Turkey and Russia. In my view, our relations with Russia are distinguished by mutual understanding. If we look at the entire 500-year history of Russo-Turkish relations, it may be seen that there have been wars between us, that there have been times of quite cool relations. But the periods of mutual understanding and good cooperation have lasted far longer. The times of the cold war are now ended. This affords extensive opportunities for Russia and Turkey in respect to a unification of efforts in the struggle for peace and stability both in the region and throughout the world. I am convinced that we have a chance to considerably increase the efficiency of our trade and economic relations also. [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, the process of change on the European continent has begun with a search for ways toward a common nonbloc Europe. The military opposition on the continent has today become a thing of the past. There is no Warsaw Pact. NATO should leave the stage also, it would seem. Instead, we are observing the opposite. The question of the expansion of NATO has gradually switched from the sphere of discussion to a practical plane. How do you assess this problem? [Cetin] NATO was created as a defensive alliance. But the threat against which this organization was to have defended us has gone, it no longer exists. The cardinal changes that have occurred indicate that NATO needs a new role, which it could perform in a strengthening of peace and stability in the world. For a definition of this role it is essential to restructure, and we believe that NATO could be doing this very soon. [Koritskiy] Esteemed Minister, how do you evaluate the prospects of the joint actions of Russia and Turkey to settle the conflicts surrounding Nagornyy Karabakh and on the Afghan-Tajik border? There is, after all, a real danger of their internationalization. [Cetin] Armenia's armed forces occupy approximately 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory. I believe that their actions are not in the least bit different from Iraq's aggression when it occupied Kuwait. Armenia is ignoring the UN Security Council and CSCE decisions on this issue. You are right in saying that there is a danger of internationalization of the conflict. I am convinced that the joint efforts of all countries are needed. The pooling of the efforts of Russia and Turkey would produce certain results. This is shown even by the difficult process of a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. As far as Afghanistan and Tajikistan are concerned, I consider that the presence and active operations of representatives of the CSCE are essential here. The directed intervention of the UN Security Council would be useful also. The conflict on the Afghan-Tajik border affects the interests of Turkey also. Turkey is prepared to join its efforts with those of Russia to avert a negative development of events here. I am convinced that it is in this way that we could defend and preserve peace and stability in the region.
