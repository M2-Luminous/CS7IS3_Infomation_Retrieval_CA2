FR941220-0-00007 FR941220-0-00004 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 82 [FRL&hyph;5125&hyph;1] RIN 2060&hyph;AD91 Protection of Stratospheric Ozone: Supplemental Rule To Amend Phaseout of Ozone-Depleting Substances To Include Potential Production Allowances for Methyl Bromide AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: With this action, EPA allocates potential production allowances to producers who have baseline allowances for the production of methyl bromide. These potential production allowances are intended solely for the production of methyl bromide for export to Article 5 countries, as defined under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. In drafting the accelerated phaseout rule, which was published in the Federal Register on December 10, 1993, the Agency inadvertently omitted methyl bromide from the list of chemicals for which potential production allowances were granted. Today's action correctly allocates potential production allowances for all control periods beginning January 1, 1994, and ending before January 1, 2001, equal to 10 percent of a company's baseline production allowances. The Agency may propose potential production allowances for methyl bromide for control periods after January 1, 2001, at a later date. Today's action makes the above-mentioned correction while maintaining the goals of the accelerated phaseout to protect human health and the environment. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 20, 1994. Potential production allowances for methyl bromide are granted for the 1994 control period (which began January 1, 1994) and for control periods until January 1, 2001.

I. Background When Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Protocol) first met in 1987, they agreed in Article 2H to allow additional production of controlled substances beyond the levels being set for the developed countries for developing countries. The United States, as well as other Parties to the Protocol, recognized the need to continue to supply controlled substances to developing countries during the period of scheduled reductions and for a limited time after the phaseout of production of controlled substances. Under Article 5 of the Protocol, developing countries are defined as Parties to the Protocol consuming less than 0.3 kilograms per capita of class I, Group I and II controlled substances. These Article 5 countries have limited resources to adopt alternative technologies to replace the phased out controlled substances. To ensure that such countries do not purchase the technologies to produce controlled substances and otherwise bypass controls on controlled substances, the Parties to the Protocol agreed to provide a set-aside level of production for Article 5 countries. Article 5 countries must ensure that these imported controlled substances are used to meet basic domestic needs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements a program domestically that limits and monitors production and consumption of controlled substances, including methyl bromide. Production for Article 5 countries in the United States is monitored by allocating potential production allowances to those companies that have baseline production allowances. Since 1989, EPA has allocated potential production allowances equal to 10 percent of baseline production allowances for specific controlled substances. EPA grants authorization to producers to convert potential production allowances to production allowances once they have exported to an Article 5 country. The July 30, 1992, Federal Register document (57 FR 3375), as well as the December 10, 1993, Federal Register document (58 FR 65018), explains these controls, as well as the recordkeeping and reporting required for such transactions. The specific provisions governing production for, and export to, Article 5 countries are in §§82.9 and 82.11. Appendix D of subpart A of 40 CFR part 82 contains a listing of Article 5 countries. 1 1 EPA is drafting a final rule that amends the accelerated phaseout rule to adjust the dates relating to exports for Article 5 countries. That final rule will also reflect today's amendments granting methyl bromide potential production allowances. II. Summary of Proposal In the October 14, 1994 proposal to grant potential production allowances for methyl bromide, EPA discussed the inadvertent omission of the allocation of these allowances in the final rule published December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018). In drafting the December 10, 1993 final rule, EPA focused on the level of control of methyl bromide and its phaseout, but inadvertently failed to allocate additional production allowances of methyl bromide for exports to Article 5 countries. Due to this oversight, EPA proposed on October 14 to allocate potential production allowances to methyl bromide producers equal to 10 percent of their baseline production allowances beginning in the current control period (which began January 1, 1994). Because section 82.11 indicates that authorizations to convert potential production allowances to production allowances are valid during the control period in which the controlled substance departed the United States, companies may use these potential production allowances for methyl bromide only for the control period in which the shipment departed the United States. The 10 percent level of additional production for Article 5 countries would continue until the effective date of the phaseout of production of methyl bromide, January 1, 2001. Section 602(d) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 establishes the phaseout date for methyl bromide by stating that production may not extend beyond ``a date more than seven years after January 1 of the year after the year in which the substance is added to the list of class I substances.'' Methyl bromide was added to the list of class I substances in 1993. With this proposal, EPA is reserving action in allocating potential production allowances for control periods starting January 1, 2001, and beyond.
