He also agreed to reply to questions by a correspondent of this program. Asked whether there will be any changes in the government economic policy after the Seimas debate on a government no- confidence vote, Slezevicius said: [Begin Slezevicius recording] We have very carefully studied all statements without exception by Seimas members. We have analyzed all critical remarks and focussed our attention on many of them during the preparation of a corrected government program. As you know, the no-confidence issue is one side of the matter, but now, in accordance with our constitution, we have, after a change of more than a half of the members of the cabinet, submitted a new government program to the Seimas. [end recording] Having stated that the stability of the litas is helping the development of the economy but is not sufficient to make this development more dynamic, Slezevicius continued: [Begin Slezevicius recording] In our program we emphasize our attention on those issues which require a very fast solution. This includes taxation policy, the administration of taxes, the control of borders, and improvement of the work of the customs offices. And, of course, it is very important to step up the investment process. [passage omitted] A limiting factor in the development of the economy is the very high cost of credits, and, of course, not a single investor is able to use local credits for investment processes. This is closely connected with the credit resources of our commercial banks and with the stability of these banks. Together with the Central Bank, we have to accomplish a great deal in this sphere, so that the price of credits in our country goes down in a more dynamic manner than now. [end recording] Slezevicius then stressed the government's tasks in creating favorable trading conditions for Lithuania's industry and businessmen and mentioned that at a foreign policy coordinating committee meeting relations with Russia were discussed today. Then he continued: [Begin Slevevicius recording] As you know our relations with Russia are being extensively discussed. They are closely linked with the strategic situation of the Kaliningrad region and with the necessity of normalizing transit through our country. As it happens, our country is situated between two territories of Russia and our task is to find together with Russia mutually acceptable means of solving all problems. [passage omitted] I think that we will find mutually acceptable solutions in the immediate future and that the agreement signed by Mr Chernomyrdin on 18 November will be implemented. [end recording]
