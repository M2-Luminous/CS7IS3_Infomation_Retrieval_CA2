The source gas was diborane or trichloroboron. The structure of film was characterized by transmission electron beam diffraction. The optical energy gap was estimated from the energy dispersion of photo-absorption coefficient. The electrical properties were determined from Hall measurement. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of deposition system. Reaction chamber was made from quartz tube with the diameter of 42 cm. The RF power was applied by a couple of ring electrodes. The frequency was 13.56 MHz. The diborane gas was diluted to 5% with hydrogen gas. The substrate temperature was 600-900ï¿½C. Figure 1. Deposition System Figure 2 shows a typical transmission electron beam diffraction pattern of a sample. The ring pattern shows the film is polycrystalline _a_- boron. The plasma enhancement was effective to get sharper diffraction patterns. Some properties of the polycrystalline boron films were listed in Table 1. Figure 2.
