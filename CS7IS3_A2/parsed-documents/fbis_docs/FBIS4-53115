FBIS4-53115 "dreas095_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Philippines * Possible Military Equipment From South Korea * Possible Military Equipment From South Korea 94P30051 94P30051 CSO [Editorial Report] The 20 April Jakarta ANGKATAN BERSENJATA in Indonesian on page 5 reported that the Philippines is interested in purchasing excess F-5 fighter jets and ships from South Korea as part of its efforts to modernize its military equipment, according to Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, the newly-appointed military chief. South Korea sold 12 patrol boats the Philippines at a sharply-reduced price last year, and was considering selling F-5 jets as well. This sale, however, must be approved by the U.S., since Korea acquired the jets through the U.S. military assistance program. Enrile pointed out that the Philippines is relying on only two 1960-vintage F-5 jets to guard its airspace. The problem became very apparent when U.S. forces withdrew from the country in 1992.
