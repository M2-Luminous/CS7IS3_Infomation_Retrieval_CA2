In the morning the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations board discussed a concept for a federal program of industrial export supports, and in the afternoon the government's commission on operational issues met and decided to change the mechanism by which export quotas are assigned. This is not the first time that the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has tried to use state incentives to improve the export structure. The board meeting focused on the objectives of a federal program to support machinery and equipment exports. On 31 March 1993 the government approved the "State Program for Support of Machinery and Equipment Exports," which was developed by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The first version of the federal program, which differs from the state program in its specific request for allocation of budget funding, was presented to the government in October. However, the government took no action at that time. In December the draft federal program was sent back to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations for additional editing. The core ideas of the revised federal program are these: establishment of a precedent for budget funding of finished goods exports through creation of a lending, insurance and transportation infrastructure for industrial exports (including through the use of favorable tariffs). Specifically, these things are supposed to be embodied in the Russian Export-Import Bank, a controlling block of shares in which will belong to the state. On two occasions already, in July 1993 and January 1994, the government has passed a resolution establishing such a bank, yet at this time it exists only on paper. Suffice it to say that bank president Viktor Shilin, who was confirmed by the founders' meeting, is still working as deputy minister for foreign economic relations, i.e. despite the extensive history of this issue exporters of finished goods are still forced to solve their problems on their own. The sad story of support for industrial exports brings to mind the thought that in the future Russia will be represented in the world market solely as a raw materials exporter. In view of that, the changes in the raw materials export mechanism announced at yesterday's commission session by Oleg Soskovets, are of primary importance. The commission granted non-ferrous metals and diesel fuel export quotas to the State Investment Corporation, which is headed by Yuriy Petrov. Hard currency revenues will go to a society for disabled Afghanistan war veterans. In this way the case-by-case assignment of export quotas will be replaced by specific funding of their previous recipients' programs. Special-purpose export quotas will now go only to special exporters, who may in turn, in accordance with a decision by Soskovets' commission, transfer the hard currency received through sale of their export quotas (minus a commission) to non-commercial structures designated by the government. Thereby the government eliminates another means of exporting strategic raw materials that has easily evaded state supervision: use of public organizations that possess special foreign economic privileges and tax breaks. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations lobbied for this innovation, but the ministry has not yet succeeded in reserving the sale of special-purpose quotas for organizations under its jurisdiction. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations proposes that the new mechanism be extended to the assignment of special-purpose quotas and regional quotas, particularly since at the present time local governments are refusing them in favor of their own enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has also drawn up proposals regarding a change in the mechanism for export shipments in connection with the state's needs, as supported by the government commission on operational matters. Specifically, it has been proposed that as of 1 January 1995 state exports be restricted solely to fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements and protocols. At the same time export controls should be tightened, with these to be carried out in part by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The number of government special export agents would be limited to a single organization for each product category. Changes in Export Regulation Immediate Changes Special-purpose export quotas will be assigned only to special exporters for the purpose of funding the programs of public non-commercial organizations designated by the government. Long-Range Changes As of 1 January 1995 state exports will be restricted to fulfillment of obligations under intergovernmental agreements and protocols.
