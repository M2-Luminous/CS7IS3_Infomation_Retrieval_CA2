India's strong reservations on the possibility of an amendment of the Pressler legislation or its waiver to supply more F-16 jet fighters to Pakistan, were conveyed by the foreign secretary, Mr Krishnan Srinivasan, to the U.S. assistant-secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel. An external affairs ministry press release said Mr Srinivasan reiterated India's willingness to resume dialogue with Pakistan at the foreign secretary level and hoped Pakistan would eschew the path of internationalisation of the Kashmir issue and support to trans-border terrorism. Ms Raphel told the foreign secretary that the United States was willing to encourage the process to facilitate resolution of all outstanding problems between the two countries. It welcomed the continuation of the bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan which was resumed in January last. India has reaffirmed its consistent position on, and preference for a global, comprehensive and non-discriminatory approach to non-proliferation and security-related issues. This was made clear to Ms Raphel by the minister of state for external affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, when she called on him today. India has also expressed its reservations on the possibility of discussing the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] and related security issues in a multilateral forum comprising some selected countries. This point was raised by Ms Raphel during her discussions with Mr Srinivasan. Ms Raphel had a series of discussions with Mr Bhatia, Mr Srinivasan and also the commerce secretary. She got an opportunity to interact with several joint secretaries of territorial divisions in the external affairs ministry at a working lunch hosted by the jt sec. (America). The foreign secretary regretted the closure by Pakistan of its consulate in Bombay and banning the entry of Indian citizens through the Wagah checkpost on the border in Punjab. He drew her attention to the unanimous resolution passed by Parliament on Kashmir recently and asserted that Pakistan's efforts to internationalise the issue would not succeed in fulfilling its territorial ambitions. Both sides agreed that contentious issues like the amendment of the Pressler legislation to facilitate purchase of F-16 fighter aircraft by Pakistan should be taken up in detail with Mr Strobe Talbott, the number two person in the state department, who arrives here early next month. During her discussions with the commerce secretary, Mr Tesinder Khanna, both sides expressed satisfaction at the increased momentum in bilateral trade relations, the growing interest of the U.S. business community in commercial interaction with India and expressed optimism about the growth in trade. Specific issues like difficulties being experienced by Indian software engineers in securing visas, apprehensions about revival of Super 301 and other pressing issues were raised by the commerce secretary. Ms Raphel responded that America would use Super 301, consistent with GATT and the results of the Uruguay round. The commerce secretary also outlined India's efforts to work out a preferential trading arrangement under the aegis of SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]. He expressed the hope that Pakistan would join other SAARC members in this endeavour. The U.S. commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is also expected to pay a visit sometime later this year. Meanwhile, the Janata Dal today registered its strong protest over the manner in which the Indian government has dealt with the visit of Ms Raphel, and wondered why the "nation's dignity" had been compromised in such a way. A statement issued here today by the senior Dal MP [member of Parliament] and former external affairs minister, Mr I.K. Gujral, said he was astonished on how all protocol norms had been disregarded and the visiting U.S. official received by the country's home minister, the minister of state and the home secretary. Mr Gujral pointed out that all practioners of diplomacy knew that such upgradation of protocol would imply nervousness and uncertainty, adding that since the days of Nehru, India had evolved a pattern of dealing with such visits particularly in similar circumstances. "I fail to understand why the nation's dignity is being compromised in such a way. We have both the strength and pride to preserve our nation's integrity. We do not need testimonials from all and Sundry," Mr Gujral said.
