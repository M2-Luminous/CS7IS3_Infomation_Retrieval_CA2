ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting season. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest of which generally commence on or about October 1, 1994. The effects of this final rule are to facilitate the selection of hunting seasons by the States to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. State selections will be published in the Federal Register as amendments to §§20.104 through 20.107 and §20.109 of title 50 CFR part 20. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Season selections from States are to be mailed to: Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634_ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. Comments received are available for public inspection during normal business hours in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul R. Schmidt, Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634_ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, (703) 358&hyph;1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 1994 On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the Federal Register (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending July 21 for early-season proposals and September 2 for late-season proposals. The deadline for late-season proposals was subsequently extended to September 9 in the September 7 Federal Register (58 FR 46320). These regulations would be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons), Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These species are designated as ``migratory game birds'' in conventions between the United States and several foreign nations for the protection and management of these birds. All other birds designated as migratory (under 10.13 of Subpart B of 50 CFR Part 10) in the aforementioned conventions may not be hunted. On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8 Federal Registers , to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these species and for other early seasons. On July 12, 1993, the Service published in the Federal Register (59 FR 35566) a third document in the series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents which dealt specifically with proposed early-season frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 season. On August 4, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7, June 8, and July 12 Federal Registers , to review the status of waterfowl. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these late seasons. On August 17, 1994, the Service published a fourth document (59 FR 42474) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for 1994&hyph;95. The fifth document in the series, published August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43684), dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1994&hyph;95 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. On September 1, 1994, the Service published in the Federal Register a sixth document consisting of a final rule amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On September 7, 1994, the Service published in the Federal Register a seventh document announcing an extension of the closing date for the comment period on late-season regulations from September 2 to September 9. This document, which establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 season, is the eighth in the series. Review of Comments and the Service's Response Public-hearing and written comments received through September 9, 1994, relating to proposed late-season frameworks are discussed and addressed here. Ten individuals presented statements at the August 4, 1994, public hearing. Individuals and the organizations represented were: Dr. Rollin Sparrowe, Wildlife Management Institute; Walter Sikes, California Waterfowl Association; Brian Cavey, Office of Senator Max Baucus; Bruce Barbour, National Audubon Society; K.L. Cool, Central Flyway Council; Scott Sutherland, Ducks Unlimited; Congressman Jay Dickey, 4th Congressional District in Arkansas; Congressman Tim Petrie, 6th Congressional District in Wisconsin; Dr. Gary Will, Pacific Flyway Council; and Congressman Steve Gunderson, 3rd Congressional District in Wisconsin. The Service received 504 written comments that specifically addressed late-season issues. These late-season comments are summarized and discussed in the subject order used in the April 7, 1994, Federal Register . Only the numbered items pertaining to late seasons for which comments were received are included. Flyway Council recommendations shown below include only those involving changes from the 1993&hyph;94 late-season frameworks. For those topics where a Council recommendation is not shown, the Council supported continuing the same frameworks as in 1993&hyph;94. General Public-Hearing Comments: Dr. Rollin Sparrowe, Mr. Brian Cavey, Mr. Bruce Barbour, Mr. K. L. Cool, and Mr. Scott Sutherland expressed optimism for the recovery of duck populations this year due to the return of good water and improved upland habitat conditions. They noted that a variety of circumstances likely contributed to this improvement but praised the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the cooperative efforts of private landowners, State and Federal wildlife agencies, and conservation organizations for having played a significant role. However, Mr. Sutherland stated that several species, including the mallard, black duck, pintail, American wigeon, blue-winged teal, canvasback, and scaup are still below the North American Waterfowl Management Plan goals. He stressed the need to expand and improve population surveys and banding program databases which would allow the development of refined regional and flyway management plans. Written Comments: The California Waterfowl Association urged the Service to consider the link between hunting opportunities and hunter support of habitat programs when formulating regulations. They believe that the current sizes of waterfowl populations justify a relaxation of restrictions. An individual from California requested that waterfowl harvests be managed on a flyway basis. Dr. Robert McLandress, Director of the Waterfowl and Wetland Program of the California Waterfowl Association, expressed his concern for the 65 percent decrease in California waterfowl hunters during the past two decades and the impact of such losses on wetland habitat preservation and maintenance. He noted that the number of California waterfowl hunters was more highly correlated with pintail harvests and pintail breeding populations than with harvests and populations of other ducks. Mr. Walter R. Sikes, representing the California Waterfowl Association, noted that 1994 would be the second year of good production for Pacific Flyway duck populations which should provide relief to the existing regulations restrictions. He commented that reduced waterfowl populations and hunting opportunities had discouraged support for habitat restoration efforts in California; but nonetheless, California waterfowlers have spent millions of dollars on waterfowl habitat improvement programs in that State. He further indicated that historical data supported relaxation of regulations, noting that during years with similar duck populations, seasons were 31 percent longer, bag limits were 75 percent higher, and hunter numbers were at least 35 percent greater than in 1993. Two local sportsmen's organizations from Massachusetts requested threshold figures for all species of waterfowl defining when seasons shall be opened or closed. The Fund for Animals expressed concern that many States are establishing late-season migratory bird hunting dates prior to the publication of the final frameworks by the Service. They contend that such premature action by State agencies, regardless of the time constraint the agencies may face, conflict with the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. The purpose of publishing the Federal Register proposed rulemaking document and allowing a subsequent comment period is to provide opportunity for interested parties to submit data and facts and to present their views. They maintain that this scenario places the Service in a difficult situation and compromises its ability to make changes. As a result, they believe that the Service does not seriously consider comments received and thus does not involve the public in the decision-making process. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation expressed concern regarding the timing of the process required to establish final frameworks for setting migratory game bird regulations and asked that the Service modify the administrative process. They suggested that regulations should be finalized a month earlier in order to establish season dates and provide information to hunters in an orderly and timely manner. The Humane Society of the United States (hereinafter the Humane Society) expressed concern that the public was not well represented in the regulations-establishment process. They requested establishment of a system directly involving the non-hunting public. They also requested that the Service undertake efforts to obtain population estimates for all hunted species. Service Response: When the preliminary proposed rulemaking document was published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994, the Service announced the comment periods for the early-season and late-season proposals and gave notice that the process of promulgating hunting regulations ``must, by its nature, operate under time constraints''. Ample time must be given to gather and interpret survey data, consider recommendations and develop proposals, and to receive public comment. Scheduled dates are set to give the greatest possible opportunity for public input. If States do take action to establish their seasons prior to the final decisions on the frameworks, they risk having to withdraw and modify those actions. The Service is obligated to, and does, give serious consideration to all information received as public comment. The Service has long recognized the problems associated with the length of time necessary to establish the final frameworks, and in conjunction with States, Flyway Councils, and the public, continues to seek new ways to streamline and improve the regulatory process. Regarding population estimates, the long-term objectives of the Service include providing opportunities to harvest portions of certain migratory game bird populations and to limit harvests to levels compatible with each population's ability to maintain healthy, viable numbers. Annually, the status of populations are evaluated and the potential impacts of hunting are considered. The Service believes that hunting seasons are consistent with the current status of waterfowl populations and long-term population goals. 1. Ducks A. General Harvest Strategy Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended seasons and limits similar to those in effect during 1985&hyph;87 (with the exception of pintail), when significant reductions in bag and season length were imposed to protect certain declining duck populations. The Council presented information on duck populations, hunter numbers, and duck harvest in support of their recommendations. Public-Hearing Comments: Dr. Rollin Sparrowe indicated that while a recovery of duck populations appears to be underway, a single year does not represent an upward trend. He noted that some liberalization may be warranted this year, but added that the major question was how much and how fast should these liberalizations be implemented. Mr. Bruce Barbour advised a cautious restraint and suggested that our goal should be to return as many breeding pairs as possible next spring to take full advantage of the likely excellent nesting conditions. Mr. Walter Sikes and Mr. Brian Cavey commented that with the increased breeding populations and improved fall flight of ducks, some liberalization in the hunting regulations was justified this year. Tim Petrie believed that Wisconsin hunters were deserving of additional hunting opportunities because of their support and participation in habitat programs. Mr. Walter Sikes accused the Service of imposing restrictions based on a trend towards continental waterfowl management and a desire to simplify regulations. He believed such restrictions were unnecessary on healthy populations and inconsistent with the status of populations and habitat conditions within a flyway. Written Comments: The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries expressed their dissatisfaction with the decision by the Service to offer an option package on duck seasons this year. They indicated that most optional regulations regarding waterfowl hunting were abandoned years ago. The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission commented that regulations changes should ideally result in measurable responses to those changes and that ``tinkering'' should be avoided. They maintained that the hybrid option proposed by the Service this year will further complicate evaluations and impede our capabilities to learn about the effects of those regulation changes. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission asked the Service to explain the basis of information used to change the proposed frameworks from those presented at the public hearing on August 4, 1994, to those published in the Federal Register on August 24, 1994. Further, they indicated that they were unaware of the opportunity to provide comments regarding the regulations frameworks prior to the publication of the proposed late-season rulemaking document in the Federal Register . The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department was critical of the regulations-development process this year and questioned the partnership between the Service, States, and Flyway Councils. They indicated that certain perceptions or politics were driving the decision process rather than constructive compromise based on sound biology. They advocated the need for greater focus on population biology, current and projected habitat conditions, and concerns of those who still hunt ducks. They believe this will build the base of knowledge on which sound decisions should be made. The Central Flyway Council commented that the Service's proposal of one additional bird or 10 additional days was overly conservative, penalized hunters, and was inconsistent with our biological knowledge. They stated that it appeared as if biologically-based action had been overridden by risk-aversive conservatism and clearly amounted to ``tinkering'', which would impede learning. The Delta Waterfowl Foundation expressed concern that the increase in the spring population survey represented a redistribution of ducks from unsurveyed areas, and raised concerns about the reliability of short-term population projections in justifying significant changes in harvest strategies. Given the fact that 1994 was only the first year of good production and considering the uncertain variability in the fall-flight index, they maintained that a conservative framework was justified. They further recommended allowing populations to rebuild during these potentially short-lived years of good cover and water conditions. The Federation of State Waterfowl Associations expressed concern that the Service was moving towards a continental waterfowl-management approach and a simplification of regulations rather than using the flyway concept to tailor regulations to specific populations and to promote habitat management. Two individuals asked that shooting hours be returned to sunrise rather than one-half hour before sunrise to reduce crippling loss and aid in species identification and management. Service Response: During most of the past decade, drought conditions on the principal duck breeding grounds have resulted in depressed duck populations, with numbers of some species reaching all-time lows. This situation necessitated restrictions in hunting regulations to reduce harvest rates commensurate with the status of ducks. This year, habitat conditions were much improved and breeding-population indices for many duck species and fall-flight indices for both mallards and all ducks combined increased substantially. Further, the continuation of good habitat conditions into mid-summer this year increases the likelihood that breeding habitat conditions may again be favorable for good production in 1995. As a result of the increases observed in breeding-population and production surveys this year, the Service believed that some relaxation of the harvest restrictions that have been in place in recent years was warranted. The question was how much relaxation should occur in this first year of improvement. Several alternatives were available, including: (1) to continue harvest restraints one more year by making little or no change in regulations in an attempt to provide maximum population growth and potentially be in a better position to capitalize, in terms of duck production, on the prospects for good habitat conditions next year, or (2) to increase harvest opportunity to a greater extent this year and have a lesser chance for continued growth in duck populations. The Service felt that the first alternative offered the greatest opportunity for long-term benefit for both duck populations and harvest opportunity. Flyway Councils felt that more liberalization in the hunting regulations was justified and recommended increases in both season length and bag limits for the duck season. In the Service's view, these changes would significantly increase harvests and were more in line with the second alternative identified above. Consequently, the Service opted for increases in bag limits similar to those recommended by the Councils, but preferred to retain last year's season lengths. The Service felt that this approach would provide additional harvest opportunity for hunters but would have a lesser impact on overall harvest than longer seasons. At the public hearing for late-season regulations on August 4, 1994, in Washington, DC, the Service proposed duck-season frameworks consisting of the same season length as last year and an increase of one bird in the overall daily bag limit. In response to numerous comments received after the public hearing, the proposed frameworks published in the Federal Register on August 24, 1994, were changed to include an option for States to select either the same season length as last year with a larger bag limit or a season length 10 days longer than last year with essentially the same bag limit. The Service recognizes the wide divergence of views concerning an appropriate harvest strategy for ducks during this first year of significant improvement in the status of ducks. However, 1 year of significant growth does not constitute a full recovery and several years of growth are needed to rebuild the principal stocks in the surveyed area that were depressed during the 1980s. The Service remains committed to this goal and believes that in order to reach these desired population levels, we must take full advantage of the much-improved habitat conditions and prudently manage harvest rates. The Service welcomes this challenge and asks that States, Flyway Councils, hunters and the general public join in this effort. In regard to shooting hours, the Service has received considerable support for the proposed shooting hours. The Service has compiled information which demonstrates that shooting hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise do not contribute significantly to the harvest of nontarget species. Consistent with the Service's long-term strategy for shooting hours, published in the September 21, 1990, Federal Register (55 FR 38898), the frameworks herein provide for shooting hours of one-half hour before sunrise to sunset, unless otherwise specified. B. Framework Dates Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that the hunting-season frameworks for ducks, coots, and mergansers begin on the Saturday nearest October 1 (October 1, 1994) and extend until the Sunday nearest January 20 (January 22, 1995). The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended framework opening and closing dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 to January 20. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee also recommended that opening and closing dates be established as a basic regulation and not fluctuate annually. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended outside season dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 to the Sunday nearest January 20. Floating framework dates are recommended because (1) the flyway has traditionally been offered Saturday openings and Sunday closing for most migratory game birds, (2) fixed calendar dates will further restrict hunting opportunity in those States that traditionally open hunting on Saturday and close on Sunday, (3) departure from this traditional format will be confusing and unnecessarily restrictive, (4) there are no biological consequences to floating frameworks since we are dealing with only plus or minus 3 days in opening and closing dates, (5) a Saturday opening allows participation by school-age hunters and those that have a traditional work week, (6) there are no biological or political justifications which warrant a change from previous outside framework dates. Written Comments: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission requested the Service to consider the use of floating framework dates, rather than the proposed fixed dates. The Humane Society recommends that all seasons open on Wednesday in order to reduce the high level of harvest associated with traditional Saturday season openings. Service Response: The use of floating framework dates automatically allows earliest opening and latest closing dates to vary by almost a full week over a period of years. These kinds of annual variations tend to confound assessment of the impact of hunting regulations on duck populations. As the Service has previously stated in the Federal Register (58 FR 50190), a State may choose to delay its opening date to correspond with a particular day of the week or to close earlier to maximize the number of weekends that hunting is allowed. Regarding the consideration of framework dates as ``basic'' rather than ``annual'' regulations, the Service has previously stated its policy to retain the use of framework dates as a harvest-management tool. C. Season Lengths Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council and the Upper-Region and Lower- Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a 40-day duck season. The Central Flyway Council recommended that the season length in the High Plains Mallard Management Unit be 69 days, 16 of which must begin no earlier than the Saturday nearest December 10 (December 10, 1994). For the remainder of the Flyway, the Council recommended a season length of 53 days. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended a season length of 79 days, with 7 additional days in the Columbia Basin Mallard Management Unit. Public-Hearing Comments: Mr. Walter Sikes, Mr. Brian Cavey, Mr. K. L. Cool, and Mr. Scott Sutherland supported the Flyway Councils' recommendations to expand season lengths and allow hunters to have more opportunity. Mr. Jay Dickey supported a 10-day season extension in Arkansas to allow families additional time to spend together. Congressman Steve Gunderson (Wisconsin) commented on the inequity of an additional 9-day teal season in ``non-production'' States without making some additional duck harvest opportunity available to ``production'' States. Written Comments: The Federation of State Waterfowl Associations supported the adoption of recommendations by the Flyway Councils. They believe that the recommendations provide an incentive to duck hunters to maintain and enhance waterfowl habitat under their control. An individual from California asked that the Service consider allowing 86 days of duck hunting in the Pacific Flyway. The Nebraska Low Plains Waterfowlers' Association urged the Service to allow 46 days of duck hunting in the Low Plains portion of the Central Flyway. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources endorsed the recommendations of the Mississippi Flyway Council's Upper-Region Regulations Committee and requested that the Service reconsider its proposal for a 30-day duck season with a 4-bird daily bag limit. They suggested that if the Service feels a more conservative season is necessary this year, a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit would be more acceptable. They also expressed concern that ``non-production'' States are offered a 9-day special teal season while production States are not offered some type of compensatory opportunity. Two local sportsmen's organizations in Massachusetts requested a 35-day season for duck hunting in the Atlantic Flyway. The Illinois Department of Conservation urged the Service to consider a 40-day season framework with a 3-bird daily bag limit. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin expressed concern about the Service's proposal to allow a 30-day season and asked that consideration be given to a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit to provide more recreational opportunity for hunters. Both the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and the Wisconsin Conservation Congress asked the Service to consider a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources expressed concern that the Service did not support the Mississippi Flyway Council proposal for a 40-day season with a 4-bird daily bag limit and suggested that if further protection was warranted, they would prefer a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources disagreed with the Service's proposal and asked for reconsideration of a 40-day season with a 4-bird daily bag limit, but they indicated they would accept a 3-bird daily bag limit and a 40-day season, if necessary. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources indicated preference for an increase in the season length rather than an increase in the daily-bag limit, but stated that they may support the decisions of the Service, if conservative measures were necessary, based on additional information. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources asked for a season of 40 days with a 4-bird bag limit, but if not acceptable to the Service, they would opt for a longer season over an expanded bag limit. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources felt that input from the States was being disregarded and that the Service's restrictive proposal did not show support for hunting and would be difficult to explain to sportsmen. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife recommended a 35-day to 40-day season in the Atlantic Flyway with a 3-bird daily bag limit, stating that an additional 5 to 10 days of hunting is an appropriate response to the improved situation of the past 3 years. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources supported a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, the Missouri Department of Conservation, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency supported the recommendations of the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils for a 40-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation stated that a 40-day season with a 4 bird daily bag limit would help biologists evaluate harvest under regulations comparable to 1985&hyph;87. Further, they would support implementation of these recommendations in 1995 to help future evaluations. The Missouri Department of Conservation expressed concern that the frameworks did not adequately reflect the substantial input from the Flyway Councils. Further, they stated that the recommendation to return to hunting seasons similar to those in 1985&hyph;87 was justified when considered in the context of existing management plans, the current and expected improvement in breeding populations, and the status of breeding habitat. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency believed the recommendation of the Mississippi Flyway Council was biologically justified. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries stated that the breeding-pair and production survey information clearly supported reasonable upward adjustments in the bag limit and season length for the Mississippi Flyway. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources commented that they see no biological reason why the season should not be 40 days and the requested increase was modest at best. However, they stated that if 10 additional days is deemed to be inappropriate, 7 additional days would be acceptable. The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission commented that a 40-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit represented a reasonable response to improved duck population status. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks, while supporting the Flyway's recommendation, believed that there was abundant information to support a 40-day season and a 5-bird daily bag limit. Senators David Pryor and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas expressed support for the recommendations of the Mississippi Flyway Council for a 40-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit. Senator Bumpers commented that it appears that the scientific recommendations of the Mississippi Flyway Council were ignored. The Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, composed of over 180 House Members and 35 Senators, supported the recommendations of the Flyway Councils for expanded seasons and bag limits and felt that maintaining a 30-day season with a daily bag limit of 3 birds sets a dangerous precedent of ignoring sound scientific information in making management decisions. Congressman G.V. Montgomery and Congresswoman Blanche Lambert of Arkansas; Congressmen Don Sundquist, John Tanner, James Quillen, Jim Cooper, Bart Gordon, Bob Clement, and John Duncan, Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd, and Senators Jim Sasser and Harlan Matthews of Tennessee; and Senators J. Bennett Johnston and John Breaux, Congressmen Robert Livingston, W.J. Tauzin, Jimmy Hayes, William Jefferson, Richard Baker, Jim McCrery, and Cleo Fields of Louisiana supported the recommendations of the Mississippi Flyway Council for a 40-day season with a daily bag limit of 4 birds. Congressman John Dingell of Michigan expressed support for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources' recommendation for a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit. Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, State Senators James Scott and Jay Bradford of Arkansas, and State Senator Joe McPherson of Louisiana expressed support for a 40-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit. Other organizations supporting Flyway Council recommendations for a 40-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit included the North Carolina Wildlife Federation, Arkansas Ducks Unlimited, the North Carolina Wildlife Habitat Foundation, the Alliance for Wetlands, the Southern Illinois Quotazone Waterfowl Association, the South Shore Waterfowlers Association of New York, the Sabine Chapter (Texas) of Ducks Unlimited, Migratory Waterfowl Hunters, Inc. of Illinois, and the Illinois Federation of Outdoor Resources. The Delta Waterfowl Foundation supported the proposal for a 30-day season and stated that they did not believe this was the time to liberalize duck hunting regulations. Stating that now was the time for patience and to build for the future, they further commented that limiting the liberalization to the increase in bag limits and not days was appropriate and should be the final decision for the late-season frameworks. The National Wildlife Federation concurred with the Service's proposal of either a 10-day increase in the season or an additional bird, but not both. They commented that it was critical to err on the side of conservation in the interest of ensuring the long-term well-being of waterfowl populations. One hundred and eighty individuals in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin expressed support for a 40-day season with a 4-bird daily bag limit. One hundred and forty-nine individuals from Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin expressed support for a 40-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit. Three hundred and thirty-one individuals, including one petition containing 237 names, from Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Tennessee requested a 40-day season. Thirteen individuals from Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Texas expressed support for a daily bag limit of 4 birds and a 30-day season. Twelve individuals from Illinois, Minnesota, Texas, and Wisconsin supported the rejection of a 40-day season. Twenty-three individuals from Arkansas, Iowa, Florida, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin were opposed to any increase in either the daily bag limit or season length. The Central Flyway Council urged the Service to reconsider and grant the original Central Flyway proposal for a modest liberalization in the 1994 season. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department supported the recommendations of the Central Flyway Council for a 49-day season with a daily bag limit of 4 birds. They believed these proposals were warranted and would not jeopardize continued expansion of the duck population. The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks urged support for a 53-day season and a daily bag limit of 4 birds, stating that this expansion would not threaten the continued recovery of our duck resources. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation urged the Service to reconsider additional hunting days in all Flyways with an additional 10&hyph;14 days provided in the Central Flyway. They further pointed out that in mid-latitude States, additional season length is very important, since duck availability can be very variable. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks encouraged the Service to consider adopting regulations more typical of those in the early 1980s. They stated that their information supported modest increases in both bag and season length and would not jeopardize continued increases in duck populations from habitat areas on the northern plains. Congressman Martin Frost of Texas supported the Flyway Council's recommendation to expand the season length and bag limits in the Central Flyway. The Wetland Habitat Alliance of Texas supported a 5-bird daily bag limit and 49-day season. The Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas, the Texas Handicapped Sportsman, and Hunt County (Texas) Ducks Unlimited expressed support for a 49-day season and a 4-bird daily bag limit. Thirty individuals from Texas expressed support for the recommendations of the Central Flyway Council for an extended season and a larger daily bag limit. In the Pacific Flyway, the California Department of Fish and Game and the Nevada Division of Wildlife supported the recommendations of the Pacific Flyway Council. As an alternative to the proposed framework, the California Department of Fish and Game requested that an additional 8 days of hunting be considered. Both the California Department of Fish and Game and the Nevada Division of Wildlife believed that the 1994 duck population status justifies the seasons and bag limits proposed by the Pacific Flyway Council. Congressmen Calvin Dooley, Vic Fazio, Richard Lehman, Robert Matsui, and George Miller of California, the California Waterfowl Association, and the California Rice Industry Association also expressed their support for the recommendations of the Pacific Flyway Council and for the California Department of Fish and Game's request for an additional 8 days of hunting. The Westside Associated Duck Clubs and Wildlife Refuge of Utah urged the addition of more hunting days. Southern California Ducks and twelve individuals from Utah and California supported the recommendations of the Pacific Flyway Council. Seven individuals from Utah and California and the Grassland Water District of California expressed support for the California Department of Fish and Game recommendation for an additional 8 days of hunting. An individual from Utah urged that the season be lengthened at the expense of the additional bird in the daily bag limit. The Nebraska Low Plains Waterfowlers' Association requested liberalizations in duck hunting frameworks this year. They requested that, if both season length and bag limits cannot be increased, season length alone should be liberalized. They believe it is time to reward sportsmen for their support of waterfowl management. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources urged the Service to liberalize season length rather than bag limits if both could not be liberalized this year. Service Response: At the public hearing for late-season regulations on August 4, 1994, in Washington, DC, the Service proposed duck-season frameworks consisting of the same season length as last year and an increase of 1 bird in the daily bag limit. In response to numerous comments received after the public hearing, the proposed frameworks published in the Federal Register on August 24, 1994, included an option for States to select either the same season length as last year with a larger daily bag limit or a season length 10 days longer than last year with essentially the same bag limits as last year. Recommendations from Flyway Councils and numerous comments included increases in both season length and daily bag limits; however, the Service believes that increasing both season length and daily bag limits for ducks is not appropriate this first year of substantial improvement in the status of ducks. Therefore, the frameworks herein contain the same options as those in the proposed frameworks. Regarding comments on the inequity of the special teal seasons in ``non-production States,'' the Service previously responded to this issue in the August 17, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 42474). E. Bag Limits Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a 4-bird daily bag limit for the regular duck season, which would include no more than 1 canvasback, 1 black duck, 1 pintail; 2 wood ducks, 2 redheads; and 3 mallards (of which only 1 could be a hen). The Central Flyway Council requested that the Service review its policy for the use of the point-system bag-limit option that requires that it be no more liberal than the conventional bag limit. The Central Flyway Council recommended that with respect to duck, coot and merganser hunting regulations, States selecting the High Plains Mallard Management Unit season option of additional late hunting opportunity may select either the point system or the conventional bag limit for establishing daily possession limits in the entire State. The Central Flyway Council recommended that for those States where the daily bag and possession limits are established by the conventional bag limit, the daily bag would be 4 birds with species and sex restrictions as follows: hen mallard, pintail, redhead, mottled duck, and canvasback, 1 bird; wood duck, 2 birds; all other species and sexes not mentioned above, 4 birds. The possession limit would be twice the daily bag limit. The Central Flyway Council recommended that for those States where the daily bag and possession limits are established by the point-system bag limit, point values for species and sexes would be as follows: redhead, canvasback, hen mallard, pintail, hooded merganser and mottled duck, 100 points each; wood duck, 50 points each; mallard drake, gadwall, wigeon, green-winged teal, blue-winged teal, cinnamon teal, shoveler, whistling duck, common and red-breasted merganser, 20 points each; all other species and sexes of ducks, 35 points each. The possession limit under the point system would be the maximum number of birds that legally could be taken in 2 days. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a point-system bag-limit option that would provide, for several species, 1 more bird in the daily bag limit than the conventional bag limit. The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service review its current point-system bag-limit policy. They feel that at least 1 more bird should be allowed in the point system than in the conventional bag limit. The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the overall duck bag limit be increased from 3 to 4, that the number of male mallards allowed be increased from 2 to 3, and that 1 canvasback be allowed daily. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee also recommended a restriction of 3 mottled ducks in the 4-bird daily limit. Other species/sex restrictions would be the same as last year. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the Service: (1) review its current point-system policy, (2) work with both Pacific and Central Flyway Technical Committees to interpret available data, and (3) consider all available new information and evaluate the point system against other bag-limit systems. The Council also recommended a daily bag limit of 5 ducks, including no more than 4 mallards (only 1 of which may be a hen), 2 pintails (only 1 of which may be a hen), 2 redheads, and 1 canvasback. Public-Hearing Comments: Mr. K. L. Cool stated that he could not support the elimination of the point system because of its success in directing harvest pressure toward abundant species and away from species and sexes of concern. Dr. Gary Wills argued that an increase in the pintail bag limit was biologically sound and would not greatly increase harvest pressure from its current low level. Written Comments: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources supported the Mississippi Flyway Council's Upper-Region Regulations Committee recommendation for a daily bag limit of 4 ducks. An individual from California requested that the Service consider increasing the total-duck daily bag limit to 5, the mallard limit to 5, and the pintail limit to 2 in the Pacific Flyway. The Nebraska Low Plains Waterfowlers' Association urged the Service to allow a daily bag limit of 3 mallards in the Low Plains portion of the Central Flyway. An individual from California requested that the duck daily bag limit be increased to 6, with a daily bag limit of 1 or 2 for mallards, or no mallards at all as an acceptable alternative. He also requested increasing the daily bag limit of pintails to 2. Dr. Robert McLandress presented historical information on regulations and harvests of pintails and believed that an increase in the pintail daily bag limit to at least 3 birds was warranted and would provide much-needed encouragement for hunters and habitat management in California. He believed bag-limit restrictions for mallards in California were inappropriate given evidence of a preponderance of California-produced mallards in the harvest, consistently high nesting success and good brood survival. He believed the breeding population decline in California in 1994 was caused by the elimination of set-aside rice lands, favored by nesting mallards; however, there were significant increases elsewhere in the State. In addition to increased limits of mallards and pintails, he recommended an addition of 1 duck to the daily bag limit and 8 additional days. Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina commented that in light of the favorable data this year on duck populations, the Service should raise the limit to promote reasonable hunting privileges. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation requested that the Service work with the Flyway Councils to cooperatively review its policy on the use of the point system for determining daily bag limits for ducks. It was pointed out that the Central Flyway Council believes that the 1990 point-system review contained misinterpretations and omissions that should be cooperatively resolved prior to any decision on the use of this important harvest-management tool. Further, they stated that the process used for the handling of the updated review of the point system appeared to be a breach of the cooperative spirit and partnership approach to migratory bird management programs in the Central Flyway. The Colorado Division of Wildlife questioned the objectivity of the Service's review and analysis of the point system. They stated that illogical conclusions were drawn from inconsistent reasoning. They also criticized the Service for failing to work cooperatively with States on the point-system issue. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department urged the Service and Flyway Councils to develop a cooperative approach to review the point system and strengthen Federal/State partnerships. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission expressed concern about the elimination of the point system without thorough consultation with the Flyway Councils and asked that it be offered to States as a bag-limit option. An individual from Georgia requested that the point system be revisited to reward knowledgeable hunters and to penalize those hunters who shoot group limits. An individual from Wyoming commented on the value of the point system to protect hen mallards and asked the Service to reconsider the point system for the 1995 hunting season. The Humane Society expressed support for abandoning the point system as a bag-limit option. They cited strong evidence that many hunters are reordering their bag limits to achieve higher harvests and many are unable to distinguish ducks by species. As a regulatory tool, they claim that the point system is highly vulnerable to abuse. Further, they supported no increase in daily bag limits from the 1993&hyph;94 season. The California Department of Fish and Game asked that the Service consider adding a second pintail, of which no more than one could be a hen, to the daily bag limit in the Pacific Flyway. The Idaho Fish and Game Department and the Nevada Division of Wildlife expressed support for California's request to add a second pintail to the daily bag limit. Congressmen Calvin Dooley, Vic Fazio, Richard Lehman, Robert Matsui, and George Miller of California recommended adding a second pintail (no more than 1 hen) to the daily bag limit of 5 ducks in the Pacific Flyway. Several individuals from California asked that the Service support the Pacific Flyway Council's recommendation for a second pintail in the daily bag limit. Several individuals from California requested that the daily bag limit on hen mallards be increased to 2, as many hens are being thrown away in the field. An individual from Illinois requested a 4-bird daily bag limit including 2 drake mallards, allowing no hens, and a 2-scaup bag limit. Service Response: The Service, with input from the Flyway Councils, completed a comprehensive review of the point system in 1990, and established a policy that the point system should be restricted to a maximum daily bag no greater than that allowed under the conventional daily bag limit. In 1994, the Flyway Councils asked the Service to review this policy. The Service's review was completed in July 1994 and sent to all Flyway Councils. The 1990 review indicated that (1) there was little evidence that the point system was more effective than the conventional bag at redirecting harvest (2) major problems remained with determining appropriate species- and sex-specific point values (3) species closures eliminated the bird-in-hand identification advantage of the point system (4) reordering of point values in the field was an incentive under the point system and enforceability remained a major concern and (5) most problems with the point system were in application and not concept. In the 1994 review, the Service considered additional information that has been gathered since the 1990 review, and concluded that the point-system alternative to the conventional bag limit should be discontinued. Over the years, the Flyway Councils and States have had substantial opportunity to provide input into the review of scientific studies and analysis of this information. The completion of the 1990 and 1994 reviews and the decision to discontinue the point system have considered input from all entities. The Service has worked with the Flyway Councils on this issue several times in an effort to resolve differences. Three of the four Flyway Councils recommended retaining the 1-pintail limit. Pintail breeding populations have not increased above levels of the mid-1980s, when major restrictions were first implemented, and winter population indices for the pintail in the Pacific Flyway remain at record low levels. While the production outlook has improved over the last 2 nesting seasons, the Service believes that, until more evidence of a sustained recovery is available, additional liberalization of the pintail in the daily bag limit is not warranted. F. Zones and Splits Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended continuation of the Southern San Joaquin Valley Waterfowl Zone in California in 1994 and that this zone be made permanent. About 3,500 acres of Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as duck clubs, compared to about 5,000 acres of managed wetlands in 1971. About 200 additional acres of wetlands had been flooded for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent wildlife in response to the creation of the zone. During 1991&hyph;93, this zone has allowed for a month delay in the opening date from the surrounding Balance-of-the-State and Southern California zones. This delay allows private wetland owners to take advantage of reduced electric pumping rates which become effective November 1, as well as reduced evapotranspiration rates which occur as temperatures decline. This results in an approximate 20 percent reduction in the cost of flooding. Any reductions in water cost provide an incentive for the continued flooding of private wetlands. The situation is not relieved by improvements in rainfall, because although surface water availability improves somewhat, ground water pumping costs are still high. Establishment of the zone has not affected harvest. Estimated harvest of ducks from Kern, Kings and Tulare Counties constituted between 3.0 and 5.6 percent of the Statewide harvest in the periods 1961&hyph;1990. Since implementation of the zone in 1991, 2.5 percent of the State duck harvest has occurred in the zone. Pintail harvest in the zone declined from a high of 4.5 percent of the State harvest to 2.5 percent. Written Comments: Two local sportsmen's organizations from Massachusetts requested continuation of zoning for their State. Two individuals from Texas requested a third zone in Texas between the Mallard High Plains Management Area and the Eastern Zone, due to the size of the State. The Humane Society urges the Service to discontinue all split and special seasons and recommends that any State establishing such seasons reduce the total number of hunting days by a minimum of 10 days. Mr. Boyd Gibbons, Director, California Department of Fish and Game, provided information on wetland habitat and waterfowl harvests in the Southern San Joaquin Valley Duck Zone and requested that the temporary zone be made permanent. Twenty percent of the remaining Tulare Basin wetlands are managed as private clubs, with most relying on costly, pumped groundwater. Allowing this zone to set a late, straight season which typically differs from adjacent zones would allow clubs to flood later when evaporative rates were lower and pumping costs significantly reduced. Estimated harvests of pintails and total ducks during 2 years with the zone (1991&hyph;92) were 16 percent less and 5 percent more, respectively, than during the 2 years prior (1989&hyph;90). An individual from Minnesota expressed support for a straight (non-split) season due to cold weather onset at the first of November in the extreme northern portions of the State. Service Response: The Service acknowledges that the Southern San Joaquin Valley Zone in California appears to provide economic incentives for maintaining privately-managed wetlands, especially during recent years when season lengths have been relatively short. The Service will allow this zone to continue on a temporary basis for this year. With longer seasons, such as currently offered as an option to larger limits, the necessity and advantages for such a zone diminish. Regarding comments about zoning in Massachusetts and Texas, current zoning arrangements will continue until 1996, at which time States will have the opportunity to modify zone configurations in accordance with Service guidelines previously established. In reference to split seasons in Minnesota, the State has the option to change from 3-way splits to continuous seasons or 2-way splits if it wishes to do so. G. Special Seasons/Species Management i. Canvasback Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that an open season for canvasbacks be allowed with a 1-bird daily bag limit throughout the length of the 1994 season in the Atlantic Flyway. The Central Flyway Council recommended that the Service adopt the alternative canvasback harvest-management strategy developed by State representatives on the Adaptive Harvest Management Working Group from all four Flyways. The Central Flyway Council recommended that an open season for canvasbacks throughout the regular duck season be allowed for all four Flyways with a 1-bird daily bag limit beginning in 1994, contingent upon breeding population and habitat conditions. The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that an open season for canvasbacks be allowed in the Mississippi Flyway with a 1-bird daily bag limit throughout the regular duck season. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended adoption of an interim canvasback strategy that would allow harvest of that species throughout the regular duck season in all four Flyways, with a daily bag limit of 1 canvasback (either sex), when the 3-year running average of the estimated May breeding population is at or above 480,000 birds. No season should be allowed when the average index is below that level. Public-Hearing Comments: Mr. Bruce Barbour expressed support for the Service's proposed canvasback harvest strategy but cautioned that the Service should consider the use of closures in specific areas where canvasback concentrate and may be especially vulnerable. Congressman Steve Gunderson supported the opening of the canvasback season Flyway-wide with certain restrictions recommended by the Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council. Written Comments: The Michigan Department of Natural Resources supported the Service's strategy for canvasback harvest management. They recommended allowing a canvasback season in 1994 and continuing the season for at least 3 years. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources opposed the reestablishment of closed areas for canvasback hunting, preferring instead that the season be open Flyway-wide. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife recommended that 1 canvasback be allowed in the daily bag limit and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation supported the canvasback daily bag limit of 1 bird throughout the duck season. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources commented that if canvasback numbers were a concern, they would not oppose removing canvasbacks from the daily bag limit. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission supported the opening of canvasback season. The National Wildlife Federation agreed with the Service proposal to open the canvasback season nationwide and restrict the daily bag limit to 1 bird. The Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas supported the allowance of 1 canvasback per day in the daily bag limit. An individual from Wisconsin opposed the opening of a season for canvasbacks, stating that the population is still rebuilding. If, however, the season were to be opened, options considered should be 1) a drake-only season, 2) issuance of 1 to 2 tags per hunter, and 3) only a 1 to 2-week season. Several individuals from Wisconsin and Minnesota disagreed with the proposal to open the canvasback season and allow 1 canvasback in the daily bag limit. An individual from Minnesota supported the addition of a canvasback in the daily bag limit. Service Response: The Service concurs with recommendations to open the hunting season on canvasbacks during the 1994&hyph;95 season. Based on current population levels, expected production, and projected harvest estimates, the Service believes that a season in all Flyways with a 1-bird daily bag limit is warranted. Area closures designed to protect key migrational and wintering concentrations from heavy harvest pressure and to reduce enforcement problems are not being considered at this time, but, some States may opt to close local areas that are problematic. The Service is aware of the high harvest potential for this species and will closely monitor this season's canvasback harvest and the population status next spring. As an interim strategy, the Service will annually assess several population parameters to manage future harvests of canvasbacks. 3. Mergansers Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended point-value changes under the point-system bag-limit option that involve mergansers. See item 1. Ducks, E. Bag Limits . Service Response: No point-system option is provided in the 1994&hyph;95 frameworks. See item 1. Ducks, E. Bag Limits . 4. Canada Geese A. Special Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the Service amend the criteria for late special Canada goose seasons to require a 2-year data-collection period for proposal submission. They also recommended a 3-year late experimental season in northeastern New Jersey for 1995&hyph;97. The Council also requested that the late special Canada goose season in Long Island, New York, be discontinued. Written Comments: The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources requested that the frameworks for their resident Canada goose season be expanded to 8 days, occurring between December 1 and February 15. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources asked that the Criteria for Special Canada Goose Seasons be modified to allow harvest of both resident and migrant birds in metropolitan areas where their occurrence causes problems and should be discouraged. Further, they believe it is unreasonable and an unnecessary burden to require the experimental period to continue for 3 more years in order to evaluate the impacts of adding 2 hunting days beyond September 10. Service Response: The Service concurs with the expanded season frameworks on resident geese in South Carolina, the addition of an experimental season in New Jersey, and discontinuing the season in Long Island. The Service asks that evaluations of these seasons continue in accordance with the criteria that have been established. These criteria are subject to periodic review and may be modified upon agreement and consensus of the Service and Flyway Councils. The Service will request input from the other Flyways regarding expanding from 1 to 2 years the data&hyph;collection period required prior to proposal submission for a late special season. The Service requests that Minnesota provide a biological rational for their contention that migrant geese harvested in metropolitan areas during special goose season not be subject to the special Canada goose season criteria. The Service also notes that Minnesota has the option of not extending their special season 2 days and thus avoiding further evaluation if, in their judgement, such an extension does not warrant the additional evaluation costs. B. Regular Seasons Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that the dark goose hunting regulations in the east-tier States (Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas [Eastern Goose Zone]) be 86 days with a bag limit of 2 in North Dakota and 2 with no more than 1 white-fronted goose in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota and the eastern goose zone of Texas. The white-fronted goose season in Texas should not exceed 72 days, and during the remaining 14 days of the season, the bag limit will be no more than 2 Canada geese. The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended several changes in Canada goose quotas, season lengths, etc., based on population status and population management plans and programs. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee also recommended that the Service allow seasons for geese to be split into 3 segments. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended allowing cackling Canada geese to be taken outside their normal range in California, Oregon, and Washington as part of the prevailing limit on Canada geese. Within their normal range, the Council recommended that the bag limit include not more than 1 cackling Canada goose. The 1-cackler limit would apply to the Southwestern Washington Goose Quota Area, all of Oregon, and a majority of California where the season would be concurrent with the restricted white-fronted goose season. The Pacific Flyway Council also recommended that for Oregon, the Malheur County Zone be incorporated into a Harney, Klamath, Lake, and Malheur Counties Zone, thereby allowing the season on dark geese to end on the Saturday nearest January 20 instead of the first Sunday in January. The dark goose limit would be increased from 3 to 4, including not more than 2 whitefronts. The adjacent Southwestern Zone in Idaho would be permitted frameworks similar to those recommended for Malheur County. The Pacific Flyway Council sought a limited resumption of cackling Canada goose hunting throughout the population's range and recommended that the Service provide an expedited Section 7 Consultation review of their recommended changes in cackling Canada goose regulations for possible impacts on Aleutian Canada geese. Public-Hearing Comments: Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin endorsed a procedure recommended by the Mississippi Flyway Council to manage Canada goose harvest in the Mississippi River Subzone in southwest Wisconsin. Written Comments: The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife requested that the Service review the Federal frameworks for hunting Canada geese on the DelMarva Peninsula. They believe that the existing frameworks are more liberal than can be justified based on the size of the population. They maintained that high harvest rates on adult birds are suppressing the population and preventing a recovery. During the 1993&hyph;94 hunting season, Delaware voluntarily restricted their seasons, but because these Canada goose populations move about the Peninsula, they believe that harvest pressure should be reviewed in parts of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia and appropriate action taken to reduce harvest and protect these migrant Canada geese. Congressman Steve Gunderson (Wisconsin) requested that the Mississippi River Subzone in Wisconsin be declared a giant Canada goose harvest area and removed from Canada goose harvest-quota considerations for the State. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources requested a change in the boundary of their West-Central Goose Zone, as required by State legislation. They indicated that they had requested endorsement of the proposed change by the Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council; however, the Committee did not endorse it. An individual from Wisconsin commented that Wisconsin's goose harvest quota should be more than the allotted 60,000 geese since the Mississippi Valley Population has increased from 1993. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas, and the Wetland Habitat Alliance of Texas expressed their support for the Service's proposal to extend the framework for dark geese to 86 days with a 2-bird daily bag limit. Service Response: The Service generally concurs with recommendations from the Flyway Councils for the 1994&hyph;95 frameworks. However, the Service does not endorse 3-way splits for Canada goose seasons at this time. The use of 3-way splits as a harvest-management tool may have merit, but a more detailed proposal, including plans for a Flyway-wide evaluation and projections of potential impacts, should be prepared prior to implementing such a change. The Service is willing to work with the Mississippi Flyway Council to investigate the desirability of this option during the coming year. Regarding the Mississippi River Subzone in southwest Wisconsin, the Service concurs with the Mississippi Flyway Council recommendation to assign a reasonable portion of the State's Canada goose quota to the Subzone and remove the monitoring requirement. In reference to season frameworks for the Delmarva Peninsula, the Service believes that a departure from the Flyway Council's recommended 3-year harvest strategy is not warranted at this time, since this is the third year of that period. The Service suggests that Delaware work with other concerned Flyway States during the coming year to develop appropriate harvest strategies for this important wintering area of the Atlantic Flyway Population of Canada geese. Regarding the recommendation by Minnesota for a boundary change in the West-Central Goose Zone, the Service believes that such changes should be made in cooperation with other Flyway States involved in the management of the Eastern Prairie Canada Goose Population. Since the Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council did not endorse the Minnesota proposal, the Service does not concur with the recommended change. Concerning Canada goose harvest quotas in Wisconsin, recommendations for the annual allocation of allowable harvests among harvest areas are developed cooperatively by Flyway States involved in the management of the various Canada goose populations. The Service endorses this procedure, and notes that the Wisconsin quota provided in the following frameworks is larger than 60,000. 5. White-fronted Geese Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommendations regarding dark geese involve white-fronted geese. See item 4. Canada Geese. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that: for Washington, the special bag-limit restriction on white-fronted geese be removed, allowing them to be included in the overall 4-dark-goose limit; for Oregon, the season on white-fronted geese would open at the same time as the dark-goose season, approximately 1 week earlier than currently allowed; and for California, the white-fronted goose season would be extended by 2 weeks within the Sacramento Valley special goose-closure portion of the ``Balance-of-the-State'' Zone. Public-Hearing Comments: Dr. Gary Will recommended allowing modest liberalization of the take of white-fronted geese in California, Oregon, and Washington, which would still allow a 5&hyph;10 percent increase in annual growth. He indicated that the population would likely be at the objective level this fall and that the Service's request for a long-term harvest strategy would be completed. Written Comments: The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area of Alaska, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington. However, they did not support further liberalizations in Oregon or California, noting that liberalizations occurred during each of the preceding years and that it was difficult to measure the effects of these incremental changes. Service Response: The Service concurs with the Flyway Council recommendations for season frameworks, except the changes recommended by the Pacific Flyway Council for Washington, Oregon, and California. Although the Flyway's population of white-fronted geese is increasing, it remains below the management objective endorsed by the Council. The Flyway harvest strategy for this population of geese has not been completed, and some members of the Native American Community in Alaska have not endorsed portions of this recommendation. Further, changes in white-fronted seasons made last year have not yet been fully evaluated. For these reasons, the Service believes the recommended changes are not warranted at this time. 6. Brant Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a 2-bird daily bag limit and a 50-day season length for brant. The Central Flyway Council recommendations regarding dark geese involve brant. See item 4. Canada Geese. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the daily bag limit for brant be reduced to 2 birds to better conform with limits in other Flyways. Written Comments: The New York Department of Environmental Conservation supported the increase in season length to 50 days in the Atlantic Flyway. Service Response: The Service concurs with the recommendations regarding Brant seasons. 7. Snow and Ross' (Light) Geese Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that the framework dates for light geese be from the Saturday nearest October 1 (October 1, 1994) through the Sunday nearest February 15 (February 12, 1995), except in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas where the closing framework date would be extended to February 28, 1995. The Council also recommended that the State of Kansas be allowed to modify its boundary for Zone 1 (light goose) to include that portion of Kansas east of the Kansas Highway 99, and Zone 2 include the remainder of the State west of Highway 99. The Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the season length for light geese be increased from 80 to 107 days. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended a season framework adjustment to extend the light-goose closing date for Malheur County of Oregon and southwest Idaho from the first Sunday in January to the Sunday nearest January 20. Malheur County would become part of a Harney, Klamath, Lake, and Malheur Counties Zone. This adjustment aligns the framework of the affected area with the remainder of the Flyway. Written Comments: The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department supported a change in the Federal frameworks that would extend the framework closing date for light geese until February 28. This change would allow for increased harvest of the Mid-continent Population of lesser snow geese which are at record-high levels and, because of these levels, may be threatening their own breeding habitat. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas, and the Wetland Habitat Alliance of Texas agreed with the Service's proposal to extend the framework for light geese to February 28. Service Response: The Service concurs with the above recommendations. 8. Tundra swans Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended that the experimental tundra swan season in North Dakota be granted an additional year of experimental status with a final report due on June 1, 1995. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the number of permits in Utah authorizing the take of 1 tundra swan per season be increased from 2,500 to 2,800 to compensate for lost hunting opportunity from a State-imposed early season closure. As an informational item, the Council recommended that Montana, Nevada, and Utah implement a monitoring program to assess the number of trumpeter swans, if any, taken accidentally during the tundra swan season. The Council also recommended that Utah be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks by ending its season on or before December 15 and closing the Green River Area to swan hunting. The 3-year-average midwinter population index of 79,406 tundra swans is well above the Flyway objective level of 38,000. Proposed frameworks will result in harvest levels within those prescribed in the 1989 Tundra Swan Hunt Plan endorsed by the Pacific Flyway Council. The changes are premised on the implementation of the State-Federal cooperative program for hazing trumpeter swans from winter concentration areas near Harriman State Park in Idaho to more favorable sites. Public-Hearing Comments: Dr. Gary Will reemphasized the Council's support for restrictions on tundra swan hunting in portions of the Pacific Flyway to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans and encouraged the Service to continue to cooperate with the Council and participating States in the management of the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP) of trumpeter swans. He recommended that a reasonable harvest of tundra swans be continued while also accommodating the range expansion of trumpeter swans to resolve winter bottleneck problems in southeastern Idaho. Written Comments: Mr. D. C. Carlton, representing the Biodiversity Legal Foundation (Foundation), commented on the management of the RMP of trumpeter swans. He detailed the status and perceived threats to these swans, reviewed past and current management actions, and concluded that leadership, actions, and funding by the Service are inadequate to assure the population's recovery and believes they warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act. Among many recommendations directed at improving the effectiveness of range-expansion efforts directed at benefiting these swans, those germane to hunting regulations included: (1) not allowing either a permitted or incidental take of trumpeter swans during a tundra swan season, (2) having no open seasons for hunting tundra swans in the most critical trumpeter swan range-expansion areas, including all of Utah and Nevada, (3) modifying hunting regulations on National Wildlife Refuges in Montana, Utah, and Nevada to provide sanctuary for resting, reproduction, and rearing of cygnets, and (4) ending waterfowl hunting after October 20 at two sites on the Snake River in Idaho, at a site on the Green River, including Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming, and in unspecified areas within the Tristate Yellowstone region. Ms. Heidi Prescott, on behalf of The Fund for Animals, Inc., highlighted recent survey reports, reviewed portions of the Pacific Flyway Council's management plan and a report by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service employee, and presented the group's views regarding management action pertaining to RMP trumpeter swans. The Fund for Animals, Inc., concurred with the recommendations of the Foundation pertaining to migratory game bird hunting contained in the aforementioned letter from Mr. D. C. Carlton of the Foundation. Mr. D. J. Schubert, also on behalf of the Fund for Animals, Inc., reiterated certain concerns and needed actions deemed necessary for successful range expansion of RMP trumpeter swans. He believed that a mandatory check of swans taken by hunters in Utah and Nevada is necessary to measure the level of accidental take. While the purposeful hazing of trumpeter swans to more favorable winter sites has merit, it put more trumpeter swans at risk in tundra swan hunt areas; and he therefore recommended a new management strategy. The Fund for Animals believes there are two possible management strategy changes that would minimize excessive killing of trumpeter swans and still be consistent with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act: (1) prohibit hunting of tundra swans in Utah and Nevada; or, although less preferred, (2) prohibit hunting in certain critical areas in Utah. Under both options, security areas should be established in Idaho, and recreational activities such as waterfowl hunting and boating should be evaluated for possible negative impacts on trumpeter swan behavior and habitat use. Should intensive hazing be pursued to disperse birds to more favorable wintering sites, and if law enforcement policy is to be changed to facilitate the collection of information on the accidental take of trumpeter swans during the tundra swan season, the Fund for Animals recommended that: (1) both Idaho and Wyoming Game and Fish Departments provide sanctuaries in designated areas; (2) the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, at the maximum, not allow swan hunting or, at the minimum, not allow swan hunting in Box Elder, Cache, and Rich Counties; (3) the Nevada Division of Wildlife close Stillwater Wildlife Management Area to swan hunting; (4) the Service close all National Wildlife Refuges in Utah and Nevada to the hunting of tundra swans; and (5) should the aforenamed States not exercise the recommended action, the Service should do so. Additionally, all States should enhance their hunter-education programs to emphasize proper identification of swans and waterfowl to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans as a result of other hunting seasons. Mr. D. J. Schubert, in comments representing both The Fund for Animals, Inc., and the Foundation, reiterated and elaborated upon previous recommendations from those two organizations for curtailing tundra swan hunting and waterfowl hunting to enhance RMP trumpeter swan winter-range expansion (see above and 59 FR 43691&hyph;43692) and made specific comments on the proposed frameworks. At a minimum, Mr. Schubert recommends prohibiting tundra swan hunting and restricting waterfowl hunting on all Federal lands in south-central Montana, southern Idaho, western Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. He believes that the Service is negligent in not using to the fullest extent various management provisions afforded and mandated by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act, and the Refuge Recreation Act to protect RMP trumpeter swans. He described the historic RMP trumpeter swan populations, probable causes for their current restricted winter distribution, and past and current management efforts aimed at restoring the population; he offered management solutions to restore the population; and he argued in support of a petition for listing the RMP trumpeter as a threatened species which had been dismissed by the Service. He insists that the Service is obligated by law to restore the trumpeter swan to its native range. He contends that the Service is operating under an unpublished policy of nonenforcement of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act with respect to tundra swan hunters who might accidentally shoot a trumpeter swan. He recanted his previous recommendation for measuring the level of accidental take, by saying that there was sufficient information to know that it occurred. Mr. Michael Roy, on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, expressed concern about the successful continuation of the RMP trumpeter swan range-expansion program, in part because of a perceived ineffective and confusing management structure that is not adequately represented by all interested parties, and in part by accidental take of trumpeter swans during tundra swan seasons in Utah. He believes certain recommendations provided by Ms. Ruth Shea, a Service employee, were reasoned and practical and, if implemented, would enhance range-expansion efforts. Premised on Ms. Shea's recommendations, he recommended that tundra swan hunting in Utah be discontinued from the southern boundary of the Bear River National Wildlife Refuge north and east to the Idaho and Wyoming borders for an initial 5-year period. This closure would be intended to minimize the accidental take of trumpeter swans during translocation activities and, hopefully, tundra swan hunting could be reinstated afterwards. Ms. Louisa Willcox, representing the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, raised questions regarding the Service's role in managing RMP trumpeter swans and funding efforts to increase their numbers and expand their distribution. She asked how the Service will monitor the accidental take of trumpeter swans during tundra swan hunting seasons in Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah and what measures will be taken to minimize the potential losses. She also asked why the Service has not sought establishment of trumpeter swan wintering sites outside the Montana-Idaho-Wyoming region. She requested that the Service develop a long-term strategy to prevent wintering waterfowl, including trumpeter swans, from damaging vegetation and fish habitat at Harriman State Park in Idaho. The Humane Society recommended that all tundra swan seasons be closed. Service Response: The Service concurs with the recommendation to extend the experimental tundra swan season in North Dakota one additional year, with a final report due by June 1, 1995. In conjunction with a larger Federal-State-Flyway effort to enhance and monitor both winter and summer distribution of RMP trumpeter swans, the Service believes that modification of tundra swan hunting seasons in the Pacific Flyway portion of Montana, in Utah, and in Nevada is warranted to minimize the accidental killing of trumpeter swans by tundra swan hunters. Accordingly, final frameworks require: (1) States to collect and report information on the accidental take of trumpeter swans in conjunction with tundra swan seasons, and (2) in Utah, the season must end on or before December 15 and four counties would be closed to swan hunting. The Pacific Flyway Council's request for additional permits to compensate for lost hunting opportunities in Utah is not without merit from the standpoint of tundra swan management; however, the Service denied the Council's request and believes a conservative approach is warranted because of the possibility of trumpeter swans moving into the general hunting area. Further, there has been no change in either policy or law regarding enforcement of migratory game bird hunting regulations as they apply to the illegal take of trumpeter swans. Monitoring of the winter distribution of trumpeter swans will provide the Service with additional opportunities to further modify hunt programs if warranted. Trumpeter swans are expected to number about 17,000&hyph;20,000 individuals during the next range-wide survey scheduled for 1995 and have been increasing at about 6 percent per year during 1968&hyph;90 (1990 was the last year in which a range-wide survey was conducted). Populations such as the RMP warrant additional attention, which the Service continues to give with considerable assistance from State and other Federal agencies and moral, if not financial, support from several non-governmental organizations. Regarding closure of all tundra swan seasons, the Service believes that the status of tundra swan populations does not warrant such closures. 23. Other Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the Service provide compensatory days for State-imposed Sunday-hunting prohibitions. Written Comments: Two local sportsmen's organizations from Massachusetts suggested compensatory days for those days lost due to State-imposed Sunday-hunting prohibitions. The Humane Society supported the closure of hunting on Sundays. Service Response: The Service is not aware of any biological basis for prohibiting hunting on Sundays and therefore neither promotes nor condones prohibition of Sunday hunting. Sunday-hunting closures are established by State or local law. The Service has stated previously in the September 24, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 50188) that it believes this problem is an individual State issue and can best be resolved by each State removing its self-imposed restrictions. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14),'' filed with EPA on June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). However, this programmatic document does not prescribe year-specific regulations; those are developed annually. The annual regulations and options are being considered in the Environmental Assessment, ``Waterfowl Hunting Regulations for 1994,'' which is available upon request. Endangered Species Act Consideration In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under Section 7 are considered public documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird Management. Regulatory Flexibility Act; Executive Order 12866; and the Paperwork Reduction Act In the Federal Register dated April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16762), the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq), and publication of a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under E.O. 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504. Authorship The primary author of this proposed rule is Robert J. Blohm, Office of Migratory Bird Management. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service intends that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, the Service established what it believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, the Service recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, the States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. Therefore, the Service, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;711), prescribes final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season and option selections from these officials, the Service will publish in the Federal Register a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United States for the 1994&hyph;95 season. The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season are authorized under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;711); the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act of 1978 (November 8, 1978), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 712); and the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (August 8, 1956), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 742 a_d and e_j). Dated: September 22, 1994. Robert P. Davison, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Final Regulations Frameworks for 1994&hyph;95 Late Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Director has approved frameworks for season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for hunting waterfowl and coots between the dates of September 1, 1994, and March 10, 1995.
