He gave that interview in the city of Huambo, on the Angolan Central Plateau. Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi noted that a peace accord should be secured as a matter of urgency because, in his words, 30 years of war is far too much and there is a need to avoid further bloodshed. The president of UNITA also expressed the belief that Angola will enjoy peace in the future. In this regard, Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi said that UNITA has made many concessions at the Lusaka peace talks. At another point in his interview with the French newspaper, the president of UNITA noted that it was absurd to continue making war while peace talks are continuing. He said, quote, I am well aware that it makes no sense to make war while talking peace, unquote. Looking back to the September 1992 elections, Dr. Jonas Savimbi said that responsibility for the failure of those elections must be laid at the door of all Angolan political forces, the West -- which did not help -- and the United Nations, which did not have the necessary ability to operate in a country as vast as Angola which, to add to the problem, had just come out of a 16-year war.
