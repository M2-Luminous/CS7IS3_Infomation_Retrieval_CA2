Since then, military authorities have been assiduously analyzing the true intention of such a remark and have been very sensitive to the conduct of the North Korean military. An analysis of their behavior since 22 March by military authorities reveals that such a remark stems from a high-powered strategy and tactic to occupy favorable ground in the negotiations with the South and the United States. No signs of aggression can be detected in the conduct of the North Korean military. According to military intelligence sources, the North Korean military is currently carrying out winter season training exercises. North Korea is carrying out large-scale military training exercises. It designates December to March as the winter season training period and July to August as the summer season training period. The winter season training period exercises, including joint infantry, tank, and artillery mobile exercises, are more intense than during the summer season training period. Regardless of the remark by the North Korean delegate, the recent conduct of the North Korean military shows that it is carrying out normal training. The only difference is that the intensity is enhanced and the number of training exercises has increased. This is a common method used when South-North dialogue and DPRK-U.S. talks are not progressing well. Even though there is no clear sign of provocation attracting our interest, the Defense Ministry is not breaking its vigilant position because the North Korean military is increasing the number of training exercises, which is worthy of close attention. Including the armistice line region, North Korea deployed to the front line 65 percent of its ground forces; 60 percent of its vessels; and 40 percent of its fighter planes along the region south of Pyongyang and Wonsan. Therefore, North Korea, which has been propagandizing 1995 as the "year for reunification," completed a military deployment strong enough for a full large-scale invasion of the South. North Korea has also sharply increased exercises that were reduced in 1980. Moreover, the frontline corps of the North Korean Army increased exercises by 40 percent, the Navy 15 percent, and the Air Force 30 percent, compared with last year. These actions are making the military authorities tense. The military is closely observing the moves by the North Korean military based on a list of approximately 100 signs indicating moves for a southward invasion. Not even 10 percent of the signs from the list have been observed in the current conduct of the North Korean military. Nevertheless, the military authorities are frequently holding contacts with U.S. forces stationed in the ROK to discuss the conduct of the North Korean military. On 22 March, the Defense Ministry examined prolonging the "time- limited readiness," which has been carried out since 1 November 1993, until the crisis on the Korean peninsula is improved to some degree. Also, before and after President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan and China, a special alert was ordered for the whole Army. This is a measure that will allow an immediate reaction to a possible provocation from North Korea.
