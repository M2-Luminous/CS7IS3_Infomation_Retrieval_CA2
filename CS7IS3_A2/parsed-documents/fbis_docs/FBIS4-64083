A total of 17 per cent of respondents said they can hardly make both ends meet, while only three per cent are quite satisfied with their incomes and 27 per cent admitted that their incomes are relatively not bad. The majority of these polled (65 per cent) said that five years ago they lived much better. A total of 22 per cent said that their incomes had grown, while 11 per cent believe that their incomes remained at about the same level. Almost half of respondents (47 per cent) resolutely declined to make any forecasts about their future incomes. The number of optimists hoping that in five years their life will change for the better makes up about 27 per cent, with 6 per cent cherishing hopes of getting rich. However, 13 per cent cherish no such hopes and are preparing to tighten their belts. Taking part in the poll were 3,535 respondents from 190 Russian settlements located in 30 regions of the Russian Federation.
