FR941003-2-00169 FR941003-2-00058 The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 14 Specifically, the Commission finds the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 permitting Specialists to accept contingency orders, as defined in Phlx Rule 1066, without prior Floor Official approval, will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by facilitating quicker and more efficient executions of such contingency orders. While the Commission believes that it is permissible for Specialists to retain the ability to refuse to accept contingency orders as market conditions necessitate, the Commission also believes that the proposed amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 requiring the express approval of two Floor Officials in order for a Specialist to refuse to accept a contingency order from a customer account will serve to prevent Specialists from arbitrarily rejecting such customer orders, and will thereby help to protect investors and the public interest. In this regard, the Commission would expect the Phlx to monitor this area to assure that orders are not arbitrarily or unfairly being refused. 14 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1988). The Commission finds that the expansion of Phlx Rule 1066(c) to include four additional types of contingency orders is consistent with the Act and the rules thereunder, as well as the rules of other self-regulatory organizations which trade option products. Specifically, the definitions of all-or-none, 15 opening-only-market, 16 and market-on-close 17 orders are consistent with the definitions contained in the rules of other options self-regulatory organizations, all of which rules have been previously approved by the Commission. In addition, although not contained in the rules of other self-regulatory organizations, the ability, or in some cases the responsibility, of Exchange members to submit cancel-replacement orders in appropriate circumstances is set forth in Phlx OFPA A&hyph;7(b), which was previously approved by the Commission. 18 15 See American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') Rule 131(c); Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'') Rule 6.53(i); and New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') Rule 13. See also Phlx OFPA A&hyph;7. 16 See Amex Rule 131(e); CBOE Rule 6.53(l); and NYSE Rule 13. 17 See Amex Rule 131(f) and NYSE Rule 13. 18 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30670 (May 6, 1992), 57 FR 20312 (May 12, 1992) (``Release No. 30670''). OFPA A&hyph;7(b) states that in order to effect a change in the option series of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member shall submit separate cancel and replacement orders to the Specialists. In order to effect a change in the price or volume of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member may submit the appropriate cancel and replacement ticket or tickets to the Specialist. In Release No. 30670, the Commission found that this provision ``served the needs of investors and promotes investor confidence in the quality and integrity of the Phlx's options market by requiring specialists to respond promptly to cancellation instructions and to indicate immediately that the cancellation was accepted or that the cancellation was too late, and therefore, that the order was executed.'' In addition, the Commission found that the provision ``will improve the execution of customer orders by providing an efficient procedure for submitting changes in the terms of an order on the specialist's book.'' Id. The Commission also finds that the proposed amendments to the definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders in Rule 1066(c) merely clarify the current definitions of those terms, and therefore present no new regulatory issues. The Commission also finds that the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2's fine schedule to increase the penalties for infractions thereof will continue to provide a fair and effective means to enforce compliance with the provisions and thereby promote just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors and the public interest. Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register. Currently, OFPA A&hyph;2(ii) permits specialists to accept spread, straddle, or combination orders, as those terms are defined in Phlx Rule 1066(d), (g) and (h), respectively with the express approval of one Floor Official. However, because such orders are discretionary in nature, and Section 11(a) of the Act 19 prohibits specialists from accepting discretionary orders, the Phlx has amended OFPA A&hyph;2 to prohibit specialists from accepting such orders, regardless of Floor Official approval. Thus, the purpose of Amendment No. 4 is merely to conform OFPA A&hyph;2 with the requirements and prohibitions of the Act, and necessarily serves to promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 4. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 4 on an accelerated basis. 19 15 U.S.C. 78k(a). Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory orgainzation. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;03, and should be submitted by October 24, 1994. It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 20 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;92&hyph;03), as amended, is approved. 20 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 21 21 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
