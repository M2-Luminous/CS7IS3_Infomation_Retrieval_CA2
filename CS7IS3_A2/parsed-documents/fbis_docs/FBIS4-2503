The work of price inspection departments has won praise from all sectors of society and the public. The party and government have fully affirmed and highly valued their work. Price inspection departments are law-enforcement administrative departments of the government, and price inspectors exercise their functions on behalf of the state. All enterprises and individuals engaged in production or business and administrative units or institutions that charge fees are subject to inspection without exception. Taken together, the overwhelming majority of units and individuals that are subject to inspections are supportive of and cooperative toward price inspections. There are, however, indeed a handful of units and individuals -- privately run enterprises and self-employed industrial and commercial entities in particular -- who interfere with, obstruct, or even refuse to be inspected. Some even threaten, abuse, mob, and beat up inspectors. The incident in Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, in which price inspectors were mobbed and beaten up shows how lacking is awareness of the law among this handful of units and individuals. Some people declare that because prices have been deregulated, they are free to set their own prices, free to cheat and hustle consumers by any means, and free from government supervision and price inspection. They are greatly mistaken. Obstructing price inspectors from carrying out their official duties is a rather prominent problem today. Governments and departments concerned at all levels must take it seriously and pay close attention. Article 34 of the "Provisions of the People's Republic of China Concerning Price Inspection" provides: When a party refuses to permit or obstructs price inspectors from carrying out their duties according to the law, he shall be punished by a public security department pursuant to the provisions of the "Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order of the People's Republic of China"; in cases of gross violation or when a crime has resulted, the judicial department shall investigate the party's criminal responsibility according to the law. Governments and departments concerned at all levels must take immediate, effective action to protect the personal safety of price inspectors and ensure the smooth progress of the general price inspection.
