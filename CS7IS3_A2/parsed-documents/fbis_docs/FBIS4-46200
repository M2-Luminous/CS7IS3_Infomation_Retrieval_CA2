On 16 May, security guards discovered a plastic bag containing a time bomb between the doors of a shop of the British firm Littlewoods in Tukhachevskiy Avenue. The alarm hand connected with the firing device and four kilograms of TNT pointed at eight o'clock. Had the explosive device gone off, the shop would have been blown to pieces. The Prince of Wales did visit Littlewoods, but at another time.
