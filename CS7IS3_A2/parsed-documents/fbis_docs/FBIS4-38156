However, our belief was in vain, because the Israeli report on the massacre of the age was received with complete silence. This despite the fact that the report contains false allegations and distorted facts. It also defends the crime of the settler, who committed the crime through cooperation with members of the army, by saying that he was insane when he carried out the act. The Israeli government is not innocent of the crime in which scores of innocent children and old men were killed. It was able, as usual, through its arrogance, to reverse facts and to charge people, who are without conscience or ethics, with writing a report which is far away from reality. Meanwhile, the Arab capitals received this report with silence, as if they approve of its contents. Arab silence over Israeli crimes will encourage the Rabin government not only to continue its crimes but also to impose whatever it wants in the peace process. Thus, it will achieve its ambitions and reach -- through the peace which it will impose by deception -- what it failed to reach in its wars with the Arabs. The Arabs must place at the top of their priorities in the peace process ending the Israeli crimes and the Israeli strategy which is based on aggression and expansion. These two items are as important as restoring the usurped Arab rights and respecting the rights of others. The objective of establishing a lasting, just, and comprehensive peace should include the conditions that will enable the coming generations to live in security and stability. Otherwise, talk about peace will be nonsense and media uproar, which has no basis on the ground.
