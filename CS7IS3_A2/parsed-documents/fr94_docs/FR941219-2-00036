SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute a total of $10,700,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into with Murphy on July 15, 1994. These funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations that were in effect from August 19, 1973, through January 28, 1981. The OHA has proposed to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27,899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the volume of petroleum products they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. Dated: December 12, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
