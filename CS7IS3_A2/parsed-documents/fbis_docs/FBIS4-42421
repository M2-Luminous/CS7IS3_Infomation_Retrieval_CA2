Net borrowing will be 35 billion schillings higher than without joining the EU. Has the course of budget recovery thus failed? [Lacina] I have great doubts about this figure. Of course there will initially be a higher burden on the budget, but I will certainly not accept that everything that is related to EU accession will be classified as new burden. A large part of it, for example in the sphere of subsidies for agricultural sector, industry, and labor has to be financed through shifting funds: Those industries that will benefit strongly will have to make a solidarity contribution in favor of those that are exposed to major difficulties. All in all, the crucial thing is the alternative, and that is not joining the EU. [Grubelnik] What does that mean for Austria? [Lacina] We are in the middle of a phase of upswing and are benefiting from an investment drive, because people are already expecting EU membership. If this expectation is thwarted, then it will mean insecurity and a flagging economy. Last year, we were able to experience dramatically the effects of low economic growth on the budget when our deficit jumped up 34 billion schillings over the draft budget. I much prefer a higher burden as a result of an offensive strategy to one that is caused by a slump in the economy. [Grubelnik] Yet, the Wifo has not exactly predicted thrilling results for the economy as a result of our accession to the EU: The economic research experts expect an accumulated additional growth of 2.8 percent up to the year 2000. [Lacina] That is not the point. The point is what will happen if we do not join the EU. Then businesses will simply reduce investment. In the event of unemployment, the EU will set up trade barriers against third countries and discriminate against them. The Wifo simply did not work out the costs of non-membership, and these costs would be very high. [Grubelnik] It is indisputable that EU membership would produce an additional burden on the budget. Under the motto of "What happens if nothing happens," the Wifo has predicted the net deficit to explode to 5.2 percent in 1995, while debt would skyrocket from the current 56 percent of GDP to 70 percent. Would we still be able to cope with that? [Lacina] I am used to counteract predictions with the appropriate measures, which is what we are going to do this time, too. We will mainly look at the spending side, because we do not want to stiffle growth with higher taxes. Besides, these contributions cannot be financed exclusively by the Federal Government alone, but the provinces and communities will also have to contribute. All of Austria is going to join, not just the Federal Government. This will require tough negotiations for financial equalization. Since we managed to finance the main bell in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral with the help of the provinces [after World War II], we might be able to make such a national effort together with regard to the EU. [Grubelnik] Will there be massive privatization campaigns to finance the extraordinary burdens? [Lacina] Privatization revenues are not permanent revenues, even though they can help prevent short-term budget shocks, which is what we have done time and again in the various stages of the tax reform. We still have certain reserves. [Grubelnik] Yet, sooner or later the VAT [value-added tax] rates, which are 5 percent lower in Germany, will have to be cut. This will cost the budget another 20 billion schillings per year. [Lacina] The VAT rates are lower in Germany, while in Italy they are about the same. There is also a 5-percent difference with Denmark, but there these rates are higher. Denmark also shares a border with Germany and can afford higher VAT rates. We will look at the matter from the point of view of competition policy. Anyway, I receive proposals for new taxes on a daily basis, and I might feel like introducing one or the other and cut the VAT. [Grubelnik] All in all, Austrian farmers will get 117 billion schillings in compensation payment for losses suffered from EU entry, about half of which will be provided from the Austrian budget, the remainder from the EU. Has the farmers's support for EU entry been bought? [Lacina] Distributed over a period of four years, the 117 billion schillings are about the same as what the farming sector has received in direct and indirect subsidies so far, namely 28-30 billion schillings per year. Some of this money came from subsidies from the state budget, some from artificially high prices to be paid for by the consumers. Without EU membership, the farmers would also have to put up with lower agricultural prices as a result of the GATT agreement that was adopted last December -- but without getting full compensation. I do not rule out that some farmers, for example those in Alpine regions, may be better off as a result of EU accession.
