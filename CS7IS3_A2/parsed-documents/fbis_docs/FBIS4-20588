The new hard alloys consist of a MO[.sub]2[/]NiB[.sub]2[/] type boride as a hard phase and a nickel base binder alloyed with Cr, Mo and other elements, both of which are formed by a boride forming reaction during liquid phase sintering. Mechanical properties and microstructure of the new hard alloys were studied by using Ni-6wt%B-58.6wt%Mo-Xwt%Cr model alloys. Microstructure of the new hard alloys considerably affected mechanical properties of those. The maximum transverse rupture strength (TRS) of 2.3 GPa is obtained at lOwt%Cr content. Crystal structure of a MO[.sub]2[/]NiB[.sub]2[/] type boride changes from the orthorhombic M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] (M:Metal) at Owt%Cr content to the tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] at lOwt%Cr content. High TRS value at lOwt%Cr is attributed to the formation of the tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride. The Rietveld structure analysis of X-ray powder diffraction data of the borides resulted that the orthorhombic M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride classified in space group D[.sup]25[/][.sub]2h[/]-I[.sub]mmm[/], which is similar to the result of the orthorhombic W[.sub]2[/]CoB[.sub]2[/] type boride,[.sup]2[/] and the, tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride in space group D[.sup]5[/][.sub]4h[/]-P [.sub]4/mbm[/]. It is concluded that Cr addition causes crystal structural change of boride from orthorhombic to tetragonal M[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] type boride, and improves mechanical properties of the new hard alloys. The result of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the new hard alloys will be reported. References 1. M. Kornai, Y. Yamasaki, K. Takagi, and T.
