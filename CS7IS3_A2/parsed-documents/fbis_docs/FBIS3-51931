Our correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, reports: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Beauliere] The representatives of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast met with the press on 25 January to explain to the population what they discussed and adopted in the 18 to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince. The group called for a mobilization of Southeast citizens to support the resolution that emerged from the congress. For Mr. Ducles Louis, member of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast, the resolution of the congress will allow a solution to the crisis that the country has been facing for 28 months. The committee of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast is sending invitations throughout the region for people to participate in the installation of the Government of Public Security. [Louis] [Words indistinct] most likely that we will have to install within the next 48 hours. Thus, our tasks right now in the Southeast... [changes thought] We left Port-au-Prince with the project of coordinating the bureau there, and we returned home to call for mobilization to Port-au-Prince for the installation of the Government of Public Security. [end recording] [Beauliere] The resolution of the Congress for National Salvation did not get the approval of all political sectors in Jacmel. Some groups do not agree because not all the sectors are represented within that government. Others stated that they did not have enough information on the decision: Will it allow the embargo to be lifted and national reconciliation to take place? The formation of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast and formation of the delegation representing the Southeast in the 18 to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince created great division within the sector always opposed to Father Aristide. They criticize one another over the people chosen to represent Jacmel in this congress. They think those choices were made in camera for personal interests. This has been Pierre Nazon Beauliere in Jacmel for Radio Metropole. [end recording]
