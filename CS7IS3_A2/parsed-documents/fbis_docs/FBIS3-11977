(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 March 94) Carles has requested the national government "to immediately suspend the renegotiation of the foreign debt with international banks, as it is unadvisable and extemporaneous," adding the government "should concentrate all of its efforts until September on attaining free elections which will pave the way for the new president and his team." (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 24 March 94 p 2A) Should she win the 8 May elections, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfista Party (PA) presidential candidate, has promised she would revise the minimum wage. De Gruber announced her intention after visiting several communities throughout the country where she found there is economic stagnation due to an increase in basic market products. De Gruber said: "Our government program establishes, after assuming the Presidency on 1 September, that we will conduct an in-depth and prompt study on the minimum wage. We must increase the minimum wage." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 17 March 94) In statements to the newscast "Telemetro Reports," de Gruber has admitted that political forces have become polarized between the PRD and the PA. Given this situation, de Gruber reiterated her call to all political parties to form one single political coalition behind the PA so as to confront the PRD. De Gruber asked other candidates to decline their candidacies in her favor. Regarding electoral violence, de Gruber has said she hopes violence could be averted.

Members of the National Consensus Alliance, comprised by the Solidarity and National Unity Mission, have visited the Central Avenue area. Lewis Galindo said he does not favor a civic alliance. Galindo said: "The people are beginning to realize that in the fights between the candidates, we are the only ones who can attain the requisite national unity to fight poverty."

(Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 19 March 94 p 3A) A 500-word article by Marco Julio de Obaldia states the PRD has one-third of the people's vote, "and this will be evident on 8 May." De Obaldia writes "these votes were cultivated throughout 21 years," and most of the voters feel "they cannot go wrong by voting for the PRD." In conclusion, the writer urges the people to forget voting for the party of their choice, rather, to vote for the civic candidate who has "the greatest chance of winning," the only way to defeat the PRD candidate.
