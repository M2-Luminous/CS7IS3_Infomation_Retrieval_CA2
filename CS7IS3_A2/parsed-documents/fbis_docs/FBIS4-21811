Despite the fact that the wave of violence in Brandenburg, which reached its climax at the end of 1992, has abated, right-wing extremism remains a central challenge to state and society. This was stressed by Interior Minister Alwin Ziel (Social Democratic Party of Germany) on the occasion of presenting the 1993 Constitutional Protection Report. The paper provides detailed information about the activities and scope of political extremism as well as on the role and structure of the Constitutional Protection Office in Brandenburg, which is still in the process of being established. It is the first report of this kind that has been presented so far. Combating right-wing extremism will characterize the work of the coming years, Wolfgang Pfaff, head of the Brandenburg Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said. One needs long-term measures, which must also nip the problem in the bud by means of an appropriate youth and social policy. With this the impetus of the moment could be reduced. Above all the so-called Central German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ) continues to be the target of all efforts. The number of members is given as 100, with an upward trend. The organization openly picks up the usual topics of Nazi propaganda, the Constitutional Protection Report says. They are committed to Hitler's person and ``work.'' Anti-Semitic instigation and the denial of the holocaust are evidence of the cynical racism that is cultivated in the FMJ. Constitutional Protection also watches increasingly the development of left-wing extremism. Since Berlin is so close, it is also encroaching on Brandenburg, which is proved by the militant squatters' scene in Potsdam, Pfaff said. Therefore, the personnel dealing with leftist violence in his office will now be increased, he said. At the moment, there are hardly any activities by the Red Army Faction (RAF). The RAF has other priorities, but that might change very quickly. Pfaff said that there are about 500 rightist Republikaner in Brandenburg. In the past their activities were rather limited because of controversies among the leaders. However, there are signs that the Republikaner will gain in importance in the 1994 election year. According to Pfaff, ``in the surroundings'' of right-wing extremist organizations there are also members that are moving toward the Republikaner. Nevertheless, the Republikaner cannot necessarily be considered as a collection pond of the rightist scene, because they are taking great care not to accept ``real neo-Nazis'' into their ranks.
