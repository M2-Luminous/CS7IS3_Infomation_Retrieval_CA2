Commenting on Gen. Rose's decision that humanitarian convoys as of Monday move through that war-shattered former Yugoslav republic with armed escort and without the prior consent of the warring parties, Gen. Milovanovic said that nothing had changed as far as the Serbs are concerned and that aid and other convoys would in the future continue to need Serb consent to pass through Bosnian Serb territory. "Otherwise, we shall prevent their movement, at arms if necessary," Milovanovic told TANJUG late on Sunday. Bosnian Serbs will not permit humanitarian convoys to move through their territory without their permission and control, because the Bosnian Serb army had on several occasions found the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to be smuggling arms and ammunition for the Moslems. Milovanovic said also that, if necessary, the Serb side would use force to prevent the reopening of Sarajevo's bridge, announced for noon on Monday. He explained that the bridge could be reopened only in consultations between the Serbs and Moslems with the mediation of U.N. special envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. Milovanovic said that all convoys, especially aid convoys, had always been safe only in Serb territory. By contrast, those travelling through Moslem and Croat territories have frequently been attacked, with dozens of relief aid workers killed and wounded. Incidents of this kind have never been recorded in Serb territory. However, the announced change in the regimen of the movement of humanitarian convoys puts an equation mark between the Serbs and the other two warring nations. The attitude of the Moslem and Croat sides to humanitarian convoys is evident from countless incidents, such as the downing of an Italian transporter over Jablanica, the murder of a Danish driver at Travnik, the murder of a British aid worker and the wounding of two others at Zenica, etc. More recently, an UNPROFOR inquiry has showed that Moslem forces wounded five Swedish peacekeepers near Kakanj on Tuesday, an incident that was originally blamed on the Serbs, in the absence of all proof, with the former UNPROFOR Chief of Staff in Bosnia-Herzegovina General Angus Ramsay going so far as to call for NATO air strikes against the Serbs. A day later, British U.N. troops said they had bombed out two Croat bunkers at Gornji Vakuf, which had been used to attack two U.N. aid convoys.
