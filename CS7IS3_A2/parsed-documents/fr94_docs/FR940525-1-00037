FR940525-1-00037 FR940525-1-00007 Financial standby letters of credit are distinguished from loan commitments (discussed below) in that standbys are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument (direct credit substitute). Performance standby letters of credit (performance bonds) are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) fails to perform some other contractual non-financial obligation. The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus, any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an irrevocable obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer fails to repay an outstanding debt obligation or fails to perform a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby letter of credit or a performance standby. A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar clause) of the bank to fund its customer in the normal course of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment. Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages, is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the institution's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount of total capital that must be maintained against the transaction is equal to the maximum amount of possible loss under the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term commitments without direct recourse) are defined in the instructions to the commercial bank Call Report and for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5 of this appendix A. Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward forward deposits placed, 45 and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward foreign exchange contracts. 45 Forward forward deposits accepted are treated as interest rate contracts. Securities lent by a bank are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a bank, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively, a bank lends its own securities, or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor, to any collateral delivered to the lending bank, or, if applicable, to the independent custodian acting on the lender's behalf. Where a bank is acting as agent for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the bank, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit in the bank for purposes of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification is limited to no more than the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer. * * * * * PART 225_BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL (REGULATION Y) 3.

Banking organizations may engage in activities_such as securitizing pools of assets, selling single assets, and entering into certain off-balance sheet transactions_that result in the provision of a credit enhancement in the form of a recourse arrangement or a direct credit substitute. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes. Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset a banking organization has transferred that is in excess of the banking organization's pro rata share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from (a) a default of principal or interest or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the banking organization's pro rata share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities, or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced.
