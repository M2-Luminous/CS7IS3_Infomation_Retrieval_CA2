Zmachinskiy: "On Subunit Tactics"] [Text] Today we are becoming witnesses to major changes in the international situation and in the country's domestic and foreign policies. The peace-loving course taken by Russia in recent years has practically reduced to naught the danger of the emergence of nuclear missile war. But it is perhaps premature to arrive at the conclusion that no one and nothing threatens Russian statehood. (Unfortunately, some politicians are attempting to convince people of that in the mass media). It is impossible to ignore the fact that combat operations are becoming increasingly widespread in the near abroad and also everything is not peaceful in the far abroad. Battles of "local significance" are being conducted, as a rule, by small armed detachments and groups, and not always skillfully from the point of view of tactics. Hence the increase of unwarranted losses. Officers who have completed higher military schools and academies are leading compulsory service personnel who have completed their military obligation and on the whole well-trained guerrillas. All of this permits us to doubt to a certain extent the correctness of previously solid approaches to training people and suggests the thought on the need to examine certain views that affect the tactics of small subunits and their comprehension. This question appears to be fundamental first of all because the result of a small subunit battle directly impacts the combat operations of a larger tactical echelon on which the course and outcome of an operation frequently depend. Furthermore, the practitioners -- the soldiers and officers, through whose hands victory is attained, first of all pay for the theorists' mistakes. Any science is in constant development. As a component of military science (military art), tactics are also modified from time to time. What specific features in small subunit operational tactics have emerged today? There are several of them. I will begin with the advisability, in my view, of imparting a somewhat different characterization to the opposing side. While studying tactics as an academic discipline, we perceived and perceive the enemy in the form of a specific organic structure with definite (known beforehand) personnel strength, weapons, combat tactics, standards, etc. However, in our time, this stereotype is nothing other than harm and we cannot bear it. Armed conflicts are conducted according to other "laws". Consequently, it makes sense to present the enemy numerically. That is, based upon the number of opposing personnel and armored targets, weapons emplacements and so forth. And it is hardly worthwhile to delve into the details of the opposing side's organic structure or, say, its unit affiliation while accomplishing a training or actual combat mission on the squad, platoon or company scale. It seems to me that the main thing here is knowledge of the actual enemy and his capabilities that have been obtained based upon intelligence data. The typical diversity of the enemy and therefore, the unpredictability of his operations, increases the role of the latter. We can encounter a completely unfamiliar structure and even its absence (as it occurred in Afghanistan) instead of theoretically known enemy formations in one-on-one combat with spontaneously created detachments and groups. Formerly, subunit combat capabilities were examined in detail when studying their tactics. Now, I think, we need to pay attention to combat requirements on a par with them. What does that signify? First of all the need to establish the number of targets that are subject to destruction to attain success in battle. For example, on an offensive -- 100% of the weapons that are preventing us from seizing the target of the attack. On defense -- no less than 50% of the attackers' personnel and weapons. As for the combat missions (their parameters) and forming up, obviously, the time has come to more precisely define certain provisions of the Field Manual. By way of illustration, the currently legitimized method of forming up the defending troops with the presence of large gaps in them causes bewilderment. You won't manage to reliably cover gaps between subunits at night, under conditions of poor visibility, and in a number of cases during the day. A battle most often carries over onto broken terrain and soldiers and weapons are located in trenches, that is, practically on the surface of the earth. Details of the relief, vegetation, ground features, dust and smoke substantially impede surveillance and the conduct of aimed fire. As events in the Persian Gulf demonstrated, it is already impossible to consider various types of impediments to be impenetrable barriers. In my opinion, subunits that are operating according to today's standards are doomed to defeat from the beginning. How should we act? We most likely need to return to the experience of the concluding stage of the Great Patriotic War. The standards that were applied at that time appeared as a result of painstaking analysis of a multitude of previous battles and engagements. We can say that they became the essence of the maturity of our tactics and ultimately were one of the main factors in the attainment of victory over the enemy. It is probably no accident that the leading war colleges of the entire world have been intently studying the experience of those years until now. A few words about the motorized rifle squad. In the existing organic structure, it is actually incapable of operating in a combat situation with adequate effectiveness. The fact is that we cannot even think about similar formations that previously existed and that currently exist in a number of foreign armies without hand-to-hand combat. Practically no one in a motorized rifle squad participates in it. A driver (driver-mechanic), machinegunner (loader-operator), machinegunner, sniper, and an RPG [rocket propelled grenade] man with an assistant are here in secondary and even tertiary roles and are hardly capable of affecting its outcome. Moreover, in the war years it was thought that you needed to have no less than 10 men in the squad line for a successful attack on a front of up to 50 meters. How does the author of these lines see a modern squad? A commander, 10 riflemen with automatic weapons (of them one -- is the assistant RPG man and, possibly, one is the combat vehicle commander, a machinegunner, an RPG man, a sniper, machinegunners (loader-operators), and drivers (driver-mechanics). A total of 18 men and two armored vehicles. In this case, a team of fire support riflemen is drawn in great detail which is extremely important in cases of limited capabilities of artillery and aircraft, and also without joint participation of a tank subunit with the motorized riflemen in a battle. In any case, the emergence of similar situations is not excluded. A squad of that structure is capable of defending itself on a front of 100-150 meters and up to 100 m in depth. In an offensive, the motorized riflemen can operate while located either behind the armored vehicles or ahead of them, or while having one ahead and the other with the fire support group behind the squad line. That is, the movement of BTR's [armored transport vehicles] and BMP's [armored infantry vehicles] will in some ways begin to remind you of the flight of a pair of aircraft -- the flight leader and the wing man which, in my opinion, makes sense. The subunit combat capability calculation methods proposed by the tactics training manuals also need to be made more precise. Let's take as an example the recommended number of bullets expended per meter of front per minute. It is thought that the higher the density of fire the greater the probability of attaining victory. It would seem that everything is correct from the point of view of theory. However, in practice, infantry did not and will not conduct small arms fire against lines or areas. It fires against specifically visible live targets. And the outcome of the battle does not depend on the number of bullets expended but on the number of targets destroyed. Meanwhile, it is easy to calculate combat capabilities if you actually determine the time for conducting aimed fire (while taking into account the training of personnel). Say, in the defense -- from the moment of the appearance of targets until their closure with the forward edge of the battle area and the transition to a hand-to-hand skirmish. Average weapons combat capability coefficients were also not presented in the best manner. For example, they total 0.3-0.4 for an RPG [rocket propelled grenade]. This question is appropriate: Is it true that a tank will not be hit until they assemble 3-4 RPG men together in a subunit? Where do these numbers come from? Perhaps they result from the calculation of the overall combat capabilities of the weapons that are taking part in a battle. And if they don't cause any doubts on one structural level (in a division or regiment), then they don't appear to be very well substantiated on another (in a squad, platoon or company). Here I would say we need another, weightier approach. How are coefficients that are interpreted so unambiguously dangerous? First of all by the reduction of soldiers' confidence in their weapons. Military school graduates in the troops transfer their knowledge to their subordinates who in turn are justified in arriving at the conclusion on the inadequate effectiveness of the weapons assigned to them. Therefore, we need to provide the appropriate explanations when we discuss subunit combat capabilities. I also have to say something about the Ground Forces Field Manual. It was never as large as it is today. The current edition contains many repetitions, some articles and attachments are excessively detailed, and certain inconsistencies are observed with the combat operations regulations of the branches of the armed forces and on the types of combat support, and with other guiding documents. I think that only the primary provisions should be set forth in it and it is better to provide for all the rest in training manuals and regulations. Furthermore, we must simplify the work of commanders of small subunits to the maximum extent possible, reducing their activities to command and control of subordinates in battle to short commands and signals. For example, in an offensive: "Platoon (squad), attack up to some landmark -- FORWARD". In the defense: "Platoon (squad), to some line or other -- ACTION." Of course, personnel must be well trained and know their duties in battle. In conclusion, I will point out that, having set forth my personal point of view, I do not lay claim to the truth in the highest instance. However, I consider it necessary to sometimes examine the established canons of military art from a critical angle. Tactics will only gain from that. COPYRIGHT: VOYENNYY VESTNIK No 12 1993
