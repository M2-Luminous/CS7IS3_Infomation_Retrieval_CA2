Carl Bildt answered the question at a news conference a little while ago as to whether Olof Johansson could be included in a new right-wing government. Bildt said: [Begin recording] [Bildt] You have to ask him that. The political prerequisites in general he should account for; but what he has already shown us is that they are not influenced. He is part of this government [laughs], has been part of this government, the Center Party is still part of this government, and all the political decisions, all the political principles, and the political engagements that the government stands for. But the question should by right be put to Olof and not me. [Correspondent] Do you think that the Center Party could be part of a new right-wing government? [Bildt] The Center Party is in a right-wing government, has been in a right-wing government, and is still in a right-wing government. This resignation is a very strong political statement from the Center Party in an individual matter. It is stronger than what I thought was necessary, but it is clear that it does not change anything in the sense that it was not a surprise. It was not something politically new today in the sense that the Center Party would have revealed a new political attitude. [Correspondent] Prime Minister Bildt was firm that the bridge question did not need anymore preparations, as Olof Johansson has demanded. [Bildt] If I had thought, or the other party leaders, that one or two, or maybe three, or whatever number of extra weeks had brought a solution to this question it is clear that we would have in that case used this extra time. We have used a very long time on this so we could have used a little bit more time, but no one who has heard Olof Johansson express himself in the fundamental bridge question can actually believe that this would have been the case.
