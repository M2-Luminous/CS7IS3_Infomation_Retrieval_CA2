He said LDU must set sensible tasks, avoid giving hollow promises, wage a resolute campaign for national interests and move to prosperity by transforming the country's political and economic systems. He said LDU was a group of 26 independent deputies representing different parts of the country rather than being "an elitist Moscow club". One other LDU leader Irina Khakamada said the faction's name was intended to help form its political image and reflect its determination to merge social and market reforms with a thrust towards the individual rather than talking about the abstract models of a so-called market economy. On the political front, LDU is opposed to the hardliners' call for an early presidential election and prepared instead to back up the idea of a coalition government provided it is committed to further market reforms, democracy and a socially oriented state. LDU will not oppose the government while there is a chance for further constructive reforms, but any government without a social basis and majority in parliament is doomed, its platform says. Among its potential allies, the group has named the Gaydar-led Russia's Choice Party and the Yavlinskiy-led faction though it is ready to cooperate with Women of Russia group and to hold an open dialogue with all pro-democracy movements. At the same time, it says the name of the Zhirinovskiy-led Liberal Democratic Party does not reflect the substance and activity of the LDP leadership which brings nothing but disgrace to Russia. LDU says some support that LDP enjoys on the ground is evidence of a power crisis and lack of coherent political priorities in the country. On the economic front, LDU's priorities include financial stabilization, a 1-3 percent inflation rate in 1994, a sensible budget, a one-off 15-25 percent tax cut to spur up business activity, reduction of the amount and types of taxation and government support for state companies yielding to modernization and work efficiency. In foreign policy, LDU calls for a G-8 with Russian participation and Russia's reunification with Belarus and Ukraine following referendums there. However, LDU is opposed to what it calls "an absurd unification of monetary systems". Fedorov attacked the recent monetary merger between Moscow and Minsk calling the decision incompetent. He said economic integration must follow trade and customs unions as it was done in Western Europe but not start with a monetary union. In his view, unification must take place on all fronts with clear understanding of the purpose and price to be paid for it.
