"The declaration is a party-political act taken in close co-operation with the African National Congress and the SA Communist Party [SACP], both of which have for years nurtured a desire to overthrow the kwaZulu government and destroy the IFP," said an Inkatha statement. The IFP charged State President F W de Klerk had colluded with the ANC and SACP to eliminate all political opposition to the interim constitution. "He (Mr de Klerk) has succumbed to pressure from the Transitional Executive Council to send troops into kwaZulu. (SACP leader) Joe Slovo of 'two down, one to go' fame must be especially pleased," said the statement. The IFP said it was "especially cynical" to declare a state of emergency in the midst of a general election campaign. The party repeated calls for the postponement of the April poll and for a resumption of "genuine" multiparty negotiations.
