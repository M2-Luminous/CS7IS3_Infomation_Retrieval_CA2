This official postponement announced by the host country, Tunisia, does not cancel the Council of Ministers' meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union scheduled for the same day, 5 February, in the Tunisian capital. The decision to postpone the summit, which was taken by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was at the request of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya, in view of the current developments on the Mauritanian political scene, resulting from the recent municipal elections in that country. This Mauritanian request is not the only reason why the summit was postponed, because according to the same source, King Hassan II [of Morocco] was going to be represented at this summit by an envoy. Moreover, Mr. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has also announced that he will not be attending the summit proceedings. Algeria, which took over the chairmanship of the union on 1 January 1994, had prepared the proceedings of this summit [as heard] and [words indistinct] supported Tunisia's request for a postponement.
