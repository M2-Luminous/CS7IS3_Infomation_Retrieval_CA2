Bobrov had been discontinued. In issue No. 45 of 11 March 1994 our newspaper had written an article on this case, entitled "Scene of Crime -- Barracks." That is why our reporter was invited to attend the session. General Major Volodymyr Melnyk, Ukraine's deputy prosecutor general, kept asking his subordinates: "Who discontinued the hearing of this case? On what grounds?" In response to this, the participants portrayed the criminal situation in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the tough situation of military prosecutorial bodies in such a way that it was hard to believe this was true. This prompted a newspaper reporter to conduct an interview with the deputy prosecutor general. [Cherkas] Are numerous violations of the law really flourishing in the Ukrainian Army? [Melnyk] Everything that you heard at the session is true. Violations of accepted norms in interpersonal relations, ultra vires acts, dodging of military service, embezzlements, thefts of military equipment and property have recently become commonplace. For instance in 1993, the number of violations of statute provisions that regulate relations between servicemen increased by 19 times in general. In particular, in Defense Ministry troops the growth rate was 34 percent. Soldiers are often "educated" by means of battery; the hazing of conscripts reigns in many military units; order is built on the "punch the mug" principle. The number of cases of battery increased by more than 70 percent. Do you understand what this means? This is mass bashing! Here is an example. At the beginning of March, six sergeants from the Chernihiv garrison were brought before the court. They had been drunk and had beaten up their 66 subordinates so severely that one of the soldiers died. This had been done right in front of the company duty officer who had done nothing to calm down the drunkards. On 16 March, a "senior" soldier and a conscript quarrelled about lack of bread. The "senior" hit the newcomer on the chest four times; the latter fell down and never got up. He died for a piece of bread! Similar facts of violating the regulations of statutory interpersonal relations have lately occurred in Sevastopol, Ivano- Frankivsk, and some other military garrisons. Speaking in general, we should state with alarm that in January-February the rate of this crime has increased by 14 percent in all of Ukraine's military formations, and by 37 percent in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. There is another alarming trend: The suicide rate in the Army is increasing. In 1993, 123 servicemen killed themselves. Over the first two months of 1994, there were 24 such cases. The number of cases of draft-dodging has also grown -- desertion, going AWOL, and so on. Last year, more than 3,000 such crimes were committed. This year, there have been 400 of them. Almost 2,000 violators are still on the run. While hiding, they exacerbate criminal situations and often commit heinous crimes. Last year, 414 such cases were disclosed. Unfortunately, thefts of arms and military property have become more commonplace in the Army. Not long ago, 15 Kalashnikov assault rifles and 15 Makarov pistols were stolen from one of the units in the Kharkiv garrison. Six assault rifles and a machine gun with ammunition have been stolen from a coast guard unit in Yevpatoriya. It is startling that the storage of weapons and property is not organized in an appropriate manner. Last year, losses caused by mismanagement, embezzlements, and thefts cost the state a fortune -- 70 billion karbovantsi. This sum includes the 65 billion caused by the disappearance of fuel and lubricants. Gasoline, kerosene, lubricants, and diesel fuel are pumped into Army reservoirs, and only God knows where they vanish. We have lately observed the alarming phenomenon of Mafia elements penetrating into the Army circles. Some time ago, profiteers in uniforms were booked in one of the units in the Odessa military district. Those were military financiers who had made agreements with local dealers and used Army assets -- hundreds of millions karbovantsi -- for trading. Here is another example: In July 1993, the Defense Ministry Directorate for Material Supplies signed an agreement with a small commercial enterprise for the shipping of undershirts and transferred 5.6 billion karbovantsi to the dealers. Soldiers never saw the undershirts, while the smart dealers paid back the money five months later, this time significantly devaluated. [Cherkas] Regarding this, let me ask you a hackneyed question: What is the prosecutor doing? At the session that you have just conducted, military prosecutors maintained that they would not be able to continue work under the current circumstances. [Melnyk] Their stories are absolutely true. The point is that the former chiefs of Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office virtually destroyed the existing system of military prosecution, claiming that the Army did not need it. Although genuine legal experts opposed this, their voices were ignored. For example, General Major of Legal Service V. Melnychuk, military prosecutor of the Western region, appealed to various state institutions but nobody paid any attention. As a result of this, the most experienced military lawyers abandoned the Army for other legal bodies. We found ourselves, so to say, back where we started. Although the military prosecutor's service has been legalized again, it is to be comprised of 484 specialists, while as of today, we have only 300. Eighty eight of these people are investigators, charged with the following primary tasks: Supervision over the observance of Ukrainian laws by bodies of command, military formations, combined units, units, and subunits, establishments, and military educational institutions, the officials of the Armed Forces, the Border Troops, the National Guard, the Department of State Protection, the Security Service, and other military formations in Ukraine. Can you imagine the scope of their responsibilities? The monthly workload of a military investigator is five times the volume of the workload of a territorial [civil] investigator. And you are asking what military prosecutors are doing. From morning until evening, and often at night these people hardly have time to breathe. Getting to the venue to carry out an investigation is another problem, because there is either no car or no gasoline. Military lawyers continuously apply for termination of Army service. We have no one to replace these people -- there is not a single educational institution in Ukraine training specialists for military prosecution. Still, even under these conditions people work and persistently uphold legality and order in the young Army of sovereign Ukraine. In 1993, 36 percent more criminal cases were investigated and sent to courts than in 1992. Purposeful preventive activities are being carried out in the Army. Taking advantage of the occasion, I want to address servicemen's parents by means of the Supreme Council newspaper [HOLOS UKRAYINY]: The military prosecutor's service will do everything in its power to ensure their sons' legal protection. At the same time, I appeal to all the employees of military prosecutor offices to step up legal supervision in every way regardless of the current tough situation, to firmly keep watch over the protection of our state laws. [Cherkas] You should agree that our conversation with Ukraine's deputy general prosecutor was not very optimistic. The cited facts from servicemen's lives portray a miserable picture. I am reading the HOLOS UKRAYINY article "Scene of Crime -- Barracks" dealing with the same issues. Perhaps, the writer of the article did not look into the current situation of the military prosecution attentively enough and his criticism of the "bureaucrats in prosecutor chairs" is not quite balanced. As it appears from the cited facts, military lawyers do not twiddle their thumbs. The criminal situation in the troops is indeed horrendous. In my opinion, prosecutorial supervision alone is not enough. Apparently the education and sociopsychological services of the Defense Ministry and other military formations fall short of their task. We probably need distinctly coordinated activities of the chiefs of all the military services to curb the reign of the violators of the law; and to persistently ensure the triumph of the military statutes and the military oath. The president of Ukraine, who is commander in chief of the Armed Forces should also put in his weighty word in this regard. Crimes are crimes also in the Army.
