This is the employment proportion set preliminarily by the Chinese Government for overseas personnel by the year 2000, according to Wang Dongyan, a senior official with the State Labor Ministry. According to the official, China will balance and readjust the total number of overseas personnel employed in various regions in light of the economic development and the labor supply and demand in various localities. He mentioned the necessity of strictly limiting the employment of non-technical personnel and other ordinary laborers from overseas, for China is very populous and has huge redundant labor resources. The labor official noted that only those with special skills and managerial personnel who are in short demand in China can be employed. On no account should localities exceed the employment quota set by the government. The state's labor departments will also decide on the list of industries and types of work which overseas personnel are allowed to take on. The official stressed that overseas personnel should be banned from employment in industries and departments which concern national defense as well as national security. In addition, the official said, overseas employees should get "employment permits for overseas personnel" before being allowed to settle in China.
