FR941102-1-00045 FR941102-1-00008 40 CFR Parts 63 and 70 [ADR&hyph;FRL&hyph;5100&hyph;6] Peer Review of the Proposed Section 112(g) Hazard Ranking; Document; Open Meeting AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of meeting of the peer reviewers. summary: Notice is hereby given that a meeting of the peer reviewers of the proposed hazard ranking document of section 112(g) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (1990 Amendments) will be held. dates: November 18, 1994. The meeting will be from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on November 18 and is open to the public. addresses: EPA's Office of Administration Auditorium, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. supplementary information: The main purpose of this meeting is to allow the public to give comment to the peer reviewers on the proposed hazard ranking technical support document which describes the EPA's approach to relatively rank the 189 Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) listed in the 1990 Amendments. The section 112(g) rulemaking was proposed April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15504). Copies of the technical support document are available via the Technology Transfer Network [a network of electronic bulletin boards developed and operated by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, phone (919) 541&hyph;5384] or by contacting the EPA office of Air and Radiation Docket [Docket # A&hyph;91&hyph;64, phone (202) 260&hyph;7548]. The designated federal official for the meeting will be Mr. Robert Kellam. Anyone wishing to make an oral presentation at the meeting should contact Dr. Jane Caldwell (U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Emission Standards Division, Maildrop 13, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711 (919) 541&hyph;0328 Fax: (919) 541&hyph;4028) by November 15, 1994. In general each individual or group making an oral presentation will be limited to fifteen minutes but the time allowed will be dependent on the number of speakers. Seating at the meeting will be on a first come first serve basis. Section 112 of the 1990 Amendments establishes a control technology-based program to reduce stationary source emissions of HAP. In section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, the 189 HAP are defined as hazardous for the purposes of regulation. Section 112(g) requires control technology reviews for new, modified and reconstructed major sources of these pollutants. Increases in hazardous air pollution emissions from existing major sources are not considered a modification if they can be offset by equal or greater decreases in HAP deemed ``more hazardous''. Furthermore, the HAP ``with no safety threshold of exposure'' may only be offset by other such ``nonthreshold'' pollutants. Therefore, threshold and nonthreshold pollutants must be identified and are subject to offsetting restrictions. The proposed section 112(g) rulemaking contains the EPA's guidance that identifies the relative hazard to human health of these hazardous pollutants and application of that characterization for determining allowing offsets. Dated: October 27, 1994. Richard D. Wilson, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27171; Filed 11&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
