Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi Haotian, and other delegates spoke during their respective groups' examination of Premier Li Peng's "Govenment Work Report." Central Military Commission's Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen said as Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" has greatly inspired the military, set forth clear tasks and demands regarding the issue of strengthening the modernization construction of national defense, the army will resolutely implement it. Consolidating the national defense, resisting aggression, defending the motherland, safeguarding the results of the peaceful labor of the people, are the sacred duty and responsibility that the constitution has entrusted upon our Army. Under the new situation of reform and opening up, the PLA bears a great responsibility to defend the state security and maintain social stability. Only by building a strong and powerful Army which is under the absolute leadership of the party, loyal to the motherland and the people, can our country achieve security and stability, can our country be assured of a smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. After reviewing the achievements in Army construction last year, Zhang Zhen said our army is politically firm, resolutely listens to the party, and can be trusted absolutely by the party and the people. In the new year, our Army will, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Thought on building the Army in the new period, in line with the general demands for "political qualification, perfect operational skill, fine working style, strict discipline, and an effective logistic guarantee" proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin, do a further good job in the revolution, modernization, and regularization of Army construction, and fulfill well the tasks entrusted by the party and the people under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core. Zhang Zhen said to do a good job on Army construction, it is first of all necessary to conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the thinking of the Army's commanders. It is necessary to increase the study of new and high technology; raise the Army's combat capability in modern conditions; implement a policy of strict Army management; strictly enforce rules and regulations; manage troop units well; foster the excellent work style of strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions; and establish a good image for the people's soldiers. He also expressed the hope of again giving play to the role of militiamen and reserve forces in maintaining social order and social stability. Delegate Chi Haotian, who is a State Councillor and Defense Minister, spoke at the group meeting. He said practice in China's 15 years of reform, opening up, and economic construction has demonstrated that reform is the strong impetus for propelling social development. The only way out to solve the deep-rooted contradictions and problems in the current national economy lies in deepening reform. We should not waver in the least to make Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics a guide and support the state in accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic system. Our Army is the people's army led by the party. In this crucial period in which the state is accelerating the pace of reform, it is necessary to firmly keep in mind President Jiang Zemin's instruction that "revolutionary soldiers should hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism"; to assume responsibility for serving the interests of the party and the people; to serve the overall situation of economic construction; to try our best in doing a good job in national defense construction; and to create a safe and reliable environment to carry out reform smoothly and develop the economy for the state. Chi Haotian said a strong consciousness about national defense is the inspiration for millions of people to care for and support national defense. First of all, the notion of "if there is no Army, there will be no security, and if there is no Army, there will be no stability" must be firmly implanted in the minds of cadres at all levels. We must rely on the force of the party, the government, the military, and society, make regular use of the means of news dissemination, publishing, film-making, and television production to conduct national defense education among the masses, so that the positive effects of national defense education will take root in the minds of the people. We should also attach great importance to the building of a legal system for national defense and persist in giving equal importance to legislation and enforcement of the law. It is necessary to vigorously promote reform, enhance the building of reserve forces, and make the building of reserve forces adapt to the new situation. This afternoon, delegates from the PLA showed great enthusiasm in speaking out at group discussions. Delegate Xu Huizi said that since the new blueprint has been mapped out and the state's major policies and principles decided, the key lies in their implementation. We must mobilize the initiative and creativity of comrades of the whole party and people in the nation to the greatest extent, gather the people's cohesive force, rouse people to rise with force and spirit, and link our army's construction with the state's economic construction and with the overall situation of national reform. A strong economy will improve the military's outlook and successful reform will bring about a strong national defense. We must subordinate ourselves to the overall situation, support reform, and contribute to the establishment of a socialist market economy. Delegate Xu Xin said all levels of party organizations should enhance the education of party members and leading cadres, train hundreds of thousands of upright and good communist party members, display an exemplary role in reform, opening up, and modernization construction. Delegates Yang Huaiqing, Mao Bingxiang, Yang Hong, and others from the Navy also spoke at the group discussions. They urged enhancement of the Navy's construction and called on the Navy to genuinely assume the heavy historical responsibility of reform, opening up, modernization construction, and to provide a security guarantee on the sea.
