[passage omitted] Today, General Bizimungu, the chief of staff of the Rwandan Army, warned the United Nations against intervention in Rwanda, which would, he said, be comparable to that conducted in Somalia, where the UN peacekeeping troops killed and were killed, end of quote. I would prefer the matter to be carefully examined, added Mr. Bizimungu, expressing the hope that the United Nations would not come to drive the knife in further. You may perhaps know that the Security Council in New York is currently examining the situation in Rwanda, at a time when UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali very recently said that he was in favor of the dispatch of a large contingent of UN peacekeeping troops to the spot, a prospect which Major General Paul Kagame, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel leader, is not in favor either. He said so to our correspondent on the spot, Jean Helene: [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French translation] [passage omitted] I think that achieving a cease-fire is a long and exacting task. It is part of the whole process. And at the moment when we speak about a cease-fire, the other party has a different agenda. We do not recognize that government.
