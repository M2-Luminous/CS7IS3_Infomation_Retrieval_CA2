In other words, we still do not have all the details, which we will receive from the U.S. peace team. The overall terminology was okay, the detailed terminology has still not been uttered. It is still too early to draw conclusions. It is clear that President Clinton made a supreme effort to advance the peace process, for which we admire him. We are ready to resume the peace talks between the heads of delegations at the end of the month as planned, but to what extent the general terminology is translated into practice, we will know -- at the earliest -- tomorrow, and even that is not definite. [Raz] But can we refer to satisfaction, temperate satisfaction, or disappointment that President al-Asad did not go into more detail on normalization? [Peres] The tone was too positive to be disappointing, it was too general to arouse satisfaction. At this stage, we know some of the things -- we know the overall tone -- we do not know the details, and there is no point in guessing. [Raz] In your meeting tomorrow with the two U.S. emissaries -- Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk -- will you have to provide the Americans with answers concerning the news conference? [Peres] Our answers are ready today. We say that in return for full peace, including diplomatic relations, open borders -- not only normalization because that is a general word, we have to know what lies behind normal relations -- discussions on security arrangements, an understanding on Lebanon, and the proper conduct of the negotiations, our answer is affirmative.
