FR940725-0-00119 FR940725-0-00018 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 071894A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to fully utilize the total allowable catch (TAC) for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), July 20, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area, was established by the final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1048 metric tons (mt). The specifications also closed the directed fishery for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area under ยง672.20(c)(2)(ii). NMFS has determined that as of July 2, 1994, 917 mt remains unharvested. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the 1994 TAC for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area has not been reached and that the remaining amount is sufficient to support a directed fishery. Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the previous closure and is opening directed fishing for the ``other rockfish'' species category in the Eastern Regulatory Area, effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., July 20, 1994. All other closures remain in full force and effect. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: July 19, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
