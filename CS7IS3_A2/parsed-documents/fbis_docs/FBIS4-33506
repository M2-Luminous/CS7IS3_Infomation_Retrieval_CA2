Carrida] [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jun (PL) -- If total failure was the result of the visit U.S. lawmaker Roberto Torricelli paid to Mexico, the important actions of solidarity with Cuba registered here increase the dimensions of the fiasco. Known at the international level for being the author of the law bearing his name to strengthen the economic blockade imposed by Washington against Havana more than 30 years ago, Torricelli arrived in Mexico with very clear plans of supervising and meddling, according to the Mexican press. A few days before arriving in this city, the congressman presented a draft law that calls for political reforms in Mexico and for international observers in the Mexican federal elections to be held in August. Furthermore, he arrived with the purpose of getting directly involved in the armed conflict that has been taking place in the southern State of Chiapas since early this year and of holding a meeting with the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), which is leading the rebellion by the Chiapas Indians that began on New Year's Day. However, in an open rejection of the visitor, the Zapatists burned the letter in which Torricelli requested a meeting. Torricelli was not received either by Amado Avendano, independent candidate for governor of Chiapas and director of the daily TIEMPO from San Cristobal de las Casas, a newspaper that plays an important role in the evolution of the conflict in Chiapas. Leaders from other political and social organizations of this state also refused to talk with the congressman. Torricelli left Chiapas one day ahead of schedule. The situation in Mexico City was not encouraging either. Deputies, high-ranking government officials, and the press in general did not spare any criticism of the interventionist purposes of the legislator, and they went as far as proposing that he be declared persona non grata. On Sunday, a group of activists from the Promoters of Solidarity with Cuba group demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy here to protest the lawmaker's visit, and they burned a coffin with a dummy that symbolized the visitor and his well-known anti-Cuban law. Exactly one day before concluding his stay in Cuba, Torricelli witnessed the announcement of the official visit Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Havana in mid-June. According to the request made by the president for authorization from National Congress to leave the country, the visit to Cuba "will serve to promote even more bilateral relations, evaluate the contents of the agenda, and explore new actions that will diversify and strengthen it." This idea was supported here last night by the Chamber of Deputies when it approved the president's request and pointed out that the visit will be "a show of Mexico's solidarity for the Cuban people and of the standards that guide Mexican foreign policy." Rodolfo Becerril, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' foreign relations committee, emphasized that Salinas' visit to Havana "is taking place at a time when some U.S. Congressmen want to tighten the blockade against that country (Cuba) and on the eve of the (fourth) Ibero-American Summit." The stand voiced by the deputies was emphasized when the Mexican legislators of the six parties of the chamber decided to donate one day's salary to the Cubans. This money will be used to purchase petroleum for the island. The legislators are from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), National Action Party (PAN), Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM), Popular Socialist Party (PPS), and the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party (PFCRN). When referring to Torricelli's recent visit to Mexico, Foreign Under Secretary Andres Rozental said that the U.S. legislator's visit "was rejected in general, and this united all Mexicans." The high-ranking official pointed out that NAFTA, which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, does not give any country the right to intervene in the affairs of the other, and he insisted that commercial integration involves social and political aspects.
