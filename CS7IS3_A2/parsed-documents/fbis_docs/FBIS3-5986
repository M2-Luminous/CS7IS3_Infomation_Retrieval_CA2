Mr. Phonsin said the law, which is not concerned with Thai industrial products, will take a long time to come into effect. Thai products exported to Japan are primarily semi-processed goods or raw materials which are subsequently used to produce other exports for the U.S. He said imposition of the law contradicts the GATT agreement which will come into effect in 1995. He believes there is ample time for the U.S. to resolve the conflict. The move is considered to be a political gesture after negotiations hit a snag. In the short run, Thailand does not have to adjust its export and international trade strategies, he said. But the Government and the private sector should follow development of the issue closely. He agreed with the move by the Committee on Raising Thailand's Competitiveness, which is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak, to determine the country's long-term trade strategies.
