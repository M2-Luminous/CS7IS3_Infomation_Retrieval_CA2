SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The IPHC, under the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea (signed at Ottawa, Ontario, on March 2, 1953), as amended by a Protocol Amending the Convention (signed at Washington, DC, on March 29, 1979), has issued this inseason action pursuant to IPHC regulations governing the Pacific halibut fishery. The regulations have been approved by the Secretary of State (59 FR 22522, May 2, 1994). On behalf of the IPHC, this inseason action is published in the Federal Register to provide additional notice of its effectiveness, and to inform persons subject to the inseason action of the restrictions and requirements established therein. Inseason Action: 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 13 Area 2A to Reopen on August 3 The IPHC estimates that 25,000 lb (11.3 mt) were landed from Area 2A (Washington, Oregon, and California) during the July 19 fishing period, resulting in a total catch of 150,000 lb (68 mt). As the total catch is 29,000 lb (13.2 mt) less than the 178,750 lb (81 mt) catch limit, Area 2A will reopen on August 3 for 10 hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time. Fishing period limits as indicated in the following table will be in effect for this opening. Note that the fishing period limits for the three smallest vessel classes have all been set at the same level. ␣ 1Vessel length 2Length 2Letter 1Fishing period limit (pounds)* 2Dressed, head on 2Dressed, head off ␣0&hyph;25 A 225 200 26&hyph;30 B 225 200 31&hyph;35 C 225 200 36&hyph;40 D 395 350 41&hyph;45 E 425 375 46&hyph;50 F 510 450 51&hyph;55 G 570 500 ␣56+ H 850 750 *Weights are after 2 percent has been deducted for ice and slime, if fish are not washed prior to weighing. The fishing period limit is shown in terms of dressed, head-off weight as well as dressed, head-on weight. Fishermen should be aware that regulations require that all halibut from Area 2A be landed with their heads on. The fishing period limit applies to the vessel, not the individual fisherman, and any landings over the vessel limit will be subject to forfeiture and may result in a fine. Dated: July 28, 1994.
