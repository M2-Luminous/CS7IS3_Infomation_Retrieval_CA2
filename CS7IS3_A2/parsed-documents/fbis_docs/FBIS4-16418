"Around 15,000 Russians are currently residing in Armenia and they have no complaints about any infringement on their rights or ethnic discrimination," said representatives of the Russian speaking population during the meeting. Chairman of the "Rossiya" society, Galina Chernousova, told Russian lawmakers that this organisation unites ethnic Russians in Armenia, protects their interests and rights and renders them all possible assistance. The society has branch offices in all areas if Armenia, including in places predominantly populated by Russians. Chernousova pointed out that the main problem faced by the Russian-speaking population in Armenia is the problem of education. After Armenia proclaimed independence, all Russian schools and faculties teaching in Russian were closed here. Armenians who were educated in Russian face the same problems as well. The Armenian law on the language demands that graduates of higher educational establishments, especially in engineering specialities, have a good command of the Armenian language. The same applies to those looking for jobs at state-run enterprises. Facing difficulties in education, the young generation sees no prospects in Armenia and have to leave Armenia and live elsewhere, Chernousova said.
