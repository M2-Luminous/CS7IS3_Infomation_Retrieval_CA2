Sometimes you say it is ready to fill the vacuum of Israeli withdrawal and other times you stress that the Syrian presence is a necessity because the Army's preparedness is not complete yet. [Dallul] I confirm that there is no contradiction. The Syrian Army is in Lebanon at the request of the Council of Ministers. It has made great sacrifices in defense of Lebanon's unity and Arabism. The Syrian presence is a fraternal and helping presence. The Syrian military command has never turned down any request submitted by us, whether regarding positions and posts or with regard to deployment. I consider drawing a comparison in this connection a deviation from patriotism. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] We are not comparing the Syrian presence with the Israeli Army's presence. We are asking about the duality in the rhetoric concerning the [Lebanese] Army's preparedness. [Dallul] Brother, there is no duality. Who is going to protect our back if we send three brigades to the south? When we entered east Sidon, the Syrians wanted to evacuate the posts in 'Aramun, so we asked them to stay to protect the Army's rear. And when we entered the southern suburb [of Beirut], they set up a big cordon in Beirut to facilitate our job. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Have all arms been collected in the suburb? [Dallul] The arms present in the suburb are individual arms for the purpose of defending Hizballah cadres. We have agreed with Hizballah on that for the sake of personal protection. The picture of what Israel did to Hizballah leaders is still in people's mind ('Abbas Musawi's assassination). I believe that what is termed security spots is the right of the resistance. We still avoid entering the camps lest such a step be interpreted in various ways, so how do you expect us to deal with a resistance party? Do you want me to deny it even escort weapons, when it is engaged in confrontations with Israel? At any rate, Hizballah does not apply the methods applied by the Army in its operations, and resistance actions are a legitimate right. Our problem with Israel is more a political than a security problem. It has been occupying our territory for 16 years and yet has not solved its security problem. If it withdraws, the problem will end and the Army will take charge of security in the south as a whole. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Former Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli said that resistance actions will continue even if peace is achieved. [Dallul] When Israel withdraws, no arms will exist except [the arms of] legitimacy, and we pledge that. [AL-HAYAH] You pledge and they pledge. Do you not think that a confrontation may occur between the two pledges? [Dallul] No confrontation will take place, because Hizballah understands the circumstances. It is today talking within the resistance framework -- which is its right. It may turn into a political tendency when peace is established, in order to continue its march. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] If the negotiation stage requires the establishment of a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you support that? [Dallul] It is neither required nor proposed. In its present structure Lebanon is the last state that would embark on an action of that kind among Arab states. What is required is coordination that is in Lebanon's interests. I say in Lebanon's interests, because most of the agreements taking place are in Lebanon's interests. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Are you prepared to guarantee the oppositionists' security if they return to Lebanon? [Dallul] We are willing to do that. Yesterday (the day before yesterday) Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri contacted Raymond Iddih and had a long conversation with him. [AL-HAYAH] And General 'Awn? [Dallul] There is an agreement stipulating that he should stay abroad for a certain period. When this period ends, there will be no problem. Besides, he is violating the agreement. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] What is your opinion of Lebanese Forces leader Dr. Samir Ja'ja''s visit to al-Qardahah? [Dallul] Excellent. I am one of those who contributed to establishing a dialogue between Syria and the "Forces." The first meeting took place between Brigadier Ghazi Kan'an and Forces officials in my house in al-Biqa'. We want national rallying around the national concept: to differ politically over what Lebanon should be, not how to destroy Lebanon. [AL-HAYAH] It is noted that there is greater involvement by military courts in the arrests taking place. [Dallul] And how many detainees do you think there are? Not more than 12. [AL-HAYAH] Political detainees? [Dallul] There are no political detainees in Lebanon. [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International said there is torture. [Dallul] I challenge it to provide one proof or one name.
