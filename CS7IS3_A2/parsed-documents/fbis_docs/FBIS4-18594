After Chancellor Helmut Kohl's trip to India last year and the return visit by Prime Minister Rao in February, FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's trip to Delhi is the third visit to India by a German minister this year. Guenter Rexrodt has come to participate in the 11th meeting of the "Joint Economic Committee" in the Indian capital. This committee has been meeting at the ministerial level since 1988; thus it is a routine matter. However, Rexrodt is going at an important time in India's economic development and in German-Indian economic relations. Three bilateral treaties, an amendment to the German-Indian double taxation agreement, a new aviation agreement, and an investment protection agreement are in different stages of preparation. The double-taxation agreement is practically concluded, and the German side is reportedly satisfied with the result. Agreements on Investment Protection The FRG economics minister wants to finish the preparations for signing the aviation agreement in Delhi. It will bring about additional landing rights for Lufthansa in Indian cities and, in addition, help Air India in expanding its tourist business. The "investment protection and promotion agreement," is also virtually ready for signature apart from a few "technical-juridical details." After Great Britain, the FRG will be the second country with which India will conclude such an agreement. The 20-person economic delegation accompanying the minister stresses that the visit will naturally also deal with down-to-earth business. Rexrodt told correspondents that he wants to advocate several specific projects, among others in the fields of telecommunications, machine-building, iron and steel, energy, and food industry. In New Delhi, Rexrodt will also meet with Indian Prime Minister Rao, Finance Minister Singh, and Minister of Commerce Mukherjee, as well as the minister of civilian aviation and tourism, the minister of post and telecommunications, and the state secretary in the Foreign Ministry. In the meetings with Rao, Singh, and Mukherjee, it is likely that not just "bilateral issues" will be discussed, because the Indians' worries concerning the GATT conference in Marrakesh are currently the dominating economic policy issue in New Delhi. Rexrodt's doubts whether environment-specific trade barriers are the best way to make free world trade compatible with the environment are not only shared by New Delhi, but are seen as a neoprotectionist specter, together with other initiatives, such as "trade-related work norms" and countervailing duties against "social dumping." In contrast to the skirmish with Washington, New Delhi hopes that it will find a few common points with Bonn in these fields. In the bilateral sphere, it is intended to look for new ways to strengthen German-Indian partnership in trade and industrial cooperation. If German industry "is underrepresented in the Asian-Pacific region," as the Federal Government's Asian concept says, this quite certainly also applies to India because German industry has only a very moderate share in the current boom in India, especially regarding investments. Bilateral Trade Stimulated Again Even though German investments in India have doubled every year since 1990 (measured by the approved applications), the German share in total foreign investments in India has, at the same time, declined from second place to 10th place. Only regarding the number of cooperation projects (173 in 1993) have German companies successfully maintained their traditional second place among India's partners in technology. It seems that German investment capital is still shy. Several large projects of renowned companies, such as Siemens, BASF, and Mercedes-Benz, to cite just a few, permit, however, the conclusion that a change is emerging in this field. German-Indian trade has also been stimulated again after an extended period of stagnation. Trade volume rose by 12 percent in 1993; thus, for the first time exceeding 6 billion German marks. This is a sum that Rexrodt called "very, very small" with a view to China. "We are not here without euphoria," Rexrodt said, referring to the missed opportunities, "and we are not just thinking of China anymore." Customs reductions, great plans for expansion in the field of infrastructure, reorganization of the nationalized companies, and a quickly growing large market give the go-ahead for major business with India. The glitches in implementing these plans will be the main subject of the ministers' meeting in New Delhi.
