FR940830-0-00031 FR940830-0-00006 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MT6&hyph;1&hyph;5485a and MT20&hyph;1&hyph;6355a; FRL&hyph;5053&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Montana; State Implementation Plan for Libby PM 10 Nonattainment Area AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Libby. The effect of EPA's final action is to make the Libby PM 10 SIP, including the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program regulations, federally enforceable. DATES: This final rule will be effective October 31, 1994, unless adverse comments are received by September 29, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Meredith A. Bond, 8ART&hyph;AP, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405. Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, 999 18th Street, suite 500, Denver, Colorado; and Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Division, 836 Front Street, Helena, Montana; and USEPA Air & Radiation Docket Information Center, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Meredith Bond at (303)293&hyph;1764. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Libby, Montana, area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.327 (specifying designation for Libby). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of title I of the Act. 2 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in today's action and the supporting rationale. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in today's document and supporting information. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and
