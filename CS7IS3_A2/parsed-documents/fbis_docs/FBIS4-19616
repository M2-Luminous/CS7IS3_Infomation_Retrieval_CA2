A day after Lubbers publicly expressed doubts about Brinkman's suitability as prime minister, the CDA's leading candidate made it clear that he had not found the remark helpful. "I am and remain available for the prime ministership," he said. He said it was "a complicating factor" that the CDA had two leaders. "I have always thought that and still do," he said. "But I am keeping the ship on course, even if there is an occasional wind." Brinkman, who was campaigning in Friesland over the weekend, said that "Lubbers is now really saying goodbye and he is having trouble passing on the baton." Lubbers said on Friday evening [during a television talk show] that he thought Wim Kok, PvdA [Labor Party] leader, would be "just as good a prime minister" as his party colleague Brinkman. The prime minister said he thought it was "a pity" that a tradition had developed whereby the leading election candidates automatically became candidates for the prime ministership. "I have praised Brinkman as my successor as the leader of the CDA, but I have never said: Here stands the new prime minister of the Netherlands," Lubbers said. He admitted that he had seen the CDA's decline coming several months ago. "It was difficult for Brinkman to support the cabinet and at the same time to mark out a new course for after the elections," Lubbers said. "I have had sleepless nights about it." Brinkman reacted with contained anger and indirect criticism of Lubbers' third cabinet. "I did not have sleepless nights about that," Brinkman said. "But I do get them about increasing unemployment, another 15 people without a job every hour, the real feeling of insecurity on the streets, and the pressure on the social security system, if we do not act." The leading candidate had noticed that the prime minister had "problems giving up." Talking of his tense relationship with Lubbers, Brinkman said "taking leave is apparently hurting. He announced his departure four years ago and now it is right before him." He said he had not discussed the matter with Lubbers yet. "But I will do next time I meet him face to face," Brinkman said. Brinkman also said that he was still available for the prime ministership. "It would after all be peculiar for the CDA to set off with a leading candidate who was not available to lead the country. If the CDA says that Brinkman is number one, then that is the case and that will continue to be the case. I will keep a steady course, even if there is an occasional wind. In any event I am available for the prime ministership, although that will only be decided when the government is formed."
