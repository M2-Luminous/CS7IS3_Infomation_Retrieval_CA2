Although unanimous in their praise for Swiss aid, Mr. Cotti's dialogue partners nevertheless reiterated that only investments could ensure the stability of the country. "Poland is a priority recipient of Swiss aid to the East," said Flavio Cotti at the end of a courtesy visit paid to President Walesa. Mr. Cotti, head of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs [DFAE] wants Swiss aid to be accompanied by private sector investments. Upcoming State Visit "We are waiting for you, come and do business with us," said Lech Walesa, addressing his visitors. Furthermore, Mr. Walesa will have an opportunity to establish contacts with the private sector during his state visit in May. President Walesa believes that Europe has not yet found a solution that could satisfy the countries of the East. "The postcommunist states still find themselves in a vacuum," he said regretfully, alluding to the lack of a collective security system which would include his country. His concern is shared by Prime Minister Pawlak. The questions of European security and Polish economic development also dominated talks between Ms. Cotti and Mr. Olechowski the day before. Both men emphasized the fundamental Russian role within the context of a peaceful Europe. "Russian participation in international peacekeeping efforts must occur under the mandate and the supervision of a collective security organization," Mr. Cotti told a Polish daily. On the economic level, the Polish foreign minister also launched an appeal to Swiss entrepreneurs to invest more money in his country. Furthermore, he hoped Western markets would open up more to Polish products. Switzerland ranks eighth among principal investors in Poland for 1991-1993, investing 150 million Swiss francs. Swiss Aid Poland is one of the main recipients of financial aid allocated to the new democracies in the East. Switzerland's commitment to Poland is based on two main axes: technological cooperation and financial assistance. At the end of 1993, Switzerland's total commitment amounted to 310.5 million Swiss francs, of which 25.3 million were designated for cooperation, and 285.2 million for financial aid. On Tuesday, Mr. Cotti went to Poznan specifically to see for himself one of the first projects carried out within the framework of technological cooperation: the covered market in Poznan. This accomplishment aims to promote an economic model for regional supplying. Warsaw's European Option The European option constitutes the dominant idea in Poland's foreign policy. Its principal objectives include rapid integration into the European Union [EU], and membership of some kind of collective defense system. Warsaw has already signed the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO in the hope that it will lead to membership of the Atlantic alliance. With this in mind, [Polish] political leaders are extending their contacts with their European partners. They want to make political, cultural, and economic links durable with a view to guaranteeing Poland's place in West Europe. However, for a large number of citizens, the division of Europe will endure, despite the fall of the Berlin Wall: The old Iron Curtain has turned into a frontier of prosperity.
