FBIS4-49746 "drchi090_w_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Macao Stolen Passport, Russian Visa Racket Revealed Stolen Passport, Russian Visa Racket Revealed HK0905030894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 9 May 94 p 2 HK0905030894 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Adam Lee in Macao] [Text] The latest trick in the race to leave China illegally is to use a stolen Portuguese passport from Macao to get a Russian visa in Beijing, according to a local government official. Director of the Identification Department in Macao, Salome Madeira said her office had recently received several batches of stolen Macao-Portuguese passports sent to the Russian Embassy in Beijing. She said Russian officials, suspicious of the authenticity of the documents had handed photocopies to the Portuguese Embassy, which had forwarded them to Macao for verification. All the passports had the photographs changed by forgers, she said. A stolen passport can be sold for anything between HK$10,000 and $50,000 in Hong Kong and Macao, and fetches more in China and some other Asian countries. Ms Madeira said the number of passports reported missing in Macao had declined from about 100 to around 30 every month. This was partly because computerisation of check points meant it was easier to trace people using two passports, and partly because it takes between three and six months for a replacement. About one quarter of Macao's 400,000 residents hold Portuguese passports. Of the 100,000 Portuguese passport holders about 6,000 are from Portugal or former Portuguese colonies, about 10,000 are Macanese (born in Macao of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent) and the rest are of full Chinese parentage. Until 1981, anyone born in a Portuguese territory would automatically be a Portuguese national. However, the 1981 Nationality Law in Portugal stated that people born on Portuguese territory after October 3, 1981 would only be Portuguese if one or both of their parents was already a Portuguese national.
