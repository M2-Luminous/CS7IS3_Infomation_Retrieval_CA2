Vasilyev, president of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and president of the Russian Agricultural Exchange, by SELSKAYA ZHIZN correspondent Mikhail Sharov, under the rubric "Interview of Current Interest"; place and date not given: "Futures Are Advantageous to All"] [Text] We have already reported that a conference on the issues of organizing a grain futures market has been held at the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation. The main developer of this program, Doctor of Commerce A.V. Vasilyev, president of the Selkhoztrast joint-stock company and simultaneously the president of the Russian Agricultural Exchange, has answered questions put by SELSKAYA ZHIZN. [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, organization of the grain futures market is a completely new endeavor both for commodity producers and the state as a whole. We would like you to discuss it because many readers do not know what futures are. [Vasilyev] Translated into Russian, futures means the future, transactions concluded for the purchase of future products. Exchanges in Russia had not previously engaged in futures trading; however, they had advanced to the level of a highly organized wholesale market for grain. Exchanges set prices for grain that were published in all the newspapers. Peasants knew precisely what grain cost on the market. Meanwhile, in our country, the general customer (the Roskhleboprodukt [Russian Federation Committee for Grain Products]), the Ministry of Agriculture of Russia, the AKKOR [Association of Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia], and the Agrarian Union get together at the beginning of the year and set the price, and the government subsequently confirms it. Is this not theater of the absurd?! We have now begun to foster a new wholesale market, which consists of two main elements: these are the market for real goods and the market for the sale of the right to goods. The latter is the futures market. It may also be called a term contract market, that is, a market of contracts for a definite period. A peasant may sell his grain three, six, nine, or 12 months in advance. [Sharov] Grain that has not yet been grown? That has not even been planted? [Vasilyev] Precisely. Having sold a contract for a certain amount of grain at a price projected for the next year, he receives money for this grain, which has not yet been grown (and this is very important!) in order to buy fuel, good seeds, fertilizer, and machinery. Therefore, the commodity producer is a winner, and the state also has an advantage; after all, the buyer pays for grain, and funds from the budget are not spent to this end. Buyers in Western markets are speculators pure and simple, and in the genuine, favorable sense of the word, rather than in ours. So, two speculator-buyers meet on the exchange. One of them believes that grain will be expensive because its gross production will fall due to poor weather conditions. The other one believes that on the contrary, the cost of grain will be reduced because the crop will be large. That is, two contrary opinions are apparent. One speculator says: I will stock up on grain, whereas the other one says: I will sell it. These interests are reflected, in monetary terms, in sales and purchases on the exchange. Those playing for a rise are called "bulls," and those playing for a fall are called "bears." The peasant stays on the sidelines, looks at them fighting on the exchange, and is plainly happy. This means that the price for grain is being stabilized. If any one of them is winning, the peasant understands that yes, indeed, the grain situation at present is bad. Apparently, contracts need to be bought out in order to hedge against a fall in value. Or else, on the contrary, try to sell as many contracts as possible, because prices for grain will go up. [Sharov] At present, there are a great many insinuations of all kinds concerning grain prices. They say that the prices have been unjustifiably overstated.... [Vasilyev] As early as January of this year, we projected for September a grain price of approximately 90 rubles [R], with the value-added tax included. [Sharov] You mean price per kilogram.... [Vasilyev] Of course. So had a peasant sold grain at this price at the beginning of the year and received money as early as January, I am convinced that his mood would be good now, and the crop would have certainly been harvested in its entirety. Meanwhile, this is what it has come to: a tiller cannot buy what is necessary to till the land, grow the crop, and bring it in. [Sharov] Is this, in essence, an interest-free loan? [Vasilyev] Essentially so. It would vindicate the peasants from all unjustified and malevolent accusations. Of course, there is a risk factor involved here. It is easy to understand a peasant if deep down he harbors the thought that he will be cheated about the price being precisely R90. [Sharov] However, these apprehensions are not groundless. The risk factor indeed exists. Imagine that early in the year a peasant sells grain at a high price, and in September it becomes cheaper.... [Vasilyev] Yes, in this case, the peasant loses. What should he do? He either leaves the sold contracts open for sale, or buys them out and sells grain at its actual price on the exchange. This is where one more aspect, a very powerful aspect of the futures exchange, comes in: it is so-called hedging or, in other words, insurance against unfavorable changes in prices. If insurance exists, the peasant will get the price for which he sold grain on the exchange in any event--in any event if his grain is purchased. [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, when the issue was being discussed at the Ministry of Agriculture, you illustrated your arguments with a chart that vividly showed the mechanism of operation of the grain futures market. [Vasilyev] What is the most fundamental provision with regard to price setting for grain? It is that nobody knows how much grain will cost 12 months from now, because the futures market is not yet in operation in our country. This is why we approached this from a scientific point of view and established that in October of the next year, 1994, the cost of grain may range between R180 and R250 per kilogram. According to our calculations, these fluctuations in December will already be within the range of R190-R260. However, let us discuss the October prices for which R180 is the minimum price limit and R250 is the maximum price limit. A peasant takes a look at the chart and decides to put up his grain at the maximum price. He is told: "Go ahead, but you will get only 50 percent down." This variant may not satisfy him, and he will wish to receive all of 90 percent (we cannot pay 100 percent, because we would like to build up reserve stocks of grain out of the 10 percent). He is told once again: "Go ahead, but in this case you must put up the merchandise at R180, that is, at the lowest end of the scale" (final settlement will be effected at the time of actually turning in the grain). At this point, the peasant begins to think: Let me take the golden mean, R200, and receive 80 percent down. This price satisfies the peasant--he was the one to set it. [Sharov] Does this important endeavor take into account the role of the state and public organizations representing the interests of the peasantry? [Vasilyev] Definitely. The chart we are talking about should be approved by the government after a thorough discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agrarian Union. In the process, the state will retain a regulatory function--after all, bread is at stake! Imagine that grain prices have exceeded the maximum limit. What does the state do? It releases onto the market a large amount of grain from reserves. Since more of it appears on the exchange, it means that prices for grain will fall. Once again, this chart is brought into conformity. However, the opposite situation may also occur, whereby they begin to sell grain at R160 rather than at R180. In this case, the state dumps a large amount of money on the grain market and purchases the grain to meet state needs. This means that prices will return to those on the chart once again. [Sharov] Aleksandr Vasilyevich, everything is always impeccably smooth in theory.... What about reality? [Vasilyev] Indeed, in practice everything is considerably more complicated. The most difficult issue in this instance is that of the buyer. For example, who will now buy grain at R250 per kilogram if it is suddenly put up for sale? There will be no takers, because cattle breeders who need this grain are beggars now. Private farms will not buy at this price either, nor, perhaps, will mill operators. So we started thinking about how to cut this Gordian knot. The following thought occurred to us: What if these contracts are sold at 10 percent of the value, or even five percent, that is to say, one-tenth to one-twentieth of the contract rather than at full value? An opportunity will appear to sell this grain to a larger circle of consumers. Peasants need manufactured feed concentrates rather than grain in order to raise farm animals. Esteemed buyers of futures contracts, we propose to replace grain with any manufactured feed concentrate, and then at your manufactured-feed plants located nearby. We have signed an agreement with the Roskombikorm association, which has been set up by these manufactured-feed plants. You may buy manufactured feed concentrates from them towards a grain contract. At present, we specify the values of one-tenth or one-twentieth of the cost on only one condition, that of the opportunity we will have to build an insurance reserve of grain. If contracts are sold for one-tenth of the cost, we will need to place no less than 1 million tonnes of grain in reserve stocks. If they are sold for one-twentieth, we should place no less than 2 million tonnes. Everything depends on what arrangements we make and where we find the money to purchase this segment of the emergency fund at present. Everyone who makes a purchase under a contract should be sure that the delivery to himself of grain or manufactured feed concentrates is guaranteed. We will be able to guarantee it when we have a reserve stock. [Sharov] Do you mean the amount of grain that is necessary in order to set in motion the mechanism of the futures market itself next year? Is it realistic to be discussing it already? [Vasilyev] Yes, it is realistic. We have prepared virtually all documentation, refined the contract itself, and refined the implementation program. To be sure, at present we will not be able to do this in all regions of Russia. For now, we will only use a few grain-producing and grain-consuming oblasts in which we will refine this mechanism. As soon as it gets going, we will extend it to all of Russia. However, this will happen tomorrow, but today we badly need support from the mass media in explaining the very mechanism of the futures market. This is a very, very complicated business. The main point is for the people to understand that if they buy contracts for grain, the latter will be delivered in the necessary amount and on schedule--a tonne in December, a tonne in January, February, and so on, that is, at a rate that supports, on a monthly basis, the technical cycle of production or animal feeding. The state should provide assistance in setting this mechanism in motion, if not in funds, then in grain. We should be told: We are allocating 1 million tonnes for the futures mechanism to the five or six exchanges in which they have confidence now, and guarantee that this grain will be provided from state reserves in any case. Our farmer or peasant may suddenly fail to get the crop. In this case, all of us are bankrupt and unable to honor commitments made under the contracts. Support from the state and a reserve fund are needed to ensure that this does not happen. To be sure, Americans propose to give us the necessary amount of grain as charitable aid. However, frankly, I would not want it, because we will thus punish our own commodity producers. When charitable-aid grain was dumped in March on the Saratov exchange, its price fell from R35-R40 to R27 right away. This is what the infusion of a large delivery of grain means. Generally, my notion is that purchasing grain abroad is just a catastrophe for Russia. Why? Because we ruin the domestic commodity producer in this manner, paying him for grain three to four times less than a Western grain producer. Would it not be better to purchase elite grades of seeds, of which we do not have enough, and various kinds of defoliants and herbicides, that is, everything that improves the grade and quality of the crop? This would be a statesmanlike approach!
