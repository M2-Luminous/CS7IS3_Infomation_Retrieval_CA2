Economic problems militate against the optimistic scenario of maintaining 1993's rhythm of inflation (an average rate of 46 percent.) Garcia believes that this government has inherited a profound economic and financial crisis, whose solution becomes more difficult because of the country's social problems and the restrictions that Caldera himself spoke of in his inaugural address (taxes, increase in the price of gasoline). The principal reason for the economic crisis is the budget deficit, which could reach from 5 to 8 percent of the gross domestic product (from 350 billion to 560 billion pesos, respectively). The feasibility of maintaining an accord on prices (salaries, exchange rates, and prices of goods and services), mentioned by some members of the new government, seems unrealistic and improbable, according to Garcia. [passage omitted] The new government will apply the VAT [Value Added Tax], although with another name, only to wholesalers and with a long list of exemptions, which Garcia believes, could contribute to higher levels of tax evasion. He warns of the grave error of falling into the temptation of using funds from the sale of the assets of privatized firms to cover the deficit. The sale of shares in PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] to pay off large amounts of the external debt is another possibility, which would also reduce the pressure of interest payments. Although this measure is impeccable from a financial point of view, it would be dangerous if not accompanied by a radical restructuring of government finances. According to the IESA economist, the alternatives for financing the deficit are very restricted, because Venezuela's access to international financial markets is limited, especially when the macroeconomic situation is not sustainable. Economic instability would limit the funds that could be obtained from the multilateral organizations if there is no clear intention and specific plan to put government finances in order. There are also serious restrictions on further increases in the domestic debt (new issues of letters of credit in bolivares) to finance part of the deficit, because it would mean substantial increases in interest rates.
