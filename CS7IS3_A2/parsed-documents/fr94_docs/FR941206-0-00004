FR941206-0-00004 FR941206-0-00001 Actions in Response to Labeling Issues FSIS considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues and initiated two actions in response to them. FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on March 3, 1994 (59 FR 10230), which solicited comments and requested data on various tentative positions on poultry products produced by mechanical separation. The second action was a proposed rule (59 FR 10246), also published on March 3, 1994, on which this final rule is predicated, that focused on the meat product derived from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr). Taking into account the information and experience acquired since 1969 and current regulatory policies, FSIS reviewed and reevaluated the existing poultry regulations, particularly in light of the labeling issues. As a result of its review and reevaluation, the Agency now believes that the method of deriving boneless poultry products by the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from the meat and other tissues of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses results in a product whose physical form and texture differ materially from those of other boneless poultry products produced by traditional deboning techniques. Mechanically separated poultry is derived using a machine that operates on the differing resistance of bone and tissue to passage through small openings, whether it employs sieves, screens, or other devices. Such machines mechanically separate and remove most of the bone from poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses resulting in a finely comminuted, paste-like product. The starting materials, which may have undergone an initial bone breaking process, are pushed under high pressure through equipment with apertures that allow a small amount of powdered bone to pass through with the soft tissue. This is different than boneless poultry derived by traditional means, i.e., hand-deboning, and such differences have potential consequences for consumer expectations. FSIS has statutory responsibilities under the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) and the FMIA to assure that consumers receive poultry and meat food products that are not adulterated and that bear labeling that is not false or misleading. Mechanically separated poultry is produced by essentially the same technology and has characteristics (i.e., physical form and texture) similar to those of the livestock product, MS(S). Yet, the regulatory requirements for labeling these two products currently are inconsistent with one another. Therefore, the Agency is proposing that further regulatory action is necessary pursuant to its statutory responsibilities to protect the public and prevent the preparation and distribution in commerce of poultry products and meat food products which are misbranded or not properly marked, labeled, or packaged. As such, the Agency is proposing in a separate document in this issue of the Federal Register to amend the poultry products inspection regulations (9 CFR Part 381) to revise and supplement the requirements for the manufacture, characteristics, and labeling of poultry products produced by mechanical separation and the labeling of products in which they are used as ingredients. As a result of data and information provided in response to the proposed rule on Meat Produced by Advanced Meat/Bone Separation Machinery and Meat Recovery Systems and otherwise acquired by FSIS, FSIS has determined that advances in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, which do not grind, crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissue adhering to bones of livestock (i.e., bones of cattle, sheep, swine, and goats) result in a product which, unlike MS(S), is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined. Since the 1970's, there has been increasing commercial production of processed meat products that are formulated with comminuted (i.e., ground) meat, e.g., hot dogs, in order to meet the demands of the market for such products. Most of the technology that has found commercial use will evolve in the form of improvements to meet the demands of consumers and industry. The demands of the industry have centered around the desire to harvest more usable protein, i.e., muscle tissue, and to find alternatives to recovering more usable protein, from livestock carcasses to meet consumer demands for the processed meat products formulated with skeletal muscle tissue obtained by mechanical removal. Mechanization also diminishes the economic implications of removing meat by hand caused by repetitive motion disorders for workers that hand-debone carcasses and parts of carcasses using knives, and by knife accidents. Industry data 2 indicate that over 300,000 cases of cumulative trauma disorder (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) have occurred in the meat industry due to the strain of repetitive movements to remove meat from bones. The demands of the consumer and industry have resulted in improvements in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to improve yields and, simultaneously, to make the process better ergonomically. 2 Data received in comments from Longmont Foods and Butterball Turkey Company on Docket No. 93&hyph;008ANPR, ``Labeling of Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical Deboning and Products in Which Such Poultry Product Is Used'' (58 FR 33040), June 1993.
