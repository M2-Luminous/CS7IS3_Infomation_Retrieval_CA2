FBIS4-53344 "dreas095_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 South Korea British Combat Software Selected for Destroyers British Combat Software Selected for Destroyers SK1305035194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0253 GMT 13 May 94 SK1305035194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry gave final approval Friday to the Navy's choice of a British combat system for Korea's new destroyers. The final contract saved Korea 22 billion won as the price of the SSCS (Surface Ship Combat System)-MK7 was cut 34 percent from the original offer in 1992 and revised to minimize treasury loss on the part of Korea, ministry officials said. The advanced software system of Bae-Sema Ltd. (BSL), to be installed in the new warships under the KDX (Korean Destroyer Project) program, was selected over Germany's Cosys-200K1. The Defense Ministry completely revised the screening process for the combat system when the German equipment was chosen in June last year despite the Navy's preference for the British version. The fact that the British Navy already has a contract on a similar destroyer system that the Koreans wish to adopt and that the British system was estimated to have better "follow-up logistics support" tilted Korea toward the SSCS, the officials said. The SSCS sets will be installed in the next-generation Navy destroyers, now under construction, with advanced computer operational capability.The project is due to be completed by 1998.
