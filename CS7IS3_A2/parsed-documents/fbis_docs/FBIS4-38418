He told the press conference devoted to a State Duma delegation's visit to Russia's Baltic exclave, located between Lithuania and Poland, that "Kaliningrad is an inalienable part of Russia and that neither Lithuanians, nor Estonians, nor Poles or Germans, will be able to tear it away from the motherland." The Kaliningrad Region (former East Prussia) was joined to Russia following the Potsdam conference in 1945. The Vilnius territory is the south eastern part of Lithuania which was occupied by Poland in 1919-39. In 1939, following the occupation of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union sent its troops to this territory and subsequently joined it to Lithuania.
