FR940603-2-00011 FR940603-2-00009 On March 1, 1994, CEMEX responded to our supplementary questionnaire. Again, CEMEX failed to report its home market sales of Type I cement. CEMEX reiterated its contention that its sales of identical merchandise satisfied all statutory criteria for use in calculating foreign market value (FMV). CEMEX argued that there was not yet any evidence on the record of the instant review to refute this contention, and that it was not incumbent on CEMEX to establish that its home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were made in the ordinary course of trade CEMEX stated that, given its position it was not willing to incur the expense necessary to provide complete Type I cement sales data. Given the Department's finding that home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were made outside the ordinary course of trade in the period of the second review, we have been concerned about the possibility that CEMEX's home market sales of type II and Type V cement might also have been made outside the ordinary course of trade during the instant POR. Section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act and section 353.46(a) of the Department's regulations provide that FMV shall be based on the price at which ``such or similar merchandise'' is sold in the exporting country in the ``ordinary course of trade for home consumption''. Section 771(15) of the Tariff Act defines ``ordinary course of trade'' as ``the conditions and practices which, for a reasonable time prior to the exportation of the merchandise which is the subject of an investigation, have been normal in the trade under consideration with respect to merchandise of the same class or kind'' (see also 19 CFR 353.46(b)). In the previous review, i.e., the second review, where CEMEX reported home market sales of Type I, Type II, Type V cement, petitioners made an allegation that CEMEX's have market sales of Type II and Type V cement were outside the ordinary course of trade. In the final results of the second review we compared CEMEX's home market sales of Type II and Type V cement with sales of similar merchandise (namely, Type I cement) within the same class or kind. Based on this comparison and on other factors raised by petitioners, we concluded in the second review that CEMEX's home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were not made in the ordinary course of trade, and we did not use them for the purposes of calculating FMV (See Gray Portland Cement and Clinker for Mexico: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; 58 FR 47253 (September 8, 1993)). Based on this finding, we believe that it is necessary to compare Type II and Type V cement sales with Type I cement sales to determine whether the same conditions existed during the instant review, i.e., the third review. However, after several requests for information, CEMEX has not reported Type I cement sales data that would permit such a comparison. Preliminary Results of Review While CEMEX argues that it is not incumbent upon it to provide the Type I cement sales data, its refusal to provide essential information has prevented the Department from determining whether home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were sold in the ordinary course of trade. Therefore, we must resort to the use of BIA, is accordance with section 776(c) of the Traffic Act. For a detailed analysis of this issue, see the Memorandum from the Office Director to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance, dated May 18, 1994, which is on file in room B&hyph;099 of the Department's main building. As for the choice of BIA, we note that we have an established ``two-tier'' system: 1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes the proceedings, we use as BIA the higher of (a) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative review or (b) the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind or merchandise in the same country of origin. 2. When a company substantially cooperated with our request for information, but failed to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required, we use as BIA the higher of (a) the highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review, or (b) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind of merchandise from the same country of origin. See Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, et. al. ; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, 57 FR 28360, 28379 (June 24, 1992). In this case, we are using first-tier BIA because CEMEX was uncooperative. The BIA rate is the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the LTFV investigation, i.e., CEMEX's rate of 60.33 percent (55 FR 29244, July 18, 1990). Thus, as a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin for CEMEX for the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993, to be 60.33 percent.
