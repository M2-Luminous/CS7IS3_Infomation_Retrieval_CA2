My dear compatriots; my family and tribe in Shandi; peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you. It is, brothers and sisters, a unique moment in which we meet on this blessed day -- the day of the anniversary of Sudan's independence -- with the masses of Shandi. [passage omitted] The believer, brothers and sisters, does not seek refuge except in Almighty God. He does not kneel except to Almighty God. He does not ask anyone except Almighty God. Also, after gaining real independence, we do not seek refuge or kneel before anyone except Almighty God. We ask nothing from anyone or from any state. It is because we only ask this from Almighty God. We are not asking anyone or any state for strength, because strength belongs to God the all powerful. [passage omitted] Our slogan is self-reliance; we should eat what we grow and wear what we make. [passage omitted] On this day we salute our people's valiant and victorious forces currently deployed at the locations of operations, presenting one martyr after another and wounded after wounded in order to preserve our independence. Salutations to them while they are irrigating the land of the south with their blood so that the land may sprout dignity and honor. Salutations to them while they are protecting our independence, land, honor, and dignity. Salutations on this day, brothers and sisters, to the unified police officers and men who in the past stood in support of the national movement, and who are now standing with their armed forces in defense of honor and land, and in protection of independence. Salutations on this day to our farmers who have liberated our decision and preserved our independence by the cereals they produce to protect the dignity and honor of the Sudan. Salutations to our farmers who have transformed our slogans -- that we should eat from what we farm -- into the reality we are living today. [passage omitted] From this rostrum I give directions for setting up a national committee to review and write the history of the national movement so that our own generation and the coming generation will learn about the struggle of our forefathers, the leaders of the national movement, so that they can receive their appreciation. [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, our people had to make some stops during crucial moments of their unity stand which led to the independence of Sudan. But after independence some of our leaders became preoccupied with worldly matters. They fought one another and were busy gathering booty, distributing gains and struggling for power. They squandered our independence and they neglected our decision-making; they squandered our land to let the mutineers sieze it. They neglected our people so much so that they began to beg for charity and aid. But while the leaders of this country were being complacent, the revolution surged forward, either a revolution led by the army and supported by the Sudanese people, or a revolution led by the Sudanese people and supported by the armed forces. This has been the case until, brothers and sisters, the revolution of national salvation came to be, and it was led by the army. It was supported by all the members of the Sudanese nation, who stood behind it and who pushed it forward . The revolution of national salvation came to restore the real meaning of independence. It came in order to realise independence. Then we began to call for self-reliance. The Sudanese people did not fail us. Almighty God did not fail us after we rejected all the threats of the West and its aides, after we rejected all the temptations of the forces of haughtiness and colonialism. We prayed to Almighty God, asking for reinforcement and help and relief. We all looked up to Him. He did not fail us. He provided us with ample relief and abundant production, as a result of which we managed to realise self-sufficiency, liberate our decision-making and realise our independence. [passage omitted] We recalled Almighty God's words. We remembered His words and we said: For us, God is sufficent, and He is the best disposer of affairs. [Chants of "God is Great"] We turned to your sons and brothers in the armed forces, provided them with equipment and military supplies and called for the formation of the People's Defense Forces. All that was in obedience to Almighty God's order to provide them with all possible power and supplies. Your sons and brothers took part in crossing operations [as heard]. These operations were a true crossing over from the state of defeat to victory, weakness to strength, degradation and defeat to dignity and pride. The sword of the crossing pounded the rebel battalions and was the cause of terror amongst the enemies of Almighty God. The salvation revolution came to rebuild Sudan, to restore the glory and dignity of the Sudanese people, to put Sudan back into its normal place as leader and imam of the peoples of the world. [passage omitted] We are looking to build Sudan, a Sudan with honor and pride. We must overcome all difficulties to achieve this noble aim because the road to gaining self-respect and pride is not easy but is full of hurdles, obstacles and thorns. But our honorable people can overcome all the difficulties, all the hurdles and all the obstacles. [chants of "God is Great," and "There is no God but one God"] [passage omitted] We have also gone to the oilfields which the previous governments placed as a hostage in the hands of the American Chevron Company. The salvation revolution came to liberate Sudan's oil. Work has now begun in earnest to extract and refine Sudan's oil. Brothers and sisters, in order to build Sudan, we must also build an infrastructure of roads in order to connect the different parts of the country and facilitate the movement of people and goods. The Defiance Highway, the artery of the north, the western Salvation Highway, the Peace Highway, the Salvation Highway from Madani to Manaqil, the Halfa-Sab'at highway, all these, brothers and sisters, are now being constructed with purely Sudanese efforts. Life is also being returned to the railways, that vital artery, and work has been carried out to build airports in Port Sudan, Dunqula and Al-Fashir. There has also been work to adapt ports and build new ports, like the expansion of Port Sudan and the ports of Sawakin and Usayf. [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, on the anniversary of independence we should recall the lofty stances taken by the Sudanese people, in all its factions. The Sudanese people were united in the realization of self-autonomy and the signing of the self-autonomy agreement. We should salute the memory of our leaders on that date -- the end of 1955 -- 19 December; the day when the Sudanese people forgot all their tribal and party differences; when the word for the Sudanese people was united, when the decision on independence was declared from inside parliament. These are the stances which we should recall because all this achievement was realized thanks to the unity of the word and the rank. Had God willed that we should continue in that unity we would today be in a different position to our current one, and we would be in a different situation to our present situation. But the leaders, following that great achievement, became disunited. Sudan's identity was lost. Sudan's interests were lost. We lagged behind, until the salvation revolution came to restore national unity and reunite the Sudanese rank, and to invite all -- after we had placed all our trust in Almighty God and after we raised the banner of "There is no God but God" -- to unite and close our rank to build the new Sudan. Today I call on all the sons of Sudan to forget all our old differences, all our party, sect, tribal, and regional differences, so that we talk together and join together behind the banner: There is no God but God and Mohammad is the messenger of God. [passage omitted] [Chants of "God is great"] Brothers and sisters, on this day we must not forget peace and the call for peace, and we must call on our brothers, whom time and the enemies of Sudan have exposed to danger, to let us talk together and to sit down with us to hold a dialogue for the sake of peace in order to restore the unity of Sudan and bring peace to all the Sudanese people. We want this day to be a day of peace, and this year to be the year of peace in which peace is attained, Almighty God permitting. We want peace for all the people of Sudan and we want peace for Sudan with all its neighbors and brothers. We do not interfere in anyone's affairs nor do we plot against anyone. We only declared our independence and our independent decision. We want to build our Sudan, relying on ourselves, Almighty God permitting. We also call on all peoples of the world to work for peace and call for peace, to work for the good of humankind and to assure the future of their sons, to develop humankind and underdeveloped regions and those peoples who are bowed under the burden of backwardness, hunger and ignorance. Greetings on this day to our brothers in brotherly Iraq. We praise their steadfastness and their stand against arrogance. We praise them and pray that they become victorious. We wish them consolidated victory, God willing. Greetings to our brothers in the Libyan Jamahiriyah while they resist colonialism and the new sanctions imposed on them. We do not forget, on this day, to urge our brothers in brotherly Yemen to forget their disputes and to safeguard their trusteeship. We must also remember on this day our brothers who are being exposed to mass liquidation -- our brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a living example of man's injustice toward his brother mankind. This living example is an example of human rights' violations in the heart of Europe, which accuses us of violating human rights. Our brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina are undergoing ethnic cleansing, not for committing any mistake or crime other than saying: There is no God but one God, Mohammad is the Prophet of God. And they accuse us of persecuting people of other religions. Also, greetings to our brothers in Somalia for their steadfastness and stand which forced the colonizing powers to leave Somalia. Greetings to the people of Palestine and the sons of Palestine, to the revolution of rocks and the children of rocks who stood up against the Zionist enemy, made him bow, humiliated him and made him sit down for negotiations. You have heard through the media that we have asked Britain, the colonizing state, to recall its ambassador in Khartoum because he interfered in and encroached on what did not concern him, and he forgot that today we are celebrating the 38th anniversary of the exit of his people, who were expelled and alienated, not to return, God willing. Brothers and sisters, we wanted it to be a lesson for them and a lesson that we are independent and will not permit anyone to harm our independence. [passage omitted] Brothers and sisters, my family and kinsfolk, I greet you and hope that we will continue to meet on the path of inimitable achievement. God is great, and all power to Sudan. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.
