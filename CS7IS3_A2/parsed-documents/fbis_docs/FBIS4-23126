FBIS TRENDS-24jun94-Russia Parliamentary Chambers Pass 1994 Budget Parliamentary Chambers Pass 1994 Budget SUMMARY On 24 june both chambers of the Federal Assembly passed the 1994 budget, resisting furious Defense Ministry attempts to boost defense allocations and approving a budget bill with few major changes from the Government's proposals except for a significant increase in agricultural spending skillfully wangled by the agrarian lobby. The State Duma concluded its revisions two weeks earlier when it approved the bill by a one-vote margin in a vote that revealed a surprising lineup of forces--support from the Agrarians, Communists, and ultranationalist Liberal Democrats despite the low defense budget, while reformers largely voted against it or abstained. The budget's relatively quick passage through the legislature may not, however, be an accurate portent for future budget processes, as the Duma already appears to be preparing for a more lengthy and rigorous scrutiny of the 1995 budget. END SUMMARY On 24 june the Duma voted 273 to 80 (with 8 abstentions) to pass the 1994 budget (ITAR-TASS, 24 june), reversing its defeat two days earlier, when the Duma failed to pass it on the third reading--supposedly a mere formality (See Box 1)--and when the Duma's usual high absenteeism and perhaps some last-minute doubts on the part of deputies prevented it from mustering the required majority. Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, evidently unwilling to let the chamber defeat the budget and risk being branded as ineffective, bent the rules of procedure in forcing repeat votes. The Agrarian Faction, eager to pass the budget because of its generous allocations to agriculture, aided Rybkin in this endeavor, reportedly proposing that the Duma hold a repeat vote on the 24th because 15 of its members were absent on 22 june (Interfax, 22 june). Rybkin, reportedly angry at the budget's failure to pass (Segodnya, 23 june), canceled all scheduled business trips by deputies and ordered them all to be present for the "crucial" budget vote on Friday (Interfax, 22 june). Earlier, Rybkin had predicted that the third and supposedly final reading of the budget, scheduled for 22 june, would be a largely pro forma review of the law's language (Interfax, 9 june), and its defeat in three separate votes (See Note 1) evidently came as a surprise. (Note 1) On the first attempt, with 295 deputies (out of 450) voting, it failed by a wide margin of 32 votes; the second vote, with 299 deputies present, failed by only six votes; and the third vote failed by a wider margin of 14 votes, despite the presence of 315 deputies (ITAR-TASS, Interfax, 22 june). According to Article 116 of the Duma's regulations, the Duma needs a majority of the total number (obshcheye chislo) of the chamber's deputies, defined in Article 86 as 450, to adopt laws (Reglament Gosudarstvennoy Dumy Federalnogo Sobraniya--Parlamenta Rossiyskoy Federatsii, dated 25 March and 25 April 1994). Upper House's Surprise Support Possibly indicating the upper house's sensitivity to pressure exerted on it to pass the budget and not appear obstructionist, the Federation Council also passed the budget the same day despite having voiced objections to its low level of defense spending (ITAR-TASS, 24 june). In response to statements from Federation Council leaders on the need to increase the defense allocation (See Box 2), the Duma had signaled that it would not back down on the budget, issuing a statement after it had approved the budget's provisions on 8 june affirming its position and portraying its vote as one of fiscal responsibility that establishes "firm control" over "taxpayers' money" (Radio Rossii, Interfax, 10 june). The Duma's Rybkin lashed out at the upper chamber's threat to reject the budget, warning that if it tried to "destroy the budget," he would expose its opponents and "tell the public who they used to be and why they have been undermining the budget for four years" (Interfax, 8 june). Moreover, the Duma reportedly refused to hear a presentation by the Federation Council's chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee, Nikolay Gonchar, on the Federation Council's objections to the budget (ITAR-TASS, 21 june). President Boris Yeltsin may have pressured Shumeyko to encourage the Federation Council to pass the budget when the two met on 9 june, reportedly to discuss the "effectiveness" of the upper chamber's work and presumably also to discuss the budget passed the day before in the Duma (Moscow NTV, ITAR-TASS, 9 june). Budget's Main Provisions The Duma had completed its revisions to the budget on 8 june with few major changes to the government's figures, resisting severe pressure from the Ministry of Defense and two of its own committees for a huge boost in defense allocations, holding the line on the deficit, but significantly increasing spending on agriculture. The budget calls for overall expenditures of 194.4 trillion rubles (R) and revenues of R124.4 trillion, leaving a deficit amounting to 9.6 percent of GDP (Interfax, 8 june). The government's original figures had called for expenditures of R183.1 trillion, revenues of R120.7 trillion, and a deficit estimated at 8 to 9 percent of GDP (ITAR-TASS, 15 April). Despite intensive lobbying by the military (see box 3), the budget calls for only R40.6 trillion in defense spending, far below the R55 trillion supported by the Duma's Defense and Economic Policy committees and only a modest increase from the R37.1 trillion figure approved on 11 May in the first reading. In contrast to the military's setback, agriculture fared well, receiving R15.3 trillion, up from R11.9 trillion in the government's draft (ITAR-TASS, 27 May; Kommersant-Daily, 28 May). Deputy Premier and Agrarian Party member Aleksandr Zaveryukha credited the increase to "tough work" conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in the government and the Duma (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 26 May). Committees Vie for Influence The budget's relatively quick progress in the Duma marks a victory for Mikhail Zadornov (Yabloko bloc), the moderate reformist chairman of the Duma's Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance Committee, who apparently concluded that the Duma should postpone any effort to make major revisions in the budget until it begins consideration of the 1995 budget. In an interview to the mass circulation newspaper Trud (23 March), Zadornov stated, "In the current year, unfortunately, there is little that can be changed [in the budget]." Instead, he appears eager to get a start on the 1995 budget, which he has asked the government to submit in September (Segodnya, 16 April) in the expectation that, working with a less pressing deadline, the Duma will exert greater influence on economic policy in 1995. By contrast, Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev (Democratic Party of Russia) wanted to delay passage of the 1994 budget and attempt more ambitious revisions now. He urged that the budget be rejected at its first reading for failing to address structural reforms, complaining in particular about the high levels of investment in agriculture and the fuel and energy complex at the expense of technology-intensive industries and a military conversion program, without which, he contends, it will be impossible to "break the dangerous trends" in the production slump (Delovoy Mir, 7 April; Segodnya, 14 April). Like Zadornov, Glazyev has emphasized the need to start working on the 1995 budget, but, unlike his colleague, was willing to finish 1994 without a budget, continuing the ad hoc quarterly budget approval practice employed in recent years (Segodnya, 14 April). Major Amendments Rebuffed Anticipating that the Duma would attempt major revisions on the second reading, especially in the defense allocation, Zadornov made clear that his committee would brook no amendments altering the basic revenue and expenditure guidelines approved on the first reading. Zadornov successfully proposed that the Duma reject "automatically" any of the almost 300 proposed amendments that would change the budget's basic parameters (Segodnya, 8 June). Rybkin evidently supported Zadornov's goal and reportedly delayed the start of the budget discussion to meet with the heads of all factions behind closed doors, where he proposed that the Duma vote on all amendments endorsed by the budget committee as a package (Radio Ekho Moskvy, 8 june). The combined efforts of Zadornov and Rybkin successfully thwarted attempts by the Defense and Economic Policy committees to increase the defense budget to R55 trillion. Projecting that the government would gain R28.6 trillion in additional revenues from the sale of state property in the post-voucher phase of privatization, Glazyev's committee called for allocating an additional R18 trillion to defense (ITAR-TASS, 25 May; Segodnya, 27, 28 May; Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 8 june). Zadornov's committee treated that revenue projection with suspicion, contending that any "excess" revenues would "hardly exceed R3 trillion," but agreed to create an off-budget fund for privatization receipts earmarked for the military (Segodnya, 28 May, 8 june). Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's Choice) cited Glazyev's revenue projections when he stated at a press conference that his committee would "insist" on increasing the defense budget from R37 trillion to R55 trillion, adding for good measure that the higher figure had "practically been agreed upon by the president, the Government, and the Security Council" (Interfax, Moscow NTV, 19 May) (see box 4). How the Factions Voted The Duma approved the budget on the second reading by only one vote above the required majority, 227 to 40 (32 abstentions), with most of the support coming from left-wing, nationalist, and centrist factions, while reformers either abstained or voted against (Krasnaya Zvezda, Izvestiya, 16 june): -- Left-Wing Factions. An analysis of the 8 june budget vote conducted by the "Information Analysis Group" under the leadership of Aleksandr Sobyanin (Izvestiya, 16 june) indicates that the budget received the highest proportional support from the Agrarian and Women of Russia factions, followed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) faction. Appearing to view a viable budget as a necessary tool of government, CPRF leader Gennadiy Zyuganov called the budget's adoption "the logic of common sense" (Radio Ekho Moskvy, 8 june). Suggesting, however, that the Agrarian-CPRF alliance in the Duma may break down when agrarian and military-industrial interests are placed in direct competition, 95 percent of Agrarian deputies voted for the budget--including Rybkin--while only 73 percent of the CPRF faction did so. -- Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). The faction's 42 votes (of 64 members) for the budget (Izvestiya, 16 june), despite the modest defense allocation, appear to reflect the capriciousness and inconsistency with which party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy approaches politics. Before the first reading Zhirinovskiy vowed to vote against the budget unless Yeltsin dismissed Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, privatization tsar Anatoliy Chubays, and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 15 April), but then he flip-flopped and encouraged faction members to vote for it on the first reading (Russian TV, 13 May). Zhirinovskiy's move to support the budget appeared to reflect his resistance to attempts by reformist factions to defeat it, explaining to journalists: "If the initiative to vote the budget down was ours, we would vote. But we do not want to help the [Yabloko] faction and Russia's Choice remove this government and take its place. We will remove this government in the fall, but we will do it for ourselves" (ITAR-TASS, 13 May). Zhirinovskiy's absence on the day of the vote may have helped the budget's passage, relieving the Duma of his usual obstreperousness. -- New Regional Policy (NRP). The pro-industry NRP, whose members are largely elected from districts and are therefore more sensitive to constituents' localized concerns than deputies elected from party lists, also voted against the budget. According to Sobyanin, only 28 percent of the faction's members voted for the budget, the lowest percentage of any faction except the reformist Russia's Choice and Yabloko bloc (Izvestiya, 16 june). Indicating that, like the Federation Council, the NRP is concerned about maintaining local defense industries, faction leader Vladimir Medvedev said before the vote that the NRP would vote for the budget only if the defense allocation was increased to R55 trillion (Interfax, 7 june). The faction recently allied itself with former Security Council Chairman Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Russian Commodity Producers. According to media accounts of a "secret" meeting on 17 May, Skokov and NRP deputies reportedly explored avenues of cooperation, resulting in an agreement signed by Medvedev and Skokov on "devising common approaches to political and economic" issues and "resolving urgent problems at the federal and regional level" (Obshchaya Gazeta, 20 May; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 May). -- Russia's Choice. The decision by many faction members to follow faction leader Yegor Gaydar's lead in abstaining appears to reflect a compromise between the faction's conviction that the budget was seriously flawed and its reluctance to vote the budget down and possibly endanger Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's Government. Only 11 out of 74 Russia's Choice deputies (15 percent) voted for the budget, among them Foreign Minister Kozyrev. Reflecting the faction's views of the budget's flaws, Gaydar has criticized the "high level of military spending," system of regional transfer payments that he contends "subsidize[s] the south at the expense of the north," excessive subsidies to "inefficient" coal mining and agriculture, and insufficient funding of science, education, and culture (Izvestiya, 26 May; Radio Rossii, 8 june). -- Yabloko. In a strong show of unity, only one Yabloko member voted for the budget, a reflection of faction leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's opposition to the economic reform priorities pursued by Yeltsin since 1992. Yavlinskiy has objected to the government's use of "monetarist instruments" for managing the economy and for attempting deregulation in an economy where monopolies still dominate. He also supports a more activist structural policy that favors investment in technology-intensive industries that can produce output for export and in what he considers the "driving sectors of the economy"--aircraft building, the oil industry, construction materials, and housing (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 April). Implications The budget's adoption--a signal by both parliamentary chambers of their acquiescence to the government's economic policy--may mark a milestone in Russia's political reform process, formally transforming some of Yeltsin's critics into players in determining policy and bringing an unprecedented openness to the debate on the country's military spending. In casting their votes in favor of the budget, some of Yeltsin's harshest critics from the nationalist opposition, especially the CPRF and LDPR, now have accepted a shared responsibility for the plight of the military. Their vote--which the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (16 june) construed as a vote against an "adequate defense budget"--may undercut their criticisms of Yeltsin's security policy and weaken their support among military personnel. The unprecedented debate carried out in the country's press and broadcast media on the military budget has probably drawn new public attention to the question of how much defense the country can afford, and, during a period of widespread economic hardship, possibly reduced sympathy for the Ministry of Defense's attempts to protect servicemen. The Defense Minis try itself may in the future find that it has to expand its lobbying efforts beyond the government and the Duma's Defense Committee to gain legislative votes, a move that could further open up defense policymaking to legislative influence. The legislature's lenient treatment of the 1994 budget may not, however, accurately foreshadow the 1995 budget process. The Federal Assembly passed the 1994 budget quickly and with relatively few changes largely because of Rybkin's unwillingness to let the Duma defeat it, Duma Budget Committee Chairman Zadornov's efforts to institutionalize the budget process and get away from the ad hoc quarterly budgets of recent years, and the Federation Council's surprisingly rapid abandonment of its opposition. With the experience of one budget behind it and more time to work on the 1995 budget, the legislature may be more forceful in its future efforts to effect changes in the government's economic policy. Box 1 The 1994 Budget Process In March the Duma adopted special procedures for considering and adopting the 1994 budget, reducing the duration of the budget hearings and authorizing the Budget, Finance, Banking, and Finance Committee to coordinate and expedite the amendment process to make up for the delay in the government's submission of the budget (ITAR-TASS, 23 March; Rossiyskiye Vesti, 25 March). The 1994 budget went through the following steps: 18 March -- Premier Chernomyrdin submitted the government's draft budget to the State Duma. 23 March -- The Duma determined procedures for reviewing the draft. 15 April -- The Duma began preliminary hearings on the budget with Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin formally presenting the government's draft. The Duma adopted the budget "in principle" in a vote of 225-57, 21 abstentions (Interfax, 15 April), thus beginning the formal review process. 11 May -- The Duma approved the budget's basic parameters in a first reading vote of 237-77, 12 abstentions (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 7 june). After the first reading the budget was sent to committees for detailed review. As stipulated in the procedures adopted in March, the budget committee has responsibility for coordinating all amendments proposed by the committees and recommending their adoption or rejection at the budget's second reading. 8 june -- The Duma approved the budget on the second reading, after which, according to the Duma's regulations, no further amendments can be introduced. 22 june -- The Duma was scheduled to vote on the budget on the third and last reading, but despite Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin's prediction that it would be a "formal" vote on the law's "juridical" language (Interfax, 9 june), the budget went down in defeat in three separate attempts (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 22 june). 24 june -- The Duma held a repeat vote for the third reading, passing the budget 273-80, 8 abstentions (ITAR-TASS, 24 june). The Duma then passed the budget immediately to the Federation Council, despite rules giving it five days to forward the bill to the upper house. The Federation Council also adopted the budget the same day. After the budget's approval by the Federation Council, it is forwarded to President Yeltsin for his signature. End Box 1 Box 2 Federation Council Leaders on Record Opposing Budget Prior to the suprise 24 June vote in favor of the budget, Federation Council leaders had suggested that the upper chamber would reject the budget on the grounds that the modest defense allocation would hurt regions economically dependent on large defense industries. Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko predicted after the Duma's first reading that the Federation Council would reject the budget because rejection was "in the interests of Russia's regions" (ITAR-TASS, 18 May). At a conference of regional legislative leaders after the second reading, Shumeyko emphasized the importance of a large defense budget for the regions, stating that "for 33 regions, the defense sector forms the basis of their industry" (Ostankino TV, 11 June). In attacking the Duma's adoption of the budget, Shumeyko has contended that the Duma represents narrow party interests while the regions--represented in the Federation Council-- " reflect the real state of affairs in Russia" (Ostankino TV, 11 June). On a more strident note, he even darkly implied that the Duma's "political set up" makes it interested in destabilizing the political situation, and its vote on the budget reveals its thinking that "the worse [the situation is], the better; we'll change the authorities more quickly"* (Moscow NTV, 9 June) Although less strident than Shumeyko, who may be pursuing his own political ambitions, other Federation Council leaders appeared to share his views. The chamber's budget and finance committee chairman, Nikolay Gonchar, stated that the Duma's modest defense allocation "will bring the manufacturing industries of [33 of Russia's] regions to their knees" (Interfax, 9 June). Similarly, Defense and Security Committee Chairman Petr Shirshov claimed that increasing the defense budget would benefit 33 regions and warned that the R37 trillion allocated by the Duma for defense will prevent the military from replacing obsolescent equipment and force cuts in training and exercises (Krasnaya Zvezda, 9 june). Suggesting that the chamber as a whole shared its leaders' views, the Federation Council adopted a decree on 2 June calling for an increase in expenditures of R23 trillion, including a R55 trillion outlay for defense, but support for the decree was hard to gauge since the media were not observed to report a vote total (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 3 june). * In what appears to have been a misrepresentation of Yeltsin's position, presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov also implied that the Duma's disinclination to approve the higher defense allocation was an attempt to foment friction between Yeltsin and the military. Kostikov quoted Yeltsin as saying that the Duma's defense allocation was "not adequate enough," and Kostikov remarked that it was a "ploy . . . to put the Army on a ration so as to bring it into a head-on collision with the president" (Interfax, 19 May). End Box 2 Box 3 Military Lobbying Efforts Faulted Senior Russian military officials, apparently confident that the Duma would increase the armed forces budget allocation from the recommended R37 trillion to R55 trillion, reportedly were stunned when the Duma refused to approve the increase on the budget's first reading on 11 May (Kommersant-Daily, 14 May). Despite what one television reporter termed a "furious" lobbying effort following the 11 May vote (Moscow NTV, 22 May), the military was unable to secure enough votes to significantly increase the defense allocation before the budget was approved on its second reading on 8 June. Russian media have attributed the failure to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's poor lobbying tactics and the military media's ineffectiveness in generating public sympathy for the armed forces. Grachev's Performance Criticized According to Kommersant-Daily (14 May), some Defense Ministry officials said Grachev made a "strategic mistake" in relying too heavily on the apparent support of President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. "Certain" that a favorable defense budget would be approved with their support, commentator Ilya Bulavinov wrote, Grachev "left the parliament completely out of his considerations." The result was "a situation where virtually no one defended the military's interests in the State Duma." Even the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (7 June) suggested that military lobbying had failed. Parliamentary reporter Vladimir Yermolin, noting that lobbying "is a relatively new phenomenon in our life," suggested that reasoned arguments are not enough--" the main thing is to get busy with your elbows; the army has not learned this yet." Grachev's ineffective lobbying may also result from his alleged reluctance to engage the Duma on other issues. According to the government newspaper Rossiyskiye Vesti (21 June), legislators--including Defense Committee Deputy Chairman Yevgeniy Loginov--have often complained about Grachev's preference for sending subordinates to meet with Duma members rather than attending himself. Indeed, in his own statements Grachev suggests that the military saw its main enemy in the budget battle as the Finance Ministry- -not the Duma--and leaves the impression that he regards political trench warfare as beneath him. On the eve of the budget fight, Grachev suggested that within the government "only the Finance Ministry" was "insisting" on the recommended defense budget (Interfax, 17 March). Similarly, in an 18 March interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Grachev said that "unless the Finance Ministry yields," the Russian military would become "an army of unemployed men." In the same interview, Grachev provides a clue to his attitude toward lobbying: "I do not want to make any threats, nor do I intend to humiliate myself by begging. At government meetings I put forward concrete figures so that it is clear where such a policy [the Finance Ministry's proposed budget] could lead us." Military Media Castigated In addition to the lobbying efforts of senior Defense Ministry officials, the ministry's public relations arm--especially its radio and television studio*--has since its inception in late 1992 been trying to generate public support for the military's interests by airing programs that highlight the plight of the average serviceman, especially lack of housing and low pay. With the military's budget failure in the Duma, the effort seems to have fallen victim to internal recriminations and second guessing: -- According to Komsomolskaya Pravda (26 May), the ministry's Central Radio and Television Broadcasting Studio was subjected to severe internal criticism following the Duma's first budget vote. The article claimed that Gen. Vladimir Kosarev, the chief of the ministry's Information and Press Directorate, which oversees the ministry's studio, "came down like a ton of bricks" on the studio for failure to "give wide and full representation . . . of the process of developing the Russian army" and accused the studio of "financial irregularities" and "nepotism." Kosarev also reportedly called for replacing the studio leadership with "more experienced cadres." -- While not mentioning the studio's performance explicitly, Krasnaya Zvezda suggested that publicizing the plight of Russian servicemen does not elicit much sympathy from an already impoverished people. A 9 June article by Yermolin questioned the need "to paint a vivid picture" of army life. "In a country where the majority of the population only just makes ends meet, people are no longer shocked by the notion of a poverty stricken officer." In another article on 10 June, Yermolin acknowledged that "no one was shaken" by portrayals of "the problems faced by the army, by officers and their families, and of the tragedy of the defense industry." * The ministry's radio and television studio produces a number of programs that air regularly on national and regional radio and television networks as well as through the military's own broadcasting outlets. The studio also contributes to civilian news programs, such as Vesti and Novosti. End Box 3 Box 4 Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin Lukewarm Toward Military President Yeltsin apparently offered little more than verbal support to the military's effort to raise defense spending to R55 trillion. In response to a March memorandum from Defense Minister Pavel Grachev warning of the inadequacy of the planned defense budget, Yeltsin only tepidly endorsed the military's position, reportedly writing that he "share[d] the defense minister's concern' (Izvestiya, 12 May). However, it was not until the day before the budget's first reading that Yeltsin reportedly sent a message to Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin saying "I consider it expedient to agree" with the R55 trillion allocation (Interfax, 10 May). After the second reading, when it was clear that the Communists, Agrarians, and even a majority of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russian (LDPR) faction--the very factions that have so frequently accused Yeltsin of destroying the army--had voted for the more modest defense allocation, Yeltsin evidently saw little need to fight for the military. At his Independence Day press conference, Yeltsin indicated that the military would have to learn to live within its budget and criticized the armed forces for not making cuts "more energetically." He indicated that Russia could not support the 3-million-strong army of the former Soviet Union and also said there "must be some reduction" in defense industry orders (Russian TV, 10 June). To that end, he has reportedly drafted a presidential edict that will reduce state orders to defense enterprises (ITAR-TASS, 18 June). The military also failed to find an ally in Premier Chernomyrdin, who demonstrated a commitment to fiscal restraint with the 1994 budget. During the Duma's first reading of the budget, Chernomyrdin cautioned deputies that "only a strictly balanced budget can mobilize the market" and emphasized that the government's deficit target would ensure that inflation is kept "under control" (ITAR-TASS, 11 May). At a meeting of the Russian Government Presidium the following day, Chernomyrdin acknowledged that the defense budget was an "important problem" and said that the government "shall back the military-industrial complex," but he stopped short of endorsing increased funding (ITAR-TASS, 12 May). Moreover, Chernomyrdin is reportedly prepared to seek further cuts in allocations for the military, including abolishing credits for military housing construction, one of the Defense Ministry's highest priority programs (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 18 May).
