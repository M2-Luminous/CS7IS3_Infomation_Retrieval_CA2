The Vostokredmet industrial association, which until recently mined and refined uranium, is situated in a suburb of Khudzhand, an oblast center of Tajikistan. Thirty-five thousand people, mostly Russians, who live and work at and around the site have suddenly become unwanted by anyone, including Russia, in a republic in the grip of a military confrontation. But the golden minds and hands of these people have done everything to save the enterprise. The construction of a gold refining production line is now almost complete at the combine, which will allow independent Tajikistan to have its gold in ingots by the New Year holiday. Specialists at the combine designed and built all the refining equipment themselves. [passage omitted] [Video shows fields, machinery, lathes, panel marked "F-16 Electronic Casting Machine"]
