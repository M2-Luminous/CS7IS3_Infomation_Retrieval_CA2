At the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng welcomed President Moi's third visit to China on behalf of the Chinese Government, saying the Chinese Government and people attach great importance to the Sino-Kenyan relationship and to the friendship between the two peoples. He thanked their joint efforts and was pleased to see the smooth development of their bilateral relationship. China will continue to work together with Kenya to consolidate and develop bilateral ties. Li Peng said Kenya is an important country of influence in Africa. The Kenyan Government and people, under the leadership of President Moi, have experienced gratifying achievements in safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity, and developing the national economy. China appreciates Kenya's foreign policy of peace and non-alignment, and of maintaining friendly relations with its neighboring countries. China also appreciates Kenya's positive contribution to safeguarding stability and development in East Africa. Turning to China's reform and construction, Li Peng said China, a developing country with a large population, needs decades of more effort to become strong and prosperous. Therefore, the tasks ahead are arduous, and there is still a long way to go. China has undergone great changes following 15 years of reform in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. One important experience China has gained over the past 15 years which needs to be emphasized is China has always paid attention to the correct handling of relations between reform, development, and maintaining stability. Li Peng continued, saying reform can be deepened and economic and social development promoted only under stable conditions. In the course of reform, China encourages the spirit of making bold exploration and constantly summing up experience. All reform measures should be tested in practice. A measure will be persisted in and perfected so long as it is beneficial to developing productivity, to strengthening the comprehensive national power, and to raising the people's living standards. Moi said he would leave China for home with a full memory of goodwill from the Chinese Government and people. The president added that he witnessed the great development of the Chinese economy during his visit. Moi said he wanted to congratulate the Chinese people for their achievements, and added he has achieved his goal of further enhancing and developing the friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries, particularly economic and trade relations. Moi also said he completely agreed with Li Peng's view on "the need for each country to choose its own path of development in line with its circumstances." Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of culture; Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister; and Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation; J.J. Kamotho, minister of education; K. Kones, minister of state in the president's office; P.L. Lotodo, minister of home affairs and national heritage; and James Simani, Kenyan ambassador to China.
