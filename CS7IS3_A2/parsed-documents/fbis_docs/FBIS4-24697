Located in northeast China's Liaoning Province, on the northernmost part of the country's coastline, the city is separated from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by a river. In its trade with Korea, Dandong exports grain, beef, meat, textile goods, household electrical appliances and light industry products, and imports steel, timber and aquatic products. The city now has more than 170 companies doing business with Korean partners. During recent trade talks in Pyongyang, the city's representatives signed 11.9 million U.S. dollars-worth of contracts for imports and exports with their Korean opposite numbers. This year, the city has issued a set of measures to encourage the border trade. Dandong was included in the opening up coastal area in 1988 and became a government-approved border trade zone in 1992.
