FR941122-1-00032 FR941122-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;172&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) Series Airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require a visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs on the ignition selector switch, and removal and correct installation of any improperly installed wire termination lugs. This proposal would also require application of sealant to the wire termination lugs and the attachment screws. This proposal is prompted by a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine components, and possible fire in the cowling, due to an uncontained failure of the engine starter. DATES: Comments must be received by January 19, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;172&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Dept. LS1, M.C. 2&hyph;98.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;172&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;172&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The FAA has received a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred on a Model DC&hyph;9 series airplane. After the airplane landed, inspection revealed that an uncontained failure of the engine starter on engine No. 2 had occurred. Investigation revealed that a wire termination lug in the ignition selector switch was installed barrel down, and consequently, contacted an adjacent terminal, causing an electrical short. This electrical short at the ignition selector switch caused the engine start valve to stay open and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. This condition, if not corrected, could result in damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine components, and possible fire in the cowling. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 24&hyph;121, dated February 24, 1992, which describes procedures for visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs on the ignition selector switch. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removal and proper installation of the wire termination lug if it is found to be installed incorrectly. Additionally, the service bulletin describes procedures for the application of a sealant to the termination lugs and attachment screws. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs on the ignition selector switch. The proposed AD would also require removal of the wire termination lugs and reinstallation, if they are installed improperly. Additionally, the proposed AD would require the application of a sealant to the termination lugs and attachment screws. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. [ Note: As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.] There are approximately 1,954 Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,097 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be nominal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $131,640 or $120 per airplane.
