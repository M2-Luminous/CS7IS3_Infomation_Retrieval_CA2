PLO Executive Committee Member Dr. Samir Ghawshah told a MENA correspondent in Tunis that at a meeting last night, the committee emphasized its rejection of the Israeli response to the demands sent by the PLO after the massacre. The demands were to disarm settlers, remove settlements, and provide protection for the Palestinians. Ghawshah remarked that the decisions the PLO received after the Israeli Cabinet meeting yesterday were bad, not in proportion with the nature of the massacre, contained nothing new, and failed to provide solutions. He added that the decisions indicate that Rabin's government is maintaining the policy of hegemony, intransigence, stalling for time, and failing to provide any solutions or even give a chance to efforts to deal with what happened. He said the Israelis proposed disarming a limited, specific number of individual settlers. But they refused to provide international protection for the Palestinian citizens under occupation. He explained that this means maintaining the settlements as an armed force in violation of the law and agreements. He stressed that the Palestinians cannot accept the existence of an irregular armed force when they take charge of security in Gaza and Jericho. Ghawshah added that the Executive Committee also discussed the American proposal to hold urgent negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides in Washington. He pointed out that there is a general feeling within the committee that changing the venue of the talks will be useless if the same lists of negotiators are maintained, if the United States does not play a basic role as a partner and sponsor of the peace process, if pressure is not put on Israel to honor its commitments, and if the essence of these negotiations remains the same. He explained that the U.S. proposal, which the PLO approved in principle, raises many questions on its ultimate goal: Does it really aim to boost the peace process or just to contain the situation resulting from the massacre? He pointed out that the American response to these questions and the U.S. proposals involve no real change in the peace process in terms of its essence and form or in terms of the U.S. bias toward Israel. Ghawshah noted that no final decision has been made on participation in the Washington talks or on the date for this participation. He added that this issue is still being discussed. The Palestinian official added that the committee will resume its meetings tonight with the participation of the heads of the negotiating teams to follow up on the decisions the UN Security Council will adopt. He remarked that these decisions will reflect the real stance of the Council members on the peace process, particularly the stance of the United States. Ghawshah praised the resolutions adopted last night by the Arab League Council, saying they constitute a real starting point and an excellent step toward restoring Arab solidarity and supporting the lawful rights of the Palestinian people. He affirmed that the decision in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to suspend talks with the Israeli side in Washington in protest of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre shows that coordination and solidarity have returned and that the pan-Arab common interest and national security take priority over everything else.
