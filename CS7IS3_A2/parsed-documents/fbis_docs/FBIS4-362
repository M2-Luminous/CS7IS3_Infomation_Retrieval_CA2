The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] says, however, that it will present no one for the National Electoral Council, CNE, adding that that is one issue still to be discussed. Pedro Manuel, our correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports: Some technical issues pertaining to the UN Angola Verification Mission-2's mandate and the second round of presidential elections were discussed during the meeting. The negotiating teams remained in the warmth of their hotels. UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has left for Geneva to discuss the process of negotiation with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Beye is only expected back on 8 or 9 April. Until then, there will be no work for the negotiating teams. In fact, some people say that the proceedings will only resume on 11 April. There was talk yesterday that UNITA was proposing changes to the CNE's organizational and functional framework. Things were made clearer today: UNITA believes that competing parties should enjoy parity representation on the CNE. What is more, Jonas Savimbi's organization also says that public figures in the CNE must not be picked by the president of the Republic alone. UNITA has described these as necessary changes to some points contained in the Electoral Law. Nothing is known about the government's reaction to that UNITA proposal. If we think back, however, we will realize that the government has always said that legal issues can only be dealt with in Parliament.
