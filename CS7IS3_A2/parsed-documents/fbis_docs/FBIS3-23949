The Adviser to the Prime Minister on His Former Boss"] [Text] On the heels of the resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov followed the resignation of Andrey Illarionov, head of the analysis and planning group under the prime minister. The resignation was completely logical, since it was precisely Illarionov, side by side with Gaydar and Fedorov, who was a most active proponent of an intensified toughness in credit and financial policy. Our conversation took place on the day after the announcement of the resignation. [Travin] Today you are taking your leave of Chernomyrdin with a fair amount of fanfare. But when your collaboration was beginning, you evaluated the prime minister's possibilities as a reformer, evidently, fairly optimistically? At that time, the union of Chernomyrdin and Illarionov surprised many people. [Illarionov] To be precise, I must note that I did not come to Chernomyrdin. I was simply appointed to the post of head of the analysis and planning group. The proposal that I fill the post in question came to me at the end of January of last year. I said that I needed to think about it. The mulling lasted for three months. Chernomyrdin during that time did not express any great desire to appoint me to the post, and I did not strive toward it, particularly. More than that, if in January our meetings were fairly regular, in the spring I was not able see him for more than two months on a very important matter. At that time, the government apparatus was engaged in the quiet suffocation of the working center of economic reforms (an organ created by Gaydar at the dawn of the reform--D.T.). I wanted to discuss this problem and to stop the destruction, but Chernomyrdin evaded a meeting with me. There were days when I spent almost 24 hours in the prime minister's waiting room, but my efforts were spent without success. It became clear that Chernomyrdin was well apprised of the problems of the working center, and that everything was taking place with his knowledge. I ceased any attempts at establishing contact. Suddenly, on 26 April, several hours after the results of the April referendum became known, the telephone rang, and I was invited to a meeting with the prime minister. Everyone remembers the results of the referendum today, just as they remember that on the eve of the voting many people evaluated Yeltsin's chances for victory extremely skeptically. I spent three hours with Chernomyrdin at that time. An unprecedented fact. After all, the prime minister, and especially at such a moment, had an enormous number of important matters to attend to. It suddenly transpired that the order naming me to the post of head of the analysis and planning group had long been ready. And now no one was asking for my assent. [Travin] But you, apparently, perceived Chernomyrdin's actions as a sudden change in his consciousness, brought about under the influence of the referendum. The possibilities of cooperation in such a political situation were evaluated more optimistically than during the time you were trying to get through on the subject of the working center. [Illarionov] It was not a change in consciousness, but precisely a change in the political game. It was necessary to demonstrate to the public some change in the composition of the government. My optimism applied not to April but rather to January, when it seemed that Chernomyrdin grasped reformist ideas. At that time, after all, he gave voice to several very strong speeches, in Davos, for example. It seemed to me that the prime minister was not simply repeating my words, but perceived what was said as his very own. In April I no longer thought this, but I still believed that I could bring some benefit if I were in the post in question. Our relations remained more or less acceptable until July, that is, until the moment that Mr. Gerashchenko conducted his money reform. The prime minister supported this reform. [Travin] Soon after this, you made a series of sharp statements, coming out in print against the reform. Obviously, there was some kind of confrontation with Chernomyrdin? [Illarionov] We had two conversations on this topic. The most serious was on 29 July. We talked for about an hour with raised voices and could not find common ground for a long time. Finally, I said that I had to go to a press conference that had been arranged earlier. The prime minister got scared and said that he forbade me to give it. I have to say that it was originally planned to hold the press conference on Ilinka. But the government press center issued a statement--three times, in fact--to the effect that it would not take place. I announced to its management that I would speak with journalists in any case, even if I had to do so in the street; plus I would tell them about the prohibition laid on the meeting with the press. In the end I managed, bypassing the press center, to come to an agreement on the conduct of a press conference on Zubovskiy Boulevard. It was to that place that I planned to go from Chernomyrdin's office. When the prime minister tried to forbid me to meet with the press, I said that it was impossible to call it off and that the best egress from the situation that had taken shape would be the personal appearance of Chernomyrdin at Zubovskiy Boulevard. And I added that he should make a statement on the erroneousness and criminality of the money reform and that Gerashchenko had led the government astray. To that the prime minister responded that he was not about to do that but that still, now he had begun to understand the situation better. He also expressed regret that our conversation had not taken place earlier. [Travin] But after all, the conversation could not have taken place earlier, since the whole government was not informed in advance about the conduct of the money reform in such a variant. [Illarionov] Of course. That was the reason that I still insisted that I would hold the press conference. To this I received the response: Illarionov, do not forget yourself.... [Travin] He came out and said that? [Illarionov] No, in fact he said it much more sharply, but I am not going to repeat his expression now. Then the prime minister gave me to understand that no one in particular was keeping me in the government. To which I, likewise, frankly gave him to understand that I was not hanging onto the job but that I was obligated to speak my mind directly, both to the prime minister, since I was his adviser, and to the journalists. The upshot was that we agreed that I would refrain after all from any statements to the press; however, the prime minister had to convince the president of the fallaciousness of the conducted money reform and (since repealing it was already impossible) of the necessity of immediately firing Gerashchenko. The agreement was strictly a gentlemen's one. I fulfilled it completely, saying not a word at the press conference about the money reform. Chernomyrdin did not keep his promise. [Travin] Did the prime minister never realize the harmfulness of the money reform, or was the patronage of the Central Bank's policy a conscious political play on his part? [Illarionov] The main goal of the activity both of Chernomyrdin and of Gerashchenko consists by no means in the reformation of the economy, but in the attainment of a maximum of power, both on the territory of Russia and also beyond its borders: within the framework of the entire former Soviet Union. Money reform in the form in which it was conducted answered only one goal--the restoration of the USSR, at least in questions of the conduct of credit and monetary policy. [Travin] Immediately after the exchange of banknotes, representatives of the republics of the CIS came running to Moscow.... [Illarionov] And they ran to see not the president, or even the prime minister, but precisely Gerashchenko--the person distributing the money. And the policy of gathering all the republics under the Russian roof almost succeeded. The agreement on the ruble zone of a new type was prepared on an emergency basis and quickly signed. [Travin] How in the world, after that episode, did relations with Chernomyrdin evolve? [Illarionov] They hardly evolved at all. As a result of our conversation, I ended up in the hospital, where I spent more than a month. After that, I convalesced in a sanatorium, although not very successfully. Then I went to work, but for the last half-year Chernomyrdin has not once shown a desire to speak with the head of his analysis and planning group or to give him any kind of assignment. He and I met only three times, at my initiative, and these meetings worked out because they were held at times of emergency: on the night of 21-22 September, on the night of 3-4 October, and on the morning of 13 December. [Travin] Were these meetings marked by anything in particular? [Illarionov] Each of them was memorable in its own way, but what brings them all together is the figure of the main hero of our conversations. Each time, we talked about Mr. Gerashchenko. In particular, on 13 December I spoke out about my understanding of the election results. In my view, a most important reason for such results was inflation. People voted not so much for Zhirinovskiy as against the government. It is interesting that Chernomyrdin, generally speaking, again promised me to resolve the issue of Gerashchenko. He asked me to provide him with materials substantiating the necessity for firing the chairman of the Central Bank, and he did receive these materials. In two weeks, the prime minister declared that he did not know a greater reformer than Mr. Gerashchenko and that there were no problems in working with him. [Travin] Much is being said today to the effect that Chernomyrdin aspires to the presidency. How do you assess his chances? [Illarionov] They are very high. At least, among the candidates there are at the given moment. There is no question that Chernomyrdin is a talented politician. He knows how to avoid conflict and criticism aimed in his direction. After all, even after having spent more than a year in the prime minister's seat, he was able to represent the situation in such a way that all the fire of criticism for the economic problems was directed at Gaydar and Fedorov. Besides, he has been able more than anyone else to gain the favor of the president. [Travin] How did he manage to get so far into his good graces? [Illarionov] I think that personal qualities were at work here, and also the fact that the president and the prime minister are people of the same generation. Gaydar and Fedorov have neither the same life experience behind them as does Chernomyrdin, nor a period of administrating the largest gas corporation in the country, with a billion-dollar turnover. Chernomyrdin is a person who stands firmly on his feet. Suffice it to recall how he appeared in the government in May 1992, and immediately in the post of deputy prime minister, and not minister of fuel and energy. There is much that is mysterious in the story of the firing of Lopukhin (the former minister of fuel and energy) and the appointment of Chernomyrdin. [Travin] In order to become president, Chernomyrdin will have to go through the procedure of national elections, and that is a different story than apparat games. [Illarionov] That is exactly what will be the simplest thing. In the first place, the prime minister has already accomplished a great many trips around the regions, and he has met with a mass of people. Everywhere, he has made good contacts, since he has said, "Yes," and not "No." In the second place, the balance of forces will be approximately the following. On the democratic flank--Yavlinskiy, possibly Shakhray, possibly Gaydar. In the center--Chernomyrdin. On the right--Zhirinovskiy. Only Zhirinovskiy and Chernomyrdin will emerge in the second round. After that, all clear-thinking people will start to call to vote for Chernomyrdin, and since, I am convinced, most Russians are sober-minded people, he is exactly who will become president. [Travin] Could all of that happen earlier than in two years? [Illarionov] It could, If, in a year and a half, the country finds itself in a condition of hyperinflation, the question will arise as to who is responsible for this. Since the prime minister has already repeatedly proven his amazing capacity for evading direct responsibility, then probably a multitude of people will appear who will do everything possible so that the responsibility lies with the president. [Travin] What awaits the country under President Chernomyrdin? [Illarionov] Policy will be about the same as it has been lately under Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. We will have a highly monopolized economy with an enormous share of expensive governmental regulation. And the basis for the monopolies will be the old ministerial structures. It is fairly clear what will be in the political sphere. If under President Yeltsin human rights are basically observed, judging from the customs that reign in Chernomyrdin's team, the situation could change in a radical way. Take if only the recent accusation of Fedorov that after his resignation announcement, he supposedly went to the U.S. Embassy and asked for a profitable job overseas. Chernomyrdin also committed a rudeness to Gaydar soon after the latter returned to the government. He declared that the first deputy prime minister would do as he was directed. In Italy, in a moment of candor, it was said that in Moscow Chernomyrdin was in command. That says a lot. [end Illarionov] When our conversation with the former head of the analysis and planning group was over, an INTERFAX tape was brought in, which contained the well-known report by the government press service to the effect that Andrey Illarionov had been fired for absenteeism. This was the interpretation of his recent business trip to London, attempting to show that it was not a matter of ideological differences and not of voluntary resignation, but of an ordinary violation of work discipline, which somehow happened at a moment very convenient for the prime minister.
