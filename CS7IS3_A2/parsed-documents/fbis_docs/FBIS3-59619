It was not, however, ready to alter its views for the sake of rapidly establishing a unified structure of research in East and West. One of its principles is to establish a basic research institute only when there is an exceptional individual to lead it who represents an area of work, within a creditable and primarily academic field, which promises maximum innovations. Therefore, according to President Hans Zacher in Berlin, an immediate program was begun in 1990, in which new and time-limited types of institutional research support were employed. To benefit university research in the East and at the same time to create appropriate fields for future Max Planck Institutes, so-called "task forces" were set up. Organizationally accompanied by the MPS and provided with "adequate" equipment, they were able to begin immediately and with "high scientific standards" in the universities in the new states. However, they can only count on the support of the MPS for five years. By then they must be integrated into the current universities. To this purpose, agreements were made with the universities to appoint the group directors as university teachers, even though the universities were burdened with large surpluses in personnel. There was hardly any resistance from this side appealing to university autonomy in the choice of professors. The original goal of 25 groups has even been exceeded with a total of 28 task forces (270 positions) at seven universities in the five new states and Berlin. In addition, according to Zacher, the MPS at the suggestion of the Council on Science converted two additional, long alien patterns of organization--also on only a time-limited basis: In Berlin two so-called branches of existing MPS institutes from the old states began work. The one is looked after by the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Extraterrestrial Physics, the other by the MPI for Plasma Physics, both in Garching near Berlin. Whether they will remain in this form longer than the agreed five years will be decided by a later investigation. It is said that even university affiliation, especially with Humboldt University in Berlin, is conceivable. In the end the MPS saw itself compelled by the Science Council to do something for the humanities task forces worth preserving from institutes of the "Academy of the Sciences of the GDR." They did not appear to be suitable as cores of autonomous MPS institutes, because their directions in research (European Enlightenment, History of Science, Literary Research, Modern Orient, Middle Eastern European Culture, Period History and General Linguistics) could all be established at universities, even if this didn't succeed at first. They were therefore gathered in Berlin in seven "main humanities research foci," so-called centers--not, however, under the cover of the MPS itself, but under that of their own sponsor established for them. Whether they remain more than alien elements is still open. Recommendations concerning their future were obtained from a commission which involved researchers from the outside in addition to scientists of the MPS. Accordingly, the centers are either to operate in cooperation among themselves with "close contact" with the universities or to be established there directly. The Science Council will make recommendations regarding their final status by May 1994 at the latest. Until now there has been resistance by the universities against the new "categories" and disagreement between the federal government and the states on financing. The closer the centers are to the universities, the more certain will their financing be a state matter. If they remain separate from the universities, other ways of financing would have to be found. It is precisely this, however, which could be difficult; because newly founded institutions have for some time been blocked by the Federal Minister of Finance. According to Zacher, the existence of the centers might depend to a great extent on the duration or extension of the "start-up financing," which in the meantime is assured until the end of 1994. Thus, the MPS will in the end give up all the institutions of their immediate program--task forces, branches, centers; they are only temporarily lodged with the society. In the meantime the attention of the MPS in the new states is mainly aimed at establishing institutes which strive for innovation. Seven institutes have already been founded. Both of the Max Planck Institutes for Microstructure Physics (Halle) and for Colloid and Interface Research (Teltow) materialized due to recommendations from the Science Council. The MPS has established five more under its own direction: the Institutes for Infection Biology and for History of Science (both in Berlin), for Plant Physiology (Potsdam), for Economic Systems Research (Jena) and for Physics of Complex Systems (Dresden). In the final stage, there should be 15 to 20 institutes in the east part of Germany. A density will thereby have been reached which is comparable to that in the old states, now with 65 institutes and independent research groups.
