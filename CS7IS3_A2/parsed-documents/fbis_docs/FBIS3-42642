The origins and consequences of the success of Zhirinovskiyism will be analyzed for a long time to come. At present, we should be most interested in the aspects of the Russian experience that could manifest themselves during our election drama. Precisely a drama because it is hard to call elections anything but a dramatic mistake at a time of severe crisis and confusion in all strata of society and power circles. It has now become clear that the split of reformist forces in Russia into several blocs, which most probably was a tactical move by Yeltsin aimed at taking away as many votes from the Communists as possible, scattered the platforms of reformers and diverted the attention and interest of the voters away from them. The second mistake of Russian reformers followed from the first: Certain of their victory over the Communists, they turned the television and agitation campaign into something of an election show, into clowning, giving the opportunity to the one whom the reformers perceived as a clown to rivet the attention of citizens to the sweet and specific promises. It turns out that the clown was experienced: He knew well how to get the people to laugh and how to get them interested. At present, there are two main sociopolitical ideologies in Ukraine--the national and the social. These ideologies do not exist in a completely autonomous manner, they penetrate each other. Hey, even the most obstinate nationalist wants to eat, and the most avowed socialist remembers what his nationality is. However, each of them lays a different emphasis on food and the nation. For some, "an independent Ukraine" is continuously lit up on the display of their consciousness, and for others, it is "I want to live well." Some are prepared to eat poorly or even die for a free Ukraine, whereas others may, under certain conditions, give up its independence. In keeping with the above, we will have two main platforms, the left and the right, in our elections. The left consists mainly of the Socialists, the Communists, and the peasant party; the right--of the Republicans, the Democrats, the Rukh people, and so on. It is not known whether various parties of the left persuasion will dare to unite with the Communists or among themselves. Right-wing parties have announced the creation of the Standing Council (PDN) to coordinate candidates and efforts. A third force, which we may conventionally call the "new democrats," has undoubtedly quite clearly emerged in Ukraine. These are for the most part former Communists who deliberately and clearly embarked on the path of our statehood and a market economy on the basis of private and joint-stock property. Nevertheless, for ethical and tactical considerations they do not go for an alliance with parties of a rightist orientation. This primarily concerns the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. A considerable number of politicians, such as Ivan Plyushch, belong to this wing. If we try to classify in principle those on whom the efforts of the parties will be targeted, we may distinguish two main types of voters. Politically aware individuals whom agitation does not influence at all because they have long known who to vote for are the first type. Those who are socially, or "sausage-wise," aware belong to the second type. They voted in favor of the independence of Ukraine mainly because they believed in a better life under conditions of independence. They have now been deeply disappointed. It is hard to say precisely what the number of voters of this type is on the whole or in individual regions. However, we may already say two things with certainty: Such voters are the majority, and their political culture and competency are a veritable "black box," a mixture of "mush" of various kinds. These people are desperate. They are worn out, and they do not trust anyone anymore. At present, they are saying indignantly while standing in lines that they will not turn out to vote. If they do turn out, who will they vote for? Probably there will be no votes for the Communists and Socialists if they do not disguise themselves. They carry around baggage that is too infamous. As far as the national-democrats are concerned, a considerable proportion of the "sausage-minded" treat them with aggressive fury. They say that, first, under the democrats everything has fallen apart and worsened. Second, in the eyes of the "sausage-minded," the democrats have turned out to be the same thieves as the partocrats. "They are all the same"--such is the motto of the lines in stores. The truth about the allocation of apartments to some deputies and the purchase of cars shortly before prices for them were raised is intertwined with bizarre gossip. Attempts to convince the people that Larysa Skoryk did not buy three cars and that she does not have a four-floor dacha bring nothing but sneers. Recently I learned that parquet floors have been laid in the building at Pryrichna Street where some deputies live and that there is even a cafeteria there to which sugar, butter, meat, and other foodstuffs are delivered, and that prices in the cafeterias and the canteen of the Supreme Council are one-third of what they are in the stores. If only these people knew that not only are the parquet floors and the cafeteria absent but that the deputies rarely manage to get even sugar and butter distributed through lists drawn up by housing maintenance offices. Prices in the cafeterias of the Supreme Council are at restaurant levels, and for this reason there are always few people there. On one occasion I ventured to identify myself as a deputy while in line for milk; in response I heard a unanimous roar of laughter. A man with a clearly rural background stated: "He would not be standing here if he were a deputy. What a joker!" [rendered in Russian in the original] He told a story about the deputies recently having "started a fight among themselves in the Supreme Council store." [rendered in Russian in the original] There is no such store. So I understood a few truths. First: Lies of this kind can only be circulated in a purposeful, thought-out, and planned manner, with a knowledge of the mentality of the citizens. Second: The stream of "information" of this kind will greatly increase as the elections draw nearer. There is no doubt that few of the current deputies will succeed in breaking through to the new Supreme Council. The waiting line for milk will not vote for the current democratic deputies. The line is looking for those who are guilty. It may even deal with them the way it dealt with the Tsar's family, capitalists, well-to-do peasants, and enemies of the people. The line is listening to a third force, which will promise them firm order. The line does not wish to know anything about the platforms of blocs. The line awaits specific promises for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and those making the promises will not be long in coming. They will promise to some to do away with lines, to some--to pay back the money in saving banks, to others--to set high salaries, to still others--to close down stands and force vendors to go work at plants, and to yet others they will promise a second state language, and they will promise everyone together that they will be financially disinterested, stop trips abroad, and vanquish the mafia. And if here and there they also foster hopes for a return to the ruble zone.... Thus, the step of the Zhirinovskiys is already heard. The social protest of the waiting lines is good enough soil for them. An alliance between the Zhirinovskiys of Russia and Ukraine may become a reality, too. A powerful opposition front should also become a reality, which, proceeding from the experience of elections in Russia, will call for a number of prerequisites. First. The number of criteria for resolving the issue of who among the deputies is "ours" or "not ours" should be reduced. Under certain conditions, the national-democrats should give support to all who advocate independence, even the Socialists. The Socialists should do the same. After all, the threat of a dictatorship is real. The wisdom of the people can hardly be relied upon. The people are wise, but it was precisely the people who brought Hitler to power in a constitutional manner; the people who voted for Stalin for almost 30 years; the people who rose up from their seats and clapped their hands in the era of "tits-ema-tits" [phonetic approximation of Brezhnev's way of pronouncing the word "systematic"], when yet another leader kept on talking about the general crisis of capitalism. Contenders for leaders are now numerous, and the election law makes it possible for virtually everyone to "stick out." Second. Preelection agitation should be exhaustive. Democracy is not just a choice, it is a choice in an environment of sufficient information. Will our parties be able to give people clear-cut promises substantiated in their words instead of hard-to-understand platforms? People believe promises rather than theories. As far as the democrats are concerned, their success will depend on whether they will be able to debunk three myths: 1) the myth that "independence is to blame for everything"; 2) the myth that "the democrats are to blame" for the economic collapse; 3) the myth that "they (i.e., the democrats) sold out for cars and low cafeteria prices." The democrats do not have much time--one month per myth.... From the author: I request that the honorarium be transferred to the VECHIRNIY KYYIV Fund.
