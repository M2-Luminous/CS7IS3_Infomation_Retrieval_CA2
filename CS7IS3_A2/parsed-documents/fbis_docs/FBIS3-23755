And his shirt, which Yuriy Luzhkov would don at games with a Russian Government team, would invariably sport the number 9--center forward. But last year, as a member of the Political Olympus of Russia team, Luzhkov got the number 11. The country's No. 11 politician in terms of influence--such was the result of a survey by the VP Service for the Study of Public Opinion and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 6 January 1994). No. 11 is an outside forward attacking the rival's goal by surprise, from the wing. There was hardly anyone who expected that Yuriy Luzhkov, who would invariably take up a position in the political backfield, would outrun many people. To judge by this rating, Luzhkov has, in fact, become a part of the government ring, which will boost or is already boosting his political career. In this same NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rating for 1993 Gavriil Popov, Yuriy Luzhkov's godfather in politics, came 32d. Yet in 1989, when the first democratically elected chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, who had a resonance throughout the country, adopted for the position of chairman of the Executive Committee Yuriy Luzhkov, the latter was only head of Moscow's Agro-Industrial Committee. He was a typical apparatchik of the party-economic mold--a strict and pragmatic leader who was very familiar with the municipal economy and knew how to make efficient use of the command-administrative system. There came to be talk in the governor general's house on Tverskaya at that time that the Moscow City Soviet had acquired an old bureaucratic hand. As a connoisseur of the command-administrative system, Popov was, of course, acting deliberately in appointing as his chief deputy a person from the Executive Committee of the times of Grishin and Saykin. He understood that Moscow could not be run by a democratic assembly of citizen non-gentry intellectuals. And Popov himself, by virtue of his stamp of character, had no great desire to busy himself with potatoes, street-sweeping, and the water main. The communist Luzhkov set about the job. And an old horse makes a straight furrow. In the Moscow of perestroyka times Yuriy Luzhkov in the office of chairman of the Moscow Agro-Industrial Committee was a benefactor of the co-operators since he granted permission for their activity. A good many of them had emerged at that time, and they rapidly inundated Moscow with fruit and vegetables. But their demise was swift, like a ripe plum falling from the branch--Saykin, chairman of the Executive Committee at that time, strangled the co-operators of all possible stripes with various sets of instructions. But many businessmen of this wave of enterprise, who had had a chance to get rich, did not forget Luzhkov. They are now running finance companies and banks and constitute the elite of Russian business. Some of them have become personal friends of Yuriy Luzhkov and his political capital. From a Business Manager to a Politician Three years ago Yuriy Mikhaylovich was saying in various auditoriums: "I am not a politician, I am a business manager. My job is to hold the city together." And, by and large, he has succeeded. Luzhkov became Popov's shadow. Democratic circles considered him one of them after he in fact opposed the Gorbachev government in February 1991 (troops had been brought in to Moscow to guard the Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR at that time). The leadership of the capital permitted a protest demonstration, and the Moscow militia protecting the demonstrators was led by Yuriy Luzhkov personally. The balance of power in the city gradually shifted to Luzhkov's corner office on Tverskaya with a view of the Yuriy Dolgorukoy monument and the Kremlin (Luzhkov still uses this office, incidentally, although he has in an official sense grown at least two levels)--the chairman of the Executive Committee has become a most influential figure. With every passing day Luzhkov acquired more power. At meetings of the Executive Committee he would "publicly flay" officials of the city administration and teach business managers how to operate and even sack them. There were few who came in for any praise here, and there were unkind, cutting words for everyone. But there was no grumbling since Luzhkov's command style was more comprehensible and kinder to the authorities than the clamorous sittings of the Moscow City Soviet. On 12 June 1991 Moscow elected not only the president of Russia but its first mayor also. Popov and Luzhkov (he acquired the title of vice mayor) amassed the most votes. The Executive Committee came to be called city hall, and the Executive Committee Presidium, the government, and Luzhkov become, in addition, premier of the Government of Moscow. Diarchy, which predetermined the similar development of events at a higher level, set in in the capital (still of the USSR at that time). But Popov and Luzhkov seized the initiative immediately--on the eve of the elections even all retirees were by decision of the former granted the possibility of free travel on municipal transport. This social trump card in the Popov-Luzhkov policy became one of the main ones, and Muscovites' affections remained on the side of city hall through the termination of the existence of the Moscow City Soviet. Yuriy Luzhkov was, as before, in the shadow of the democrat mayor. Luzhkov greatly respected him as a scholar and idolized him even. When the vice mayor began to talk about economics, it could be seen that the influence of Popov the economist on Luzhkov had been enormous. But at the same time it was felt that a resistance to these ideas was maturing in him, a resistance born of the "actual economy" with which Luzhkov had to deal every day--from morning until night. Popov had it figured right. Luzhkov proved to be a workhorse capable of tackling business all day long. He did not succumb to despair, became involved in everything, and could calmly and knowledgeably argue about the difficulties of the "zero" cycle in construction, then smoothly switch to the process of the manufacture of stuffing for sausages, and conclude the conversation with a discussion of binder-type asphalt. Yuriy Luzhkov would frame each subject with actual figures, and you would believe him, although he has never prepared asphalt or dug a foundation pit. He would sharply cut short talk about politics. He would knit his brows, feeling himself to be not entirely at ease. He would take pride in the fact that he is a man "of the soil," a business manager, and he would, as he put it, leave "all the chattering" to the deputies. But August 1991 threw the "winter-swimmer" Luzhkov into the cold font of world politics. On 24 August USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev formed the provisional Council of Ministers of the USSR-Committee for Operational Management of the Economy. Under the leadership of Ivan Silayev, Luzhkov was entrusted with tackling questions of the agro-industrial complex, trade, foreign economic relations, and the social sphere. In practice this meant that Yuriy Luzhkov was to secure from all the republics and krays of the disintegrating Union supplies of agricultural products for the "granary of the motherland" and on the strength of talk about an acceleration of the development of democracy in the USSR obtain from the West soft loans for purchases of that same food. As in 1987 also, almost the impossible was demanded of Luzhkov: feeding the people by employing command-socialist methods of management. What he did was there for all to see: in the store, on the table. The enthusiasm with which Yu. Luzhkov embarked on this work astonished many apparatchiks in the Council of Ministers. It was thought that he would break his neck. But ministerial office afforded Luzhkov, who had in the Moscow Agro-Industrial Committee been accustomed to extricating himself from almost hopeless situations, merely operating room for his seething energy. Luzhkov's name appeared in all major European newspapers along with those of leading politicians and businessmen. Following a conversation with Luzhkov and Yavlinskiy, Pierre Beregovoy, minister of economy, finance, and budget of France at that time, said that the course of history in the USSR had accelerated markedly. Following a visit to Warsaw, a most important barter deal was concluded: Leszek Balcerowicz, deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, did not conceal his satisfaction at the fact that in exchange for 600,000 tonnes of potatoes, 50,000 tonnes of apples, and 20,000 tonnes of onions, his country would receive 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Yuriy Luzhkov himself was sober in his evaluation of what had been done: "Yes, we could have obtained foreign currency somewhere for this raw material. We are proceeding here primarily from economic considerations. Poland is our closest neighbor. Food supplies in terms of transportation costs account for up to 15 percent and even more of the cost of the products, but transportation costs are not that great here, and we benefit from this." The principle of expediency helped Luzhkov on several other occasions to accomplish the tasks that had been heaped on him. Sometimes this principle was dominant in the affairs of the vice mayor, and decisions that were stillborn issued from his pen at that time. But simple steps helped Luzhkov in the fall of 1991. It is possible that Yu. Luzhkov's ability to negotiate with potential partners was manifested in that same period. Secretaries from the United States and Canada would come to Moscow on reconnaissance, promising nothing, but subsequently, at their direction, representatives of various companies, who would subsequently take up residence in Moscow, would come to Luzhkov, as a person capable of getting things done. Luzhkov knows how to persuade people, and they believe him. Following a visit to Brussels, to the headquarters of the Common Market, the vice mayor acknowledged that there had been very difficult negotiations on supplies of food to the USSR both along humanitarian assistance lines and along the lines of prompt credit agreements, "which are to be signed very soon." The humanitarian assistance reached the country, there were other supplies also--Luzhkov had not been cheated. But some of the agreements gradually fell through as a consequence of the West's reluctance to give money to the USSR, now Russia. This was one of Luzhkov's first contacts with the bureaucracy of the West. He did everything he could and calmly returned to his office on Tverskaya with a view of the Kremlin and the Yuriy Dolgorukoy monument: There was no starvation in the country--Luzhkov was able to persuade and convince even the Union republics that had already proclaimed their independence to fulfill the agreement on reciprocal food supplies. It was in his office on Tverskaya that Luzhkov greeted also the Belovezha Agreement, which undermined the political part of the vice mayor's work. Everything had to be started all over again. Yeltsin Once More In 1992 Yuriy Luzhkov, author of the book "72 Hours of Agony. August 1991. Beginning and End of the Communist Putsch in Russia," continued to be politicized, in spite of his desire not to become involved in politics. He understood sooner than Yeltsin what was meant by opposition of the authorities when deputies of the Moscow City Soviet began to say that all evil resided in the capital's government. Luzhkov made no move to exacerbate relations. And in this connection also spoke absolutely specifically--the contradictions were of an objective nature. They were caused by the imperfection of the legislative base. As a democratic society based on the rule of law was built, these contradictions would disappear. That is, if the Moscow City Soviet got in the way, it would soon disappear. Time has shown that Luzhkov acted wisely: he entered via his deputies into rearguard battles with the radical democrats and pulled over the most clear-headed deputies into the machinery of government. Luzhkov-Popov proteges were already holding important city positions at this time: Yevgeniy Savostyanov, chief of the Moscow department of the Ministry of Security of the Russian Federation, and Arkadiy Murashev, chief of the city's Internal Affairs Main Administration. Luzhkov himself, on the other hand, had begun to fight the Gaydar government. Primarily the methods of privatization propounded by chief privatizer Chubays. Luzhkov disliked the fact that wholesale privatization would deprive city hall of a large chunk of property. And this, in Luzhkov's opinion, was wrong: He remained, as before, a supporter of gradual entry into the market. In the old prices the property of city hall (and this means 40,000 buildings, transport, hospitals, schools, plants, and so forth) was valued at R125 billion. Luzhkov, as a true Russian fellow, has no wish to let anything out of his hands just like that. And he had by his grasp achieved a great deal--a wide-ranging social program had been initiated in the city. On 6 June 1992 Gavriil Popov--Moscow's first democrat mayor--resigned, and Yeltsin immediately appointed Luzhkov head of the city. The president of Russia did not have to think long when signing the edict, for that matter. He remembered how in 1987 Luzhkov had, as directed by B. Yeltsin, first secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee, taken charge of the Agro-Industrial Committee and had done a good job. Yuriy Luzhkov as City Planner City planning is one of Luzhkov's passions. No, he does not demolish roadways to build stone monuments. Yuriy Mikhaylovich erects churches and apartment houses. When, at the end of last year, the Chapel of the Icon of Our Lady of Kazan was opened in Red Square, the mayor stood next to the president and was inordinately proud of his creation. It was on his insistence that the Government of Moscow began the elaboration of a program of church revival and reconstruction. It is possible that at the start of the next millennium people will once again be speaking of Moscow as the city of "multitudes," and Luzhkov himself will be inscribed in tablets of stone under the name of Yuriy the Chapel Builder, although it is not absolutely clear why there will be so many churches in Moscow in the 21st century. It is hard to believe in Luzhkov's piety, but on grand church holidays he can always be found among the parishioners of the Yelokhovskiy Cathedral. The mayor has not been spotted in a synagogue or mosque. But since he ordered the erection of a synagogue and mosque in Victory Park on Poklonnaya gora alongside the Christian chapel, Luzhkov may be considered a postcommunist ecumenist. Luzhkov gave R50,000 of his own, which he had received from the judgment against the newspaper PRAVDA, for the building of the chapel in Red Square. Luzhkov cannot be reproached with a patriarchal approach or "sour" conservatism. He found his own path to the chapel--objective reality present in cubic meters of building materials--and walked it with the secret thought of praying for forgiveness for nomenklatura sins and of leaving behind fond memories of himself. What prompts people to take this path is depicted well by Russian literature of the turn of the 20th century. During a church service the appearance of our mayor holding a candle makes a dual impression. He is either quailing at the sight of Byzantine splendor in the adornment of the cathedral, when the choir hits so high a note that you yourself are uplifted a little, or Yuriy Mikhaylovich is bored. The reconciled nature of the atmosphere shrouds and enfeebles, and this is none too comfortable a state for Luzhkov's active nature. On the way out from the chapel he is probably thinking what still needs to be built, restructured, and so forth. He is aided in such work by a sound knowledge of the historical and urban-planning distinctiveness of Moscow and his ability to attract private capital for the reconstruction of buildings in the center. And he promises, furthermore, that 250,000 Muscovites who are residents of the center will return to their homes after their reconstruction. This will hardly be possible, but on a historical scale this fact is immaterial. The second direction of the activity of the city planner-mayor "for the ages" is to be the erection of ultra-modern skyscrapers like the Moscow City international business center. The first billion has already been invested, but there is, as before, still a garbage tip in the bend of the Moscow River. Luzhkov himself has not made it here yet, evidently. Corruption in Moscow Moscow received the news of Luzhkov's appointment as mayor without any particular joy. There was talk to the effect that now all documents exposing officials of city hall of theft and bribery would be destroyed. The principal unmaskers of the mafia accused Luzhkov of all mortal sins, but then all at once fell silent since the facts they had presented were not corroborated. There had been similar assaults on Yuriy Luzhkov in the period when he stood behind Gavriil Popov. At that time Luzhkov wrote letters to the papers and appeared on television, proving his cleanness. Having become mayor, he started to go to law. And it has to be acknowledged that no one has been able to prove that Luzhkov is a thief or bribe-taker--the mayor has not lost a single case. This has strongly added, if not to the popularity, then to the respect for Yuriy Mikhaylovich. A new twist was added to the spiral of the nonprofessional-democratic "fight against corruption" following the founding of the notorious MVK (Interdepartmental Commission for the Fight Against Corruption Under the President of the Russian Federation). According to confidential information, not officially reflected anywhere, at the time of the feverish collection of compromising material on the enemies of Boris Yeltsin, activists of the MVK dragged out and heaped onto the president's desk some things concerning Moscow. A person who saw all this said that the president responded in a somewhat irritated tone of voice, cutting the conversation short: "Leave Moscow alone." Or something to that effect. Looking into this incident in the Kremlin, we may say the following: Like any important superior, Luzhkov signs many documents, sometimes hardly familiarizing himself with them even, trusting his aides. On a purely formal level certain complaints could, most likely, be brought against Luzhkov, but, first, there would still have to be proof here, and, second, Luzhkov, as an experienced bureaucrat, senses danger in his bones. It is known for certain that when a powerful new commercial group attempted to blackmail the mayor with the fact that it could prove its lobbying activity to this firm's advantage, Luzhkov sent them further down the line, demonstrating here that the mayor's signature has never been appended to papers of dubious content. So the young wolves snapped their teeth on the neck of the experienced industrial ox. The Mayor and the Balalaika Yuriy Luzhkov is a man of the world. And his bowtie is an eloquent indication of this. The mayor attends secular receptions not from a sense of duty. He likes also to circulate in the company of stars of the theater of the first and second magnitudes, likes to hobnob with famous directors and scriptwriters, and likes to appear on stage. His effervescent nature cannot pass up the temptation to compose and deliver pompous toasts and odes. Listening to Yuriy Mikhaylovich at the Mark Zakharov birthday party, democratic intellectuals yawned from boredom, but, to judge by everything, they were enveloped by a sense of pride that the capital's mayor hangs around museums and makes himself over to them wholeheartedly--particularly when a specific problem needs to be resolved. At that same party Yuriy Luzhkov took to the stage with a balalaika (a gift to the birthday honoree) and began to read his poem dedicated to Zakharov. At this time a cake was carried out in back of the mayor and candles were lit in the expectation that the mayor was on the point of concluding the ode and kissing the birthday celebrant and that the latter, thus inspired, would blow out the candles at one go. But Luzhkov, rapping out his words, went on and on, speaking in rhyme: the candles had burned out, and new ones had to be stuck in. In the televised version this episode was by the solicitous hand of the director reduced to one quatrain, and the result was that Luzhkov was brief also, like Sobchak, whose speech was reproduced in full. A Good Deputy Is a Satisfied Deputy The deputies of the State Duma of Russia spent almost a week discussing the question of how they were to live at public expense, executing the wishes of the people. As you will recall, the new councilmen did not short-change themselves. The deputies of the Moscow City Duma were not offended either, but their benefactor was Yuriy Luzhkov himself. Part of the machinery of state was assigned to each deputy (and there are 35 of them altogether), and good apartments are now being sought on the quiet for the people's elect. It is for this reason, perhaps, that there have been no rows in the City Duma and that Moscow's councilmen, wholly dependent on the mayor, but with no grounds for complaints about lack of attention to them, are working productively. They voted the deficit budget with which Luzhkov had presented them and gave him carte-blanche for its execution. By this simple method Yuriy Luzhkov restored working order in the law-making body and secured his rear. And in the building on Petrovka, where the Duma meets, renovation is under way currently in order that the deputies might in the future also look into the city's problems calmly and comfortably and avoid damaging democratic urges. Reforms Luzhkov-Style Luzhkov understands the market economy and democratic transformations somewhat in his own way, although he always follows the route of purely presidential policy. Not government, presidential. It is said that it was the mayor of Moscow who said: Between democracy and the market we choose the market. Luzhkov has his own economic strategy, therefore: a market subject to the jurisdiction of the authorities, the payment of social benefits to those who cannot earn sufficient themselves, and the extraction from commercial structures of resources necessary for the city, but also the opening for them of the opportunity to develop business and, consequently, get rich. Luzhkov is even more radical than the president on certain political issues. Last winter, when the rights of the Russian-speaking population came to be violated in Latvia and Estonia, the Moscow mayor was the first to declare that, were this to go on, all agreements between the Government of Moscow and these countries could be annulled. The Russian Government, and the president also, took a slap in the face. The president remained silent when Luzhkov decided to introduce registration conditions for residence in Moscow last March. This innovation did not get through the first time--the Moscow City Soviet, the Supreme Soviet, and the Public Prosecutor's Office rebelled. But October 1993 was the mayor's shining hour. The regulations were put into effect during the state of emergency. And Moscow was engulfed in a wave of xenophobia. Luzhkov was victorious, playing the part of defender of Russian people. In the minds of citizens not burdened by politics, the mayor's action made a pleasing impression. Luzhkov did not justify himself and did not repent, in public at least, nor did he retreat from his position. Having learned how to maneuver in current political life, the mayor has always tried to play his own, even if little, game. And the presidential-government team could not put the squeeze on him, afraid of Yeltsin, obviously. For the latter Luzhkov has been a person capable of performing any work and keeping a firm hold on Moscow--more than the capital, the political and "psychological" heart of Russia. On 23 July of last year the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation Sixth Session authorized the institution of criminal proceedings against V. Shumeyko. Everyone anticipated a noisy scandal. It was rumored that, following the Supreme Soviet's demand for the dismissal of the mayor of Moscow also, Luzhkov would be sent as ambassador to Canada, out of harm's way. That same day Luzhkov, wearing a light-gray suit, mounted the Congress podium and said, rapping out each word: "Just you try. It was not you who put me there. It is not your job to remove me either." After this, the popularity of the mayor of the capital went through the roof. There has come to be talk as of late in the offices in Staraya ploshchad about Luzhkov as a candidate for the office of president. This talk has intensified even more since the victory of the LDPR at the parliamentary elections. Yuriy Mikhaylovich himself has not supported this talk, responding that he is indifferent to such rumors. He has rejected the struggle for the position of Duma deputy or member of the Federation Council, which he could not have lost, realizing that this would be of no interest to him and unnecessary now also. In addition, Luzhkov knows that there is nothing as powerful in Russia as the administrative vertical line. In tsarist, communist, and postcommunist Russia. A pragmatist with a flexible intellect, he sees for himself as yet no place other than that of mayor of the capital affording him the power to influence the domestic policy of all of Russia and the CIS even, especially since this office and his personal connections are helping him become a person who is well informed as to presidential-governmental court intrigues. So Luzhkov has become a clean politician, although such a definition seems altogether strange. The "cleanliness" of Moscow's streets is of no significance here owing to the smallness of its magnitude. No one notices this when against the background of the industrial recession the capital's construction workers have handed over 3 million square meters of housing, of which 1 million have been given free of charge--to persons on the waiting list. A political step of Luzhkov's was a slap at the falling Gaydar by an open letter to Chernomyrdin. It dealt with preferences for Moscow in the acquisition of food. The monetarists had prevented this. It is, generally, all the same to Luzhkov which economic theory is currently in vogue: He has to feed the capital. Luzhkov is a person who adapts well to all conditions of life, for he always tackles very specific assignments and (which is rarely the case with others) knows how to accomplish them. Moscow Rumors The capital's rumors from the highest spheres may be evaluated by the old words "all calendars lie," but they should not, undoubtedly, be ignored, for all that, since a computation of them affords a depth of understanding of the processes at work in the Kremlin's offices. As the POSTFAKTUM Agency reported recently, three big-capital entrepreneurial parties will shortly make their presence known. The constituent congress of one of them--Party of the Third Estate--is scheduled for 15 February. The purpose of the newly formed structure is nomination by the end of this year of Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov as candidate for the office of president. So all will very soon become clear. But it is perfectly obvious that in the last week of January Yuriy Luzhkov consolidated his positions, taking eighth place in the "100 Politicians" popularity poll, and his latest slap at Gaydar hit home: At a meeting in Orel, Chernomyrdin allocated Luzhkov the necessary credit for the purchase of food in the capital. Luzhkov wins again.
