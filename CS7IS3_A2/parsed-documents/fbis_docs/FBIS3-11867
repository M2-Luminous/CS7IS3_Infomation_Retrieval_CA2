Sandino, in Managua, in February 1994 -- first paragraph is introduction] [Text] To all Sandinists, to all Nicaraguans: Never before has Nicaragua experienced such a tragic situation of poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, lack of opportunity, the plundering of our natural resources, a crisis in moral values, corruption, abuse, hopelessness, and lack of a future for young people. This crisis, which affects all of society, has created a feeling of distrust of the government, public institutions, the political parties, and many of their leaders. The Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] is by no means exempt from this crisis, and we need to recognize this problem if we want to be part of its solution. I. The FSLN, as a matter of historic necessity, was born as an armed organization to overthrow the Somozist dictatorship. After lengthy years of heroic action, dedication, and deprivation, it managed to unleash a triumphant insurrectional movement that won the support and sympathy of the immense majority of the population. Through that heroism, the consensus of the majority of the people, the justice of their demands, and a broad policy of alliances, we came into power in 1979. II. Since its origin, Sandinism's raison d'etre has been the creation of a new society formed of new men and women, with new ideals and values, capable of forging, with everyone working together, a nation of solidarity, a nation without oppression, without egotism, without discrimination or exclusionary policies, and in control of its own independence and sovereignty. Thousands of Nicaragua's best sons and daughters gave their lives for those ideals and values of Sandino and Fonseca. III. To carry out its program of deep social transformations, and given the historic need to promote for the first time the interests of the dispossessed masses of the people--the party, the state, mass organizations, the armed forces, and the security forces were integrated into a single organization of power. This system of power also has its ideological foundation based on concepts that were new at that time; the FSLN believed in its historic destiny as a single vanguard party. IV. Guided by that concept, and in circumstances shaped by the war, a style of vertical behavior was created in the party, and in the party's behavior in relation to society. That is how we acquired the style of an exclusive political group with closed membership ranks. V. The sense of social solidarity, of popular mobilizations for just causes, the defense of our sovereignty, are values that Sandinism nurtured in society. In this way, we brought about transformations in Nicaragua's social and economic structures despite the aggression sponsored by the Reagan administration, which left our economy in ruins. But we also made some grave mistakes in political concepts and action that we did not recognize in time. These errors reduced the people's support and approval, divided society, led to armed clashes, and finally caused us to lose power. VI. The 1990's election defeat left Sandinism without any defined sense of direction because its transforming program, based upon total power, was no longer possible. Today we are still faced with an identity crisis and the lack of a persuasive political program with coherent leadership. VII. We should take pride in the fact that our most important historic legacy is economic and social democracy, whose foundation is the transformation of agrarian land ownership, and at the same time, representative and participatory democracy. We were able to fully and convincingly demonstrate our respect for the popular vote when we turned over the government after free and honest elections were held. Denying that heritage would mean denying our very selves. Based upon the foregoing considerations, it is now becoming necessary for the FSLN to accept a new vision of the history of Nicaragua and of the contemporary world, so that it will be capable of facing the nation's grave social and economic problems with lucidity and of taking effective action to defend the interests of the vast majority of the people. We Sandinists must dismiss from our minds and hearts all those forms of erroneous behavior in which we engaged while we held power, and which the people rejected, so that we will not repeat them. And we must propose to our party and to society a new program, with new options, new democratic forms of organization and new forms of popular civic struggle, without fear of changes, transformations, and renewal. Therefore, while looking ahead to the FSLN Extraordinary Congress, we now offer to the Sandinists and to the people of Nicaragua the following proposals for the new Statutes and Program: 1. Our party must be open, participatory, and creative, with flexible structures capable of bringing people together and uniting them, and not excluding or dividing. We need to return once more to being the party through which the majority of the Nicaraguan people, no matter what their economic and social status, will feel that they are represented. All closed, sectarian, exclusive, and discriminatory attitudes need to be rooted out forever from Sandinism, for such attitudes separate us from the masses of the people. The requirements for party membership must not be used to close doors, but rather to open them, and there must be a single class of membership in the FSLN. 2. Many Sandinists and sympathizers with Sandinism have moved away from the party. If we want to win the masses back to us once again, we must first learn to motivate all Sandinists so they will come back to our ranks. This includes the unemployed, who are the most numerous group, and all the others who in rural areas and in cities are creating their own way of living both through their own initiative and hard work, no matter what their occupation, area of interest, profession, or economic and social status. 3. We must have a party that is truly democratic at all levels, with broad areas available for participation, debate, and discussion. A party in which elected leaders answer for their actions to the people who elected them; a party with a new leadership capable of handling the challenges of transformation that Sandinism wants. A leadership with new styles, without one-man rule systems of any type, that respects the decisions made in local organs, and is constantly in touch with the grass roots. 4. No one wants another war in our country, nor do they want violence. Today we Sandinists cannot promote, tolerate, justify, or excuse any sort of methods of armed or violent struggle in Nicaragua, nor can we be lukewarm in condemning those methods. There are many forms of civic struggle and popular mobilization that can be used to defend the interests of the majority of the people within the framework of our political Constitution and of the laws. 5. Our political behavior must be based on strict consistency between what we say and what we do. We cannot go around saying one thing and then, behind the scenes, doing something else. Nor can we hope to win back the trust of the masses by simply changing what we say. Our political speech must always be accompanied by consistent political behavior. 6. We cannot put off working to find national solutions that will lay the groundwork for finding a way to overcome the economic and social crisis, which is the common aspiration shared by all the Nicaraguan people. In dealing with the economic crisis, our critical positions and our alternative proposals must be serious, well articulated, and viable. 7. The FSLN has legitimate spheres of influence which it must learn to use to defend the interests of the majority of the people: the media, parliament, public opinion forums, municipal and regional governments, business associations, unions, producers' organizations, and community and social groups. Sandinism must be prepared to work with everybody in the fields, in communities, in neighborhoods, in the regions, and in cities, in promoting and defending our mutual interests, even with those whom in the past we fought during the war. 8. A political party's legitimate and necessary aspiration is to obtain power, and our most important task is to expand and recover the consensus of the majority of the people so that we can be elected to office. We must remember clearly that we can only carry out our political, economic, and social program from inside the government. It would be absurd to condemn ourselves to the role of a party destined to fight eternally to change things while remaining outside in the opposition. In that way a party remains locked in frustration and demagoguery. 9. The only Sandinism possible is democratic Sandinism. We cannot be true to our ideals of economic transformation and profound social change without a deep and irreversible commitment to democracy. 10. Sandinism should carry with pride the banner of honesty demonstrated during our exercise of government, honesty which promotes nothing but the consequence of the ethical concepts we have always championed and defended. We need to reject as immoral and contrary to our principles any form of illicit enrichment, or any shady deals and acts of corruption, both inside and outside our ranks. 11. We Sandinists need to keep alive our revolutionary ideal of a just and democratic society, a society of solidarity, in which no one is humiliated or discriminated against. We need to stand firm against all forms of economic and social oppression. We need to keep ourselves on the side of a participatory and open economic system, in which the poorest and most dispossessed are given extra help, and the campesinos are given legal and economic guarantees ensuring their rights to land. There will never be a Sandinism that defends monopolies, oligarchies (old or new), powerful economic groups, whether the old ones or new improvised versions, or any form of return to the past of economic oppression, no matter who its proponents may be. 12. We should proclaim single-mindedly our respect for private property and all other legitimate forms of property: communal, associative, and cooperative. And we need to state clearly our rejection, both now and in the future, of any form of confiscation. Economic initiative, whether individual or collective, is vital for our national development. 13. Neoliberalism is contrary to the social rights and interests of the vast majority of the people, who are asked by neoliberalism to sacrifice for the benefit of a few of the more privileged. We must be forthright in rejecting the dogma of neoliberalism, which people have been trying to impose on us from outside. The present government has been unable to defend Nicaragua's interests from these external impositions by international financial organizations. Financial and economic adjustments must fit our real situation and should promote production and jobs instead of causing stagnation. And just as the dogma that everything should be in the hands of the state did not work, a dogma which says that everything should be privatized, including public services, cannot work. 14. We Sandinists should foster the ability of every social group, every business association, every union, every community organization, every youth and women's group to encourage and defend their own common interests, with full independence and freedom. This is what participatory democracy means. Democracy can only be truly effective when it expands the arenas available for popular participation. It is Sandinism's duty to promote the role and participation of women in transforming society, while respecting the ideas and autonomy of their organizations. 15. We need to continue to extend the Atlantic Coast Autonomy process within the spirit of national unity, and to seek the immediate implementation of the autonomy law and the inclusion of the functions of autonomous governments as an integral part of the constitutional reforms that will have to be debated and passed in the National Assembly. 16. Today, there is a world of new international relations after the end of the Cold War, a world marked by great abysses between rich and poor countries, with Nicaragua being one of the poor nations. It is our place to work to achieve a just international economic order. 17. Sandinism, whether in the opposition or in the government, cannot harbor undying hostility toward any country. Our relations with the United States must be relations of mutual respect, but without ever forgetting our tradition as a nation that has placed its dignity and sovereignty above all else. This is our message of hope and life. We want to share with everyone our aspiration for a prosperous and just Nicaragua, without more wars, without poverty, without exclusion, in which all Nicaraguans, on a footing of equality no matter what their political or religious beliefs or their economic and social status, will have the right to live free from fear and to work in peace, sure of their lives, of the lives of their families, and of their property. We Sandinists, without excluding anyone, must help to create an awareness of the future, in a country that really does have a future. Our spiritual and material potential, now and in the future, is immense. We must turn to the task of helping millions of Nicaraguans, especially young people, to recover faith and hope in the future. To achieve these desires, which are just and necessary, and to take on the challenge of winning the 1996 elections, we must at all cost preserve the unity of Sandinism, which is our most valued treasure.
