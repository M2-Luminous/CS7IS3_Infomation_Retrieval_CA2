Russia's interests in these areas are "critically important," Kozyrev told a Foreign Ministry meeting on Tuesday. "The major threats against Russia also come from there," he added. Kozyrev strongly opposed any attempt to withdraw Russia's military presence in these areas, describing it as "extremist attitude." One of Russia's policy priorities in these countries is to solve the issue of dual citizenships for Russian residents there, he said. He said Russia should improve the efficiency of its cooperation with other CIS members and the Baltic nations and work out short, medium and long-term strategies in setting up an economic union with them.
