Gonzalez, who delivered some very compromising documents to Foreign Minister Jose Mulino, said that he received these documents on Sunday from a reliable source who has never failed him with information on drugs and narcotics trafficking. Gonzalez preferred to withhold the name, as this is very delicate information. According to Gonzalez, who did not disclose the full contents of the documents, there is information on high-ranking PRD leaders traveling to Cuba to meet allegedly with political and government figures of that island. These persons -- Gonzalez added -- include PRD Secretary General Michel Doens, who traveled to Cuba at least five times between 1992 and 1993. Also included on the list are Ramiro Vasquez Chambonet, Nils Castro, and Luis Gomez. The documents include a letter dated 12 January 1994 on the letterhead of Roberto Infante, acting Cuban consul in Panama, addressed to Cuban Foreign Minister. In this letter, the Cuban consul tells the Cuban foreign minister that he held meetings with "the boys from the eleven" [a reference to the PRD's flag], allegedly from the PRD. Infante told Robaina that in Panama "everything is progressing according to the strategy of the People to Power" [a reference to the PRD's campaign slogan], adding that everything is being done according to his instructions, and -- best yet -- to his wishes. "The atmosphere is favorable to our friends, and the polls show it. Once again, we reiterated our solidarity and unconditional support," says Infante's note to Robaina. Infante added that an "expert from the eleven" will visit him and explain further on the advice and technical assistance they will need for the next game, that is, the 8 May elections. "With regard to comments, I believe everything can be summarized in only one remark: The bull [reference to PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares] is in charge of this farm," Infante says, adding that the necessary peons have been provided so that there will not be any interruptions in the scheduled activities. Gonzalez, who is seeking reelection on the Morena Party [National Renewal Movement] ticket, said that he has the documents that prove his charges, and he is waiting for Foreign Minister Mulino to verify the authenticity of the documents. Gonzalez added that members from the PRD Tendency faction and Papa Egoro Movement are taking trips to Cuba to coordinate logistics support for these parties from Cuba. "This is a communist country meddling in the Panamanian elections," he emphasized. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mulino said that given the importance of the issue and the seriousness of the alleged charges, he has initiated a "very careful" investigation of the case. Mulino said that he will not make any comments until he has analyzed and read the documents Leo Gonzalez gave him. "I do not know what decision I will make," the foreign minister concluded.
