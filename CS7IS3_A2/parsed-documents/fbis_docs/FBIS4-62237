Taking part in the sitting was Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense minister. The Russian Academy of Rocket and Artillery Sciences, he underlined in his address, is supposed to be an important body bringing together leading scholars in various fields. Its main task is to develop promising technologies for weapons systems using artillery and rocket arms. Among these are a series of baseline military technologies that occupy an intermediate position, as it were, between basic research and applied development. In the words of the first deputy defense minister, among the Russian military technology priorities is the creation of intelligent weapon systems capable of striking primarily the "nerve centers" of the opposing side's armed forces, and putting out of commission the enemy's combat equipment. Despite the enormous difficulties of financing the defense needs, the Defense Ministry is doing all it can to ensure progress in these priorities. And here we have, in the past two years, a whole range of world-level achievements, Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, pointed out in his address. The RARAS presidium also discussed a range of specific areas of scientific research and development in line with the decisions made by the Russian Defense Ministry Council on Military-Technical Policy.
