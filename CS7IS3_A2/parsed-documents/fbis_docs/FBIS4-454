It is noteworthy, though, that the government forces which were dislodged from their temporary base in the vicinity of Cuelei, are now regrouping. It is not yet known whether they plan to launch yet another military offensive. The military command for the independent area of Menongue today announced that technical preparation combat maneuvers are to be carried out over the course of this week in a bid to contain new attacks. That command also asked people in National Union for the Total Independence of Angola-controlled areas in general, and in the area of Cuchi in particular, to remain calm, adding that the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA, will know how to defend the interests of the civilian population. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's adventurous plans to attack and take Cuchi District cost its People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA, 91 soldiers killed and 193 wounded. Major Americo, of the 14th Infantry Regiment, was among the dead.
