Inflation seems to have been brought under control, reaching close to zero in France and suffering only minor hiccoughs in Germany, and market ups and downs have been proved nothing but temporary hitches in what is a mainly stable environment. These elements, the sources said, prompted something akin to optimism amongst the European bank governors, who may now begin putting pressure on Germany to separate its economic policy from that of the United States, where recovery is already under way. Germany will be asked to act for itself with greater determination. The Germans have promised not to let future decisions be overshadowed by January's massive growth in money supply, and other European nations are now looking forward to a downturn in interest rates, the sources said.
