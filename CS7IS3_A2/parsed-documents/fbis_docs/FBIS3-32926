Angeloz denied press reports in which he allegedly conveyed to President Carlos Menem his decision to give up his presidential candidacy. Angeloz explained: "This confusion is not good for our country or anyone. I am the one who, depending on my mood, will have to decide in due time if I feel like becoming a candidate." Concerning the possibility that Senator Fernando de la Rua might actually become the UCR candidate, the governor said: "In due time we will see who is in a better position to represent the UCR." Angeloz later stressed: "There will not be any internal rift within the UCR," although he admitted "the existence of acute, hard, and hostile disagreements. The party will remain unchanged."
