This is being done on an instruction from the Russian defence minister and the commander-in-chief of the Navy to prevent thefts of weapons and ammunition, the spokesman said. Last year, more than ten attempts to steal weapons from the flotilla's one facility alone were thwarted. The facility is located, incidentally, within the city boundaring of Petropavlovsk. In a half of cases, the arms theft attempts involved adolescents. Warning signs will be set up near the mined places. The flotilla command cautioned all residents of the region against crossing the boundaries of mined territories.
