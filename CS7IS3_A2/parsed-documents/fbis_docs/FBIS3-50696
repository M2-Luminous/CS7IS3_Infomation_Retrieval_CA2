But if we had access to the intimate thoughts of each of the possible presidential candidates, it is certain that we would find a rather mature decision. What stage has the battle for the 1995 presidency reached? The first certainty is that there are only 16 months left before the election date. The second fact, and this is perhaps the decisive one, is that the results of the referendum have not only altered the political map, but also seem to have mobilized the presidential ambitions of various individuals. The scenario has certainly become more complicated, because the opposition to the government has become bolder. But it is also a fact that in Fujimori's party sector, more than one hopeful has emerged. Up until the date of the referendum, it was possible to foresee the launching of a single candidate by the entire opposition as the only proper card to play to defeat the current chief of state. Today the opposition appears to believe it is even strong enough to be spared the need to agree on a single alternative. But not only that. Now the possibility of a Fujimori party without Fujimori is developing more broadly than could have been imagined just a few short weeks ago. Given this context, it is of interest to attempt to profile the first individuals to enter the field--Ricardo Belmont (RBC), Daniel Estrada, and Hernando de Soto. Ricardo Belmont has already had a skirmish with Government Palace. It occurred last August, and the truth is, according to the surveys taken then and despite the limited attendance at the meeting convoked in Manco Capac Square in connection with what had happened, he did not do badly in his clash with the executive branch. The IMASEN undertook a survey during those weeks that it we would do well to recall. To begin with, a very high 70 percent of the population of Lima admitted having "knowledge of the conflict between Ricardo Belmont and the president of the Republic." A substantial 53 percent believed that the government was failing to provide Belmont with the resources needed for the administration of his department. And further still, about 27 percent were convinced that the government was not giving the mayor the needed resources "because Belmont might be successful as a candidate for the presidency." Not even water could be clearer. And it should be no surprise that "Hermanon" has very carefully evaluated the positive results of these encounters with Engineer Fujimori (AFF). However, in that same month, the IMASEN compared AFF and RBC as presidential candidates. The former won out, with 58.7 percent as compared to the 20.8 percent for the mayor of Lima. Now "El Colorao" may be thinking that the referendum has broadened his space and that the months still remaining before the electoral date may favor him even further. This man always "thinks positive." But in the most recent issue of IMASEN CONFIDENCIAL (November 1993), the administration of the mayor of Lima received good marks--an approval rating of 61.4 percent as compared to a rejection rating of 31 percent. (This survey was taken exclusively in Lima.) The conclusion reached by this same survey organization is that Belmont is maintaining his position, and that his approval rate is improving in the lowest stratum and declining in the middle-upper strata. This means, of course, that he would be a candidate who would for the most part eat into a portion of the same social strata as the current incumbent in Government Palace. However, Belmont's possible candidacy raises several questions. Thus far it has been a phenomenon limited to Lima (although it is true that he enjoys broad acceptance in the poorer sectors). He has not, therefore, had an opportunity to assess how well he would be accepted in the country's provinces, which are today so sensitive to the centralism in Lima. Another matter of concern regarding Belmont is his habit of improvising. A few days ago, he made the statement during a political program that a political platform for governing should be drafted by technicians, who could readily be hired on contract. This statement, of course, reminds us of one made by Luis Bedoya Reyes some decades ago now. All of this seems to the mayor of Lima to be a matter of image and "projects." As for the rest, as he says, it would be up to the technicians hired. All of which is, naturally, highly debatable, when it comes to managing a city like Lima, and to an even greater extent, when one is trying to administer a country. This characteristic, which has heretofore been a part of RBC's charismatic "spontaneity," might be a highly vulnerable point when he is compared with other candidates who appear more solid and combine proposals with image. He has, moreover, revealed this more dangerous side when, for example, candidates lacking any prior knowledge about or evaluation for their positions have been chosen. There have been such flagrant instances as those involving Jorge Vasquez, in Villa El Salvador; and Jose Rubio, in San Martin de Porres. A few months ago, Belmont said that he would not run as a candidate for the presidency. And that he was not very comfortable in a tie, or in a suit, either, while men like Carlos Bolona could indeed wear them much more naturally. The allusion could not be clearer. If the candidate was the issue, he already had his own. The former minister of economy favored him, and very nearly put his name forward. What has changed between that time and the present? Perhaps it is that Fujimori no longer seems to Belmont as monolithic as before, and that his second municipal experience has convinced him that he is now ready to play in the first division. One could also surmise that Belmont's affinity for Bolona has not dwindled, that he is teamed with "Car'e bebe," and that they might well join together on a single "super-Lima" platform. But what does Belmont offer that differentiates him from Fujimori? RBC maintained a notable level of agreement with Government Palace until he ran for office a second time at the beginning of this year. It will readily be remembered that when Pablo Gutierrez, the candidate of the government party for the position of mayor of Lima, was headed downhill, AFF could find no better alternative than to throw his support to RBC. It is also a fact that in this instance, Belmont was very cautious, and made it clear that no one owed anybody anything, and that he had won thanks to his own efforts. But the internal coup of 5 April and many of Fujimori's measures had already won the support of the municipality. Belmont then is the man who might say he offers as an alternative a Fujimori movement without Fujimori, probably in an attempt to show that the difference he would make has to do with respect for the autonomy of the institutions. The difference would be, then, more one of style and communication methods than one of political proposals. Would the business community in Lima support a candidacy like that of Belmont? This remains to be seen. It will depend on how much strength he gains in the coming months, and what he can offer the businessmen. The mayor's ambitious program for rebuilding historic Lima will not, of course, be enough. Another candidate who has practically joined the race is Daniel Estrada. The mayor of Cusco is up to a point the anti-image of Belmont. Perhaps it is not, therefore, without reason that his anticentralist ideas are identified, under some circumstances, with an anti-Lima attitude. As is obvious, Estrada wants to garner the provincial votes, and he recently spoke of the need to achieve a major pact involving various regional sectors in order to defeat the central power. The results of the recent elections give him a basis for this venture, particularly since that, precisely, is Fujimori's weak point. Estrada's credentials are based on his successful municipal administration record in the city of Cusco, and he intends to increase his appeal with his anticentralist proposals, now combined with a plan, debatable in the eyes of many, for a federal Peruvian state. However, his current strength may also prove to be a hindrance to his broader national acceptance. Estrada is not like any other anticentralist leader, since he insists on emphasizing the heritage and representation of the ancestral Cusco. The question arises as to how he would integrate this particular characteristic with a national debate and plan that would not only include the other regions, which are so dissimilar and so "regionalistic," but also Lima itself, with its highly diverse population. On the other hand, could the interregional pact he so much desires be achieved? The first obstacle is the difficulty of obtaining the support of the other regional leaders who have party affiliations, like Jose Murgia, of Trujillo, or whose representation is clearly local, with roots more in the coastal population than the Incas, such as Tito Chocano, the mayor of Tacna. It must also be remembered that Estrada makes no secret of a style that is sometimes authoritarian. During a recent television appearance, he justified the events of 5 April and criticized the old parliament harshly. His only criticism of Fujimori's authoritarianism was that it was too cold and "robot-like." It is difficult to imagine what the mayor of Cusco would do if he were installed in Government Palace. There can be no doubt that an anticentralist policy would be promoted at full speed, but what is unknown is what his institutional administration would be like, and what his relations would be, with the parliament, with the political parties, and with the Armed Forces, for example. The same can be said about his economic policy. The unknown factors predominate, but there are still several months remaining in which they could be clarified. Carlos Bolona (CBB) is another individual who is making incursions in the party sector. It is said that there is one group of businessmen who have confidence in him, and that these individuals are prepared to play him as their card in the hope of replacing Fujimori. Bolona has established his institute, and he issues rather regular opinions on current political subjects. The profile of his possible candidacy is for the time being less clearly drawn that of the others. But his interest in the presidency has been more or less obvious for some time now. The leading credential CBB has to offer is his administration as head of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This action, which won applause in one sector, provoked criticism in another. As a result, it is quite probable that if Bolona should in the end be persuaded to launch his candidacy, he would have to broaden his base of support. He would need a good running mate--perhaps one of provincial origin, and a "marketing campaign" to modify his very capital-oriented image and his apparent extreme closeness with wealthy business sectors. The support of General Jaime Salinas Sedo's precandidacy by Javier Valle Riestra and Gustavo Mohme represents the initial effort to clarify the image of the most obvious opposition candidate today. Salinas Sedo could be the "more combative" candidate Fernando Belaunde is demanding to oppose Fujimori. Without a doubt, his candidacy represents the polarization of the government and the current high military commanders. There are basically two obstacles for Salinas Sedo at the present. One is winning over the more centrist sectors that are less radical in their opposition to the government, and the other is overcoming the problems of a legal nature that could be put forward formally to block his candidacy. "Get Ready, Get Set" Hernando de Soto also seems to be adjusting his stance at the starting line. Last week, he made public his proposed constitutional reform by popular initiative. This week he announced that next Tuesday, the Freedom and Democracy Institute (ILD) and the popular institutions supporting his proposal will launch a campaign to obtain the 35,000 signatures the new constitution requires in order for the Congress to consider the possibility of amendment. Last week he also paid a visit to the premises of the CUAVES [Urban Self-Management Community of Villa El Salvador], and the National Agrarian Confederation published a statement praising the ILD initiative. On the day of the press conference at which the reform proposal was announced, the presence of some well-known peasant leaders who were active for years in the leftist sector, such as Marcial Quintana and Jorge Arevalo from Piura, was notable. The organization of a meeting of 400 delegates representing the social organizations throughout the country scheduled to be held on 18 and 19 December to rally support for the reform proposal set forth seems to be the last step in this first stage of preparations for the probable candidacy of De Soto. And so his electoral strategy would begin with advocacy of a great concerted union among the representatives of all the sectors of society. As an alternative to a concertation based principally on interparty agreement, the president of the ILD proposes a union supported by the base-level movements. A careful consideration of their proposals reveals that neither Belmont, nor Estrada, nor De Soto is urging an agreement achieved mainly by the parties, although De Soto may perhaps be the individual most desirous of clarifying his disagreement with the so-called "partidocracy." De Soto's proposal combines economic liberalism and democratization of the state. In a way, it is another version of a Fujimori platform without Fujimori. The president of the ILD not only collaborated with the present chief of state during a certain period, but has also given explicit support to the government's economic policy. In this realm, De Soto has let slip some criticisms of government improvisation. He has, for example, expressed his annoyance at the lack of serious effort to promote projects such as substitution for the coca leaf as a crop. However, he has endorsed the central aspects of the program. The basic disagreement with the current regime he is attempting to demonstrate has to do with the democratization of the state. In this connection, his proposal for constitutional reform calls for the establishment of closer links between society and the political regime. The challenges facing his possible candidacy begin with the need to ensure that his image "catches on" with the national electorate. Unlike Belmont and Estrada, De Soto has not run for political office previously. He does not, therefore, have a reference point on the basis of which he can project his image as a government leader. One unknown factor is how his liberal economic proposal will sit with the middle and small businessmen's portion of the national business sector, so as to avoid its ending up as a simple neomercantilists' adjunct--a dilemma the Fujimori government is definitely faced with at present, whatever one's view of it may be. A Hibernating Candidate Perez de Cuellar (JPC) is in a state of hibernation, but he has not by any means vanished as a possible candidate. According to the most recent surveys on the subject, JPC is the individual who appears to be in the best position to challenge AFF for the presidency in 1995. In addition to that, the opposition parties in the CCD have given him their support, and he may very well be endorsed by the sectors that voted "yes" in the recent referendum but have lost confidence in Fujimori. JPC's great difficulty is that he has made a great consensus a prerequisite, and it appears that achieving this will be very difficult. Perez de Cuellar has confirmed that he will visit Peru in the middle of December. He will be here for some weeks, and will utilize the opportunity to test the air. During his earlier visit, he met with leading personalities who wanted him to run for the presidency. This meeting took place at the home of the painter Fernando de Szyszlo. It is not known if he will attend similar meetings this time.
