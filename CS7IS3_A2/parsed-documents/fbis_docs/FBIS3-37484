This document, he said, recognizes the right to self-determination, equality, defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the single economic space. Tatarstan exclusively owns and uses its land, bowels of the earth, and movable and immovable property. Simultaneously an instrument of the implementation of this treaty was adopted which represents 11 inter-governmental agreements. The position of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev noted, is directed at the democratic formation of Russia. In the concluding part of his speech Mintimer Shaymiyev thanked President Boris Yeltsin for his "invariable and consistent position shown to the very end -- up to the signing of the treaty."
