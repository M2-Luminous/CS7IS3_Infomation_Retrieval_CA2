FBIS4-10240 "drlat069_f_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 El Salvador ARENA Candidate Said Hospitalized in U.S. ARENA Candidate Said Hospitalized in U.S. PA0804201794 San Salvador Radio Farabundo Marti Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 8 Apr 94 PA0804201794 San Salvador Radio Farabundo Marti Network Spanish BFN [From the "First Delivery" newscast] [Text] Inhabitants of San Miguel and La Union Departments have called this station to deny that Armando Calderon Sol visited these departments as reported by a television station. The televised report showed Calderon Sol campaigning in the Belen neighborhood, at San Miguel's Student Center, and in El Pilon, La Union Department. Our sources, meanwhile, say they only saw Dr. Borgo Bustamante and Guadalupe Sorto. On 6 April, Calderon Sol was supposed to have met with members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and Dr. Ruben Zamora at El Presidente Hotel, but he failed to show up. Several government officials maintained that the ruling party candidate was visiting eastern El Salvador, but others said he was in the western region. The public disappearance of the ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] candidate, along with the designs of certain media to show Calderon Sol in places he has not been, reinforce unofficial reports that Calderon Sol is in a hospital outside of the country. Diplomatic sources who asked not to be identified noted that last weekend Calderon Sol had a nervous breakdown that prompted him to severely beat his wife, Elizabeth de Calderon Sol, and this is why he is in a hospital in New Orleans.
