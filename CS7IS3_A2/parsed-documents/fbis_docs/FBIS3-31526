Our reporter, who was present at the event, has just got in touch, so we go over to Jozsef Barath: [Barath] Good morning. Arpad Goncz began his talks with Andrey Kozyrev with congratulations. Russian diplomacy has saved the world from the dangers which the deterioration of the circumstances in Bosnia might have meant, he said. And it has saved NATO from the loss of prestige which would inevitably have followed from an intervention, or from unavoidable withdrawal. At the same time, Russian diplomacy has once again strengthened its prestige, which increases the region's stability. At the discussion, which was longer than planned, Arpad Goncz praised the cooperation of the West and NATO, which has led, which could lead, to the negotiated settlement of the Balkan crisis. The key to this, however, lies in the hands of the region's people. Kozyrev conveyed the greetings of President Yeltsin to Arpad Goncz and said that in making foreign political decisions, Boris Yeltsin begins with what would increase security. If Russia had been left out of the Bosnian settlement, this could have destabilized the Balkans and the whole of Central Europe. That is why there was a need for Russia to assume an increased role. Russia supports cooperation -- the Partnership for Peace -- with NATO. And within the CSCE process, it is ready for cooperation also in the matter of the national minorities and other issues as well.
