FR940916-0-00064 FR940916-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 638 [Docket No. 940677&hyph;4177; I.D. 090794A] Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule; extension of effectiveness. SUMMARY: An emergency interim rule is in effect through September 26, 1994, to prohibit all taking of live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states (South Atlantic) north of Dade County, FL; to prohibit the taking of live rock by chipping in the South Atlantic EEZ; and to limit the harvest of live rock from the South Atlantic EEZ in 1994 to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). At the request of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council), NMFS extends the emergency interim rule for an additional 90 days because conditions justifying the emergency action remain unchanged. The intended effect is to continue protection of live rock resources and fishery habitat in the South Atlantic until a permanent rule is approved and implemented. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 27, 1994, through December 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of documents supporting this action, including an environmental assessment, may be obtained from Georgia Cranmore, Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Georgia Cranmore, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Coral and coral reefs in the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico EEZ are managed under the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Under sections 305(c)(2)(B) and (c)(3) of the Magnuson Act, NMFS published an emergency interim rule (59 FR 32938, June 27, 1994) effective for 90 days (June 27 through September 26, 1994) to: (1) Prohibit all taking of live rock in the South Atlantic EEZ from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the Dade/Broward County line in Florida, (2) prohibit chipping of live rock in the South Atlantic EEZ from the Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary, and (3) limit the harvest of live rock in 1994 from the South Atlantic EEZ to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). The South Atlantic Council requested an extension of the emergency interim rule because conditions justifying the emergency action remain unchanged and to prevent a lapse in these management measures while NMFS considers approval of Amendment 2 to the FMP. Amendment 2 would implement the emergency measures on a permanent basis. NMFS concurs and extends the emergency interim rule through December 25, 1994, in accordance with section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act. Details concerning the basis for this action and the classification of the rulemaking are contained in the initial emergency interim rule and are not repeated here. Dated: September 12, 1994.
