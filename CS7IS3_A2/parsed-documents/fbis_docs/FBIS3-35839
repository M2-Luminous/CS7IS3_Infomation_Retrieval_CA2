It is said that the United States has a special foundation for cooperation with different countries in this field. Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs George Andrejevs and Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis took part in the meeting, where the NATO cooperation program "Partnership for Peace" was also discussed. G. Andrejevs confirmed Latvia's readiness to participate in this program; there is already a group of specialists prepared to begin work on this program. U.S. representatives have expressed the view that the "Partnership for Peace" program might stimulate mutual cooperation among the Baltic States in the field of security, and have advised Latvia to participate in joint military maneuvers in 1994 in the framework of this program. Both Latvian ministers acquainted their guests with the main points of the Latvian security concept. A. Andrejevs expressed anxiety concerning Latvia's security during the Skrunda radar station activities, which could cause various misunderstandings and incidents. The U.S. side responded that in the event of danger Latvia can consult NATO, taking advantage of "Partnership for Peace." The head of the U.S. delegation explained that America understands Latvia's anxiety in regard to its safety, and therefore contacts for mutual cooperation are being established. In addition, the United States is interested in long term cooperation with Latvia. V. Pavlovskis spoke about financial problems in the defense forces. The U.S. delegation said that limited financial support can also be expected from NATO. This organization could, in the future, support the Latvian mission and cover expenses of joint military maneuvers.
