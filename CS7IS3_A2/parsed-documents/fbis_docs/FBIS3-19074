A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry says: The mere fact that the resolution was adopted without waiting for (Gali), cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary committee and member of the European Union, to return from Turkey is enough to show the extent to which the resolution is prejudiced. The fact that the resolution criticizes the Turkish Government shows how little those who drew up the resolution understand and respect the principles of a state of law: The decision to lift the immunity is a decision of the legislative body. The subsequent steps will be taken by the judiciary. The government has no authority to intervene in either of these stages. The fact that the resolution talks about a Kurdish minority or autonomy is incompatible both with the realities in Turkey and with international law. The resolution talks about lifting the immunity of eight Kurdish deputies, six of whom are DEP [Democracy Party] members. In other words, former Prosperity Party member Hasan Mezarci has also been placed in the same category. This basic material mistake can also give us an idea about the seriousness of the resolution. A resolution that is full of such grave mistakes is bound to be just another European Parliament resolution.
