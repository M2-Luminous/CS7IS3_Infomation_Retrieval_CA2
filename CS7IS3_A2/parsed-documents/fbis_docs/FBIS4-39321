However, Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray Believes This Is Essential"] [Text] The Federation Council debate over the immediate introduction of Russian peacemaking forces into the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone was pretty stormy. Even after deputies had been addressed by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, they were unable to adopt a decision and continued the discussion "behind closed doors." Ultimately the parliamentarians backed the viewpoint put forward by Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council Committee for Security and Defense Issues, who believes that the president's appeal for the immediate introduction of peacemakers into the conflict zone lacks an adequate legal base. Petr Shirshov said that the Federation Council does not have the requisite documents to enable it to approve the introduction of Russian peacemakers there. Despite this, Russian servicemen's participation in settling the conflict is rather the question of the day. Russia has to send peacemakers into the conflict zone. That was the opinion voiced by Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray. He believes that lack of information, notably about the sources of funding for these forces, was the reason why the Federation Council deputies were unable to adopt a decision regarding the introduction of troops. "The executive and the legislature must work on this question together," Shakhray stressed during a conversation with a RIA correspondent. The Georgian Defense Ministry press service reported that during the night of 2 June Abkhazian formations breached the cease-fire agreement by firing artillery shells at Georgian positions in the Dalskoye Gorge for 40 minutes. The Georgians refrained from retaliating. Meanwhile, the Abkhazian Defense Ministry reported that for two days now Georgian formations have been methodically bombarding Abkhazian positions in the Kodor Gorge with all manner of automatic weapons. It is worthy of note that mutual accusations are being exchanged ahead of the adoption of a definitive decision regarding the introduction of CIS peacemaking forces into the conflict zone. Experts and observers think that each side is thus trying to create a certain image that will enable it in the future to actively influence the essence and substance of the peacemaking mission in Abkhazia.
