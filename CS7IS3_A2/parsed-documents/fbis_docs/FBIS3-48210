Ltd. (POSCO) workers will get a 2.9-percent pay hike this month under an agreement thrashed out by the company's industrial council. The modest increase in basic pay and fixed allowances was set by the council, which comprises 18 labor representatives and 12 management negotiators, in a bid to maintain POSCO's international competitiveness, according to a company spokesman. "The industrial council agreed that the pay raise should be low for the company to survive the rapidly changing circumstances of international business," he said. POSCO's wage accord is expected to affect pay negotiations at other industrial companies in the Pohang region. POSCO, which has some 22,622 workers, is the world's second biggest iron and steel maker with production last year estimated at 22.48 million tons.
