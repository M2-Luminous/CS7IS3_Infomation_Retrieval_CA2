The Russian envoy arrived in Israel from Jordan, where he had a meeting with King Husayn. Prior to this, Posuvalyuk had participated in talks with President of Syria Hafiz al-Asad. Posuvalyuk said that his mission is aimed at providing the maximum possible assistance to move ahead the Middle East peace process, help renew and complete talks between participants in this process within the framework of the active line followed by Russia. According to him, using its confidential ties with states and also with political leaders of the region, "Russia induces interested sides to implement all that has been contemplated at Madrid and what was agreed at Oslo, Washington and Cairo, without wasting any time." "The tragedy at Hebron has laid bare the absolute truth that opponents of the negotiations are trying to take advantage of falling out of step and pauses in the negotiation process. This threatens a roll back and poses danger to all achievements of the peace process," the Russian envoy said. "Main political forces, society and public as a whole in Russia are in favour of such an active and single-minded stand on the Middle East problem, the neighbourhood region for us, where today there exist and will exist in the future great interests of our state," Posuvalyuk concluded. According to diplomatic sources, a meeting between the Russian representative and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is to be held on Tuesday morning.
