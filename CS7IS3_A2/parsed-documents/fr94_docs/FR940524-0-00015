FR940524-0-00015 FR940524-0-00007 9. Combinatorial bidding . Although we recognize that there are significant benefits associated with combinatorial bidding, especially in terms of efficient aggregation of licenses, we conclude that simultaneous multiple round auctions offer many of these same advantages without the same degree of administrative and operational complexity and without biasing auction outcomes in favor of combination bids. Since simultaneous multiple round bidding is our preferred auction method for awarding narrowband PCS licenses, we think combinatorial bidding will be unnecessary in most narrowband PCS auctions. However, in circumstances where we do not use simultaneous multiple round bidding, we may permit combinatorial bidding. Bidding Procedures 10. Grouping of licenses . Whether we use our preferred approach of a sequence of simultaneous multiple round auctions or sequential individual auctions, the Commission must choose which licenses will be auctioned together. The importance of the choice of license grouping increases with the degree of interdependence among the individual licenses or groups of licenses to be auctioned. Accordingly, we will group narrowband PCS licenses into the various simultaneous auctions by aggregating together those licenses exhibiting the greatest degree of interdependence so that there will be limited interdependence across groups. 11. Based on the foregoing, we will auction narrowband PCS licenses in the following license groupings. We will award all nationwide, regional and MTA (other than MTA response channels) licenses through a sequential series of simultaneous auctions. (However, as we gain experience we may determine that an alternative auction method or license grouping is more appropriate. Under these circumstances, as provided in the general procedural rules, we will announce before each auction the licenses to be auctioned and the type of competitive bidding method to be used, as well as the stopping rules and activity rules, if any, that will be used.) To maximize the information available to bidders and increase gradually the complexity of the narrowband PCS auctions as we gain more experience, we will begin by auctioning the ten nationwide narrowband licenses in one simultaneous multiple round auction. After the nationwide narrowband PCS auction is complete, we will auction the five regional blocks (30 licenses) together in one simultaneous multiple round auction. We subsequently will conduct another simultaneous multiple round auction for all of the 50/50 kHz paired, 50/12.5 kHz paired and the 50 kHz unpaired MTA licenses (357 licenses). Simultaneous multiple round auctions are appropriate for each of these license groupings because of the relatively high value and significant interdependence of the licenses. 12. After auctioning the MTA licenses, we will hold another simultaneous multiple round auction for the 50/12.5 kHz paired BTA licenses (984 licenses). Although most of the licenses are expected to have relatively low values, individually they are highly interdependent, and their aggregate value (compared to the cost of conducting a simultaneous auction) is sufficiently high to justify a simultaneous multiple round auction. Using this approach will also enable the Commission to gain valuable experience conducting simultaneous multiple round auctions involving large numbers of licenses. 13. Finally, we will auction the 12.5 kHz unpaired MTA (204 licenses) and the 12.5 kHz unpaired BTA response channel licenses (1,968 licenses) in a single round sealed bid auction because their values are low relative to the cost of conducting other more complex auctions. Under this auction method, however, bidders cannot be certain that they will be the high bidder on all of the licenses they seek to obtain because single round sealed bidding does not provides bidders with timely information about license values and bidders do not have the opportunity to increase their bid amounts during the course of the auction. Therefore, in this context we will allow bidders to bid on more licenses than they are eligible to be awarded under the existing aggregation limits, provided they specify in advance the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses in the event that they are in high bidder on more licenses then they are permitted to hold. See 47 CFR 24.130(a) (limiting paging licensees to a maximum of two response channel licenses within the same geographic area). Bidders, however, will only be permitted to bid on response channel licenses for which they are otherwise eligible (i.e., they must operate at least one base station in the service area of the response channel for which they are applying). The Commission will only designate a bidder the winning bidder on the maximum number of licenses the bidder is eligible to hold. Under these circumstances, a high bidder will not be subject to the bid withdrawal penalty for those additional licenses for which it is not designated the winning bidder. 14. Bid increments . Where we use simultaneous multiple round auctions to award narrowband PCS licenses it is important to specify minimum bid increments. In these auctions, we may impose a minimum bid increment of 5 percent or $0.01 per pop per MHz, whichever is greater. This will provide flexibility for a wide range of different license values and will ensure timely closure of auctions, even where bidding begins at a very low dollar amount. The Commission retains the discretion in narrowband PCS auctions to set and, by announcement before or during the auction, vary the minimum bid increments for individual licenses or groups of licenses over the course of an auction. We will most likely reduce the minimum bid increment only in the later bidding rounds, as bidding begins to come to a close. In oral sequential auctions the auctioneer may within its sole discretion establish and vary the amount of the minimum bid increment in each round of bidding. 15. Stopping rules for multiple round auctions . Where we use simultaneous multiple round bidding, we believe that a simultaneous stopping rule is preferable, especially for the nationwide, regional and MTA narrowband PCS licenses, which are expected to have relatively high values and are fewer in number. Because of the large number of BTA licenses and their relatively low expected value, we may use either a hybrid stopping rule or allow markets to close individually in auctions for these licenses.
