A. Borynyak, A. V. Loginov, P. M. Mednis, S. N. Sarnadskiy; UDC 621.378:682.33] [Abstract] Interference-optical methods for information processing dealing with space-time parameters of several physical phenomena are examined. The information is in the form of a universal optical signal - interference pattern. In addition to examining the traditional methods of processing the interference pattern, methods, based on supplementary modulation in time and space, are also examined along with methods of spatial frequency measurements. Some new phase measuring methods are proposed and areas of their practical application are pointed out. An example of a digital analysis of interference pattern, which has a practical significance, is provided. Figures 5, references 64: 21 Russian, 43 Western.
