I think that such conditions have been considerably completed already. We had better implement an income tax cut starting 1 January 1994 ahead of schedule and consider raising the consumption tax rate during the period when they coincide. [Yoshitomi] It is said that, "in a democratic society there are people who call for tax reductions in time of recession, but there are none who call for tax increases in time of prosperity." However, if the combination of the present tax cut and the future tax hike, which can overcome the problem mentioned above, is consolidated, we should implement an income tax cut as a means of economic recovery and we can fully expect its fruit. Implementation of an Income Tax Cut and a Consumption Tax Hike [Kato] A recent sharp drop in personal consumption has a lot to do with the negative assets effect -- a decrease in family assets due to the bubble economy's collapse. Worried about a decrease in their assets, people have hurriedly decreased their consumption and have increased their savings. I think that a higher savings rate among the aged in particular might have been caused by such a phenomenon. The fruits of the income tax cut cannot be expected and the income tax cut cannot become an economic stimulus measure unless we can stop the negative assets effect. Recently, however, the negative assets effect has finally disappeared and conditions which can produce a positive assets effect have been created. If land prices decrease another 15 percent in the case of residential areas and another 25 percent in the case of commercial areas, the rate of variation of land prices and the rate of increase of nominal gross national product will approximately match, where the land prices become stable in general. If that happens, a positive assets effect will come about, which in turn will further ensure the income tax cut's fruit. [Yoshitomi] What is important in discussing the income tax cut is to determine the extent of expansion of consumption in proportion to the scale of the tax cut. In theory, it is possible for the consumers to save all the taxes reduced in anticipation of a future tax hike. Will 3 trillion yen or none be consumed out of the 5-trillion-yen tax cut? Only the actual proof can answer such a question. One actual proof study shows that nearly 3 trillion yen will be consumed. [Kato] In any case, I do not think that the income tax cut alone will be enough to stimulate consumption. Unless we provide an opportunity to consume the income increased through the tax cut, motivation to spend will not come about. For that purpose, we should decide in advance that the consumption tax will be raised after one year or 15 months. If we do that, we can expect the last-minute expansion of consumption during that period. There are people who say that since this is only a last-minute demand, consumption will decline after a temporary increase in demand. However, if the economic environment improves even through such a temporary expansion of consumption, that will trigger a continuous expansion, and there is a very fair possibility that the economy as a whole will pick up. [Yoshitomi] I agree with your opinion that the fruits of the last-minute demand can be expected. Therefore, what is important is how to realize a combination of the present tax cut and the future tax hike. [Kato] However, the government and ruling coalition parties intend to issue deficit-covering bonds to finance an income tax cut. It is not that I have an antipathy to deficit-covering bonds. If it is certain that we can reduce deficit-covering bonds in the future, I am not against them. Actually, however, it is impossible to extinguish deficit-covering bonds once they are issued, which has already been proven by history. In Japan, former Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira promised to extinguish deficit-covering bonds, but to no avail. The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform chaired by Mr. Doi decided to extinguish deficit-covering bonds, but it took the Commission as long as 10 years to do so, including an additional period necessitated by the collapse of the bubble economy. [Yoshitomi] Since 1973, which was called the first year of welfare, the welfare budgets have been expanded; the prolonged recession after the oil shock, as well as the tax reductions, had increased budget deficits; furthermore, the theory that Japan and West Germany should be the locomotives of the world -- the locomotive theory -- was developed in 1977-78. Because of the various demands from both within and without the country, Japan's budget deficits showed a rapid increase in the seventies. For this reason, Japan had to dedicate the eighties to financial reconstruction. [Kato] Government finances, once expanded under a recession, can never be reduced, even when business prosperity returns. In economics there is Peacock's "the rule of transfer" [as published] but, the government finances once expanded in time of emergency do not return to normal even after the end of the emergency. This is a common occurrence. [Yoshitomi] Since we have promoted our financial reconstruction to such a level with much effort, we should exert our ingenuity in implementing short-term economic stimulus measures without committing the same error committed during the seventies and eighties. [Kato] Issuing deficit-covering bonds will bring serious consequences. I was against the income tax cut financed by deficit-covering bonds which we cannot be sure of redeeming. However, if the present tax cut is combined with the future tax hike, I do not mind the issuance of short-term deficit-covering bonds as a revenue source. What is important in that case is not a revenue source but seeing the present tax cut and the future tax hike always in the same perspective. I think that as a temporary measure there should be a one-year to about a one-and-a-half-year grace period between the initiation of the tax cut and the increases of the consumption tax. However, if the resultant economic recovery is not satisfactory, the initiation of the tax hike should be postponed, with a future tax hike in mind. [Yoshitomi] I think that the grace period of one and a half to two years is enough time before the consumption tax rate is raised; I think that a certain degree of economic recovery is expected in the first or latter half of 1994. It was said around the spring of 1993 that there would be a slow economic recovery in the latter half of 1993 due to the adjustment of capital stock. Things turned out quite contrary to our expectations. There are three reasons for that: 30 percent appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the yen; the cooler summer; and the delay of the execution of public investment due to the general contractor scandals. For these reasons, economic recovery was delayed for about a year. However, if an income tax cut is feasible starting in January 1994, its effects will be produced in the latter half of 1994. If the prospect of the deferred adjustment of capital stock becomes certain, an economic recovery will begin in the latter half of 1994, although it was one year behind schedule. Therefore, the necessary conditions for a tax hike will be ready by 1996. Of course, since an income tax cut alone is not sufficient as an economic stimulus measure, it is necessary, for example, to discuss the problem of the bad debts held by banks. The Method of Introducing Public Funds for the Writing Off of Bad Assets Held by Financial Institutions [Kato] Concerning the question as to whether or not public funds should be used for the writing off of bad assets held by financial institutions, the important thing is whether the financial institution themselves are really serious about writing off their bad assets and are making efforts for that purpose. [Yoshitomi] If bad assets are to be written off by the introduction of public funds, financial institutions must clarify such managerial problems as nondividend-paying and deficit settlement of accounts; otherwise, the market does not function well. [Kato] Concerning the introduction of public funds for the writing off of bad assets, I think it is good to provide a chance for that. For example, agriculture and forestry-related bad assets amounting to 6 trillion yen is held by housing loan companies. I think it is right that the government should pay the 6 trillion yen in the form of public funds, based on the idea that public funds should be used for public industries. However, such an undertaking will cause an objection -- why should the government help private financial institutions? [Yoshitomi] As you said, the media calls for the implementation of economic stimulus measures, but at the same time, it calls a stop to whatever measures are to be taken to stimulate a sluggish economy caused by bad assets held by financial institutions. [Kato] I am not for the introduction of public funds without reservations, but I am sure it is time to think of introducing them. [Yoshitomi] Chairman Greenspan of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank commented on the issue of bad assets held by financial institutions: "Because of their bad assets, the banks are unwilling to extend loans. As a result, economic recovery is unsatisfactory, thus delaying the solution of employment problems. If that is the case, a drastic reduction of interest rates will be conducive to the economy as a whole." In short, a drastic reduction of interest rates will let the banks earn interest margins and at the same time make them lower loan interest rates -- let the banks earn business net profits and make the banks use the profits as depreciation funds. When you make the banks lower loan interest rates when they are intent on earning interest margins, you have no alternative but to drastically lower deposit rates. [Kato] Concerning the money flow, we must change the present framework in which postal savings are overwhelmingly predominant. As compared with the 18 trillion yen collected by private financial institutions in 1992, there is 19 trillion yen of postal savings, less than half of which, about 8.8 trillion yen, was used for fiscal investment and loans. The rest went to the Bank of Japan for the purchase of government bonds or to stock markets for the purpose of so-called price-keeping operations. [Yoshitomi] Concerning stock price-keeping operations, I was in charge of the comprehensive economic measures concerned with those operations. When the average stock price is on the point of dropping below the 14,000-yen level, the market runs into a kind of system crisis. Therefore, every effort is made by all concerned, including securities firms, so that the average stock price will not drop further. However, the purpose is to strictly prevent the rapid fall of stock prices and to avoid a system crisis; therefore, instantaneous countermeasures must be taken. However, the countermeasures were taken for more than a year thereafter, and stock prices came to be formed artificially. As a result, the stock market transaction balance has continued to dwindle to the dismay of securities firms, which has caused people to entertain the opinion that price-keeping operations are for the rescue of financial institutions. [Kato] Seen from such an angle, it is evident that the aggrandizement of postal savings distorts the flow of Japan's money. Therefore, postal savings, taking up a little more reserved position, should play a more supportive role for the sake of private financial institutions. [Yoshitomi] Concerning postal savings, the discussion inevitably centers on how to implement "the outflow" of postal savings, since it is impossible to hold back "the inflow" of postal savings. At present, however, it is difficult to discuss the outflow of postal savings. For, when private loans by financial institutions do not increase because of their holding bad assets, or when small and midsize firms, in particular, are unable to obtain loans, other countries cannot take direct action against these; but, for the purpose of fiscal investment and loans, Japan has governmental financial agencies intended to help small and midsize firms; and to our amazement, the agencies' loans are still increasing at the rate of 7 percent a year. Therefore, even when financial institutions find it difficult to extend loans, small and midsize firms are relatively free from troubles. Things are going rather well on a short-term basis, and that may be the reason long-term reforms are difficult to implement at present. The Economy Is on the Track to Gradual Recovery in 1994 [Kato] Now, concerning the economy in 1994, first of all, I think that adverse assets effect will change into positive assets effect. In addition, if a deregulation series is implemented, local beer will be made in various places and medicine will be sold at convenience stores, thus increasing business opportunities. [Yoshitomi] Recently, there have been people who say that "a depression is coming," but I am absolutely sure that there will be no depression. For example, if Japan's unemployment rate rises to 25 percent like the Great Depression in the United States, we may call it a depression. At present, Japan's unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, which may rise to nearly 3.5, but that is anything but a depression. In addition, the former Great Depression was a worldwide phenomenon and each nation resorted to extreme protectionism. At present, however, there exists GATT, and trade rules are in good order. Moreover, at that time, there were no thriving countries like Asia today. [Kato] If general contractor scandals subside and public works begin to be undertaken, then an income tax cut should be implemented. The consumption tax should be raised in the future; but, for the time being, the present 4.5 percent consumption tax on passenger cars, for example, should be lowered to 3.0 percent. We can expect the last-minute stimulus effects. [Yoshitomi] People say it is terrible to have their overtime work shortened and their bonuses reduced. Conversely, the reduction of wages keeps Japan's employment as it is. The reason Europe's unemployment rate is high is because wages do not decrease even in time of recession because of the downward rigidity of wages. In addition, enterprises have to bear a tremendous amount of nonwage labor costs, such as installments for social security systems, besides wages. A wage system with such extreme downward rigidity and high nonwage costs have raised Europe's unemployment rate. This is not the case in Japan. Such an adjustment mechanism of Japan's labor market is highly evaluated all over the world. Wages should be determined flexibly at the market. In forecasting the economy for 1994, no opinion is more erroneous than the one that the higher spring wage settlements go up, the weaker the consumption recession becomes. Higher wages will increase unemployment and strengthen the consumption recession. In addition, an income tax cut of 5-6 trillion yen will probably have the power to raise real wages nearly 2 percent. Furthermore, the rise of consumption prices will become almost zero. [Kato] Concerning land measures, reconsideration of the land tax has not been made yet. However, we can make an exception to the rule when one uses the proceeds of land sales to buy a choice lot, or we can reduce the tax on the profit upon alienation. If these are complied with, the economy's bottom will further firm down more than ever before. [Yoshitomi] The appreciation of the yen exerts a negative influence on the economy for the first year, but afterward it works for the raising of real income through a deduction in commodity prices. A combination of three excess stock adjustments -- the adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing industries, of excess stock of office buildings, and of excess stock of durable goods for domestic use -- is the fundamental reason for the current recession. Of the three adjustments, the adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing industries and of excess stock of durable goods for domestic use had been expected to be almost completed by the latter half of 1993. For this reason, a slow economic recovery was supposed to begin around early autumn of 1993, which was delayed for another year due to the higher yen, the scandals of general contractors and a cool summer. Judging from this, it is certain that there will be an economic recovery in the latter half of 1994. The medium- and long-term growth rate of Japan's future economy may be weaker by about 1 point compared with the growth rate of a little over 4 percent after the oil shock. However, Japan has the power to grow at about 3 percent due to its higher savings rate and its greater research and development investment than Europe and the United States. [Kato] Both of us have a bright prospect for 1994. However, unless political reform bills are agreed upon and budget compilation is moved forward, this scenario may come to naught.
