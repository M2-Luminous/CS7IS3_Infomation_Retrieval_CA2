The station had been broadcasting to all of the former Yugoslavia since April of last year. The European Union, which had been backing the project, said it could no longer provide financial support because of an administrative reorganization. The journalists from throughout the former Yugoslavia who were involved in the project are understandably furious. At a press conference on Tuesday they said the weren't given any warning about the move and therefore couldn't look for alternative financing. The journalists have asked Italy for authorization to set up a transmitter off the Italian coast. Italy, they say, is their last hope because the republics of the former Yugoslavia have all refused to allow them to erect a transmitter and the Albanian government hasn't responded. [passage omitted] The ship is now sailing to Marseille in the south of France and the 19 journalists on board all plan to return home -- except for the three Bosnians, who have no home to return to.
