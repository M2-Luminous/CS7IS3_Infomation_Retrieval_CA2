The minister noted a number of elements which have not yet been mentioned aloud. He announced that despite the declared procedure for the exchange of Belorussian money for Russian, the reassessment of enterprises' fixed capital will not proceed evenly. [Yanchuk] Fixed capital, and that means primarily equipment, was bought five years ago at some enterprises and 50 years ago at others, Stepan Yanchuk said. So a corrective coefficient will be applied. One more detail is that the Republic must seek on its own sources for eliminating the discrepancy between the cost of the Russian ruble and the Belorussian ruble when exchanging money in savings banks. Therefore, the government will have to make a big effort not to ruin the banks. And not only the savings bank but also the commercial banks. In addition when money is exchanged by individuals in sums in excess of 200,000 it is not simply the general exchange rate which will be used, calculated on the basis of differences in the cost of consumer goods baskets, but a rectified exchange rate. This is connected with the fact that a speculative dollar exchange rate is in operation in Russia and Belarus today. So when establishing the exchange rate for Belorussian "hares" against Russian rubles an adjustment for the speculative element will be made. Stepan Yanchuk specified the needs for which, according to the treaty, Russia will give Belarus 200 billion rubles: Today, we have a negative balance of payments with Russia. The debts for gas and oil total over 600 billion Russian rubles. So far, the Russian Federation is supplying us with gas and in part with oil on credit. And to ensure that the Republic can settle its debts we have been earmarked this money for the first half of the year. We will reach a new agreement on credit for the second half of the year. [Vysotskaya] Stepan Petrovich, it is known that the keenest disputes when signing the documents were generated by the fifth point of the treaty, which states that emission is effected exclusively by the Central Bank of Russia. Should we be afraid that the functions of the Republic's National Bank will be assumed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation? [Yanchuk] Even if the fifth point remains in the form which it has now, but the policy of the Russian Government and the Central Bank of Russia with regard to Belarus does not change, then there is no great fear. We would simply like to protect ourselves against the unexpected so we are making attempts to somewhat amend the way it is formulated. [Vysotskaya] The opponents of unification assert that Belarus, like Russia, will suffer from a constant shortage of cash and delays in payments. How real are these fears? [Yanchuk] I must say that in Russia there are no longer any cash problems. That wages are not always paid is another matter, since the enterprises lack funds. Under the treaty the Russian side undertook to supply Belarus with cash. As for the question of whether Belorussian enterprises will have the money to pay wages, just as today not everyone has money so in the future some people may not have it. The main thing is to give a push to production, after all it is production that creates money. Incidentally, over the first quarter of this year production decline in Belarus was 36 percent. Because of this the budget shortfall was 1.5 trillion rubles. Enterprises are standing idle. The reason is the price factor, because of which our output is not competitive even on the Russian market, not to mention the world market. A unification which equalizes prices will make it possible to boost our production and economy.
