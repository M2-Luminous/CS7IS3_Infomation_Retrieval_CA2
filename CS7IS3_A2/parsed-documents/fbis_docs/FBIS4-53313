The MITI minister told reporters that rules are necessary to implement internationally accepted measures. But he said it would be ideal if there is no necessity to implement such measures. Hata was commenting on a set of rules for the implementation of measures to guard textile import levels, recommended by a government advisory panel on Tuesday. The panel proposed the step be used under certain conditions as a way to protect the struggling Japanese textile industry against massive textile exports by China and other developing countries. A discriminatory curb on textile imports under the multifiber agreement (MFA) will be phased out by 2005 under the recently concluded Uruguay Round global trade accord. Japan's implementation of such a step amid the global shift toward free trade could draw international criticism as a return to protectionism.
