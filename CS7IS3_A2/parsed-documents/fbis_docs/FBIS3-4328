The number of such major and serious cases increased by a large margin as compared with that in 1992. Of these cases, 834 were transferred to the judicial organs. According to the analysis, as compared with the situation in 1992, some new changes were found in illicit business activities handled by industrial and commercial administrations in all parts of the country. First, the total number of cases decreased, but the number of major and serious cases increased by a margin as large as over 90 percent. Second, the total amount of fines rebounded after decreasing for a number of consecutive years. The total of fines and the value of confiscated goods amounted to over 800 million yuan in 1993 and increased by more than 10 percent over that in 1992. Third, more state-owned and collective units were involved in illicit business activities. In the more than 30,000 major and serious cases being handled last year, over 11,000 cases involved state-owned units and over 7,500 cases involved collective units. Both numbers were larger than those of the previous year, and they accounted for 63 percent of the total number of major and serious cases. Fourth, cases of smuggling and selling smuggled goods and cases of making and selling counterfeit and inferior goods accounted for a large proportion in the cases of violations of economic laws. According to incomplete statistics in 11 provinces, including Shandong and Liaoning, they discovered and handled more than 23,000 smuggling cases last year. In the whole country, more than 4,100 major and serious cases of making and selling counterfeit and inferior goods were investigated and handled, and the number increased by 18 percent over that of the previous year. In addition, some new forms of illicit business activities continued to appear, including the cases of foreign exchange speculation in the black market with the lure of "high investment returns in futures trading." The Industrial and Commercial Administration of Shenzhen City discovered 72 cases of such activities last year, and the value of fines and confiscated goods exceeded 2 million yuan.
