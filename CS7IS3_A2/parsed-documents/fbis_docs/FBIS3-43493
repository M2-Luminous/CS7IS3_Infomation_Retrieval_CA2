He was reacting in an interview to pressure by foreign aid donors on the Zambian government to stamp out corruption and drug trafficking in the Cabinet. Mushota said diplomats had international guidelines within which to operate "which some have chosen to ignore with impunity in Zambia". He said no official complaints had been lodged by the Zambian government with the governments of the diplomats in question, but added: "The Zambian government will expel foreign diplomats who continue to question the governance of the country by the State." German ambassador Peter Schmidt said yesterday the resignation of Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaaanga on Tuesday was not enough to appease the donors. He called for other ministers to resign and for more serious government efforts to stamp out corruption. Zambian newspapers yesterday carried reports alleging that several Cabinet Ministers had misappropriated and shared out between them a R[Rand]142 million Japanese grant intended for small-scale business development. Political analysts expect more Cabinet resignations as the corruption scandal continues to rock the government of President Frederick Chiluba. While he has not been linked to corruption, Chiluba is being accused of weakness or incompetence in failing to stamp it out. The Anti-Corruption Commission, set up by the government, says it has begun investigating allegations by Mwaanga that some of his former Cabinet colleagues had long been engaged in corruption.
