In addition to creating a new situation for exchange with foreign countries, it has also contributed positively to developing Chinese diplomacy and expediting the modernization of the Chinese Armed Forces. In 1993, Chinese Armed Forces received over 1,300 members of 120 military delegations and groups from more than 40 countries, and sent more than 60 delegations and groups to visit 36 countries. During the same year, naval vessels and over 2,300 officers and men from Russia and three other countries visited China, and the Chinese naval vessel, the "Zheng He," visited Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Thailand. Chinese Armed Forces continued to maintain relatively high-level contacts with armed forces in neighboring countries last year. The frequent exchange of visits by ranking officers has contributed positively to promoting good neighborliness. Chinese Armed Forces increased contacts and broadened exchanges with armed forces of certain countries with which contacts had been infrequent or disrupted. The establishment of contacts with the armed forces of countries with which military contacts were reestablished not long ago has enhanced mutual understanding and friendship. Chinese Armed Forces' specialized technological exchanges with foreign armed forces were even more active. Some PLA delegations and groups went abroad on study and inspection tours, and for advance studies or technical training; and the Chinese PLA also received many foreign delegations and specialized technology groups. During the specialized technological exchanges, Chinese Armed Forces and their foreign counterparts shared with one another their experiences about military construction and military science and technology, and these exchanges have promoted understanding, developed cooperation, and helped each other improve. To display Chinese Armed Forces' successes in revolutionization, modernization, and regularization, Chinese Armed Forces and colleges opened to foreign visitors have been making active efforts to improve their reception for foreign visitors and they have acted as showcases exhibiting the bearing and high morale of the Chinese Armed Forces.
