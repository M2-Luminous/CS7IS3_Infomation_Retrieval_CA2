Deposition of titanium nitride coatings was preceded by preliminary deposition of titanium on the steel surface. Subsequent processing was done with the steel substrate at a temperature within 550+/-25�C and the nitrogen pressure within 0.25-0.28 Pa, with the bias potential held constant at 100 V and the current varied over the 75-125 A range. The phase composition of the coatings was analyzed in a DRON-3M x-ray diffractometer with Cu-K[.sub]_a_[/] and Co-K[.sub]_a_[/] radiation sources, the results revealing the presence of 0.02-1.0% Fe,Mo,Co,W,Si from the steel. An x-ray structural examination revealed, moreover, not only TiN with a b.c.c. crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4241 nm) but also up to 8% _a_-Ti phase which had formed during the preliminary deposition of titanium. An x-ray spectrum microanalysis was performed with an electronic probe in a ``Cam-Scan'' analyzer. The relative nitrogen content in the coatings was measured using a TiN[.sub]0.06[/] reference specimen. The coatings were tested for abrasion resistance in dry sliding friction, a 2500 m long path being covered at a velocity of 1.1 m/s and the amount of wear being measured by the loss-of-mass method. The heat resistance of coated steel was estimated from the change of mass as specimens were soaking in air at 600�C. Microbrittleness of the coatings was measured with a PMT-3 microhardness tester, the ratio of indentations with cracks to the total number of indentations being thus estimated and the behavior of cracked indentations being tracked as the load was increased from 0.196 N to 1.96 N. Examination of chromium nitride coatings revealed 74% Cr[.sub]2[/]N and 26 % CrN, also traces of chromium which had formed a 0.4 �m thick underlayer after its preliminary deposition. Examination of vanadium nitride coatings revealed traces of vanadium accompanying the principal phase VN with a b.c.c. crystal lattice (parameter a= 0.4123). Coatings of (Ti+Cr) nitrides were found to have a b.c.c. crystal lattice and a nonstoichiometric composition corresponding to (Ti,Cr)N[.sub]0.47[/]: isomorph of TiN and CrN mononitrides rather Ti and Cr dinitrides, despite the low (32 atom%) nitrogen content. Coatings of (V+Cr) nitrides consisted of 79-80% (V,Cr)[.sub]2[/]N and 11-21% (V,Cr)N, both phases having a b.c.c. crystal lattice. The results of mechanical tests indicate that these coatings have a higher heat resistance and a higher wear resistance than TiN and (Ti,Cr) coatings, also when deposited on Ti-W 22 titanium alloy and on 12Cr18Ni10Ti steel.
