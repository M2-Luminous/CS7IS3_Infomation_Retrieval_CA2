(c) A vessel identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) is not required to carry an EPIRB between one hour before sunrise and one hour before sunset if it_ (1) Operates between 3 and 20 minutes from shore and is equipped with an operable VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A and operates within the VHF radio range of at least 1 VHF coast station (same as sea area A1 as defined in 47 CFR 80.1069) or (2) Operates more than 20 miles from shore ``in company'' with at least one other vessel at all times and each vessel is equipped with an operable VHF radio capable of transmitting and receiving on channels 6, 13, 16, and 22A. 5. By revising the section heading and paragraphs (a) introductory text, (a)(2), (b) introductory text and (b)(3) of §25.26&hyph;20 to read as follows: §25.26&hyph;20 Other self-propelled uninspected commercial vessels.

By revising §25.26&hyph;30 to read as follows: §25.26&hyph;30 121.5/243.0 MHz EPIRBs. (a) A 121.5/243.0 MHz EPIRB manufactured after October 1, 1988, may be used to meet certain requirements of §25.26&hyph;5 and §25.26&hyph;20, if the EPIRB is operable and was installed on the vessel on or before April 26, 1993. The EPIRB must be a Class A EPIRB, or a Class B EPIRB which is watertight, self-buoyant, and stable in a floating position to properly transmit a distress signal. (b) A 121.5/243.0 MHz EPIRB manufactured after October 1, 1988, may be used to meet the requirements of §25.26&hyph;10 of this part, if the EPIRB is operable and was installed on the vessel on or before [date 45 days after date of publication in the Federal Register of the final rule].
