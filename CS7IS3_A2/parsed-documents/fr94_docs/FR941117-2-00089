FR941117-2-00089 FR941117-2-00054 Janet Reno, Attorney General # 4400, Department of Justice, Constitution Ave. and 10th St., NW., Washington, DC 20530. July 25, 1994. To whom it may concern: This letter is being written in regards to the ridiculous action brought forth towards Microsoft. Is it Microsoft's fault that they have produced a product that is popular due to the ease in which it takes to operate it? In the statement issued from the Justice department it states that Microsoft has a 70% market share. If it was a monopoly, should that number not be around 90&hyph;95%? To me it looks a little strange to have the Vice-President promoting the Information Super-Highway and the Justice Department going after a company that will help provide a user friendly interface for ``computer novices'' to use in order to navigate the highway with. One reason that Microsoft has such a large market share is that software developers would like to have an operating system standard. Can you imagine the cost for developing an application in 3 or 4 different formats? I believe that this would cripple trade far more than the fact that Microsoft has 70% of the market share. This clearly shows that in America you get penalized for success. ␣␣␣Sincerely, J. Adam Burden.
