The documents were also signed by OECD Secretary-General Jean-Claude Paye and chairman of the OECD council session, Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister of Ireland Dick Spring. The declaration on cooperation envisages, among other things, that Russia will now enjoy the status of observer in various OECD bodies, that it will get access to information possessed by the organisation. The OECD will draw up surveys of the economic situation in Russia, will make recommendations for the implementation of economic reforms, and will assess their effectiveness. The second document signed today lays down the terms for the work of OECD experts in Russia.
