This fact is a very graphic demonstration of the present role of the supreme legislative body of the Russian Federation in the foreign policy decisionmaking process. An abnormal situation, to be blunt. And it is dictated not only by the new constitution, which quite effectively sidelines the legislators from the formulation of foreign policy. The obvious short-sightedness of our foreign policy establishment explained by the less than most felicitous experience of interaction with the former Supreme Soviet and a certain wariness in respect to the new corps of deputies may be traced behind this trend also. The short-sightedness amounts to the fact that even with the current constitution, the influence of parliament is potentially quite considerable: adoption of the budget, items geared to the foreign policy activity of the Russian Federation included; ratification of international treaties and agreements (more than 100 of them are to be approved by the Federal Assembly); the adoption of laws, those regulating the implementation of domestic and foreign policy included; the possibility of a wide-ranging appeal to domestic and world public opinion. Considering this, it has to be concluded that the noninvolvement of the Federal Assembly in the overall foreign policy mechanism could threaten the very foundations of the policy of the Russian Federation in the world arena, which, as we all know, begins at home. In addition, foreign policy can only be consistent and effective when it is based on a certain consensus within the country. And it is hard to count on this when the representative authority is notified post factum. Yes, the Federal Assembly is heterogeneous, and forces with different views on international problems, differing at times from those of the government, are represented in it. But it is just as much a reality as the government, and it is impossible to hope for a rapprochement of views while adopting an ostrich-like position. Parliament's isolation from the formulation of the Partnership for Peace decision was a reason for the very tumultuous debate on this problem in the State Duma, which induced a number of experts to begin talking about the conception of contradictions of the two authorities in the foreign policy sphere. The PFP problem is, indeed, a complex one. And the position of the members of parliament is dictated by no means only by ideological predilections but also by the obvious lack of knowledgeability, the lack of clarity on many essential details (for me included), and the equivocal nature of the assessments of the program in the news media. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has as of late repeatedly addressed, directly or indirectly, the Partnership problem, having published articles by V. Chernov, D. Yevstafyev, V. Katin, and A. Migranyan (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 23 February, 25 February, and 15 March 1994). They, as many other publications also, contain entirely cogent criticism of the PFP and proof of its unsuitability for Russia, which cannot simply be brushed aside. On the other hand, official announcements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation contain outright panegyrics to the program without the least attempt to investigate the essence of the arguments of its opponents or to respond to them. A debate, in which alone can the truth be born, as, equally, a foreign policy course acceptable to the majority, has not eventuated. I shall try to fill in this gap somewhat, summarize and weigh the arguments "for" and "against," and offer the Federal Assembly and the executive certain conclusions. I For the opponents of the Partnership for Peace program the starting point is the negative evaluation of NATO and its role in the modern world. They see no satisfactory answers to the question concerning the reasons for its preservation following the end of the cold war. The opinion of NATO merely as an instrument for securing an American military presence in Europe, in which Russia is interested least of all, is widely held. NATO was created as a global organization for containing communism, and even recently, when it has been confronted mainly with tasks of crisis management, it has, in fact, changed little in its doctrines, focus of operational troop training, and so forth. The distrust of NATO, which lurks far from just in the minds of certain politicians and specialists, but which is also deeply rooted in the public consciousness, is being carried over also to the Partnership, which is, not without reason, being seen as a form of the phased expansion of NATO. Of course, we cannot hope to alter many people's suspicion of NATO overnight, especially since it is not based on sand. But remaining in the soil of reality, not dreams beyond the clouds, we cannot fail to note the strength of the arguments of the supporters of the preservation of NATO, primarily in the West. The North Atlantic bloc exists because the ruling circles of all its constituent countries (and of many that are not such), convinced of its usefulness on the basis of the experience of postwar development, which has made it possible, in their opinion, to secure the longest period of peaceful development in Europe's history, have an interest in this. It may be argued what NATO's actual role in this was, but political leaders and the majority of the populace in the West are reluctant to take a risk, destroying a structure of the need for which they are certain. As we are unwilling to conclusively bring down the CIS, whoever might desire this. NATO will exist and will have its own interests, which do not in all things coincide with Russian interests, and there is no getting away from this. Russia cannot force NATO to dissolve itself, and the more stridently it seeks this, flexing its muscles, the more arguments there will be for the supporters of a strengthening of Atlantic solidarity. But is it advisable for Russia to join the Partnership for Peace, as a kind of NATO locker room, which would be seen as a Russian "go-ahead" for the geographical expansion of its sphere of influence? The opponents of the PFP rightly observe that the arguments of the East European countries seeking via the Partnership a strengthening of their security in an explosive region and guarantees of their sovereignty and territorial integrity are absolutely unacceptable to Russia. The Russian Federation has no enemies from whom it could be protected by NATO, as, equally, the problem of securing the country's independence with the aid of outside forces is a non-issue. We cannot seriously see as the point of the PFP Russia's protection against the territorial claims of certain Baltic states. If, on the other hand, what is meant is NATO's assistance in the security of Russia's southern and Far East borders, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would never assume such commitments. In addition, the affiliation of the Russian Federation and the Central Asian republics to the Partnership could be perceived by China as the approach of NATO right to its borders and could signify a complication of relations with Beijing. The PFP completely disregards the Chinese factor. The interest in the Partnership on the part of NATO is understandable also. In the opinion of some of our experts, this is not only an argument for the geographical expansion of the North Atlantic bloc but also an opportunity to wait out the development of events in Russia and, depending on their outcome, to create either a system opposed to it or a system incorporating the Russian Federation. There is also talk about a certain perfidy of the West, which is endeavoring with the aid of the PFP to fill the vacuum that formed in East and Central Europe following Russia's abandonment of the "Brezhnev doctrine," the withdrawal from there of Russian troops, the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, and the Russian Federation's consent to the unification of Germany. The nonexpansion of NATO was a condition of a number of unilateral Russian steps. But what does Russia need the Partnership for? An answer to this question is, indeed, hard to find if we proceed from the interests of the prevention of direct and indirect threats to Russia's security. Although here also it may be said that Russia has an interest in NATO responsibility for the stability of borders in East Europe, where there are potentially a multitude of destabilizing focal points capable of creating a threat to the Russian Federation and its citizens. The answer should, rather, be sought from the rule of contraries: What would Russia get from nonparticipation in the Partnership program from the viewpoint of its overall geopolitical positions? The idea of the PFP was born, as we know, as a result of the insistent demands of a number of East European countries for their direct membership of NATO. Not ready to receive them and encountering the negative reaction of Russia, Western leaders moved toward the formulation of a compromise, of which the Partnership proposal was the result. That is, it remains a fact that the question of the expansion of NATO was placed and continues to be placed on the agenda, primarily by the governments of East European states which have for this a stable public consensus within their countries. Membership of NATO and the PFP, as a step toward membership, is for them a symbol of the return to Europe and a reflection of the deeply rooted fears (it is pointless now saying to what extent they are justified) in respect to their powerful eastern neighbor. And the degree of attraction to NATO is not connected with the ideological particularities of this government or the other, what is more: The most assertiveness is being displayed by Lithuania and Poland, where former communists, in fact, are in power. The problems of NATO's expansion via the PFP will be resolved not by a "vacuum" but by specific countries of East Europe, the influence of Russia on which has diminished unswervingly in recent years. Were the Russian Federation to refrain from participation in the PFP, East Europe would not, for all that, follow its example. Thus whether the Partnership is realized or not will not depend on Russia's position. It will be realized. Whether it exists with Russia or without it will depend on us. If without, it is highly likely that this will, indeed, be a partnership against Russia. Participating in the program, we could influence its realization. Not doing so, the Russian Federation would forfeit every opportunity for this and would achieve nothing other than splendid self-isolation from the rest of Europe. Counting on a development of Russian policy on the southern and eastern azimuths is unrealistic, to say the least, considering, in particular, that countries of the European continent account for half of Russia's foreign trade turnover and the lion's share of the overseas capital investments coming to us. At the same time, not affiliating with the Partnership, the Russian Federation would be cutting off for itself the possibility of the achievement of a number of geopolitical goals of considerable importance: postponing the question of the immediate expansion of the NATO bloc and deciding on a compromise formula, influencing its further realization; strengthening military-political cooperation along East-West lines; enabling countries of West and East Europe to feel more secure, which would help beat down the "post-Zhirinovskiy" wave of anti-Russian sentiment there; undertaking in earnest for the first time a surmounting of the civilization barrier between East and West and contributing to Russia's integration in the world community. II A large place in the discussion of Partnership problems is occupied by questions of the equality of the partners and of Russia's participation in this program on a par with the leading Western countries, not only with Lithuania or Romania. Truly, the Partnership program specifies the equal status of the newly admitted participants, but not the equality of the latter and the NATO graybeards. Having let slip the initiative of the creation of the PFP, Russia let through ahead of it several of what are not the greatest East European states and has now found itself standing in a long line for membership of this program. If the Partnership is regarded as NATO's backup team, should Russia be playing for it when, on the one hand, it is in terms of its playing possibilities good enough for the main team and, on the other, it is still not a fact that it will be accepted by this main team. It should be agreed that there is a large proportion of truth in all these arguments. Russia, truly, is not an ordinary "partner." It is the sole potential participant in the PFP which possesses nuclear weapons and which has, in addition, most powerful army and naval forces and immense scientific and technological potential. There is a multitude of organizations in the world, from the United Nations through the International Monetary Fund, which make provision for the special status of the most influential states. Take if only the UN Security Council. Unfortunately, Washington and Brussels did not take Russia's concern at this problem into account. Our diplomats also, most likely, were in too much of a hurry to agree to the lack of special status for Russia, particularly considering the information, which NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has reported also (15 March 1994), concerning the readiness of NATO Headquarters and the capitals of the bloc's leading powers to make a curtsy in Moscow's direction on this matter. A serious opportunity for full-fledged partnership was also let slip right at the outset, when the program was proposed on behalf of NATO. Partnership as an initiative emanating jointly from the United States and Russia and addressed simultaneously to the countries of the North Atlantic bloc and East Europe would undoubtedly have suited us. The question of the prospect of Russia's membership of NATO is far from having been decided. As Andranik Migranyan observed, "were Russia to immediately become a full member of NATO, and this organization became a universal structure ensuring security in Europe, only a madman would not support such a development of events." The West's consent to Russia's membership of NATO cannot be ruled out, but this only in the long term. At hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee in the U.S. Senate on 23 March, Assistant Secretary of State S. Talbott declared that this could happen "when many other things have happened." Such wording does not, I believe, need any translation from diplomatic into normal language. Problems of Russia's participation in the leadership of the PFP and the mechanism of the formulation of decisions within its framework still remain to be clarified. Will the decisions be adopted by a consensus of all the participants or will this prove to be the prerogative of NATO? It is perfectly obvious that the latter would be simply unacceptable to Russia, especially when we have before us the recent graphic example of the NATO Bosnia bombing decision, which was not coordinated with the Russian Federation and which was contrary to its position. Experts cite one further problem in this connection--peacekeeping operations within the Partnership framework and joint maneuvers of the participants to perfect them, in East Europe included. The uncertainties here are connected with whether NATO intends to take account of Moscow's opinion or not when planning the forms, timeframe, scale, and geography of such maneuvers. If not, a threat to stability in East Europe could arise. But despite all the complexity of the questions concerning the role, status, and influence of Russia in the PFP, the possibility in principle of their relatively acceptable solution cannot be ruled out either. As we know, a universal Partnership formula does not exist. Each country will draw up an individual plan of its participation, which should take account of its interest in this aspect of cooperation or other and its actual possibilities. The members of parliament did not have a chance to familiarize themselves with the draft of this plan. But if this document stipulates specific and particular forms of Russia's participation not in the program itself but also in its leadership and in joint planning, the problem of status could largely be resolved. Ultimately Russia's actual role will be determined by its actual military and economic power, which is many times greater than the indicators of Lithuania or Ukraine even. III Pointing to the undesirability of NAT0's territorial expansion as an instrument for securing primarily American influence, the opponents of the Partnership propose that this be counterposed by a strengthening of cooperation within the framework of European and more neutral structures. In his message to the Federal Assembly the president of the Russian Federation proposed the use as a leading instrument of the shaping of a new system of military-political partnership not of NATO at all but of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), which could coordinate the activity of regional organizations--NATO, the Western European Union (WEU), and the CIS. Boris Yeltsin also noted the expediency of the countries of Central Europe being accorded long-term guarantees on the part of Russia and NATO, which would become utterly meaningless following realization of the Partnership. But counterposing European to transatlantic security structures is not compulsory, in my view. A strict tie to NATO is possible only in the event of the Partnership being the sole program of military-political cooperation in Europe. But I do not believe that such a formulation of the issue would suit Russia or the majority of European countries either. Consequently, the Partnership should be supplemented by efforts for the creation of additional instruments of security and cooperation in Europe--via a strengthening of Russian ties to the WEU, a corresponding expansion of the mandate of the CSCE, and so forth. The Partnership, which is not without problems for us as the sole program, would prove more acceptable as one of many contributing to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic space. Publications on the PFP have paid little attention to one further problem which is, from my viewpoint, of considerable significance in a solution of the question of Russia's affiliation to it: What is the degree of consensus in respect to the Partnership and the Russian Federation's participation in it in the Western countries themselves? Is it not the expression of the position of a certain stratum of elites which could change with a change in political winds, which would altogether undermine the program's prospects? It should be noted that the PFP has, truly, very many opponents in the West. And criticism is being heard from both the conservative and the liberal camps, what is more. The position of the first is clearly formulated in a recent article by Henry Kissinger in THE WASHINGTON POST, in which he wrote, in part: "It (the PFP) equates the victims of Soviet and Russian imperialism with the imperialists themselves and accords the Central Asian republics bordering Afghanistan the same status as Poland, which has been the victim of four divisions with the participation of Russia and which has served as a route via which Russia has historically invaded Europe." Liberals, however, on the contrary, see no great value in the existence of NATO under modern conditions and would prefer that it operate in an unenlarged composition and that security in the Old World be secured by way of a deepening of the all-European process. Agreement to Russia's participation in the PFP in Western capitals is of a far from unconditional nature and reflects a certain compromise in their ruling circles and is supported grudgingly by the "silent majority" of politicians, who would prefer to see the Russian Federation outside of NATO structures. But does this mean that Russia should wait for the moment when it ceases to be summoned to the Partnership (which could happen quite soon) and the problem is resolved of its own accord? The opposite, I am sure: Russia should not let slip the integrative opportunity it has been afforded. When doors are slammed shut for it in the Partnership, they will also close, I fear, in many other European and international organizations which our country would like to enter. Entering them would be far more difficult, in any event. IV The PFP evokes serious misgivings among the participants in closer rapprochement of the CIS countries. The Partnership would be realized on an individual basis with each state, regardless of its membership in this organization or the other. Russia, individually, Belarus, individually. The concern as to how in this situation account would be taken of the interests of the CIS as a separate organization and of the existence within its framework of the collective security system is appropriate. Crudely put, would the Partnership not pilfer the Commonwealth of Independent States? On the one hand the answer to this question will depend primarily on the CIS countries themselves, on their desire to move toward a closer alliance with one another. The individual membership of NATO of some and the nonparticipation of others did not, after all, prevent the states of West Europe from creating the European Community, where the level and dynamics of integrative processes are superior to the corresponding trends in the CIS. On the other, the affiliation of countries of the Commonwealth to the Partnership has already begun--Georgia and Ukraine. If Russia has no real levers for influencing the decision of this former Union republic or the other concerning membership of the PFP (as would appear to be the case now), its own nonparticipation would threaten it with self-isolation not only from East Europe but from the CIS also, which would do the CIS irreparable damage. If, on the other hand, we proceed from the presence of such levers (the factors of economic, financial, and energy dependence), preventing a negative development of events for the CIS, having harmonized among all its members the common principles of affiliation to the Partnership which do not jeopardize the Commonwealth's system of collective security, should constitute no difficulty for Russia. V Finally, the last bloc of problems, connected with the domestic political consequences of Russia's affiliation to the Partnership. Unfortunately, our country has never had a tradition of the implementation of foreign policy with regard to the frame of mind of society and the opinions of the opposition (which, for the most part, has not existed either). And, following the emergence of political pluralism, this tradition has had quite an excruciating birth. I have no information about or sense of the adoption of the decision on participation in the PFP having been preceded by soundings of public opinion or evaluations of the possible reaction of the main political groups and the short-term and long-term influence of affiliation to the Partnership on the alignment of political forces or of the formulation of a set of measures to explain the essence of the program to the public. At the same time, I fear that Russian public opinion and the politicians are far from a consensus on the question of the PFP and that a purely apical decision on membership, on not the most advantageous terms particularly, could add to the antireform forces' arguments in their charges against the government of another national humiliation. If the president, the Foreign Ministry, and Ministry of Defense really consider the Partnership acceptable for Russia, they should be devoting far more attention to a justification of their position than they are at present. Otherwise this most important foreign policy action could introduce a serious split in society and weaken the positions of these state institutions themselves. I am also unfamiliar with serious estimates of the cost of Russia's participation in the PFP. Foreign policy is not free. The Partnership specifies that the main expenditure shall be borne by the countries that have signed the agreement themselves. With the present strained situation as regards the state budget, the question of the actual amounts would seem far from idle, and the Federal Assembly could hardly formulate its position without an answer to it. Responses to the arguments of its opponents concerning the negative impact of the PFP on the domestic military-industrial complex as a result of realization of the demands that the participants in the Partnership adapt to the military standards of NATO would be of great significance for an evaluation of the program. In this case, the former say, the markets of the East European countries would be closed to Russia's arms manufacturers, which would make the situation in our military-industrial complex even worse. Truly, "standardization" is a central problem. As far as I know, it is a question of standards of military planning, not official NATO standards regarding specific types of arms, especially since in the North Atlantic bloc itself the standardization of arms remains an unattainable goal. But, in any event, the question of the future of Russian arms exports in connection with affiliation to the Partnership should be clarified unequivocally by the departments concerned. It would be unacceptable to Russia were the PFP to force it to restructure its own military production, to purchase arms in the West even more. VI Proceeding from all that has been said above, the following basic conclusions may be drawn. The Partnership for Peace is a far from impeccable program and in many of its parameters it does not entirely correspond to Russia's national interests. But our country does not have a practical possibility of preventing its realization. The Russian Federation's nonparticipation in the Partnership would threaten it with serious isolation in the international arena and with a narrowing of the possibilities of influencing the process of the formation of a new Euro-Atlantic space. It is my belief that the negative geopolitical consequences of Russia's estrangement from the PFP are more appreciable than the consequences of its affiliation to the program. It is from this, first and foremost, that the chambers of the Federal Assembly should proceed when formulating their approaches to the Partnership. The Federal Assembly should, on the whole, support Russia's participation. But the adoption of a final decision will be possible after certain conditions have been met and a number of positions explained: 1. The Federal Assembly should have an opportunity to closely study the draft program of the Russian Federation's participation in the Partnership. 2. This program should make provision for questions of the parties' specific obligations and Russia's participation in the process of the formulation and adoption of decisions at the level of the PFP leadership in respect to all its possible actions, peacekeeping operations included. The adoption of decisions within the Partnership framework via the NATO mechanism is hardly acceptable for Russia. We are interested in equal partnership with elements of special status. 3. The Partnership must not determine standards of the arms of the participants. 4. Expenditure on Russia's participation in the PFP must be entered as a separate line in the federal budget and approved by the Federal Assembly. 5. In connection with possible affiliation to the Partnership the president and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation should take decisive steps to harmonize questions of the participation therein of CIS countries, stimulate efforts geared to a strengthening of ties to the WEU and an expansion of military cooperation within the CSCE framework, and increase contacts with the Asia-Pacific region for the creation there of a separate system of collective security. The Partnership for Peace should not be the sole instrument of the assurance of military security in Europe and throughout the Northern hemisphere. 6. An agreement on Russia's membership of the Partnership must specify its ratification by the Federal Assembly. There remains, of course, one further question: Will the government take account of parliament's opinion? Since it is of a mind to participate in the Partnership for Peace, the executive has two main paths of advancing this idea. The first is to subscribe to it, having ignored the external legislative authority. Technically this is possible, if the PFP is presented as an international program, not an agreement requiring ratification. But such a path could hardly be deemed correct politically, considering the need for subsequent approval for the financing of the program and the possibility of the legislators creating an extremely unfavorable reputation for the Partnership in public opinion. The second path--more complex, but more promising also--is to attempt to persuade both the Federal Assembly and the citizens of Russia of the correctness of one's position.
