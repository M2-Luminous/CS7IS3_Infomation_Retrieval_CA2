Does this mean that the bank is conducting economic policy? [Issing] Monetary measures can, of course, influence the economic situation. However, we are not directly responsible for it. It is well-known that we have a medium-term concept and have enough liquidity in relation to the current economic situation. That is why there is no need for monetary policy to be used to stimulate the economy. [Richter] However, the economy and stock markets in Germany and Europe could use a small boost from the interest rates. Will the interest rates continue to fall? [Issing] Our opinion is that the Bundesbank interest rates have reached a level that is appropriate in the context of the present economic situation and current problems. [Richter] The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised key interest rates once again. Will that block further decisions on the part on the Bundesbank? [Issing] One cannot talk about blocking. Our decisions are generally based on the situation in Germany. The trend since the interest rates were raised in the United States and reductions in the interest rates were made in Germany shows that the interdependence is not as great as it is regularly made out to be. [Richter] So, you are not concerned that the increase in U.S. interest rates will weaken the German mark? [Issing] Much has been said about the German mark becoming weaker, but this has not in fact occurred. Confidence in the stability of the currency in the medium term is something that a central bank can and should supply. This kind of strategy also makes it possible for a currency to weather critical situations. We must remain cool and can be sure that, despite all the difficulties -- we do not dispute that fact -- we are on the right track. [Richter] The money supply is growing much more rapidly than it should. Do you think this is dangerous? [Issing] The figures on the money supply do indeed give us something to think about. We cannot be satisfied with the inflation rate, which was 3 percent in May and has thus reached the lowest level in years. In any event, the money supply figures have been affected by special factors since the end of last year. [Richter] What sort of factors are they? [Issing] For example, the lawmakers have included financial funds with accumulated interest in the tax on interest rates. This has led to a situation in which in December 1993 alone, German investors sold funds worth 25 billion German marks [DM]. The increase in interest rates that has come out of the United States and the higher degree of volatility in the financial markets have increased a tendency among investors to achieve higher liquidity. [Richter] How long will it take for this excessive accumulation of liquidity to be eliminated? [Issing] It will not happen overnight. However, I think that, from the point of view of time deposits, the growth in the money supply will slow down over the new next few months. [Richter] Does the M3 money supply measure still provide you with reliable information for fiscal policy? [Issing] The information that this indicator is furnishing at the present time makes some people wonder whether money supply definitions or the procedures for calculating the money supply should not be changed. However, at the present time, the growth in the M3 supply is not a problem that can be solved on a technical level. Other definitions also show that there is more than enough money. The problem is that excessive liquidity has to be eliminated. However, this should not happen through inflationary expenditure, but through long-term investment. [Richter] In view of the public debt mountain and expenditure on interest that amounts to 20 percent of the budget, is there any room for maneuvering worth mentioning at all? [Issing] If other areas at the macroeconomic level cannot contribute to stability, that will make things all the more difficult for monetary policy. However, I think that a new way of thinking has penetrated all areas. With the shock of German unity, fiscal policy did indeed come to grips with limiting expenditure far too late. Net new debt must be significantly reduced and there is a broad consensus on that. In the case of wage policy, there must be a clear improvement. This automatically means that things will be easier in the case of monetary policy, or, to be more exact, less difficult. [Richter] How do you expect the economic situation to develop? [Issing] There will be a clear improvement, but I think the present euphoria has gone too far. However, confidence also contributes to overcoming the recession. There has been a marked increase in foreign orders; the construction industry is as robust as before; even the problem child engineering is improving. There is a whole series of positive factors that allow one to expect a further improvement. [Richter] What about private consumption? [Issing] It is the biggest risk in the case of economic development. This year, after taxes, consumers will have less in real terms than a year ago. The prospects for next year are also not that rosy. Taxes and other deductions have reached a record level and will also rise next year. That applies to both private individuals and companies. This cannot be allowed to get any worse. Nowhere has the economic growth rate that we need been achieved with this level of taxation. [Richter] Can one come to grips with unemployment with the current concepts? [Issing] The problems that we have accumulated in this regard cannot be overcome with a one-shot wage freeze following the substantial wage increase of the past few years. We have to live for some time with this legacy. However, in conjunction with a whole series of measures aimed at achieving more flexibility, which has, for example, been the case with the wage settlements in the chemical and metal industries, it is a first step in the right direction. [Richter] Despite strong resistance on your part, money market funds are in fact going to be permitted in Germany. Why has the Bundesbank given in? [Issing] Following a substantial reduction in minimum reserve levels, we estimate that there is a danger that such funds will lead to the circumventing of our minimum reserves and that they will be of much less significance than in the past. We have, however, indicated our serious concern that the public purse is financing state debt on a short-term basis. That cannot and should not be the price for making Germany more attractive as a financial center. [Richter] Would it become that by permitting new financial instruments? [Issing] One should not believe in any wonders in this respect. Germany as a financial center is not something that is in itself desirable, but it should be attractive for German and international investors and secure investment should be possible. In particular, it should not make monetary policy more difficult from our point of view. [Richter] Is that something that has to be feared? [Issing] Yes, in the sense that money market funds can become substitutes for time deposits, for example, and they have be to added to the M3 money supply. One would have to consider whether investment in money market funds cannot be included in a new money supply measure. [Richter] What risks to our financial system are concealed in the growing market for so-called derivative financial products? [Issing] At first sight, in view of the ludicrous sums involved, derivatives financial products are ideally suited for scaring people away. Very few people realize that the risk potential in derivative financial products only accounts for a fraction of public money. They are not something terribly dangerous in themselves; what they are above all are instruments for providing security against risks. [Richter] But they have always played a very big part in financial crises. [Issing] There is not enough evidence for that with respect to the past. The main danger with these instruments is that people who cannot see or assume risks get involved with them. [Richter] How fine is the dividing line between derivate products business and monetary policy? Do they make the federal bank's interest rate weapon ineffective? [Issing] Until now, the relationship to monetary policy has been weak. That is why there is no new message for monetary policy from derivative products. However, if such products really will be used as investment instruments in Germany to a great extent, we will have to reconsider our monetary policy course. In any event, we must become better acquainted with this relationship and then draw the appropriate conclusions. The appearance of new financial instruments has concrete economic grounds. That is why it makes little sense to think in terms of prohibitions. [Richter] With respect to Europe, it is not only the Germans who appear to be weary of Europe. [Issing] The feeling of disillusionment is, of course, a reaction to the sometimes excessive euphoria of the past. The single market, Maastricht, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, initially created the impression that one could start immediately. Thus, "marry in haste, repent at leisure" can naturally be applied to the ambitious plans for establishing such close links between different nations. [Richter] Is it not the case that integration seems to have become more difficult from the viewpoint of a timeframe as well as from that of the convergence criteria that have been adopted? [Issing] The economic situation in Europe has changed. One could not have reasonably believed that the growth years would simply carry on without any problems. The convergence criteria clearly set out the homework that each individual country still has to carry out. That also applies to Germany. However, to conclude that the "Europe venture" has failed as a result is something that I consider just as premature as the previous euphoria.
