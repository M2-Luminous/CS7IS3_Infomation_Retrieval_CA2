Under circumstances in which North-South dialogue, including working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, is expected to be resumed soon, remarkable differences in the natures of unification-related ministers have been revealed, particularly, between Deputy Prime Minister Yi and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in many aspects. Since he assumed the post of deputy prime minister--overseer of unification policies--Yi brought up the North Korean human rights issue, which is considered to be the most sensitive issue for North Korea. Following this, on 11 January, during his visit to the administration office for the five North Korean provinces in Kugidong, Seoul, he stressed that "in order to achieve the reunification we desire, North Korea must also change," and that he would not hold dialogue merely as a matter of formality. In a recent interview with a daily newspaper, he said that "for North and South of Korea to reconcile substantially and advance toward reunification, holding a substantive meeting is important. This is what has prompted my recent remarks that the time for us to choose words only to please North Korea are now gone." His remarks clearly hark back to remarks made in the era of North-South confrontational diplomacy clearly, and clearly display his disposition. His remarks can also be interpreted to be a signal that he will implement different policies from those of his predecessor who stressed an "appeasement policy" in a bid to induce North Korea to open up. An expert in North Korean affairs pointed out: Deputy Prime Minister Yi consistently makes improvisatory, expedient remarks instead of providing concrete principles by which we should abide. Such remarks are not helpful to future North-South relations. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han, who is in fact exclusively handing the North Korean nuclear issue that has emerged as the core of North-South problems, was denounced by North Korea sometime ago for his hardline remarks against the North. However, his position has always been one of emphasizing "dialogue," and has thus avoided making remarks that would irritate North Korea. In an article entitled "Foreign Minister Han and the North Korean Nuclear Issue," THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States recently wrote that "Minister Han regards North Korea not as a sworn enemy but as a capricious, sometime unpredictable, and violent partner and sometimes, as an old relative. Thus, he is full of confidence in dealing with North Korea with a sense of humor and negotiations to the last." This article adequately portrays his nature. The two also seem to differ on their standpoint on North Korea which is the underlying consciousness to resolving the North Korean problem. Deputy Prime Minister Yi was involved in the working-level contacts for sending and receiving relief materials between North and South Korea in 1984, and attended the 10th full-dress meeting of North-South Red Cross talks in December 1985 as a senior delegate to the Red Cross talks. As a result, he seems to be keenly aware that North Korea is chiefly responsible for the fact that meetings were held only for the sake of talks between the North and the South and that there was no substantive improvement in North-South relations. Therefore, although he does not make remarks openly, Deputy Prime Minister Yi, like many other conservatives, seems to firmly believe that North Koreans are not to be trusted and that a great number of problems exist in North Korea. On the other hand, Minister Han has said: While North Korea uses tactics of driving the situation to an extreme on one hand, it also appears to use reason in handling issues overall. However, there are differences in views between upper-level and lower-level officials which is a factor undermining such reason. This factor is being reflected in negotiation conditions and attitudes in actual negotiations. Minister Han's such view on North Korea reflects a position and will to understand North Korea and to overcome such problems. Thus, his view, in general, is similar to that of former Deputy Prime Minister Han, with only a slight difference. However, there is a great distance between the views of Minister Han and new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. This somewhat progressive viewpoint of Minister Han did not attract much attention as it was shadowed by former Deputy Prime Minister Han's remarks, which served as a shield. However, with no Deputy Prime Minister Han, Foreign Minister Han should now attempt to stand alone, because at a glance, no one else amongst the unification-related ministers seems to be more progressive than himself.
