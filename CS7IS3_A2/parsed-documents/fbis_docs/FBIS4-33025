The institute said Cuba was the country with the greatest increase in exports to Colombia between January and April, as compared to the same period last year. Cuba is followed by the Cayman Islands (800 percent), Poland (351 percent), and Sweden (210 percent). Colombia and Cuba resumed their trade relations in 1990 and their diplomatic ties last October following 12 years of broken relations, which began in 1981 when President Julio Cesar Turbay accused the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro of supporting guerrilla groups. The Cuban Embassy in Colombia told EFE that Colombia imports steel, salt for industrial use, generic medicines, vaccines, and biotechnological products, from the Caribbean island while Colombia sells Cuba textiles, electricity cables, machinery, and coke, among other products. Colombia's greatest increase in imports, by groups of countries or economic blocs, came from the Andean Group countries (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela) where Colombian purchases increased 20.82 percent followed by the European Union (EU) with 13.11 percent. Colombian imports during the first four months of the year totalled $1.321 billion and its principal markets are the United States and Venezuela, in that order.
