FR940404-0-00027 FR940404-0-00013 The projected inventory for Knox County showed that, even with the 9.0 psi RVP standard, the total emissions for VOC, NO x , and CO for the year 2004 will be less than the 1990 base year total emissions for those pollutants. Accompanying the redesignation request was a request to revise the Federal RVP standard for Knox County from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi. Tennessee's maintenance demonstration assumed a 9.0 psi standard for RVP. EPA deferred action on the relaxation of the RVP standard until after redesignation was completed. On October 18, 1993 the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation re-asserted its request that the EPA revise the Federal RVP standard from 7.8 psi to 9.0 psi for Knox County. A copy of the letter, signed by Mr. John W. Walton, P.E., Director, Tennessee, Division of Air Pollution Control, has been placed in the docket at the location shown in the `` ADDRESSES '' section of this notice. V.
