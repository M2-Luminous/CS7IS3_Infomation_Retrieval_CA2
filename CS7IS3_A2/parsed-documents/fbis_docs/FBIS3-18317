The U.S. planes were acting within the terms of the no-fly-zone resolution authorised by the Security Council nearly a year ago. Though the zone has been repeatedly violated by helicopter flights on all three sides, this is the first time in months that fixed-wing aircraft have defied the ban. Eyewitness accounts appear to confirm that the six Bosnian Serb Galebs (two got away) were making a bombing raid against targets on the ground and had inflicted significant damage. We do not know whether their flight was intended as a deliberate challenge and if so, by what level of the Bosnian Serb leadership. But the Galebs were taking a chance -- and they paid for it. Had they flown a month ago, or at any time before the recent NATO ultimatum, it is quite possible that the Bosnian Serbs would have got away with it. The UN and those acting in its name have got tougher: if the Galebs' flight was designed to test this greater resolve, it secured a straightforward answer. Yesterday should also have seen the start of a more determined effort to get aid convoys past the blockades (mounted by combatants of all forces) which have so often forced them to grind to a halt. Instead the first convoy to travel under the new rules was halted by the UNHCR "until the system clarified." This is an early demonstration of an obvious truth -- often stressed by the aid workers themselves -- that being tough in one area can make life harder in another. There is no easy answer to this dilemma. The Russian government (Mr Zhirinovskiy is another matter) appears to accept that if the Serb planes were engaged in offensive operations, then they were liable to UN sanction under a resolution which Moscow had fully endorsed. That does not diminish the political difficulty for the Russians if this leads to further incidents in which UN forces clash with the Serbs. A more forceful policy also has to steer very carefully between letting the Serbs off too easily and driving them into their preferred state of beleaguered martyrdom. It is essential too that the forces of the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims must be rigorously policed. Incidents such as yesterday's Serb shelling of Tuzla present the UN with what may be a multiplying sequence of very difficult choices. It is unlikely to have been a direct riposte to the shooting down of the four planes. Tuzla, though one of the five UN safe-areas, has been shelled before with impunity, but it is also one of the issues over which the UN Commander intends to proceed more forcefully. Yet this is still a case to be tackled by negotiation rather than further retaliation. As it increasingly adopts the dual roles of peace keeping and peace making, the UN is going to encounter a widening patchwork of difficult and specific problems on the ground. They will need very sensitive handling: they cannot all be shot out of the sky.
