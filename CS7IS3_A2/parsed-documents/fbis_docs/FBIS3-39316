"It went well," said the president in an exclusive interview at the end of his flying visit to Brussels. He spoke to the local representative of BTA in very good English at the luxurious villa of Ambassador Leah Cohen, before he caught the airplane back to Sofia. "I'm satisfied, I'm happy, I think it was a good thing for Bulgaria, for its national security in the long run. There will be a gradual integration of Bulgaria into the European structure," President Zhelev said. At NATO headquarters, Zhelev met with the deputy secretary general, Sergio Balanzino, because the secretary general, Manfred Woerner, has had three operations for cancer in the last year and is still recovering from the last one. The agreement Zhelev signed is the standard form admitting Bulgaria to the process of association without full membership. It has already been signed by the leaders of Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia. Bulgaria was thus the eighth country to sign, later the same afternoon Latvia became the ninth. At a news conference later at Ambassador Cohen's villa in the richest part of Brussels, with the local police waiting outside in the tree-lined streets on motorcycles to escort his limousine to the airport for the airplane home, Zhelev was pressed about the situation in Bosnia. He called the NATO threats to attack Serbian artillery around Sarajevo an "act of peace" and expressed the hope that it would have a sobering effect on the combatants. When he had a brief glass of Bulgarian wine before getting into his limousine, the BTA correspondent asked him about the political situation in Bulgaria. He said he thought there would be elections at the end of this year. Asked if there would be a coalition with the Turkish political interests, Zhelev said it was too early to tell.
