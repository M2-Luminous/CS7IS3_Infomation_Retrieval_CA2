FBIS4-64809 "drweu089_p_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 GREECE Albania, Berisha Accused of New Provocations Albania, Berisha Accused of New Provocations NC0605171594 Athens ELEVTHEROTIPIA in Greek 6 May 94 p 13 NC0605171594 Athens ELEVTHEROTIPIA Greek BFN [Text] Following the meeting between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and his Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi in Zurich last Tuesday [3 May], the Albanian side continues to maintain a hard and often provocative stance. At the same time, it says it is ready and willing to normalize bilateral relations. The official Albanian Foreign Ministry statement issued after Serreqi's return from Zurich maintains the entire offensive stance toward Athens with detailed reportage on the issues that the Albanian side raised with Papoulias. Albanian President Sali Berisha, in an interview yesterday evening, blamed the Greek Government for the bloody incident at Episkopi, and again unsuccessfully attempted to internationalize the issue by claiming that Greece has territorial designs against Albania! The Greek Government, which continues to maintain a soft tone, was forced yesterday through a government spokesman to reject many points in the Albanian statement, which elevated reference to issues by the Albanian side to the level of a "discussion" between the two foreign ministers. Thus, the government spokesman denied that there was a discussion on the issue of Tsamidhes, which the Albanian side had indeed mentioned. The spokesman also said that the Greek Government cannot address Tirana's demand to suspend the operations of radio stations in Corfou and Konitsa, which address the Greek minority in Albania. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: "The government has its policy. Greek society has its views, which are free, as long as they respect the Constitution and the laws of the state, and the Albanian side should become familiar with the regulations of a democratic and constitutionally based state...." However, the intentional inaccuracies of the official Albanian statement on the Papoulias-Serreqi meeting clearly prove that Tirana does not plan at the moment, perhaps even for domestic reasons, to proceed quickly with the normalization of Greek-Albanian relations. In the same statement, Tirana insists that "the hold put on implementing the decision to reduce the Greek Embassy's staff does not mean that the decision will not be implemented...." and again mentions "a logical time frame" for reduction of the personnel. According to the same post-dated statement on the meeting between the two ministers, the Albanian Government also orally rejects the Greek initiative and plan for recognition of Albanian seasonal workers in Greece. In its statement, the Albanian side notes that the "draft agreement does not solve the issue of legalizing the current economic migration of Albanians to Greece." In the same statement, Tirana also raises the issue of the "border status," claiming that the two ministers also discussed the issue of "the presence of proto-Albanians (Arvanites)"!!! in Greece. In a television interview on Antenna Television yesterday, Albanian President Berisha appeared equally provocative. On the one hand, Berisha says he is optimistic about the bilateral problems which he hopes will be solved, but on the other hand he directly accuses Greece of having "territorial designs against Albania." Berisha said: "In order to convince not only me but also the international community that the Greeks do not have territorial designs, I want them to sign the Florence Protocol... As long as they do not sign the Protocol and say that in their strategy they include the so-called North Epirus, Albania will have no relations with Greece and Cyprus. No country would believe that they have a friendly policy and do not have designs in Albania with such a policy..." Berisha again directly blames the Greek Government for the incident in Episkopi, and by invoking the UN Charter (!!) he charges that "any country that allows its territory to be used by commandos or terrorist groups is accountable...."
