FR940523-2-00019 FR940523-2-00008 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940540&hyph;4140] Establishment of the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) Interpreter Test Service, Which Tests an Interpreter's Conformance to Version 1 CGM as Specified in FIPS 128&hyph;1, Computer Graphics Metafile, and the Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle Support (CALS) Application Profile (AP) (MIL&hyph;D&hyph;28003A) AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of establishment of a CGM Interpreter Test Service for testing an interpreter's conformance to FIPS 128&hyph;1 and the CALS CGM AP. SUMMARY: The NIST CGM Interpreter Test Service utilizes the Interpreter Validation Test (IVaT) Suite, Release 1.0 to assess whether an interpreter can correctly and completely parse a binary encoded, Version 1 CGM and produce the intended picture. The IVaT Suite consists of over 200 CGM files, an operator test script, and a set of reference pictures. Specifically, CGMs are processed by the interpreter and the resulting picture is compared to the expected reference picture. The focus of the IVaT Suite is on single element testing, rather than multiple elements. This allows for incremental testing and the specificity needed to determine whether the interpreter under test meets the test criteria. DATES: The interpreter test service was established April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning the CGM Interpreter Test Service and the IVaT Suite should be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: CGM Test Service, Technology Building, room A266, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Lynne Rosenthal, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (301) 975&hyph;3353, email: lsr@nist.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 128&hyph;1, Computer Graphics Metafile, adopts the American National Standards Institute/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/ISO) Computer Graphics Metafile, ANSI/ISO 8632.1&hyph;4:1992, which defines three versions of the Computer Graphics Metafile. FIPS 128&hyph;1 adopts all three versions. Additionally, the FIPS 128&hyph;1 requires the use of application profiles. In particular, the FIPS 128&hyph;1 requires the use of military specification MIL&hyph;D&hyph;28003A, commonly known as the CALS CGM AP, approved in 1991 for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense. In accordance with FIPS 128&hyph;1, the development, storage, and interchange of 2D graphical information should be in the digital format of the CGM. As a data interchange standard, CGM is suitable for the storage and exchange of graphical data (i.e., pictures) among different computers, graphical devices, and applications. In addition to the CGM Interpreter Test Service, the NIST also operates a testing service for both CGM metafiles and generators. The validation processes for metafiles, generators, and interpreters are three distinct processes. For metafiles, the validation focuses on testing an instance of a CGM; that is, a CGM data stream. For generators, the validation focuses on testing the CGM generator and its operating environment. All three testing services test for compliance to Version 1 CGM as specified by FIPS 128&hyph;1. Federal agencies may require conformance to FIPS 128&hyph;1 if computer graphics metafile systems are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Agencies may require testing to determine if a CGM metafile, generator, or interpreter conforms to FIPS 128&hyph;1. A Certificate of Validation or Registered Report provided from the NIST validation test service will be a source for Federal agencies to use in making this determination. The Certificate and Registered Report will be listed in the ``Validated Products List'', which is issued quarterly by NIST and is available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), order number PB94&hyph;937301, telephone (703) 487&hyph;4650. Obtaining Validation Services The NIST provides validation test services on a cost-reimbursable basis. These services are available to both the producers and users of CGM files, generators, and interpreters. Upon request, NIST will supply the client with a CGM Information Pack which will include a description of the test services and procedures. Dated: May 17, 1994. Samuel Kramer, Associate Director.
