An internal BKA report quotes a strategy paper by "Red Zora." It announces "illegal militant organizing" to "destroy patriarchal power." In a 38-page underground brochure entitled "Mili's Dance on the Ice," "Red Zora," which went underground in August 1988, is now again calling for attacks and punishment actions against persons and institutions that it holds responsible for the oppression of women, as the BKA analysis says. In 1978, "Red Zora" attracted attention for the first time with attacks on sex shops. In 1984, there followed attacks on genetic laboratories and the Federal Constitutional Court. In 1987, "Red Zora," which, according to the chief federal prosecutor's office, is an underground organization of the "Red Cells," set fire to the mother company of the Adler clothing company in Haibach near Aschaffenburg and another seven subsidiaries of the company. At that time, the textile corporation was accused by "Red Zora" of exploiting women in South Korea.
