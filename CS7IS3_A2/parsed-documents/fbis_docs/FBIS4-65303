It is not a matter of acknowledging that if the Right has won it is entitled to govern. We have fully acknowledged this right. The country's humiliation emerges from something quite different: from the lies, from the mockery of the "promises" that the Right had made before the voters. We cannot forget that the electorate has been tricked into believing in a new force opposed to party rule and jockeying for position. A fine way of opposing party rule! What we have in the field is a party-cum-corporation that dominates the political news and electoral propaganda markets, whose Big Brother face stares out from the walls of every Italian city, while the free associations of men and women known as parties lack the material resources to compete in this monstrous, unattainable financial challenge. This in itself shows that we are not embarking on the second phase of the republic, a reconfigured, pluralistic, democratic European country with a majority voting system, but that we run the risk of finding ourselves in a sort of republic run as a family firm and kept under the thumb of financial and media power. An arrogant, cynical power: Indeed, Berlusconi heads the list of candidates for the European elections in all five constituencies, knowing full well that, as he is prime minister, he will have to resign five minutes after he has been elected. This is a fraud committed against the voters, who would thus be cheated of their vote and called upon to sanction a caricature of a plebiscite. Is this supposed to be the advance of change? What really confronts us is a government crammed with men linked with the old power system, as numerous media commentators have pointed out. Of all the many hoaxes, this is the greatest. Can Italy, which has been massed for two years in the stands of the great multimedia stadium of courtroom politics, shouting its indignation at the kickback city scandal, admittedly in an, at times, excessively judgmental and vindictive spirit, now fail to notice that, when all is said and done, Bossi, despite his many feigned protestations, and Fini as well, have brought back to power that "second estate" of intrigue that dominated the last years of the republic? Everything has been changed to give more power to those who already influenced, and at times dominated, the transversal politics that had been attempting for some time to destroy not party rule -- which was sacrosanct -- but the parties of the poor, the chance for the humiliated and oppressed to band together to defend themselves. We have heard ministers in this government state shamelessly that promises are only made during election campaigns to catch votes. Indeed, the dream has already faded: The million jobs have faded away; the promise to form a government avoiding long drawn-out interparty negotiations has faded away; the promise of substantial tax reductions all round has faded away; the principle whereby the prime minister-designate would choose the ablest men best suited to the jobs, leaving aside considerations of party expediency, has faded away. The result staring us in the face is not a competent right-wing administration of the type that we have seen in France and Britain, with men and women of quality. No, this administration is enough to make one shed tears of national shame. For us, the opposition, it could well turn out to our advantage. But we love our country, and we do not want to see it humiliated. We tremble at the mere idea that the forthcoming European elections could take this "new" ruling class beyond the frontiers of Italy and reveal it for what it is: the worst in Italian cunning, opportunism, and demagoguery placed at the service of those who have always held power. Indeed, we go into Europe with a government to which the president of the republic has felt the need to address an anxious admonition, warning it against the risk that failure to take a clear stance on issues crucial to government policy and to democratic life itself may damage the republic both without and within its frontiers, and even calling on it not to adopt political positions contrary to the principles of freedom and legality fundamental to our constitutional charter -- an event of enormous, extraordinary, disquieting import! Yet it all ended in a thumbing of noses. This is what is so worrying: If the conscience of a nation has been mithridatized to this extent, the obscure evil can attack and defeat it at any time. But we are convinced that a better Italy has great resources and that the match is by no means over. We shall be a definite, clear- cut opposition, a democratic opposition, firmly anchored to the principles and values of our constitutional charter. However, we have not yet reached an alternative-platform stage. As has been perspicaciously pointed out, the disquieting malaise revealed by the exchange of letters between Scalfaro and Berlusconi no longer allows us merely to put ourselves forward as the spearhead of a vigorous opposition in a normal alternative-platform situation; it has turned us into the champions of a democracy that appears to be heading in a dangerous direction. Weighty words, but born of the somber, unprecedented events leading up to the formation of the government. Either Scalfaro was joking, and I rule that out, or his words are stones. We regard them as stones to be removed. This is why I feel the need to reply to the boy whose faint voice cried, "Wake up, left wing!" on yesterday evening's "Milano-Italia" [television current affairs talk show with audience participation], because it is not true that we have been laid low, there are a lot of us. The Left must wake up, drop the false issues, fight off those who increasingly want to herd us into a corral and keep us there. A wide-awake Left is also a Left that finds the right language to talk to the 60 percent of Italians on the left and in the center who did not vote for the Right. There is already a potential new majority. Let us bring it to life, without imposing hegemonies, with due respect for individuality, but let us bring it to life, if we want Italy to have its hope, self-confidence, and prestige restored.
