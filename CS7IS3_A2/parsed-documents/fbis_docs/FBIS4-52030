FBIS4-52030 "dreas088__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-088-A Daily Report 6 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Labor Unions Search for Political Realignment Labor Unions Search for Political Realignment 942A0086A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 15-19 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0086A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Article in four installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, and Go Soga] [15 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Yamagishi Claims He Was "Double-Crossed by Prime Minister"; Labor Moves Faster Than SDPJ Toward Tripolar Setup "The pace of political realignment is fast." "We must eventually form a new party by uniting the liberal forces of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]." The four chairmen, Morishige Goto of All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union [Jichiro], Eiichi Yokoyama of Japan Teachers' Union [Nikkyoso], Kyuji Sonoki of Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union [Zendentsu], and Mototaka Ito of Japan Postal Workers' Union [Zentei], met on the evening of 8 February at the "Yama-no-Ue Hotel" in Kanda, Tokyo. At noon that day, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosakawa had just withdrawn the plan for the national welfare tax that he had personally proposed. "The power of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito is too strong." The four chairmen were in agreement on the above-mentioned views. Ten days earlier, the political reform bill to install the combined small-constituency and proportional representation systems had passed the Diet. How should Rengo and the independent industrial unions handle the elections? How can we keep up with the Shinseito-Komeito bloc while maintaining the coalition regime? The attention of labor leaders, who took pride in having "supported the SDPJ with both money and personnel," was turning from the "SDPJ" to a "new political force." Triggered by Tax Reduction Issue The "tripolar setup proposal," with the SDPJ-DSP liberal group as the axis and Rengo's industrial unions, formerly affiliated with Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions], as the nucleus, took on a sense of reality as a result of the income tax reduction and consumption tax hike issues. "I believe there is someone who is saying various things to the chairman, but he is mistaken." On the evening of 16 December 1993, when coordination was in the final stages as to whether the FY94 budget should be compiled before the yearend or carried over to this year, Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito's acting secretary general, made the above remark to Rengo chairman Akira Yamagishi and Etsuya Washio, secretary general, who were pressing for the "yearend." Immediately before this, Ozawa had strongly demanded the removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to Prime Minister Hosokawa at his official residence. By "someone who is saying various things," he meant Takemura who was advocating compilation by yearend. Ozawa said: "If the compilation is to be completed before yearend, the consumption tax must be considered so the SDPJ, too, will be in a predicament. I am concerned about that." Yamagishi said, "I do not think we have to rely so much on what the Ministry of Finance says." The gap was not bridged. Oppose Ozawa and Ichikawa On 9 January 1994, Yamagishi stated on a TV program that, "a new nonconservative, liberal party should be formed," and suggested Hosokawa and Takemura, as well as Takahiro Yokoji, Hokkaido governor, as leaders of the new party. When asked how about Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general, Yamagishi replied, "I'm not even considering them." This was not the first time that Yamagishi mentioned the "tripolar setup." He had mentioned that on a TV program immediately after formation of the coalition government last summer. However, at that time, he had notified the Ozawa group beforehand that "they shouldn't be too concerned." At the timne, Yamagishi was facing the election for Rengo chairmanship so he probably wanted to indicate to union members that he was distancing himself from Shinseito. However, the tripolar setup proposal early this year came as a "surprise." Then came the uproar over the national welfare tax. Yamagishi said "he felt as though he was double-crossed by the prime minister," and called an emergency executive committee meeting of the Rengo in response to the requests of Takemura and SDPJ chairman Tomiichi Murayama. After confirming that opinions favored "separating tax reductions from tax increases," Yamagishi opposed the course set by Ozawa and Ichikawa. Takemura told his aides that "the schema has now been designed for a confrontation between Rengo and Soka Gakkai, both of which have national organizations." The "tripolar proposal" gained momentum. On 16 February, a little more than a week after the meeting of the four industrial labor union chairmen, Masatada Kitagawa, deputy secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and one of the leaders of the group prepared to leave the party, visited Yamagishi. He said, "In that event, we want the support of Rengo." Working on Yokoji, Too Chairman Goto of Jichiro had dinner with Governor Yokoji on 23 February. "Multiple leaders will have to share responsibilities in the new political entity. You are one of them." Yokoji stated that he planned to participate actively after the budget was approved by the Hokkaido prefectural assembly and, on the following day, he was also persuaded by Yamagishi that, "political reorganization will proceed even if you are not there but it would be better if you are." At a Chinese restaurant in Akasaka in the evening of 2 March, political department chiefs of 10 industrial-labor unions, including Jichiro and Nikkyoso, six Diet members of the Sakigake [Harbinger] new party, including Hidemasa Tanaka, former prime minister's special assistant, and five young SDPJ Diet members, as well as former SDPJ Diet members, met for the first time. Listening to the remarks of a Sakigake Diet member (formerly LDP) that, "until a year ago, we were like enemies; times have changed," Yoshito Senya, former SDPJ Diet member, felt somewhat concerned about the fact that "labor unions were moving much faster than the SDPJ." [16 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Repetition of "Piggyback Rides"--Labor Unions Tire of Supporting SDPJ "It is necessary to develop the power to take over the government." In the fall of 1991, when the SDPJ formed a "shadow cabinet" claiming "it would become the ruling party," a request for political fund support was made confidentially to the "Sohyo center" by Tanabe's executive staff. Financially endowed Jichiro, Zentei, Zendentsu, and Nikkyoso ultimately advanced approximately 80 million yen. Actions aimed at breaking away from the image of a "labor union party" were dependent again on labor unions. "Riding piggyback all the way"--that is how a certain industrial union leader sarcastically described the relationship between the SDPJ and labor unions. In last year's general elections, "the labor union council for unity with the SDPJ" collected approximately 450 million yen from participating independent unions and presented the money to the party. Because of the ceiling established in the Political Fund Control Law, the party treated most of the money as "loans." "Loans" Advanced in Each Election Actually, during the days of the "Sohyo Center" and "Sohyo," precedidng bodies of the "unity council," much larger amounts of "loans" had been advanced whenever elections were held. However, with the disbandment of the lending bodies, these loans were "dissolved" (SDPJ official). These were actually political contributions and there was no intention to repay. In the 1992 upper house elections, each industrial union gave approximately 80 million yen to the party for every union candidate it put up in the proportional representation districts. With multiple organizational candidates to sponsor, industrial unions exceeded the ceiling of the control law. There were cases when "a portion was kept confidential" (a certain industrial union leader). For the labor unions, these "political actions" were aimed at obtaining personal benefits, of course, such as increasing the wages of government workers and securing a "shortcut" to meeting various demands concerning "systems and policies." However, the "productive results" of the SDPJ under the LDP's one-party rule were inevitably limited to such actions as "we forced replies from cabinet members" or "we forced supplementary resolutions to be appended." As one industrial union leader puts it, "ultimately, it was only a fight for conditional gains." Significant environmental changes were occurring to directly affect labor unions which had begun to feel a sense of "fatigue" in their relations with the SDPJ. The 1987 partition and privatization of the Japan National Railways [JNR] shocked Zentei, which was a target of similar privatization, and Zendentsu, which feared partitioning. A sense of crisis spread that, "repetition of the failure of the National Railway Workers' Union [Kokuro] must be avoided." Furthermore, Rengo's establishment in 1989 hastened changes in the awareness of former Sohyo affiliates, particularly the leaders of the Government and Public Workers' Union [Kankoro], which had been the nucleus of SDPJ support. A Jichiro executive states: "I personally felt the perceptions being held by private sector labor unions. Private sector members, who can be abruptly handpicked for dismissal, have a different sense of realism. I was impressed by their careful consideration of the future outlook of the economy and enterprises." Disappointment Becomes Overwhelming Moreover, union members were definitely "detaching themselves from the SDPJ." A poll survey showed that "support for SDPJ" did not even reach 20 percent. Funds for the SDPJ had been collected from these union members as "political enlightenment funds" or "political struggle funds." The shadow cabinet was the topic of conversation for a while, with such assertions as, "conditional approval of the `Rising Sun,'" but it soon lost its popularity. In early 1992, labor unions refused to give financial support to the second shadow cabinet, saying "it was useless." In June of that year, the process of establishing the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Law, during which the SDPJ used delay tactics and submitted Diet members' resignation requests, made the labor unions' disappointment an overwhelming one. "We were truly disappointed because resignation requests were submitted, but no one left the Diet members' quarters" (leading industrial union executive). "Disbandment" Not Forecast In the upper house election the following month, all of the candidates officially designated by Rengo were defeated. During that summer, the leaders of the main industrial unions, including Etsuya Washio (Japan Federation of Iron and Steel Workers' Union [Tekko Roren]), Kyuji Sonoki (Zendentsu), Mototaka Ito (Zentei), Teruhito Tokumoto (Federation of Japan Automobile Workers' Union [Jidosha Soren]), Yasuo Iwayama (Japanese Federation of Electrical Workers' Union [Denki Rengo]), and Morishige Goto (Jichiro), met for earnest discussions on the way support to political parties should be handled. From that summer to fall, the participants revealed, one after another, the results of the discussions in speeches to general meetings of various industrial unions. "The time might come for the SDPJ to disband." "It is impossible to form a replacement party by realigning the existing political parties." "Setting up a new party of `like-minded politicians' has the most potential." However, they did not have a firm outlook for the future. With the split of the LDP's Takeshita faction at yearend, the political world moved suddenly to a change in governmental reins and election system reforms, and no one among the labor leaders anticipated that formation of a "new party" would become a realistic task so soon. [17 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Successful in Longstanding Wish To Cooperate With Conservatives--Rengo Is Concerned About "Next Scheme" Born in the mid-1930's, the three persons who might be called the new leaders of the labor circle were telling each other that "governmental change cannot be accomplished simply by marshaling opposition parties," and had been considering the formation of a new force linked to a conservative segment. They are Etsuya Washio, Tekko Roren chairman; Teruhito Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman; and, Kyuji Sonoki, Zendentsu chairman. On the evening of 14 September 1992, along with Jinnosuke Ashida, chairman of the Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment, Chemical, Mercantile, and Allied Industry Workers' Unions [Zensen Domei], they met with Ichiro Ozawa, who was then the representative chairman of the LDP Takeshita faction, at the All Nippon Airways hotel in Akasaka. Leaders' Meeting Was Turning Point When Ozawa explained that "LDP members will probably come to agreement on a simple small constituency system," the labor union officials objected, saying "no opposition party will accept that proposal." Both sides were thinking about "spreading the wings" (Washio) of the tie-up, but at this time agreement was within grasp but failed. What triggered a change in the labor circle's attitude was the meeting between Rengo chairman Yamagishi and Ozawa, which took place on 20 February of the following year, following the split of the LDP's Takeshita faction in the fall of 1992. Ozawa asserted that carrying out the electoral system reform was the shortcut to political reorganization. Ozawa: "The LDP has presented a plan. I'd like to see the opposition parties submit a plan, too." Yamagishi: "All right. We'll try to do that." Ozawa: "Depending on circumstances, I might leave the LDP." On 22 March, Yamagishi also met with Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general. In response to Ichikawa's statement, "if the SDPJ splits and the reformist faction leaves, I want Rengo's support," Yamagishi replied, "of course." Three days later, Yamagishi met with Morihiro Hosokawa, representative of the Japan New Party [JNP], and said, "I plan to take care of the JNP from now on." Support for New Parties in General Elections The labor circle, which firmly believed that "the political situation was certain to become fluid" (Sonoki), tried to get the SDPJ to move with the tide. The vehicle was the "SDPJ Reform Diet Members' Union (Giren)," led by Makoto Tanabe, former SDPJ chairman. In the evening of 18 February, immediately prior to the Yamagishi-Ozawa meeting, at a gathering which included both Yamagishi and Washio, as well as Jichiro chairman Morishige Goto, Tanabe had shown a prospectus for formation of the Giren in order to "create a force to establish a new political power base" and had requested the cooperation of Yamagishi and others. Installed in April, the reformist Giren group worked on the party's executive committee to take bold steps toward election system reform. Jichiro, Nikkyoso, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko Roren, and Denki Rengo collected approximately 20 million yen for Giren. Tanabe's group had planned to make Giren the core in forming a new mainstream faction, but the goal of the labor circle lay further ahead. The aim was to use Giren as one of the filters in the "selection process" for election support and to nurture it as a "preparatory force to split the SDPJ." "I want the selection process to be dropped." So objected Sadao Yamahana, then SDPJ chairman. But Tanabe began to concede gradually, "it cannot be helped." While conducting the "selection process," the labor circle strengthened its tie-up with the new conservative parties. On 17 June, the day before dissolution of the lower house, in a meeting with Ashida, Hosokawa showed a chart of electoral districts and rebuked him for Zensen Domei's election cooperation. For some reason, Hosokawa expressed displeasure over support for Zensen-recommended DSP candidates in a number of electoral districts, though JNP had no candidate. Ashida learned at this time that Masayoshi Takemura and others were leaving the LDP on the following day. On 25 June, just before the official announcement of general elections, leaders of eight industrial labor unions, namely, Jichiro, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko Roren, Denki Rengo, Jidosha Soren, Federation of Electrical Workers' Unions of Japan [Denryoku Soren], and Zensen Domei, met in a Tokyo hotel and agreed to widen election support to JNP and Sakigake, and even Shinseito, bypassing the old lineup of "former Sohyo-SDPJ" and "former Domei-DSP." With the subsequent participation of the Japanese Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Workers' Unions [Zosen Juki Roren], the "Nine Union United Front" performed the function of "confidentially manipulating" labor union votes to support the election of non-LDP candidates, including those of the new conservative parties. Mixture of Success and Miscalculation The birth of a "non-LDP coalition government" and SDPJ's dismal loss of half of the Diet seats... the general elections brought a mixture of success and miscalculation to the labor unions. With the "Nine Union United Front" as the base, Rengo will enter into discussions on forming a new political force that it recommends in the second-phase political realignment. Will it be a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" alliance that is recommended by former Sohyo-affiliates, including Jichiro, or will a coalition framework, including the Shinseito and Komeito, be given priority? Rengo, which succeeded for the moment in concerted actions with conservatives, must face new problems again. [18 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Tide Changes Abruptly Under Central Leadership--Confusion and Opposition Among Local Organizations A gay mood surrounded the 40th anniversary celebration of Jichiro's founding, held on the evening of 22 February at a Tokyo hotel, to which Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council, and Yuriko Koike, JNP Diet member, were invited. However, four Jichiro "organizational Diet members," including upper house members Tetsuo Yamaguchi and Sango Sato, were missing. Aftereffects of "Rebellion" Continue Yamaguchi and his cohorts voted against the political reform bill in the upper house plenary session on 21 January, and, four days later, the Jichiro headquarters decided to "freeze relations" with the four Diet members. Soon thereafter, Yamaguchi and his cohorts were notified by the Jichiro secretariat that "invitations to the ceremony will be canceled." From the start, the atmosphere was acrimonious at the meeting of representatives of Jichiro's SDPJ Members' Council held in the Makuhari International Conference Hall in Chiba City on the evening of the 20th, two days before the ceremony. When upper house member Yubun Ueno, who succeeded as "Jichiro's Diet Members' Council chairman" after Yamaguchi's withdrawal following the "rebellious" act, remarked that "to begin with, Yamaguchi had not been the proper persom to become the council chairman," Ichiu Kimishima, secretary general of the Nagano prefectural headquarters, retorted, "the same applies to you--Jichiro, too, had opposed the small constituency system at last summer's general meeting." Subsequently, about 10 regional representatives objected to the headquarters' decision, saying "there are relations between local regions and Diet members, too, so it was not proper for the headquarters to decide on the punishment without consulting us." "Coalition Overvalued" The actions of labor circle leaders, who are steering boldly in the rapid current of political reorganization, are being watched with skeptical eyes by local labor union bosses. These "party activists" of labor unions are the ones who supported the SDPJ in elections and Jichiro was truly the nucleus. In late December, after the SDPJ agreed to partial liberalization of the rice market, Kimishima, secretary general of Nagano prefectural headquarters, protested to other labor union leaders and to the three executives of the party's prefectural headquarters, that "We shouldn't be forced to go along with the party's central headquarters beyond this point. Many union members have the same complaint." "Opposition to rice liberalization had been the constant pillar of our movement. If a unified candidate is to be put up by the ruling coalition party in the future, the banners of `constitutional safeguard and peace' might be lowered. If that is so, what is the labor union movement for?" At the Zentei central committee meeting on 7 February, when chairman Mototaka Ito cautioned that, "political developments will unfold under central headquarters' leadership--local regions should refrain from acting independently," Isamu Hayashi, secretary general of Kyoto District headquarters, objected. "The coalition regime is being evaluated somewhat too highly. To begin with, what kind of a political party is the Shinseito or Sakigake? It is not convincing simply to say that the decision was made by Rengo." Kyoto does not have a SDPJ representative in the Diet. Hayashi, too, thinks that labor unions cannot continue to function forever in "support of SDPJ." He says, "Therefore, Zentei should concentrate on its basic union activities and stop proposing political party support." Uncertainty About Election Support Former Sohyo-affiliated labor unions in Kagawa Prefecture are now conducting a signature-collection campaign to oppose hikes in the consumption tax rate. Unions are troubled about how the significance of SDPJ's entry into the government should be interprreted but they are certain the movement to "oppose the national welfare tax" has the unanimous agreement of members. In lower house elections, which will change to the small constituency system, these labor unions are concerned that they might be asked by the central headquarters to support Shigeaki Tsukihara, Shinseito Diet member (Kagawa 2d District). Tsukihara is a former Defense Agency bureaucrat and was a "defense zoku" Diet member during his LDP days. Masahiro Miyake, Jichiro's prefectural headquarters chairman, states, "we can never support him." On 19 March, Yamagata Prefecture's labor unions, such as Zentei and Jichiro, will hold a lecture meeting in Yonezawa City on the subject of "constitutional safeguard and peace," with House Speaker Takako Doi as the lecturer. Soon after the coalition government was formed, planning was started, fearing "can peace be preserved by a regime led by Ichiro Ozawa's Shinseito?" Feeling uncertain about "future actions" of the central union headquarters and the SDPJ, an action committee was formed, including conservative elements and youth groups, and the support of municipal education committees was also secured. With the realization of the electoral system reform, Jichiro and Nikkyoso must conclude their reassessment of the policy to "support only the SDPJ" at this summer's general meetings to prepare for election campaign support. The move toward formation and support of a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" bloc by the former Sohyo-affiliated labor unions is their last resort for realignment out of consideration for resistance by these local organizations to Shinseito, et al. [19 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Channel to Government Secured--Will It Lead to Better Livelihood? "We will not stage a demonstration today. That is unfashionable." Rengo's "Spring Offensive General Rally" was held at noon on the 12th in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park. Most of chairman Akira Yamagishi's address was devoted to "politics," such as attacks on the LDP, which was boycotting deliberations on tax reductions and the budget bill. "Is it impossible now to persuade the SDPJ?" In late February, when the government was wavering about the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokaea telephoned Yamagishi to sound out his feelings. Before the seven-nation ministerial meeting on employment (employment summit), which was held early this week, Jinnosuke Ashida, representing the Rengo chairman, phoned Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and advised him that "it would be unwise to send only the labor minister from the cabinet." Spring Offensive Follows Usual Pattern Rengo, which served as one of the driving forces in the birth of the coalition regime, secured a channel to the government that would have been unimaginable during the LDP rule. Even the industrial unions are enthusiastic: "The struggle now takes place before government policies are announced" (Hideyuki Suzuki, chief of Jichiro's political policy bureau). However, within Rengo ranks, dissatisfaction is constantly smoldering that "the emphasis is on politics, not economics." With labor unions on the government's side, can wages be increased satisfactorily and will employment become secure? Unless the political realignment leads to better livelihood, it might be likened to playing with fire. In the spring offensive, the Rengo executive committee proposed "restructuring of the spring offensive," such as "changing the batting order" and dispersing the peak struggles, centered on the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Workers' Unions of Japan [Shitetsu] and Zendentsu, which have been relatively unaffected by the economy. However, the usual pattern had to be followd eventually because the industrial unions would not consent. As the wage structure becomes fluid with widening differences in business performances of industrial groups, as exemplified by the increase in ratio of tertiary industries, and the introduction of the annual salary system, how effective is the "showdown tactic" aimed at fulfilling demands by opposing management with a united labor front? "The present spring offensive pattern was adopted in 1956. This is another version of the `1955 setup.' Spring offensive restructuring cannot be carried out unless there is an agreement of views with management." This remark was made by none other than Yamagishi while facing the spring offensive peak struggle. Now that the schema of LDP government and management versus SDPJ and labor unions has been overturned, new relationships with management must be found. Policies Still in "Request Mode" From the management side, even statements such as, "except for the single item of wage increases, we have no confrontational issues with Rengo" (Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations] can be heard. Conversely, the National Confederation of Trade Unions [Zenroren], which strongly supports the Japan Communist Party, criticizes that, "by establishing wage demand bases below last year's, Rengo showed that it was for labor-management unity." In 1975, Yamagishi headed the "strike for striking rights" as acting secretary general of the Council of Public Corporations and Government Enterprises Workers' Unions [Kororen]. Only Yamagishi, with the demeanor of a "fighter," could've taken the strongly leftist industrial unions in tow and guided labor-political relations thus far. However, the poor showing in the spring offensive cannot be explained away simply by saying that Rengo is now on the government's side. What are the labor unions, which are now on the government's side, going to do hereafter? Recently, there have been heated discussions in Rengo ranks that "Rengo policies are still in the `request mode'--that must be changed to the `proposal mode.'" However, there are hardly any discussions on how to coordiate labor union demands and government policies. For example, Zendentsu, which is Yamagishi's base, joined in the past with management and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to oppose the privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT] and is now opposing its partitioning. This position is an extension of the old setup with the addition of "labor" to the "postal family," i.e., "government, bureaucracy, and business," and runs counter to the aim of "deregulation" announced by the Hosokawa regime. Perceptions Differ on Political Participation Will it be the formation of a SDPJ-DSP liberal bloc or will emphasis be placed on the framework of a ruling coalition? Even before deciding on the course to take in the political realignment, there is the problem of bridging the wide gap in perceptions between the aggressive view of "Rengo will strongly support the new party" (Morishige Goto, Jichiro chairman) and conversely, "labor unions should abandon the posture of selecting a party and fully supporting it with money and personnel" (Teruhito Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman). It seems that the labor circle will require more time to locate a new coordinate axis for politics which is undergoing a great transformation.
