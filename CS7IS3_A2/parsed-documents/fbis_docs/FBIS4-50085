This large delegation of nearly 100 people included Taiwan officials and entrepreneurs. Having heard the hosts' introduction to the investment situation there, a Taiwan entrepreneur of the delegation thought that the preferential treatment offered was poor, and indicated that he "would not invest in a factory in Subic Bay." Subic Bay is an excellent natural port of the Philippines. It is surrounded on three sides by mountains, the water is deep, and the port is spacious. In 1941 the United States and the Philippines signed an agreement to lease Subic Bay, which the United States turned into its largest naval base in Asia. At the end of November 1992 the lease ran out, and American troops withdrew from Subic Bay. For the Taiwan authorities to invest in Subic Bay and develop an industrial zone in cooperation with the local people is an important component of Taiwan's implementation of its southbound economic and trade policies. The Major Contents of the "Southbound Policy" The southbound economic and trade investment and cooperation plan drawn up by the Taiwan "Ministry of Economy" requires that "state- operated" enterprises belonging to the "Ministry of Economy" and the Kuomintang party-run enterprises take the lead and, at the same time, bring along nongovernmental enterprises to participate in the southbound investment plan. The region covered by this investment plan is Southeast Asia. The plan includes four aspects: Investigate and study the economic and trade movements of Southeast Asia and come up with corresponding measures, expand bilateral trade between Taiwan and Southeast Asia, strengthen bilateral investment and technical cooperation, and effectively promote substantive bilateral economic and trade relationships. This so-called economic and trade plan actually contains political motives. An official of the Taiwan "Ministry of Economy" pointed out frankly: "Choosing Southeast Asia as an economic and trade emphasis of our southbound policy is because we want to use economic and trade exchange to expand room for diplomacy." The Background and Reasons Behind the "Southbound Policy" Beginning in the early seventies, Taiwan developed economic and trade relations with Southeast Asian countries, and by the mid- eighties bilateral economic and trade relations had become heated, reaching a peak at the end of the eighties. In the nineties, these relations began to decline. Statistical data indicates that by 1993, Taiwan's investment volume in Southeast Asia had already exceeded $16 billion. During the late eighties, when Taiwan capital flowed into Southeast Asia the most, the Taiwan authorities had not raised a "Southbound policy", they were, on the contrary, worried about the "gutting of Taiwan industry." In that case, why do they push hard for a "Southbound policy" today? This is closely related to the problems faced by Taiwan economic development, the rapid economic development trend of the Asia-Pacific region, including Southeast Asia, and the economic trade development trends between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Since the eighties, the economy of the Asia-Pacific region has developed rapidly, leading the regional economic development of the world. Taiwan, belonging to the Asia-Pacific region, beginning in the mid-eighties has suffered from a drastic deterioration in its internal investment environment, rising labor costs, land price-hikes, a rise in the environmental protection movement -- facing medium and small enterprises with huge pressures for survival. It is from such a background that a large batch of medium and small enterprises have moved to regions where land and labor are relatively cheap. The Taiwan authorities have thought that, with its economic power and geographical factor, Taiwan can play an important role in the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, becoming an operating center in the Asia-Pacific region. According to this concept, the Taiwan of the future not only wants to become the transportation center of the Asia-Pacific region, but also wants to become the center of information, business, and personnel training. Large corporate groups and multinational corporations would all set up their headquarters in Taiwan, while other Asia-Pacific countries would only have their branch and representative offices. The manufacturing center of various high-tech products would be in Taiwan, with product assembling distributed in the Asia-Pacific region, forming an industrial structure with a vertical division of labor. In this ambitious grand plan, the southbound economic and trade policy has been a component, and the promotion of a southbound policy has been to create the conditions for the realization of Taiwan becoming the operating center of the Asia-Pacific region. Early in the 1990's, with the gradual reduction of tensions in the relationship between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, economic and trade relations have developed rapidly. In 1993, indirect trade volume between both sides exceeded $10 billion, and the negotiated capital of Taiwan investment in the mainland during recent years has exceeded $10 billion. This complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation between the two sides has promoted economic prosperity for both parties. However, out of political considerations, and not from the economic interests of both sides, the Taiwan authorities think of all kinds of ways to continuously lower the temperature of the island's "mainland investment fever" and advocate the "scattering of Taiwan businessmen's investment in the mainland" and the "weaning of ourselves from dependence on the mainland market." The other purpose of its "southbound policy" has been to persuade Taiwan businesses into increasing their investment in Southeast Asia, hence "counterbalancing" their investment in the mainland. The Political Motivation of the "Southbound Policy" In order to promote the "southbound policy," some decisionmakers of the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort to visit countries in Southeast Asia to conduct so-called "vacation diplomacy." Various signs indicate that the "southbound policy" is an important measure in the Taiwan authorities' promotion of "pragmatic diplomacy"; it is an attempt to obtain the status of a political entity in Southeast Asia. In order to "expand room for survival in the world," as it is called, the Taiwan authorities again and again have disregarded the principle of "one China," and have used all kinds of means -- from the "silver-bullet diplomacy" and "money diplomacy" of the early eighties, to the "dual recognition" of the early nineties, to the promotion of "substantive relationships" with certain "influential countries," all the way to the unbridled activities last year of trying to "return to the United Nations." However, the "result" they have obtained has not been ideal. The Taiwan authorities, especially after encountering defeat in last year's attempt to "return to the United Nations," have decided to make 1994 "the year of seeking a new orientation in diplomacy." As such, the Taiwan authorities have turned their foreign relations emphasis to the neighboring areas of Southeast Asia, attempting to become a dialogue partner of ASEAN, and to obtain the status of a political entity, and then to further squeeze into regional international organizations. At the same time, they have also modified their methods and come up with disguises such as "vacation diplomacy" and "informal visits" in order to cover up the substance of striving for "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan." Taiwan has no "diplomatically related country" in Asia, and all countries only recognize the government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing China, with Taiwan as a part of China. This situation is not something that the Taiwan authorities can change with its "economic and trade advantages" or by using "vacation diplomacy." The "Southbound Policy" Arouses Wide Discussion After the "southbound policy" was raised, it attracted discussion from the political circles, media, academia, and business circles of the mainland. They expressed opinions on the economic significance and political intention of the policy, the practicality of its implementation, the relationship of the "southbound policy" with mainland policies, and various other aspects. A Taiwan economist has analyzed the important significance of the "southbound policy" for Taiwan's economic development. He believes three major economic forces may appear in the Asia-Pacific region in the future: Japan, mainland China, and ASEAN. Being sandwiched between the three powers, Taiwan must maneuver among these economic forces to maintain its economic development. Establishing an industrial division of labor with Southeast Asia countries is the most advantageous to Taiwan. An influential Taiwan newspaper expressed, in an editorial, doubts that the "southbound policy" would realize a "diplomatic opening up." That editorial stated that if the basic diplomatic policies of the Southeast Asian countries did not change, then no matter how hard Taiwan pushed its "southbound" policy, it would be difficult to turn economic and trade forces into diplomatic forces. The editorial said that "it will be difficult" for Taiwan "to turn its economic and trade relations with ASEAN countries into diplomatic pressure against Communist China." A Taiwan newspaper reporter expressed the following thoughts after visiting Subic Bay in the Philippines: The "southbound policy" is an up-current movement in the general movement of the Asian market. That reporter likened the mainland to a "super magnetic field," while Southeast Asia was a "small magnetic field." He believed that the Taiwan authorities were now "using the state- operated and party-operated businesses as a main electric current to divert Taiwan businessmen from the large magnetic field to the small magnetic field." He wondered: "Is the power of this electric current really that strong?" A Taiwan businessman who has invested in both the mainland and the Philippines said that, within a short period of time, it will not be easy to see the investment results of Taiwan businessmen answering the "southbound" call because the cost of investment opportunities is still the most important consideration of Taiwan businessmen. In addition, language problems are also an obstacle to Taiwan businessmen investing in the south. Another large Taiwan newspaper expressed doubts that the "southbound policy" could turn Taiwan into the operating center of the Asia-Pacific. This newspaper said in an editorial that if enterprises took Southeast Asian countries as their targets for market development, then from the perspectives of geographical location, humanities, and social conditions, the best central depots were Singapore and Hong Kong, not Taiwan. In discussing the relationship between the "southbound policy" and the mainland policies, this editorial made this analysis: The key to implementing the "southbound policy" is a more open mainland policy. If the transport and business channels between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can be opened up, then the key position and central depot function of Taiwan in Southeast Asia region will have a better chance of showing itself. In sum, the Taiwan authorities' promotion of the "southbound policy" is, on the one hand, to seek a road for the island's economic development in an attempt to use Taiwan's economic power to obtain the crucial position of being a business center in the flourishing economic development of the Asia-Pacific region and, on the other hand, to divert Taiwan businessmen's investment from the mainland towards the Southeast Asia region in order to be rid of a "dependency on the mainland market." The political intention of this policy is to open up and build up "substantive relations" with the so-called "economic and trade advantages" -- first to obtain the status of a political entity in the Southeast Asia region, and then gradually to squeeze into regional international organizations in order to realize the goal of "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." As some foreign media have pointed out, some important policy measures of the Taiwan authorities have been far from the objective reality. These are often "self-inflated propaganda or wishful suggestions." It seems that the "southbound policy" is no exception.
