FR940318-2-00240 FR940318-2-00119 By orders dated June 12, 1986 and July 16, 1986, HCAR No. 24128 and 24150 (``Original Orders''), respectively, CNG and all except five of the subsidiaries were authorized to establish the Consolidated System Money Pool (``Money Pool''). By order dated May 27, 1987 (HCAR No. 24399), Pipeline and Service were authorized to become participants in the Money Pool. By order dated February 14, 1990 (HCAR No. 25040), VNG was authorized to become a participant in the Money Pool. By order dated May 13, 1991 (HCAR No. 25311), Storage was authorized to become a participant in the Money Pool. Iroquois now requests authorization through June 30, 1996 to participate in the Money Pool on the same terms and under the same conditions as previously authorized by the Commission in the Original Orders. Funds taken from and provided to the Money Pool would be made in the form of open account advances. Open account advances would be repayable not more than one year from the date of the first advance. If no such borrowings are outstanding on the date of any advance, then the interest rate would be the Federal Funds' effective rate of interest as quoted daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By order dated July 6, 1993 (HCAR No. 25845), the Commission authorized Transmission to provide Iroquois with up to $20 million in funds (``Transmission Advances'') through either purchases of common stock or through short-term loans. The aggregate outstanding amount of funds obtained by Iroquois from the Money Pool, together with Transmission Advances, would not at any time exceed $20 million. Additionally, CNG and the Subsidiaries request authority to change the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by participants in the Money Pool. The current rate charged to borrowers from the Money Pool equals the effective short-term borrowing costs of CNG, as stated in the Original Orders. CNG and the Subsidiaries request authority to change this rate to a rate equal to the effective weighted average rate of interest on CNG's commercial paper and/or revolving credit borrowings. Gulf Power Company, et al. (70&hyph;7294) Gulf Power Company (``Gulf''), 500 Bayfront Parkway, Pensacola, Florida 32501 and Mississippi Power Company (``Mississippi'') (together, ``Applicants''), 2993 West Beach, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501, electric utility subsidiary companies of The Southern Company, a registered holding company, have filed a post-effective amendment under section 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c) and 12(d) and Rules 42, 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder to their declaration previously filed under sections 6(a), 7 and 12(b) and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder. Mississippi and Gulf are joint owners, as tenants in common, of Plant Daniel, an electric generating facility in Jackson, Mississippi. By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24261), the Commission authorized Mississippi, acting as agent for Gulf, to enter into various transactions with Fuelco, a special purpose subsidiary of the Corporation Trinity Company, a nonassociated company, to finance Termination and Closure Payments relating to the termination of existing coal supply contracts and its entrance into new lower cost arrangements for the supply of coal to Plant Daniel. In this regard, Fuelco issued notes (``Notes'') in the aggregate principal amount of $121.325 million to private investors, which mature on December 31, 1995 and bear interest at an 8.25% annual rate, payable semi-annually. Mississippi borrowed the proceeds from the sale of the notes and issued a secured note (``Secured Note'') to Fuelco in the same principal amount and containing the same terms and conditions. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes is approximately $35 million. The Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time on or after January 1, 1994 at 101.03% of the principal amount thereof during 1994 and 100.00% of such principal amount during 1995, together in each case with accrued interest to the prepayment date. The Applicants now propose to refinance the Notes and the Secured Note by: (1) Having Fuelco, or another similar special purpose corporation, issue and sell, on or before December 31, 1994, up to $36 million aggregate principal amount of new notes (``Refunding Notes'') maturing on December 31, 1995; and (2) Mississippi issuing a new Secured Note in the same principal amount as the Refunding Notes and containing the same terms and conditions. The proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Notes would be applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Notes. While the interest rate to be borne by the Refunding Notes has not been determined at this time, it is anticipated based upon current market conditions and rate levels that such rate would not exceed 51/2% per annum. The Refunding Notes would not be prepayable prior to maturity. As an alternative for refinancing the Notes, it is proposed that Mississippi may effect borrowings of up to $36 million from a bank or banks or other institutional lender or lenders. Such borrowings may be evidenced by Mississippi's promissory note or notes, may be secured by a subordinated lien on certain properties of Mississippi, would have a final maturity of December 31, 1995, and would not be prepayable. As in the case of the Refunding Notes, it is currently anticipated that the interest rate of such borrowings would not exceed 51/2% per annum. The proceeds from such borrowings would be loaned to Fuelco and applied to the prepayment of the outstanding Notes. The obligation of Fuelco to repay such loan may be evidenced by a note issued to Mississippi the payments on which would correspond to the payments due on Mississippi's note or notes described above and would be included in the minimum payments owing under the existing coal supply agreement between Fuelco and Mississippi.
