The masses effectively support the Armed Forces in that brave governorate which Sanaa claims to control. It is completely ridiculous for the al-Ahmar gang in Sanaa to claim that it shot down one of our fighter planes in Shabwah, just as it claimed yesterday that it downed a plane in Abyan. Perhaps tomorrow, it will claim it has shot down another plane in Hadramawt or al-Mahrah. This is in keeping with its particular misleading style of lies and deception. Our brave Armed Forces, which are engaged in ferocious defensive battles for the 27th successive day against the al-Ahmar forces which planned to seize the southern and eastern governorates within a few hours or in a day or two at the most, are still quite capable today. The defense forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, with their unbending strength, have the capacity to cleanse our pure territory from the filth of the al-Ahmar family and their clique and to teach this gang of warfare, terrorism, and criminality a deserving lesson. Many a small group has overwhelmed a bigger one [Koran], with God's will.
