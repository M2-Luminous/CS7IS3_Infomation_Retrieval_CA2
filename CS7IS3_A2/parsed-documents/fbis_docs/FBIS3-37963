Talking to journalists, you said you were receiving much response to the treaty. What are people writing and saying to you? [Shaymiyev] An absolute majority of the population expresses gratitude for signing the treaty. People regard it as a guarantee of peace and stability; mind you, we never had any destabilization between people in the past, but the treaty gives them more confidence. I would like to mention in particular the fact that we are receiving a lot of letters and telephone calls from the Tatar diaspora who are living in CIS countries as well as Russia. They are saying that we have taken a great burden of uncertainty off their shoulders. Certainly, the fact that the treaty clarified and dotted all the "i"s in our relations with the Russian Federation gives us confidence in our future. [Latypov] One knows about the attitude by some members of the State Duma to the Russian-Tatarstan treaty. In particular, [Sergey] Baburin [leader of the Russian Path parliamentary group] said on television that the treaty was unacceptable. He wanted to stress once again that Russia had nothing to agree on with Tatarstan. On the other side, the opinions of radical nationalists in Kazan are just as acrimonious. It seems to me they have something in common, don't you think? [Shaymiyev] I don't think it is anything -- in this particular case they agree utterly and completely. This is a demonstration of chauvinism, Russian on the one side and Tatar on the other. This is unacceptable. These are extremes. [Latypov] You said Tatarstan will not stop at this treaty. What will happen next? [Shaymiyev] We are resolutely in favor of decentralization of Russian economy. Without resolving this problem, we will not be able to succeed in achieving further progress in the economic reforms. More opportunities should be provided so that the reforms could be implemented on the ground. The fact that the treaty was signed means we are approaching a democratic federal structure in the Russian Federation. One should pay tribute to the understanding demonstrated by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. Both he and we have undertaken great responsibility as a result of signing the treaty.
