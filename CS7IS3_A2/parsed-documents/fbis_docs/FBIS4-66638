Chavan, on Wednesday accused the United States of meddling in Kashmir and went to the extent of questioning the locus standi of President Bill Clinton and his administration challenging the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. In a hard-hitting reply in the Lok Sabha to the debate on the resolution extending the President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir by another six months from Thursday, he said the United States had a vested interest in the matter. The House later unanimously adopted the resolution, which has already been approved by the Rajya Sabha. In the first-ever strong criticism of the current US position on Kashmir by a senior government representative, Mr. Chavan said the United States was "neither interested in helping Pakistan or India, but helping themselves." "We have to be on guard," said Mr. Chavan, wondering "what really are their (US) intentions." The Home Minister said the United States had raked up the issue of human rights in Kashmir as a sort of balancing act. He said Washington was thinking in terms of declaring Pakistan as a State sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir. But just to maintain a balance between that country and India, it played up the issue of human rights in Kashmir. Mr. Chavan said both United States and Pakistan had no "right or credibility" to talk of human rights and went on to recall how human rights were crushed by the former when its supreme national interests were involved. As for Pakistan, it was "ridiculous" for it to talk of human rights, he said amid cheers and mentioned how human rights were trampled upon in the provinces of Baluchistan, Sind and elsewhere in that country. Mr. Chavan said he could not believe that Mr. Clinton had not been properly briefed on Kashmir. Again, he said, the statements of administration official Robin Raphel questioning the Kashmir accession to India were rather consistent. On the other hand, three republican Senators and former US Ambassador to New Delhi Patrick Moynihan, who had met him recently, had categorically stated that what Ms. Raphel was saying was not the right line. He even quoted the US Charge D'affairs in New Delhi as having taken this position in one of these meetings. Mr. Chavan claimed that the United Kingdom also did not agree with the US line and based his claim on what was told to him by an unnamed UK Minister. The Home Minister said there was a qualitative improvement in Kashmir especially after the peaceful resolution of the Hazratbal standoff. Pakistan was no longer getting the sort of the peoples sympathy it used to earlier, he said. Mr. Chavan said it was a "delicate national issue," and appealed to all sections and political parties to exercise restraint in their utterances on the topic. Mr. Chavan said the government had an open mind in discussing Kashmir. "We have to take everybody along" in finding a solution. He said it was wrong to describe the perpetrators of violence in Kashmir as "militants." They are "terrorists, nothing less," he added. Mr. Chavan regretted the references during the debate to the so-called differences between Jawaharlah Nehru and Sardar Patel over the approach to Kashmir issue. They were tall and great leaders and worked together to create and build an independent India. There was absolutely nothing surprising if they had differences of perception, if at all, on certain issues, he said.
