However, in reality there is no free trade. This was stated by Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko at a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry briefing. He explained that there were 48 exceptions to the list of Russian goods imported by Ukraine. These goods, such as energy sources and timber, are vital to us. The deputy minister believes that setting up a CIS economic union, and Ukraine being an associate member of this union, should end those discriminatory restrictions.
