The conference will bring together representatives of the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations to work out a single plan for the settlement. It can be surmised that in addition to the two great powers, France, Germany and Britain, who are playing a prominent role in unblocking the situation, are likely to take part in the talks. The meeting will take place in Geneva "literally in the next few days", according to a ranking official of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Geneva ministerial forum, according to the official, can become a prologue to a summit, involving all interested countries, as proposed by Moscow. The idea of a multilateral conference is dictated by an understanding that the guarantees of any one party cannot lead to the settlement of the conflict but can only further exacerbate the problem. The Russian official stressed that the prompt setting in motion of a mechanism of multilateral negotiations is necessitated by the volatile situation in the area of Brcko. Bitter experience has made clear to every one where such situations might lead. To achieve a universal end to combat activities is now a high priority task, the official said.
