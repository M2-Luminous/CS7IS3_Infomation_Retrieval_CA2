It was also established that the study and learning of the Romanian language as the official language in the state shall be compulsory for all Romanian citizens, irrespective of nationality. After contradictory discussions, the deputies rejected the amendments promoted by Varujan Vosganian (Armenians' Union of Romania) and Benedek Nagy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) protesting the introduction of this article, which belongs to the general principles of expressing provisions on the education in the mother tongues of the nationalities and in the languages of international circulation [sentence as received]. The amendments were assessed as "overzealous," especially considering that by the same article the deputies voted in favor of guaranteeing the right of persons belonging to ethnic minorities to study and get instructed in their mother tongue, and the education bill gives special attention to this issue in other articles.
