Commenting on the outcome of the talks, South Korea's President Kim Yong-sam told journalists that the accords provided for "frontal cooperation between the two countries in all fields of science, culture, and technology." "We regard Uzbekistan as an important potential partner," he stressed. In his opinion the most prospective cooperation fields are electronics, communication, telecommunication, and gas extraction and refinement. "The two countries could prosper more by combining Uzbekistan's natural wealth with South Korea's technologies and finances," Kim Yong-sam said. Noting the proximity of views with Seoul on a number of international and regional problems, Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov spoke in favour of applying South Korea's experience in consolidating Uzbekistan as a state politically and otherwise. He described the Korean form of government as democracy rather than arbitrary rule and said that a factor such as strong executive power used by South Korea during its reform suited Uzbekistan as well. Asked by INTERFAX about Tashkent's attitude toward NATO's Partnership for Peace program, Karimov said: "Uzbekistan has nothing against the idea of Partnership for Peace. Uzbekistan will sign this document. But we want to do so above all for national interests rather than reasons of fashion. Haste in this matter would be dangerous and improper," he said. From Tashkent, Kim Yong-sam is going to Vladivostok tonight.
