The anniversary of our existence marked by indefatigable efforts for the homeland's sake is both an opportunity and an obligation to assess our work. The All-National Committee for the Defense of National Interests is celebrating its fourth anniversary. This is a very young age for the dimensions of history, but it is sufficient to give evidence of political wisdom, of a new self-confidence, and of meaningful efforts. Founded at a grandiose mass rally on 7 January 1990, which took place in front of the St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral [in the Sofia center], a rally which was prompted by the spontaneous wave of people's discontent in facing the emerging Turkish danger, the All-National Committee for the Defense of National Interests is the most extensive public organization in our country today. The committee, precisely, is the reliable and unshakable guard watching over our national sovereignty, confronted with the dark shadow of the Pan-Islamic doctrine, which permitted the emergence of ethnic unrest and provocations. The committee has become a shield protecting the revival of the Bulgarian spirit. We are now addressing you, our compatriots. We appeal to your faith and patriotism, in the hope that, all together, we shall jointly revive Bulgaria as a strong, prospering, and democratic country. The All-National Committee for the Defense of National Interests guarantees that not even an inch of the Bulgarian soil shall be taken away, that no Bulgarian shall be Turkicized or turned into a Macedonian [makedoniziran]. In professing the truth that every citizen is equal before the law, we are following the postulates of our apostle of freedom, Vasil Levski, in repeating his everlasting principle: Life in our Bulgarian homeland should not be similar to life in a Turkish village. We are convinced that all our compatriots, wherever they are throughout the world, are equal citizens of our homeland and children of mother Bulgaria. We shall always defend the rights of Bulgarians in Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Yugoslavia, Romania, Albania, Turkey, Greece, the Commonwealth of Independent States, in Europe, and all over the world. We resolutely condemn national nihilism and we shall severely hold responsible all traitors. We categorically declare that there is no place for the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] in a future parliament, nor is there place for any party whatsoever based on ethnic or religious principles. We are against the genocide through which some kind of religious pseudo-movement and single-racial formations are dividing the Bulgarian nation and are creating contemporary ghettos for their supporters. We declare ourselves in support of the civil disobedience and intellectual rebellion of the materially destitute and humiliated Bulgarian scientists, teachers, educators, physicians, engineers, economists, workers, peasants, and pensioners. We are in favor of a priority statute for our national capital. We are siding with the Bulgarian youths who are the victims of irresponsible experiments, dooming them to unemployment and hopelessness. We are rejecting the anti-Bulgarian approach to the young generation. Bulgaria belongs to you, young friends, do not leave it to others. It shall be the country which we all are going to create. We are also addressing our Bulgarian women with hopeful confidence. Mothers of the homeland, let us protect together the national ideals and interests, the lives, efforts, and future prosperity of your children. We are in favor of social protection and support the nation's biological survival. We are against the slandering and disgracing of those who created Bulgaria in ancient times and in our contemporary history. We are watching the developments in the Rhodope area with concern. Let us raise our voice of warning against all unpatriotic elements. Bulgarian Muslims are Bulgarians just like all of us, like all Eastern Orthodox, Catholics, Protestants, and atheists in Bulgaria. We shall never permit the poison of Macedonianism to corrupt the souls of Bulgarians in the Pirin area and in Vardar Macedonia. It is justified to fight the relapses into Macedonianism with fire and sword. No Macedonian nation or language whatsoever exist. Our brothers in the Vardar area must be granted the right of free, ethnic, self-identification. We appeal for the integration with the peoples belonging to Christian civilization, for integration with the ancient values of Europe, an insuperable part of which we have always been. Once more we would like to recall our feelings of sympathy and friendship with Russia. This glorious Slavonic country was a great positive factor for the birth of the Third Bulgarian State. Today, when Russia is going through difficulties and privations, despite all things, we are convinced that its historical existence shall always be a factor of peace and stability in the world, in Europe, and the Balkans. We respect and appreciate the remarkable democratic values created by the brilliant minds of numerous U.S. citizens. We shall always remember the words of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, the great founders of the United States, that freedom is the greatest benefit of mankind. We are proud that hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians have participated in the building of the economically most powerful state in the world, as its equal citizens, and that one of them even invented the computer. We would like to strengthen the traditional cooperation and the spirit of understanding with Germany. Our joint victories and defeats have taught us that nothing is more valuable than a hand of assistance offered in hard times. Dear compatriots, four years ago, the All-National Committee lit the spark of Bulgarian patriotism and nationalism. Today the spark is growing into a flame. Tomorrow it shall light the fire of purification and rebirth. The only principle worth announcing shall be: Bulgaria above everything.
