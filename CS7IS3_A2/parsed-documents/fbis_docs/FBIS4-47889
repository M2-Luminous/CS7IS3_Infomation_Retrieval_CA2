Speaking at Maputo Airport yesterday on his return from a two week trip to Europe and Kenya, he said the UN's complaints that Renamo is demobilizing its troops too slowly are meaningless. The head of the UN operation has threatened to take issue before the UN Security Council. Mr. Dhlakama also said the was skeptical about a recent UN announcement that various foreign countries have already pledged 13 million dollars to assist Renamo in its preparations for October's multiparty elections. He said the UN always talks of millions of dollars for Renamo, but they never see the money. He welcomed the ANC's victory in South Africa's elections despite a history of poor relations between the two organizations. He has been invited to the ceremony to inaugurate Mr. Nelson Mandela as president.
