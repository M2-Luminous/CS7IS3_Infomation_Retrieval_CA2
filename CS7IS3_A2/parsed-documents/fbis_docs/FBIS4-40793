However, some difficulties related to the citizenship of one of the cosmonauts arose during the preparations for the mission. Dalgat Musabayev, 43, is a lieutenant colonel of the Russian air Force, he is also a Russian citizen and has lived in Star City for quite some time. Meanwhile, representatives of Kazakhstan insist that Musabayev go to space as a Kazakh citizen. According to the Russian Space Agency spokesman the request of Kazakhstan will be granted. There are plans to launch a Russian-Kazakh crew from the Baykonur spaceport on July 1. Dalgat Musabayev will fly together with Major Yuriy Malashenko, 33. During the four months he will stay on the orbit, Musabayev will perform a number of experiments, including those under the national space programme of Kazakhstan. Asked about the payment for the stay aboard the Mir spacecraft, the RSA spokesman said that Kazakhstan will probably withhold this amount due from the lease payment Russia makes for the use of the Baykonur spaceport. The amount which Kazakhstan will pay for Musabayev's involvement in the mir mission has not been disclosed. A well- informed sources told RIA that the sum may be reduced, considering the fact that Kazakhstan and Russia have common interest in the outer space. As a rule, a one-week flight for a foreign cosmonaut on a Russian orbiter cost about 10 million dollars.
