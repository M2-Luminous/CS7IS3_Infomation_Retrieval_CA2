Mr Burney presented his resignation to the provincial chief secretary saying that he is resigning from the government job owing to some unavoidable circumstances, says a spokesman for the police. The heroin king Showrang, an Afghan national, was arrested on May 17 by the CIA but on May 24, he was released on bail by ADM [expansion unknown]/CIA. The sudden release of Showrang created an uproar in the recently set up Anti-Narcotics Task Force [ANTF] headed by some senior army officers. On a protest by ANTF, the Interior Ministry ordered an enquiry into the matter. Senior army officials accused the CIA chief of helping Showrang to go free without taking the military authorities into confidence. Refuting the claims of the army, the CIA officials claimed that the ANTF and the Narcotics Control Board and others interrogated Showrang, but they did not have any past record of the accused. CIA claimed that the accused is 70 years old with weak physique and is a heart patient. "During the course of interrogation he became senseless. As no further recoveries were expected from him, he was released on bail under section 497 of Cr PC," the agency said. CIA claimed that his wrist watch worth Rs [rupees] 400,000 is still lying with CIA Karachi as personal search and if CIA officials have any sympathy with the accused then this valuable wrist-watch would have been returned back to him." [no beginning quote as received] Police officials claimed that the Mr Burney has also requested the government for permission to approach higher courts to take action against the newspapers which have published incorrect news against him. Later, in the night, it was learnt that the SSP CIA withdrew his resignation on a request by a senior Sindh minister.
