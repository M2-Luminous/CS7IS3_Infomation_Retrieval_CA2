Its current down-slide is mainly due to a temporary adjustment process. Many partners have been forced to sell their right to [word indistinct]. This is due to measures instituted by Bank Negara, the Central Bank, to curb speculative inflow of funds. Most foreign currency payers had been buying huge amounts of Malaysian currency given its high interest rate and because they wanted to gain by investing from the booming stock exchange. The solid fundamentals and confidence in the Malaysian economy had never been stronger. It is therefore not surprising that the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange performed extremely well. It recorded a volume of 107.8 billion shares in volume valued at 387.3 billion ringgit in 1993. This was unprecedented and surpassed even the total volume and value of shares traded over the past 20 years. What happened was that funds flood in significantly, putting extreme pressure on the liquidity in the banking system and pressure on interest rate. Therefore, the Central Bank had to intervene to bring about stability in the financial system. Of course, mopping up the excess liquidity in the bank system was a costly affair for Bank Negara. However, had it not been done the price of inaction would have been even more damaging. It would have resulted in runaway inflation. Therefore, Bank Negara's recent spate of measures are to ensure that funds only flow in for genuine investment purposes. The move is also vital in ensuring the country's economic growth and stability. These measures are long-term and should not be construed as moves to further regulate the economy. But at the same time, it does not go against the principles of liberalization, which Malaysia opposes. But being a small economy, there has to be certain amount of protection of the local currency. It cannot be left entirely to global market forces. This is because there are companies large enough which can struggle against the ringgit and in the process disrupt the steady growth of the economy. After all, it is the rule of the Central Bank to maintain price stability by keeping a check on inflation. Economic growth is meaningless if accompanied by too high an inflational rate. Therefore, Bank Negara should be lauded for its cautious policy [word indistinct]. The result can be seen the government being able to record an overall balanced budget in 1993 [as heard]. The Central Bank has always proved a guiding hand in moving the economy towards a more sustainable growth fund. It is in this light that foreign institutions should see the role of Bank Negara and the measures it is taking. After all both Malaysians and non-Malaysians alike stand to gain from the continuous prosperity of the country. Its future depends on the ability to strike a fine balance between growth and stability. And Bank Negara has done a fine job in achieving both.
