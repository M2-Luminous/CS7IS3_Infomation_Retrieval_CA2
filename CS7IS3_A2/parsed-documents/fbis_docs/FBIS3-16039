He stated that the new government of the republic would begin to operate in its final form in a month's time -- in April. Yevgeniy Saburov said that the break with Russia was rather tragic for the economy of the Crimea since it was oriented toward selling goods and services to the Russian north in the first instance. Therefore, if one were to speak of restoring these contacts, what was at issue was not political rapprochement but the closest ties with the sales market. This is what the people of Crimea wanted, too, and one should be sympathetic toward the will of the people. He confirmed that Crimea and Ukraine would enjoy the closest ties. And it was likely that the best of what was accepted in the Crimea would be used in Ukraine, too. In reply to a question as to what would happen if politicians did not allow the reforms to be carried out, the deputy premier said that in that event, his stay in the Crimea would be pointless. At the press conference itself, Yevgeniy Saburov signed a statement to Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, asking Ukrainian citizenship to be conferred upon him in connection with his appointment to work in the Crimean government.
