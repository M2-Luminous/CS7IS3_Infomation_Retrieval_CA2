FR940620-1-00040 FR940620-1-00009 (2) The definition of ``restricted rights'' is revised. The existing rule's right to use software with the computer for which it was acquired is replaced by the right to use a program with one computer at one time. The Government's rights to transfer programs, modify restricted rights software, and permit others to use or modify software for the Government in specific situations, are clarified. j. Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation This proposed rule provides that the Government shall have only the rights specified in the license under which the commercial computer software or documentation is obtained. A contract clause is not prescribed. k. Use and Nondisclosure Agreements The standard nondisclosure agreement contained in the existing rule is amended. The proposed agreement covers third party use and disclosure of all data or software in which the Government's rights are restricted. The proposed regulations permit the use of class nondisclosure agreements. l. Contracts Under the Small Business Innovative Research Program Alternate 1 to the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 of the existing rule is replaced by a new clause, 252.227&hyph;7018, ``Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software_Small Business Innovative Research Programs.'' A single clause, rather than separate technical data and computer software clauses each with alternate provisions, reduces contractual burdens on these small businesses. Data generated under these contracts is required to be protected for five years instead of the four year statutory requirement. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq . This proposed rule modifies the circumstances under which the Government may release or disclose technical data or computer software to interested persons or permit those persons to use the technical data or computer software. An initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA), that updates the IRFA submitted for DAR Case 87&hyph;303 on March 29, 1988, has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DAR Case 91&hyph;312 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule implements information collection requirements under 10 U.S.C. 2321 and requires the submission of other information to comply with requirements in 10 U.S.C. 2320 that are within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . A request for clearance, superseding the analysis performed for DAR Case 87&hyph;303, will be submitted to OMB. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 211, 227, and 252 Government procurement. Claudia L.
