First, they should realize a change of their property rights system, enabling themselves adapted to new practices required by a commercialized bank system. Second, their industrial structure should be re-adjusted because commercial banks will examine the assets structure of a particular enterprise and confirm its payment ability when offering loans to it. Third, their debt structure should also be regulated and their money-raising should be conducted in multi-ways. They should not entirely rely on bank loans. Fourth, they should have flexible policies for their funding. Their equipment and other goods and materials unsuitable for their use should be sold out. Their technological achievements can also be transferred with pay to other entities. Fifth, their fund-accumulating mechanism must be re-adjusted. Enterprises in Japan are practicing a high depreciation rate system and they realize renewal of their property through depreciation to promote their development. China's enterprises should learn from them to raise depreciation rate through reducing their profits. Sixth, their organization structure should become more adaptable. Seventh, their accounting system should be reformed and their accounts should be made open. They should practice a shareholding system. Eighth, they must get more information and their sources of information should not only rely on government departments but should be gained through more channels. Ninth, their trust for funding should be raised. They must keep their promises in payment of debt. Tenth, their risk sense must be enhanced. They must pay much attention to risks from foreign debts, exchange rates and interests rates, besides that from their production.
