FR940705-2-00006 FR940705-2-00005 [A&hyph;122&hyph;506] Oil Country Tubular Goods From Canada, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review AGENCY: International Trade Administration/Import Administration/Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of final results of antidumping duty administrative review. SUMMARY: On April 20, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping duty order on oil country tubular goods from Canada (51 FR 21782; June 16, 1986). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, IPSCO Inc. (IPSCO), and the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. Since the Department received no comments, the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Genovese or Michael Heaney, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202)482&hyph;5254. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 25, 1993, IPSCO requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from Canada. The Department initiated the review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), covering the period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. On April 20, 1994, the Department published the preliminary results of review (59 FR 18798). The Department has now completed this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of the Review The products covered by this review include shipments of OCTG from Canada. This includes American Petroleum Institute (API) specification OCTG and all other pipe with the following characteristics except entries which the Department determined through its end use certification procedure were not used in OCTG applications: Length of at least 16 feet; outside diameter of standard sizes published in the API or proprietary specifications for OCTG with tolerances of plus 1/8 inch for diameters less than or equal to 85/8 inches and plus 1/4 inch for diameters greater than 85/8 inches, minimum wall thickness as identified for a given outer diameter as published in the API or proprietary specifications for OCTG; a minimum of 40,000 PSI yield strength and a minimum 60,000 PSI tensile strength; and if with seams, must be electric resistance welded. Furthermore, imports covered by this review include OCTG with non-standard size wall thickness greater than the minimum identified for a given outer diameter as published in the API or proprietary specifications for OCTG, with surface scabs or slivers, irregularly cut ends, ID or OD weld flash, or open seams; OCTG may be bent, flattened or oval, and may lack certification because the pipe has not been mechanically tested or has failed those tests. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 7304.20, 7305.20, and 7306.20. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. Final Results of Review We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. The Department received no comments. Accordingly, we have determined that a final margin of zero percent exists for IPSCO for the period June 1, 1992 through May 1, 1993. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of these final results of review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for IPSCO will be zero percent; (2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in a previous review or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the rate published in the most recent final results or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in these final results of review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, whichever is the most recent; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will be 16.65 percent, as explained below. On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in Floral Trade Council v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States , 822 F. Supp. 782 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. Accordingly, the cash deposit rate for any future entries from all other manufacturers or exporters, who are not covered in this or prior administrative reviews and who are unrelated to the reviewed firms or any previously reviewed firm, will be the ``all others'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation, which is 16.65 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a sanctionable violation. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: June 27, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16207 Filed 7&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
