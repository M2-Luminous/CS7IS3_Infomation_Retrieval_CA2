Today, we present the thinking of experts on the matter of the privatization funds. Ukraine is not the first country to take the path of privatization, in which privatization documents are used to pay for objects of privatization -- in our case, privatization property certificates. And even though in each of these countries, the processes of privatization have their own national specifics, one thing, certainly, is shared: the very broad participation of financial intermediaries in them -- investment funds, trust associations, and the like. Thus, two-thirds of the citizens of the Czech Republic and Slovakia have used the services of investment privatization funds in the distribution of their privatization funds, and investment funds in Russia have already collected more than half of all vouchers. Perhaps one of the main reasons why privatization, especially "voucher" privatization, is going so slowly in Ukraine, has been the absence of institutions capable of giving the population qualified help in the distribution of privatization funds. Today in Ukraine, only one percent of the population has used its right to obtain privatization documents and invest them in objects of privatization. The majority has invested in the enterprise in which they work. However, significant categories of citizens are deprived of this possibility. They are forced to seek, independently, objects for the investment of privatization funds, and to resolve on their own all questions connected with the exchange of property certificates for the stock of a given enterprise. Anyone who has made such attempts knows how complex this procedure is, considering the mechanism for the use of privatization funds that exists in Ukraine. Moreover, the problem of choosing an enterprise is complex enough in circumstances of an almost complete information vacuum. The awarding of licenses by the Fund for Ukrainian State Property for work with the privatization funds of the population to the trust associations (in Kiev, "Kinto-Trust" was the first to work with them) has, at last, made it possible for most of the population quickly and effectively to use the right of every citizen of Ukraine to privatization funds. What are the advantages given by the transfer of privatization property certificates to the management of a trust association? First, there is the possibility of using the services of genuine professionals in a field of financial activity, eliminating the necessity of independently, at one's own risk, seeking directions for the profitable use of privatization funds, and most of all, the possibility of influencing the activity of these joint stock companies. Recently, various conjectures concerning the intermediaries which provide services in the distribution of privatization funds are spreading more actively. Perhaps it is advantageous to certain circles that such institutions, capable of directing the privatization of property on a professional basis, not arise in Ukraine. It will be much easier if these stocks are scattered among thousands of stockholders, each of whom will be deprived of any influence on the activities of the joint stock companies, rather than to have to deal with an investment fund or trust association, which, because of the unification of the votes of individual investors, will be capable of protecting their interests. What sorts of accusations are being made against the trust associations? First, it is said that they do not indicate guaranteed dividends. This accusation can only be made by people who are not competent in this question, since in no civilized country does a joint stock company indicate the scale of dividends in advance. They are set according to the results of the work in the course of a given period at meetings of the joint stock company. The following reproach is also made concerning the trust associations: the trusts wish to use the funds for their own goals, without buying anything. But this anxiety lacks any basis at all. The privatization property certificates are not cash, or even Russian "vouchers;" they can only be used to pay for stock in enterprises that are being privatized. In this case, the interests of the trustee and the trust coincide, since until privatization funds are invested, they do not provide any profit. The circumstance that the trusts do not indicate definite terms for investing the trustees' funds in stocks also worries many. But the task of the trust is not to invest privatization certificates in the first enterprise that comes along, rather precisely to choose those that will provide profits; the trust bears the ultimate responsibility for this to the trustee. In this, a great deal depends not on the trust, but on government organs, and how fast the process of privatization is carried out. Now a great number of the most promising state enterprises are getting ready to become stock companies. The enterprises which have already offered their stock for privatization documents, are not among the most interesting ones from the point of view of the investor. And the final thing concerns the terms. Some of the "well intentioned" are advising that people not hurry to entrust their privatization funds to a trust. It is known that the term of action of the privatization funds in Ukraine will finish in 1995, and the majority might simply not be able to take advantage of them.
