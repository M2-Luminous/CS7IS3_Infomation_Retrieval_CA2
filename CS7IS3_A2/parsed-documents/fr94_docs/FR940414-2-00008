ACTION: Notice; incorporation of Newport Beach dory fleet into limited-entry fishery. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director) has incorporated the Newport Beach dory fleet into the limited-entry fishery of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery. This action is authorized under the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and is consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 to the FMP. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective from 0001 hours (local time) March 30, 1994, until modified, superseded, or rescinded. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to J. Gary Smith, Acting Director, Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, BIN-C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Anneka W. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140; or Rodney McInnis at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4040. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Amendment 6 to the FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6, also called the ``Limited-Entry Plan'', is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing fleet by: (1) Limiting the overall number of vessels, (2) Limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types, and (3) Limiting increases in vessel harvest capacity by limiting vessel length. Section 663.34(a)(3) of the implementing regulations provides that small limited-entry fisheries that are controlled by a local government, are in existence as of July 11, 1991, and have negligible impacts on the groundfish resource, may be certified as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6 and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery. If a fleet is certified and incorporated into the limited-entry fishery, vessels in the fleet at the time of incorporation will be issued limited-entry permits with ``A'' endorsements for the appropriate gear. A permit issued to a vessel in a certified fleet is only valid when the vessel is operating under and in conformance with the certified program. Such a permit and endorsement may be transferred to another vessel that will operate in the same certified fleet, provided the total number of vessels in the fleet does not increase. If more vessels are added to a fleet in a certified limited-entry program, these additional vessels will not receive ``A'' endorsements unless the program is recertified for the greater number of vessels, and the larger fleet incorporated into the limited-entry fishery. Upon application by a representative of a small limited-entry fleet, the Regional Director, after receiving a recommendation from the Council, may incorporate the fleet into the limited-entry fishery, if the Regional Director: (1) Determines that the fleet has a negligible impact on the groundfish resource, and (2) Certifies the activities of the fleet as consistent with the objectives of Amendment 6. On May 27, 1993, a representative of the Newport Beach dory fishing fleet of southern California requested that the Regional Director incorporate the small, local dory fleet of 15 vessels into the limited-entry fishery. The Newport Beach dory fishermen's fleet was founded in 1891 and is recognized as a historical landmark by the Newport Beach Historical Society. The City of Newport Beach, CA, has reserved an area west of the Newport Pier exclusively for the dory fleet operations. Dory fishermen provide fresh fish each day to a market run by the dory fleet. The City of Newport Beach adopted policy guidelines on November 23, 1987, that serve to limit the size of the fleet and the size of the vessels that belong to the fleet. The size of the fleet is limited by the city by restricting the number of storage sheds permitted on the beach to 19, and by limiting the number of vessels to one per shed. Currently 15 sheds are utilized by longline groundfish fishermen; 2 sheds by net, crab, and lobster fishermen; and 2 sheds are used as offices. Any new entrant to the fleet must buy out one of the current shed owners in order to join the fleet. Vessel size is limited to about 20 ft (6.1 m) in length or less by the requirement that the vessels be launched and landed from the beach. Based on its recognition by the Newport Beach Historical Society and the policy guidelines adopted November 23, 1987, by the City of Newport Beach, the Regional Director has determined that the Newport Beach dory fleet is ``controlled by a local government,'' and was ``in existence as of July 11, 1991.'' The Regional Director also concluded that the fleet has unique cultural and social importance and is dependent on the Pacific groundfish fishery.
