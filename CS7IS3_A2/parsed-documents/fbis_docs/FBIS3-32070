Afterward, he met with senators and deputies from the Plural Group [grupo plural) in his office to follow-up on events in Chiapas. The congressional Standing Committee created this group, and it comprises 10 legislators representing the six registered political parties. They talked about the need to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the Chiapas conflict above any partisan stand. Camacho said the conditions for dialogue exist, and he highlighted three points that will be discussed with the armed groups. These points are: 1. Economic demands relating to the material conditions of the Chiapas Indians. 2. Social demands relating to racism, neglect, poverty, disrespect, expulsions, and attacks on culture and traditions. 3. Political demands relating to the Chiapas Indians' lack of legal room for true participation. Camacho will make a public announcement tomorrow.
