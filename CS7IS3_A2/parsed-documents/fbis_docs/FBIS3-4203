This was made clear by an official at a conference dealing with the industry, which was just closed here in the capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. Zhang Heyong, deputy director of the State Pharmaceutical Administration, said that the government's grants for research in the development of medicines had greatly increased. More than 400 such projects applied for approval last year, exceeding the total in past years. China has started to adopt the modern enterprise system in this realm, to get away from the situation in which research institutions can only get funds through one channel -- government allocation. The Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in Shandong Province and China Pharmaceutical University recently set up a corporation and a center for developing medicines, marking big progress in the field. China now has 53 independent research and development institutions. But many problems still exist, such as overlapping functions and separation of research from production. The central government is set to speed up the industry's readjustment, with stress on the establishment of advanced pharmacy centers. It has made a success in Shanghai, which ranks pharmaceuticals among its pillar industries. The city now has four bio-engineering centers, with three others on the drawing board.
