FR941103-2-00113 FR941103-2-00066 Drug Enforcement Administration Owen M. Babbe, Jr., Revocation of Registration On March 3, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Owen M. Babbe, Jr., D.D.S. of Coeur D'Arlene, Idaho, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate of Registration AB7962891, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner. 21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The Basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Babbe lacked authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Idaho, 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and that his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, as the term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Babbe's registered location in Coeur D'Arlene, Idaho by registered mail on March 3, 1994, but was returned to DEA unclaimed. Based on information obtained from the Washington State Department of Licensing, on April 26, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent registered mail to the address provided on Dr. Babbe's driver's license. On May 2, 1994, a signed receipt was returned to DEA indicating a delivery date of April 28, 1994. Thereafter, on June 10, 1994, the Order to Show Cause, in its original envelope, was returned marked unclaimed. More than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was delivered at Dr. Babbe's last known address. The DEA has received no response from Dr. Babbe or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Babbe has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57. The Deputy Administrator finds that on October 10, 1991, the Idaho State Board of Pharmacy suspended Dr. Babbe's controlled substance registration. On June 24, 1992, the Idaho State Board of Dentistry (Dentistry Board) revoked Dr. Babbe's license to practice dentistry for a period of five (5) years. The Dentistry Board concluded that on four occasions Dr. Babbe's treatment acts and dental practices constituted gross malpractice and on four other occasions his actions constituted malpractice. The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is without State authority to handle controlled substances. Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., 59 FR 44780 (1994) and Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., 59 FR 42074 (1994); see also Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992) and Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11920 (1987). Dr. Babbe is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of Idaho wherein he is registered with the DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes that it is not necessary to address whether Dr. Babbe's continued registration is otherwise consistent with the public interest. Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Babbe's DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AB7962891, previously issued to Owen M. Babbe, Jr., D.D.S., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective on November 3, 1994. Dated: October 28, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator.
