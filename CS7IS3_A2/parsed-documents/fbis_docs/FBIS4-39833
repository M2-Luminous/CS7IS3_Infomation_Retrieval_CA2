Fourteenth Army Military Commandant Undertakes To Impose Order"] [Text] There is hardly a day without Tiraspol's being rocked by yet another scandal involving Colonel Mikhail Bergman, local commandant of the 14th Russian Army. The indefatigable colonel recently exposed the Dniester leaders, charging them with illegal possession of firearms allegedly stolen from 14th Army depots. On this basis, the military commandant urged the Russian Federation authorities to strip the Tiraspol leaders of their Russian citizenship which they are shamelessly abusing, he said. In the latest incident, all Tiraspol was shocked at the story involving the 14th Army commandant's office seizing the property of their fellow serviceman, General Kurchin, who decided to move together with his family to Russia and packed his bags into two rail containers. Bergman's subordinates moved in and seized the containers, carted them downtown, and dumped the contents on the ground for all to see, as if to say: There, dear people, look how the Dniester public property embezzlers make their fortunes. The mass media of the Dniester Moldovan Republic have been hyping information about a letter Bergman allegedly sent to Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev personally. In it, having roasted Gen. Lebed, the 14th Army military commandant paints the situation in the Dniester Moldovan Republic in exceedingly dramatic light and suggests that Mr. Grachev charge himself with imposing order, which he promises to do inside the briefest space of time. Mr. Bergman has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such a letter. Informed observers are inclined to link the colonel's extraordinary behavior with his special service record. Virtually all of his service has been in Tiraspol, where he knows everyone and everything. One can only envy his vast connections in the most different social sections, and few doubt that the colonel uses the 14th Army commandant's office alone for support. Whereas for Gen. Lebed the local skirmishes are no more than a stage in his biography, for Col. Bergman they seem to be his whole life. His current heightened activity in the field of combating Dniester corruption coincides in time exactly with Tiraspol's decision to institute criminal libel proceedings against him and its request to the Russian Federation Defense Ministry to transfer Mikhail Bergman to serve in some other region.
