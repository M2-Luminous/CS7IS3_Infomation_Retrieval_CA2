Mustafa Asula, Turkish ambassador in Pakistan, told AA reporter on the phone that they expect the diplomats to arrive in the afternoon. Two dozen foreigners, including four UN staff and diplomats from Pakistan, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Libya, drove out of the war-shattered city in the afternoon in two convoys headed for neighbouring Pakistan. It was not clear whether the convoys would cross into Pakistan through the Khyber pass or halt for the night in the eastern Afghan town of Jalalabad. But some Pakistani and Saudi diplomats, as well as several from Indonesia, North Korea and Iran and one Palestinian, stayed on. Sudanese diplomats left on Friday. [passage omitted] Turkey said on Friday it would evacuate its ambassador and three other staff from its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul, rocked by a week of factional fighting. A missile landed in the embassy garden last weekend.
