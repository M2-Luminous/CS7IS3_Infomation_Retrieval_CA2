Addressing the participants, the president condemned the indifferent attitude that international bodies have adopted against crimes in the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde and stressed that the world was not seeking to defend the truth. Those international organizations, he added, are seeking their own interests as they did in the course of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in which they intervened. He congratulated the army personnel on the occasion and expressed hope that while the army is preserving its combat power it will also take part in the reconstruction effort. Various units of the army later paraded before the president while the airborne parachute units performed operations and the aircraft flew in formation. The army combat and cargo planes as well as helicopters performed operations during the ceremonies. Also present at the ceremomies were Chief of Staff of Armed Forces Brigadier General Hasan Firuzabadi, Army Chief of Staff Major General 'Ali Shahbazi and a number of other senior army officials.
