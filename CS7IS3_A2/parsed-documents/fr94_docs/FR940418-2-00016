FR940418-2-00016 FR940418-2-00005 This program applies to foreign currency loans taken out by Italian companies. Under the program, repayment amounts are calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect at the time the loan is taken out. If the exchange rate changes over time, the program sets a ceiling and a floor to limit the effect of the exchange rate change on the borrower. For example, if the lire depreciates five percent against the DM (the currency in which the loan is taken out), borrowers would normally find that they would have to repay five percent more (in lire terms). However, under the Exchange Rate Guarantee Program, the ceiling would act to limit the increased repayment amount to two percent. There is also a floor in the program which would apply if the lire appreciated against the DM. The floor would limit any windfall to the borrower. In the preliminary determination (as in Certain Steel), we found this program to be de jure specific because we believed the program was limited to ECSC loans. However, we discovered at the verification in this investigation that we had overlooked information in the response which indicated that guarantees under this program were also available for loans made by the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund (``CER''). We attempted to learn more about the program's de facto specificity at verification as it became clear that the program was not de jure specific. We established that exchange rate guarantees for CER loans are provided for in Law 796, the same law that provides guarantees for ECSC loans. We learned that CER loans are designed to improve social conditions in the weakest sectors of society by providing loans to small- and medium-sized businesses to create employment opportunities. Officials named the following examples of areas/activities that receive funds from the CER: agriculture, handicraft, tourism. We examined certain loan documents and established that guarantees were in effect on CER loans. However, given the limited time and the manner in which the data were organized, Italian officials were not able to provide information regarding the distribution of benefits provided to CER and ECSC borrowers. Based on the information we have, the exchange risk guarantees may be non-specific. Moreover, we cannot draw adverse inferences regarding the distribution of benefits under the program because the GOI was not uncooperative or otherwise remiss in providing the requested data. Therefore, we determine that the program is not countervailable. Given the circumstances under which we have reached this determination, i.e., lacking certain important information, this finding of non-countervailability will not carry over to future investigations. Therefore, until a fuller record is developed which allows us to undertake a thorough analysis, petitioners will not have to provide new evidence in order for us to investigate this program. In addition, we intend to reinvestigate this program in the first administrative review requested should this investigation result in a countervailing duty order. C. Finsider Loan Guarantees Certain loans made to Terni were assumed by ILVA, and were still outstanding during the POI. At the time the loans were taken out they were guaranteed by Finsider, the holding company of Terni and then TAS. Finsider entered into liquidation in 1988. Nevertheless, ILVA continued to pay the guarantee fees for these loans to Finsider until 1991. At that time, ILVA ceased to pay guarantee fees to Finsider and, in essence, ``self-guaranteed'' these loans. Petitioners argue that the Department should countervail these loan guarantees because: (1) The fees paid for the guarantees were less than what would have been paid to a commercial guarantor; and (2) guarantees to Terni, an uncreditworthy company, constitute government intervention ensuring the extension of the loans.
