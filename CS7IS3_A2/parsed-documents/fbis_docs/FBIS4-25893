Your activities have elicited a strong reaction from society. I would like to congratulate and thank you! Stability is a prerequisite for reform and development. Raising efficiency is the foundation for maintaining stability. Only by genuinely raising efficiency can we avoid serious unevenness in our economic development and can we ensure a stress-free environment for reform; only by genuinely raising efficiency can we truly upgrade our national strength, truly improve the people's living standards, and truly ensure social stability. I hope the comrades responsible for "in-dept travel for economic efficiency in China" activities will conduct further investigations, studies, and propaganda to determine the inherent relationship among deepening reform, raising efficiency, and maintaining stability. In this way, you will be able to render better service to reform, development, and stability. I hope you will achieve still greater achievements in your activities!
