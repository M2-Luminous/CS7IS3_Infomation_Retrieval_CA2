FBIS4-30408 "dreas123__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-123-A Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Government, BOJ To Counter Yen's Appreciation Government, BOJ To Counter Yen's Appreciation OW2606140594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 4 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2606140594 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Despite market interventions by currency authorities from Japan, Europe, and the United States, the dollar's value continued to drop against the yen and the Deutsche mark. As a result, the government and the Bank of Japan [BOJ] are ready to intervene in the market, beginning 27 June, if the yen's appreciation continues, by selling the yen [Y] and buying the dollar at the Tokyo foreign exchange market. The government and the BOJ are worried the rapid rise in the yen's value may reduce profits from export-oriented industries and have negative impacts on the domestic economy, which is beginning to recover. While there is a rumor the United States may increase its interest rate, it is likely Japan will study the possibility of acting in harmony with the United States in the financial policy field by introducing such measures as keeping short-term interest rates low. Joint market interventions on 24 June did not have enough effect because speculators, including U.S.-affiliated companies, sold the dollars they had at a scale exceeding the amount of money Japan and the United States spent in the market interventions. After the dollar-yen rate dropped to the Y99 level at the New York market on 21 June, the BOJ launched a major intervention in the Tokyo market and pushed the dollar back to the Y101 level. Therefore, the BOJ still has confidence in market intervention. However, due to the huge surplus in Japan's current account balance, investors have a strong feeling there are surplus dollar funds at the Tokyo foreign exchange market. Moreover, on 24 June, President Clinton criticized Japan for its trade surplus. Therefore, the government and the BOJ are worried about the possibility that pressure, which calls for further appreciation of the yen, may become strong in the money markets after 27 June. When the dollar's value dropped in May, there were some movements in the financial field to push it up. The BOJ increased its funds supply in the short-term financial market because an increase in funds supply is expected to widen differences in interest rates between Japan and the United States and thereby increase demands for the dollar. It is possible the BOJ may be forced to introduce such a financial measure if the recent interventions in the Tokyo market fails to produce results. The government plans to promote measures, including deregulation, and plans to review as much as possible, fundamental public investment plans in accordance with an initial schedule to show its stance at home and abroad that it aims at realizing economic recovery, led mainly by domestic demands that exist even after the cabinet's resignation. Moreover, the government also wants to make some progress in Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks before the developed countries' summit meeting (Naples summit) to improve Japan-U.S. relations.
