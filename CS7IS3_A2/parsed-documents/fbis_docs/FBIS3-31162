Laczkowski said on Wednesday he did not expect the coalition to break up soon, although he was not sure whether it could survive four years. He explained that by relative durability he meant the ability to adopt budget and to cope with local government elections. He did not expect any crack to take place this year as too many parties were waiting as alternative candidates, for instance, the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN). The PCHD leader believes that internal shifting took place in the coalition and that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak emerged strengthened from the dispute. He would get even stronger if Henryk Chmielak (first deputy finance minister) were appointed as finance minister. Laczkowski added that another major crack, for instance over the agrarian policy, could take place, but he did not see major threats to the coalition's relative durability.
