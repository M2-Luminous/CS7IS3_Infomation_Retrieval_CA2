The news centre of the government says that this resolution will enable to draw the attention to the development of oil and gas fields, to use foreign investments, labour and technical reserves more effective. The resolution includes also the instructions of the SOCAR [National Petroleum Corporation of Azerbaijan]. SOCAR comes out for speeding up the talks with foreign companies on joint development of "Azeri" and "Chirag" oil-fields and to work out the draft of the agreement meeting the interests of Azerbaijan. As the republic needs more natural gas, SOCAR with the assistance of American company "Pennzoil" intends to speed up installing of gas compression stations and building of sea gas-pipe, to start gas transportation from "Guneshli" field since the first quarter of 1994. As TURAN agency was told by the sources close to the government, the draft of the resolution has been prepared by the President of SOCAR Natig Aliyev and was presented to the Prime-Minster Guseynov. Judging by the context of the resolution, a group of experts led by Manaf Manafov does not intend to conduct talks with the consortium of oil companies any more. Earlier SOCAR rejected the draft of the agreement prepared by this group as it did not meet the interests of Azerbaijan. There have been also some statements in press concerning the attempt of Manafov (the citizen of Slovakia) to get bribe from the members of the consortium in exchange for favourable conditions in the contract. So, a new draft of the agreement will be of more severe character for foreign party. The consortium of oil foreign companies was created in summer 1993. It includes of such companies as AMOCO, BP-Statoil, Pennzoil, Unical, Turkish Petroleum Corporation. At first only Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli oil-fields have been involved into the process of exploration and development with total 1.5 billion tonnes of oil. Autumn 1993 Guneshli oil-field was withdrawn from the project, Russian joint stock company "Lukoil" was included in the consortium.
