The Pakistani team renewed a call for an Egyptian security delegation to visit regions in Pakistan suspected of being strongholds for extremists, to make sure that no such activities currently exist. The delegation stressed that Pakistan is eager for Egypt's stability and security and will not allow on its territory any person that may harm them. The sources stressed that over the past two months, Pakistan has deported hundreds of Arab students who were illegally residing in that country. The sources told AL-AHRAM correspondent Yahya Ghanim that the Pakistani authorities gave those Arabs--including Egyptians, Tunisians, and Algerians who took part in the war in Afghanistan--one month to leave the country; the deadline has expired. In a related development, official Pakistani sources said it is likely that Pakistan will sign extradition agreements with Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria.
