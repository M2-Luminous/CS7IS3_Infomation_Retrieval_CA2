Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who received the GCC foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said that the meeting will focus on three issues [as received]: namely developments in the Middle East peace process, and the need for the co-sponsors of the peace conference -- particularly the United States -- to exert greater efforts to overcome the obstacles facing the process. Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal added that the meeting will also discuss the situation and developments in the Gulf region and the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
