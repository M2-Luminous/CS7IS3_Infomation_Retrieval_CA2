"The Serb corridor through (the region of) Posavina must not exist and its capture is the only objective of Croats and Moslems," Djuro Matuzovic, Bosnian Croat force commander for the area of orasje in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, told the local Croatian radio. "If this is not resolved politically, we soldiers expect an order which we shall carry out," Matuzovic threatened. Bosnian Moslems and Croats have lately been concentrating strong forces towards the Serb town of Brcko which is situated in the narrowest part of the corridor which links eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. This was confirmed on Friday also by two members of the 108th Brigade of the Bosnian Croat Army, the so-called Croatian Defence Council HVO, which is deployed in the Posavina region. The two soldiers deserted and surrendered to Serb units with the explanation that they did not wish to take part in the upcoming attack on Serbs. Serb military sources said in Brcko on Saturday that the Croat soldiers also gave a series of facts which prove that preparations for a Moslem-Croat offensive in the region of Posavina were proceeding unabated. According to these men, machinery and equipment have been massively mobilized from private enterpreneurs in order to step up the preparations for the offensive. Bosnian Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic also said on May 2 that units under his command were preparing an offensive on Brcko in order to cut through the Serb corridor. The Serb side has reached agreement with representatives of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on the deployment of U.N. observers in the area of Brcko and offered a truce in that region which it said its forces would carry out unilaterally even if the Moslems refused to accept it. Moslems on Friday called off talks between military commanders of Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces on a cease-fire on the Brcko front, which had been scheduled for Saturday.
