The U.S. Government has set aside $35 million to finance the UN Mission in Rwanda. Bill Clinton's government has also pledged to send tanks and transport planes for African troops to be sent in Rwanda as UN troops. U.S. Government has stated that they still maintain that UN Mission in Rwanda should be humanitarian. They still insist that UN soldiers should go to the border rather than go to the city center. However, this (?delayed) reaction from the UN Security Council, and the United States for that matter, is rather too late. Earlier this week, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN secretary general, told the international community that it is responsible for what is happening in Rwanda, that he had called upon 40 countries to contribute to the UN 5,500 troops -- but only four countries have responded. So far, the countries which have agreed to send troops to Rwanda include Ghana -- which is to add to their 200 troops now in Rwanda to form a battalion of 800 -- Senegal, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe.
