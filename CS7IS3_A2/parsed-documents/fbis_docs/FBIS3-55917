But as we belong to the West and not to the East, we want to get closer as soon as possible", Lithuanian ambassador at NATO Adolfas Venckus told a Polish daily "Rzeczpospolita" on Monday [10 January]. Venckus said in the interview that the Baltic states were ready to give over one battalion to the European peacekeeping forces, were proposing centre of medical training, were ready to participate in NATO military exercises, paid a lot of attention to learning of foreign languages by senior military personnel. "Our wish to join NATO is not directed against Russia. We would like to have the best possible relations with that country but some fears appeared after the elections in Russia and statements of Vladimir Zhirinovsky concerning the Baltic states", he said. Asked how Lithuania would react if Poland was the first to join NATO, Venckus said that "Lithuania is not harmed by the success of others. But, if Poland offered the Baltic states to go to NATO together, we would be very happy". Lithuania and Albania are the only states that have formally applied NATO for membership.
