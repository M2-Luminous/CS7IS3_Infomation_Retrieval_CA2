Although Beijing has denied the rumor, Wei Jingsheng's fate in the days to come worries the outside world to a certain extent. At the beginning of this year, a female French Sinologist, a friend of Wei Jingsheng, brought the two articles which Wei Jingsheng wrote at the end of last year to France. At that time, Wei told her that he hoped to see the two articles published in Europe. Being devoted to the trust conferred on her, his friend wrote and published articles in CROISSANCE and LIBERATION, introducing the contents of the two articles. The Chinese versions of the two articles were handed to OU CHOU JIH PAO [EUROPE DAILY], a subsidiary of LIEN HO PAO, for exclusive publication. This newspaper reprints them today. Wei Jingsheng entitled his articles "China and the World" and "How to Invest in China." Today we reprint the article: "China and the World." In his article "China and the World," Wei Jingsheng appealed to European and American countries to support the democracy movement and the reform process in mainland China for the sake of long-term interest. He maintained that the issue of the fate and future of the Chinese people is a major issue which has a bearing on the future of mankind and it is much more important than selling a nuclear power station. It is common knowledge that China is equal to one-fourth of mankind. It is the only great classic civilization that has lasted up to this day, and so far is the largest country that has been under one-party rule by the Communist Party. Nevertheless, what kind of country is China, in reality? What kind of people are the Chinese? What kind of relationship do they share with the other parts of the world? These are things on which no one is very clear. This being the case, it is both a logical and extremely dangerous state of affairs that importance has not yet been attached to China's affairs and to its influence on the future world. China Does Not Necessarily Lack Any Tradition of Legality China has age-old cultural traditions that differ from European culture. China's culture is unique, and has been very successful over the past 5,000 years. Apparently, it will retain the majority of its fine substance in the years to come, and on that basis, a new cultural system will be formed. Some Chinese and Europeans maintain that, like many other backward or weak nations, China can accept European culture totally and uncritically, and can develop its modern civilization with European culture as the mainstay. This is obviously wrong. The reason this is wrong is not that China is incompatible with modern European civilization. Quite the contrary, the Chinese were the fastest in accepting the European culture among all nations besides the Europeans; they were even faster than some European nations. More often than not, Westerners who know the Chinese are amazed at the speed and the degree of understanding with which the Chinese (not referring exclusively to the Chinese of today) accept Western cultures, as well as science and technology. The fact that Western science and technology -- and cultures, in particular, those forerunners of democratic and liberal ideas -- and Chinese traditional culture have close links shows that Chinese and Western civilizations are not incompatible. Otherwise, we would be unable to explain why Copernicus, Leibniz, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and others were very familiar with, and even had the greatest esteem for Chinese culture. Although Europe's modern democratic legal system differs in essence from China's classic autocratic legal system, Montesquieu charted the blueprint for Europe's modern legal system by using China's classic forms of legal system as direct reference. Therefore, the allegation by the Communists, and of the royalists of the older generation before them, that the Chinese lack a tradition of legality is sheer nonsense. The CPC Does Not Tolerate the Existence of a Normal Legal System In fact, when it comes to some of the basic ideas of the modern legal system, such as "Everyone being equal before the law," the Europeans were not the first to discover them; instead, they were translated directly by the forerunners of democracy -- including Montesquieu -- from China's legal system culture. The principle that "if a prince violates the law, he will be punished just like ordinary people" has existed in Chinese legal clauses for at least 2,000 years. Although these modern principles and ideas of legality were not accurately guaranteed in the classical autocratic legal system, and were violated frequently by members of the ruling groups, which had unrestricted supreme power in their hands, they really served as the basis on which honest law-enforcement personnel protected the people's rights and interests, thus playing a genuine role -- to a certain extent -- in protecting human rights and in maintaining social fairness and stability. The forerunners of democracy and the legal system in Europe have raised the status and role of these ideas and principles greatly, and have developed a completely new democratic legal system, thus enabling these basic ideas and principles to play a greater role in protecting human rights and maintaining stability. Thus, the argument asserting that the Chinese -- who were the earliest to put forward these ideas and principles and who had been familiar with them for more than 2,000 years -- were not suited to the ideas and principles of legality which obviously were favorable to them can be nothing but sheer nonsense. I can hardly find any other more accurate adjectives. This kind of lawless situation exists in China, but it is not a continuity of Chinese tradition. It was borrowed by the Chinese communists from the non-legal tradition in ancient European culture. They integrated this kind of feudal and antilegal "communism" with "small-peasant liberalism," which was a branch of the traditional Chinese culture, to form the "Chinese-style Maoist" legal ideology. They used this ideology to mobilize the peasants to overthrow the legal system that had lasted for more than 2,000 years in China, and they built a contemporary lawless despotic regime characterized by small-peasant opportunism. This despotic regime, therefore, is unable to tolerate the existence of a normal legal system, no matter in terms of ideological principle or in terms of practice. So 40 years after the nation's founding, a preliminary legal system still is nowhere to be found, so naturally the country cannot be ruled by law. It resembles a robot, and you treat its head when its head aches, treat its foot when its foot hurts. There is always a specific therapy for every illness, but there is no fixed, predictable, and systematic prescription for every illness. Therefore, politics in China can only maintain this kind of chaotic situation, which is highly fortuitous, unpredictable, and adjusted by a small handful of persons using expedient measures. This style of maintenance is the most difficult one, as well as an operational style that places the harshest demands on leaders. Or it may be regarded as a style for which it is almost impossible to find a suitable operator to ensure its good operation, so I say that the CPC regime is a power structure that harbors great factors for turmoil. Internal Power Struggle Most Likely Cause for Turmoil Turmoil can erupt in many areas and in different ways. The greatest possibility is that it will erupt from the power struggle within the CPC. Reason number one: Although peasant and worker riots are the easiest way for it to erupt, owing to the overwhelming difference between their own ability and the might of the modern machine of suppression, riots can be only the catalyst for intensifying social conflict and cannot be the main way to overthrow the government. Reason number two: The road through which an opposition party promotes progressive changes or so-called peaceful evolution to democratic system has been completely blocked by those in power. With the silent consent of governments in the West, the CPC gradually has tightened its control over the mass media, to the extent that new thoughts and ideas cannot spread. So the possibility that exploration into new thoughts and ideas may lead to social consensus diminishes, whereas the CPC does not have new thoughts and ideas that can win a general consensus in society. What it has is only the evil method of eliminating its opponents in a brutal and unreasonable way. Thus, Chinese society will maintain a blind, confused, chaotic, and antigovernment mentality for a long period of time. This is how things are at the moment. Aside from the fact that the CPC fails to offer any presentable and convincing theory, even if it could, it would find no major opponent. The CPC solves one problem only to find another cropping up. Apart from normal modern democratic thought, there are numerous strange thoughts and theories confronting the CPC's lack-of-thinking theory in the struggle to win hearts and minds, and almost all of them are very successful. To conclude, the most likely cause for great turmoil in China in the future is the struggle for power and interests within the CPC. China's Influence Greater Than Is Estimated by Historians Over the past four decades, owing to the self-imposed closure by the CPC and the blockade by the international community, China was comparatively isolated from the world, so for many people, China has nothing much to do with the world. Many people even think that China's situation does not have anything to do with their countries and their interests; so why bother whether the Chinese people live or die? Although this kind of thinking is not quite in line with the humanitarianism and humanism declared by the Europeans, it is indeed a principle followed by many European politicians, and it also influences the attitude of a majority of Europeans. In fact, these politicians who believe in pragmatism have covered up many facts that already have happened and will soon happen beside you. Since the middle of 19th century, when China and Europe began frequent trade interactions, every major incident that happened in China has had something to do with the West, and has become an important topic in the governments and parliaments in the Western countries. By the time of World War II, China already had become one of the major and indispensable members of the Western allies, and the important role it played in winning the antifascist war can be matched only by the two great countries: The United States and the Soviet Union. The trends of this century have indicated that the closer China's relationship with the rest of the world becomes, the more evident is its importance as the largest part of mankind. The importance of this nation, which Napoleon called a sleeping lion, is in direct proportion to the degree of its consciousness. After World War II, the situation was even more shocking. The establishment of the Maoist regime changed the political pattern of the whole world, and almost every foreign and domestic condition and policy in the Western countries was affected by this incident. The theory of violent revolution exported by Mao Zedong also became the main ideology in the world during the 1960's and 1970's, and its influence spread to every corner of the world and has not yet disappeared even to this day. What is more important is that the Democracy Wall movement and the continuous development of the pro- democracy movement in China, have become the starting point for the tides of democracy in "socialist countries," and its important role in human history cannot possibly be adequately evaluated by contemporary historians or anybody else. The importance of such a country should be beyond dispute, and any change it goes through -- for better or for worse -- will have a decisive impact on the future development of mankind which will be hard to evaluate. If some politicians have to satisfy the need of some businessmen, so they tell you that "it is unimportant," would you not feel that this is an extremely irresponsible deception? I think, if I were a French or American politician who had a responsible attitude toward his country and people, I would sacrifice some commercial sponsorships or even votes, in order to fully support China's democracy movement and reform process because whether China has a strong noncommunist democracy movement is a crucial and decisive factor determining whether China can embark on the road of cooperation between the government and the people in peacefully reforming the social system. Whether China follows the road of peaceful democratic reform or waits for a war among the warlords is no longer a matter that concerns the fate and future of the Chinese people alone; it also has a bearing on the immediate interests of the French and American peoples. I think that this is more important than whether or not they can sell one more nuclear power plant because the interests of the French and American peoples do not terminate when tenures expire. An old saying in China goes: One who has no long-term considerations has imminent worries. A person who looks down on long-term interests often will be plagued by present difficulties that he cannot overcome. The West Should Help Promoting Democracy Movement I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone that my friendship with the Europeans begins with two Frenchmen. It is precisely from them that I have discovered that the Chinese and Europeans can understand and help each other easily. I hope this kind of friendship and understanding can break through the blockade by the CPC and reach out to all Europeans and Chinese. This way, our world certainly would be a better one!
