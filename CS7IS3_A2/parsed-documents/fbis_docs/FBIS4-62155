As the government airplane approached the Bonn-Cologne airport, the fog which until then had formed a thick shroud over the Siebengebirge drifted off somewhere. Boris Nikolayevich alighted from the airplane when the sky had already cleared and a gentle sun was shining. We, of course, are no experts in physiognomy but will make so bold as to assert that the Russian president stepped onto German soil in a good frame of mind. He even found an opportunity to give a short interview by the steps of the airplane, though this was not stipulated by the protocol. "I want to sum up with my friend Helmut the results of the two-year period since my last official visit to Bonn. We will discuss -- what is more for the final time -- the arrangements for withdrawing our troops from the FRG. Right down to the last soldier. We intend to firmly insist that the celebratory ceremony be held in Berlin." Matvey Burlakov, commander of the Western Group of Forces, is one of those who intend to insist to the end that Berlin is the location. In addition to the arguments which have already been presented, he added his own simplehearted soldier's argument: "But 31 August (the completion date for our troops' withdrawal) is a working day in Germany. Who will we have to take our leave of? It is necessary to organize the send-off on a nonworking day so that people come. It would be desirable to hold a meeting in the Reichstag." During the current visit, the heads of state will not sign agreements and protocols. The only exception that has been made is for the so-called "red" telephone -- the direct link between the Kremlin and the Federal Chancellery. Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel will confirm its right to exist by adding their signatures. Informed sources in the FRG Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell us that the German leadership views this visit as an opportunity to give Boris Nikolayevich "moral support." Bonn officials will do all they can to make the high-ranking Russian guest feel that he is head of a great power. [passage omitted]
