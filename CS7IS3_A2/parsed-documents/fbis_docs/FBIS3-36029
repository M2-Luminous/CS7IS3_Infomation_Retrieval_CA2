Will Russia Get Back Billions of Dollars from Arms Exports?"] [Text] A session of the Russian Federation State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry [Goskomoboronprom] Collegium was held last week. The main question being the results of exports of arms, military hardware, and civilian output from the military-industrial complex, and the prospects for the future. Unprecedentedly, in addition to the committee leadership, leading Russian weapons designers, and directors of the major weapons manufacturing enterprises, journalists too were invited to the collegium session, which would recently have been considered secret. Oleg Nikiforov, head of the Goskomoboronprom Main Directorate for Foreign Economic Activity, delivered the report. According to him, arms exports are today becoming a top-priority for military-industrial complex enterprises since, following the drastic reduction in Defense Ministry orders, defense sectors derive money for conversion and internal needs mainly from exports. In 1993 representatives of the aviation, radio, missile-space, and shipbuilding industries operated most successfully on the foreign arms market. There was a decline in arms industry indicators as well as munitions and special chemicals. Over the year Goskomoboronprom delegations went to 31 countries for talks on arms exports and 186 meetings were held in Moscow, as a result of which a number of protocols and agreements were signed and licenses issued granting the right to trade with 26 countries (there were previously 47 of these countries) worth 40 percent more than in 1992. The largest customers for Russian Goskomoboronprom military and civil equipment were Hungary, India, China, Iran, the United Arab Emirates [UAE], Syria, and Turkey. Some $543 million were received for exports of civilian output (88.4 percent of the 1992 level), which amounts to one-fourth of total export revenue. It is forecast that in 1994 total Russian revenue via the Goskomoboronprom will rise to $4 billion. It was particularly emphasized that last year Russia succeeded in making a mighty breakthrough in an area previously closed to it -- arms fairs -- and exhibited military-industrial complex output in a number of countries -- from West Europe to the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia. According to Nikiforov, all this gives reason to hope that the situation will gradually start to improve over the next few years following the collapse in 1992 and the lack of decline in 1993. However, in subsequent speeches by a number of general designers and directors of military-industrial complex enterprises some doubts were voiced over such an optimistic forecast. Regrettably, not everything depends on development and production personnel. According to General Designer Arkadiy Shipunov, in arms exports Russia is at the moment living off its old achievements. However, compared with previous years research and development funding dropped by a factor of 10-15 and in five years the country runs the risk of finding itself unable to offer anything new. "For instance, we recently held talks with one country and they told us bluntly: We will only buy things from you that we cannot find in the West. We have increasingly few of these products," Shipunov said. A second factor that has jeopardized Russian arms exports is the accompanying switch to world prices of energy sources and the rapid rise in the prime cost of military-industrial complex output. The result is that, whereas previously goods were taken by virtue of their relative cheapness, now they may be even more costly than their Western counterparts. A third factor is the extremely difficult situation that has arisen with the production of munitions, the range of which is steadily tending to decrease. It will soon be simply impossible to produce some types of so-called artillery rounds in Russia. And even the most state-of-the-art aircraft and ships cannot be sold without ammunition and arms for the aircraft and ships. The collegium repeatedly criticized the ill-conceived system of customs duties and taxes, which has resulted in total deductions sometimes exceeding the value of the output. The extremely harsh criticism of certain leading military manufacturers regarding the quality of their products is also worthy of note. In particular, "Kurganmashzavod," which supplies the UAE with infantry fighting vehicles, came in for criticism: The Arabs recently complained about the quality of the armor. The upshot being, in the opinion of the Goskomoboronprom leadership that all future military-technical cooperation with the Gulf countries may be in jeopardy. "We made a considerable breakthrough in the UAE, but if we operate like that, we will shortly not have a presence there," Goskomoboronprom Chairman Viktor Glukhikh said. "You realize that it was not 'Kurganmashzavod' that made the breakthrough into the Gulf, but the whole country. Boys from the Defense Ministry worked in the desert till they dropped, dozens of people held talks at various levels. But the plant has now forgotten everything and is trying to earn a faster buck. I realize that it is hard to tailor vehicles to specific Gulf conditions, but we will not nonetheless permit this approach." And there is another factor. Civilian output comprises three-fourths of the total output of Russia's military-industrial complex, while military output makes up the remaining one-fourth. However, the ratio is reversed in exports -- sales of weapons and military hardware account for 75 percent of revenue. That was why the committee's deputy chairman, Gennadiy Yanpolskiy, said that one of the main tasks for 1994 is to bring "nonmilitary" output up to a competitive level. In the opinion of the committee's specialists, major state support is needed in order for the planned escape from the crisis in exports of arms and military hardware to be feasible. Measures proposed include adopting programs for Russian military cooperation with foreign countries and foreign economic activity in the sphere of civilian output, providing export incentives by creating attractive terms in the spheres of finance, credit, tax, customs, investment, and price, and simplifying the system for exports of spare parts. And, importantly, it is finally time to give military-industrial complex enterprises the right to autonomously export arms and military hardware that is manufactured over and above the state order. One last point. In our view, it would be a good thing for certain other departments, the Defense Ministry in particular, which has shrouded itself in a tight veil of secrecy, to learn from the Goskomoboronprom's openness. However, practice shows that trivial breaches of the law and departmental anarchy often lurk behind this veil. In spite of everything, secret Defense Ministry materials vanish westward, not to mention the strictly internal information that floods into newspapers like grain from a holey sack.
