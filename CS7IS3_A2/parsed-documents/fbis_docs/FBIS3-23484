Police said the investigators were led to the three-story shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday. [passage omitted] Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban Road at the order of a foreign buyer. Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri. The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke Thai about four months ago, police said. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said investigators have identified the Mideast-looking man who drove the truck and rented the shophouse. He said the man had rented the house since August last year and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent from a province in the South. Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who might have left the country, he said. Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the landlord believed they had now left Thailand. Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents and materials used to make the bomb and the items found yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb at the World Trade Center in New York. The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S. Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a "witches' brew". [passage omitted] Chaiyasit said he was "50 percent" sure the terrorists are still in the Kingdom. [passage omitted] He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the Mideast-looking man who rented the truck and bought the water tanks was the same person. The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English and Arabic. Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot and they would have had to have been in the country for some time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know Bangkok's roads. Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy. But the names of the two suspects are still unknown and it is not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said. Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects. [passage omitted] A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for questioning and identification by the motorcyclist. The man was released later after being cleared. [passage omitted]
