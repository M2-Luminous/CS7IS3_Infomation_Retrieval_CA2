But now the demographic situation in the city is characterized as critical. Why?[end bold] The population of Novosibirsk increased by 124,700 over the decade 1979-1988. The city population increased by 12,500, on average, each year. But just a few years ago the situation began to change. In 1989 the number of people in Novosibirsk increased by only 6,700, and in 1990, by only 3,500. In 1991 a loss in population was noted for the first time (of 4,400 people). In 1992 the city population had decreased by 11,200, and in 1993--by 12,500. Of course there were contributing factors to the exodus of people from Novosibirsk -- production decline and the reduced need for outside manpower. The emigration of Novosibirsk residents was also a factor of no small significance. In 1993, 1,400 inhabitants of Novosibirsk had departed for places abroad. But on the whole, only 25 percent of the loss of population is due to migratory outflow. Last year more people died than were born in all rayons of the city. As compared with 1992, the number of births decreased by 2,100 (16 percent), amounting to 10,600. Twenty thousand people died, 4,100 more than in 1992. One of the objective factors contributing towards the reduced birth rate is the demographic echo of war. The fact of the matter is that our 20-29 year-old women are those of the sparse generations born at the end of the 60's-beginning of the 70's (i.e., the daughters of people born during the war and post-war years). Also providing its contribution to the decline in birth rate, of course, is the present crisis situation in the country and factors related to it--the drop in standard of living of the populace and lack of confidence in what tomorrow will bring. The number of registered marriages decreased by 119 in 1993, although the number of divorces also decreased last year. Unfavorable changes in population mortality are being observed in the city. The mortality index increased over the year from 11.0 to 14.1 deaths per thousand population. The main causes of death in Novosibirsk remain diseases of the circulatory system (54 percent), tumors (16 percent), accidents, poisonings, and trauma (16 percent). The incidence of murder increased 1.5-fold over the past year; suicides increased by 27 percent. Thus, the demographic situation in Novosibirsk has indeed reached crisis proportions. Everywhere we see a declining birth rate and increased mortality rate, resulting in natural losses of the city population. In addition, the migrational exodus has reduced the number of inhabitants in all rayons of Novosibirsk. The demographic situation of the city continues to deteriorate this year as well. The number of deaths in January-March was double the number of births.
