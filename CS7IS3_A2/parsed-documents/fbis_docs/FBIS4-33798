In today's edition, GRANMA points out that this information was provided by Orlando Penate, director of Social security of the State Committee for Labor. Penate points out that in 1993 Cuba invested more than 1.63 billion pesos in social security. This figure represents 4.3 million pesos invested in the social sector every 24 hours, which does not include the cost of assistance in that sector, which in 1993 was approximately 35.9 million pesos. In Cuba, the social security system's equation of equilibrium is based on the business sector's productivity, and its development is determined by the global economy, which means that greater efficiency is required from the business sector.
