[passage omitted] Sources close to the Commission of the European Union (EU) on Wednesday had reported the Court as saying that it needed one to two years to see if the Greek embargo violated EU regulations. [passage omitted] The Court decided that it was unable to decide whether or not the embargo by Greece contravened treaties of the European Union (EU), which do not allow EU members to take such unilateral action on trade, until it had studied the matter in detail. But the Court held that the arguments advanced by the Commission appeared to be "pertinent and serious," a spokesman for the Commission said on Thursday. "The Court believes that the unilateral measures taken by Greece are in contradiction with community regulations concerning the free circulation of goods and the common trade policy," the spokesman said. But the Court had said on Wednesday that it was rejecting the request that temporary measures be taken because the Commission had not shown that serious and irreperable prejudice had been caused, the Commission spokesman said. However the Court had found that the Commission's legal arguments about the fundamental issues had appeared at first sight to be pertinent and serious. This ruling, which had been given behind closed doors to Greece and the Commission, did not prejudice the final decision of the Court. [passage omitted]
