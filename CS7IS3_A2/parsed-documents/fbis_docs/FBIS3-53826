Al-Hudaybi was surprised when the Jordanian authorities banned him from entering without giving any reason. The Jordanian authorities even prevented him from seeing his daughter, who was waiting for him at the incoming passengers gate at the airport. Al- Hudaybi was forced to return to Egypt on the same plane. This should have never taken place and should not pass unnoticed. The Egyptian authorities should have adopted a position and performed their duty in defense of the dignity of its nationals, particularly those who are prominent and well-known symbols. We hope that the Jordanian authorities will reconsider their position. It is an unacceptable attitude even if it was in retaliation for the Egyptian authorities' preventing Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, general guide of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, from entering Egypt. This is also unacceptable behavior.
