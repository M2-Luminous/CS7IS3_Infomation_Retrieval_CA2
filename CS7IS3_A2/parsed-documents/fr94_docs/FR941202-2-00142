SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Laboratories, the regulated community, laboratory clients and the regulatory agencies have experienced difficulty under the current system of laboratory accreditation. In response to complaints received in 1990, EPA has been working in a cooperative venture with the states and the public to develop a system which would surmount many of the existing problems. In 1991, the Committee on National Accreditation of Environmental Laboratories (CNAEL) was chartered at the request of EPA's Deputy Administrator. The CNAEL was charged with determining the need and advisability of a national environmental laboratory accreditation program, alternatives to such a program, and the role of EPA in any program. CNAEL was composed of members from the laboratory and regulated industry communities, academia, other federal agencies, the states, public environmental interest groups, and private accrediting bodies.
