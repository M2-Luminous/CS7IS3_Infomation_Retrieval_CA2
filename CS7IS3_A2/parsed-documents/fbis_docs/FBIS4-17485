And those are the principles of the Partnership for Peace program," Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said at a news conference today. The Russian defense minister believes that NATO's Partnership for Peace program has been over-publicized, although even the masters of the program have not yet put forward its specific principles and measures. Meanwhile, hundreds of scientific works have already been written on this topic, thousands of symposiums held, and millions spent on various visits, Pavel Grachev noted.
