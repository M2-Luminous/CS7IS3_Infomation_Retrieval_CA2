Huber Matos, who has lived in San Jose since January 1993, is the son of Cuban exile leader Huber Matos, owner of a San Jose radio station and head of the Independent and Democratic Cuba (CID) organization. The extradition request, which was filed by the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica, says that Matos and Juana Mayda Perez Batista are accused of "administration irregularities" of a Miami (USA) clinic. Judicial sources said the two Cubans have been charged with using "fraudulent methods'' against U.S. Government agencies to charge for fictitious or unnecessary services given to patients at a medical center in Miami. According to the records filed with the Costa Rican court, Matos faces 21 criminal counts in southern Florida for money laundering, 49 for postal fraud, 24 for charging money with false documents, and one for conspiracy and violating federal laws. Federal Judge Barry Garber issued the U.S. arrest warrant against Matos on 23 June 1993. The Costa Rican court handling the extradition request has imposed a precautionary measure on Matos banning him from leaving the country until a decision is made on his case. A bilateral extradition treaty between Costa Rica and the United States exists. It was suspended in January 1993 when the Constitutionality Court declared several of its articles "unconstitutional."
