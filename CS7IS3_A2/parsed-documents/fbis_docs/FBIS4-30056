The top government spokesman also urged Pyongyang to allay international concerns over its nuclear program through action and pledged that japan will continue efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue in close concert with the U.S. and South Korea. Specifically, Kumagai said North Korea should formally return to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), comply with international nuclear safeguards requirements, and implement a joint declaration with South Korea for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. ``It is important to persuade North Korea in various ways,'' Kumagai said. In March last year, North Korea said it was pulling out of the NPT but suspended the decision later. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced wednesday that the U.S. and North Korea will hold high-level talks in Geneva early next month following Pyongyang's assurances that it will freeze its nuclear program while the talks are in progress. Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said japan cautiously welcomed the U.S. Government's confirmation of North Korea pledge to freeze its nuclear program, as well as Washington's intention to resume diplomatic talks with Pyongyang. The sources said U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher conveyed Washington's decision to hold a third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang in a telephone call earlier in the day to Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. They said the U.S. Took note of Japan's desire to see steps taken to uncover the history of operation of North Korea's nuclear reactor to ensure no plutonium has been diverted for a covert nuclear weapons development program. U.S. officials were quoted as saying the issue may be on the agenda of the third round of talks. But the sources said the Japanese Government is not optimistic about what may well turn out to a mere replay of events, in which North Korea proceeds at its own pace, putting off a resolution of the issue. They said that if North Korea is not more forthcoming at the talks, the course of events will inevitably lead back to consideration of economic sanctions to force Pyongyang into compliance with the will of the international community. Clinton said Wednesday that during the period of the talks the U.S. will suspend efforts to pursue a sanctions resolution in the U.N. Security Council.
