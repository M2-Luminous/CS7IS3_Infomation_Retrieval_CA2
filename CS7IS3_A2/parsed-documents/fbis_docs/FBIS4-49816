At yesterday morning's ceremony, Pu Chaozhu, secretary of the provincial party committee and president of the provincial party school, delivered a speech in which he emphatically called for setting more store by the study of theory and for further enhancing party spirit. He said: These two aspects are part and parcel of all party building work! Secretary Pu Chaozhu also urged party cadres at all levels across the province to understand the profound importance of the study of theory; to study revolutionary theory in a conscientious manner; and to implement the party's principles and policies more accurately and to the letter. Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: At present, while studying Marxist- Leninist theory, we should focus on studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; use the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three, as the main teaching material; study theories in light of actual local conditions; clearly understand and profoundly grasp socialism; and comprehend the necessity of building and developing socialism, which is a fundamental issue at the moment. Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: We should know that socialism aims at liberating and developing the productive forces; conscientiously learn and master socialist market economic theory; bear in mind that the on-going economic structural reform aims at building and perfecting the socialist market economy structure; and by dint of in-depth theory study, heighten both our consciousness and our firmness in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and in comprehensively implementing and carrying out the party's basic line. Secretary Pu Chaozhu held: While studying revolutionary theory, we should persistently adhere to the fine style of integrating theory with practice; become more capable of applying theory to practice; and transform both the subjective and objective worlds in accordance with revolutionary theory. In view of the prevailing problems among leading cadres at and above the county level, we should employ methods developed in each and every rectification movement; conduct both criticisms and self-criticisms; concentrate on studying a list of selected original works by Marx, Lenin, and Deng Xiaoping; and firmly grasp their essence and spirit, thereby achieving mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject and acquiring an in-depth understanding of the ideological line of persistently emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. In addition, we should try to acquire an in-depth understanding of such four basic issues as communist ideals, socialist faith, whole- hearted service to the people, and democratic centralism, as well as a better understanding of Marxism, thereby successfully transforming our world outlook; enhancing our party spirit; and accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and economic development in local areas and local units under the guidance of revolutionary theory. Meng Jiyao, member of the provincial party committee standing committee and director of its organization department, also attended the opening ceremony, which was presided over by Zhao Shaomin, deputy director of the provincial party committee's propaganda department, executive vice president of the provincial party school, and secretary of its party committee.
