At 0900 two enemy combat helicopters from the direction of Sumari and (?Jelina Ravan) attacked the defense positions in Vranovaca. After one of them had fired its Maljutka missiles, our antiaircraft defenses opened fire and the enemy helicopters were forced to withdraw. Then, from the direction of (?Jelina Ravan), the chetnik Gazelle helicopters carried out three bombing raids against the defense lines in Boderiste. These air raids only increased the tremendous pressure under which the aggressor's tanks and artillery have been keeping the defense lines of the free Brcko territory. Almost 1,000 shells of all calibers have so far landed on the area of Omerbegovaca, Vranovaca, and Boderiste alone. On this part of the front the aggressor this morning attempted five tank and infantry breakthroughs. The fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade successfully repulsed all these chetnik attempts. The defense lines are unchanged. During the chetnik attacks on Vranovaca, our artillery men targeted a strong enemy infantry unit near (Miladici) and destroyed the entire unit with pinpoint fire. There were some officers of the aggressor's army among the dozens of killed and wounded chetniks. Unfortunately the Serbian aggressor retaliated against civilian targets. The population has been warned to remain in their shelters by means of the general alarm, as the sudden and intense shelling of the free territory has been under way since early this morning.
