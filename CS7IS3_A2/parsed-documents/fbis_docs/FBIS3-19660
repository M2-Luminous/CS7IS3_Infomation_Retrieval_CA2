Noting that "things are not much different today," it is still in Lisbon's strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that "it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional integrations that obviate the existence of the Community." In Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this "reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it." Vegar cites Gaspar's concern about a possible fragmentation of the Union through the formation of subregional Scandinavian, Iberian, or German blocs. On the other hand, Vegar also cites Andre Goncalves Pereira, former minister of foreign affairs, as saying that "there is no privileged relationship between Portugal and Great Britain." An alliance made sense when Portugal first entered the EC, given the somewhat parallel Portuguese and English positions on federalism at that time. However, following EC assistance to Portugal, Lisbon's present stance is much closer to the official EU position, which collides with London's traditional antifederalism, Goncalves Pereira is cited as saying. Vegar then cites Socialist Party (PS) luminary and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaime Gama, who notes that "it is to our advantage to maintain an intense relationship with the United Kingdom because we are partners in NATO and the EU." Nevertheless, Gama continues, the object of this alliance "was transferred from England to the United States, which unfortunately never occupied this vacuum because it has a different awareness of international issues." Finally, Gama is cited as claiming that the "old theory of Atlantic versus continental nations" cannot justify Portugal's interest in favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for "the world is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response to each problem is needed."
