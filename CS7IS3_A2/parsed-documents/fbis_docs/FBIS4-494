And if it's Ramaphosa, will Pik Botha hang on to his post as Foreign Minister? The imminence of the election -- now just 17 days away -- is sparking furious debate in political circles about who will be occupying key posts in the new coalition Cabinet after the voting is over, according to reliable sources. Intense interest is focused on the race for one of two deputy presidencies provided for in the Interim Constitution. Polls suggest that F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the party likely to come second in the election, will win one of the posts. But ANC leader Nelson Mandela -- the overwhelming favourite for president -- will have to choose the second deputy president from his own ranks. Mbeki and Ramaphosa are regarded as the top contenders, with Mbeki's seniority in his favour, and Ramaphosa's stronger showing on the ANC list boosting his chances. The outcome could affect Botha's future. If Mbeki were not to achieve the deputy presidency, he would be a very strong candidate for the Foreign Ministry. As incumbent president, De Klerk's most senior Cabinet Minister, Botha -- now the longest-serving foreign minister in the world -- is certain to be one of the NP MPs to be included in the Cabinet which is to be announced early next month. ANC sources said debate on the new Cabinet was now at an advanced stage within the organisation. The national executive committee had been scheduled to discuss the issue and make recommendations on the issue this week, but the meeting was postponed until next week because of yesterday's four- way summit of leaders to discuss "the Natal problem". Mbeki and Ramaphosa are the two main candidates for the position of South Africa's first deputy president, who will come from the biggest party if no more than one other party wins more than 20 percent of the vote. The ANC sources said there were sensitivities over this discussion, with each man's camp making a strong claim for the position. Ramaphosa's backers argued that as the candidate placed immediately after Mandela on the ANC's national election list, he should be heir-apparent to the septuagenarian ANC leader. Mbeki's supporters -- many in the ANC Youth League -- said he had been placed second on regional lists, and claimed that as the list which saw Ramaphosa leap-frogging to second spot was a result of the national conference attended by party bosses, it did not represent "the will of the people". Should Mbeki get the deputy presidency, Botha -- whose only other challenger is said to be ANC deputy international affairs director Aziz Pahad -- is almost assured of the Foreign Affairs post. In terms of the Interim Constitution, South Africa's new president will be obliged to appoint Ministers from parties which have polled at least 5 percent of the vote "on the advice of the parties to which the relevant portfolios have been allocated."
