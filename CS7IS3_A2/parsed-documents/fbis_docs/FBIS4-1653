Liu Mingyou, president of the China National Chemical Construction Corporation (CNCCC), said CNCCC has engaged in a dozen projects involving a total volume of 500 million U.S. dollars in loans from WB and ADB. Of the total sum, 430 million dollars was granted by WB and 70 million by ADB, he said. CNCCC is one of the four corporations in China responsible for the utilization of loans from the World Bank. It has been entrusted to invite bidding for procurement using WB and ADB loans obtained by the Ministry of Chemical Industry through China's financial ministry. The WB and ADB loans were allocated for the power-saving innovation of five large fertilizer factories, product-restructuring in five medium-sized fertilizer factories, the development of a phosphorus mine in Guizhou Province, the development of phosphate in Hubei Province and agricultural development in Hebei Province. Liu said that CNCCC announced separate bidding, instead of package bidding, for the projects to reduce the costs by nearly 10 percent. Moreover, CNCCC also undertook projects using soft loans from Britain, Canada and Italy and introduced technology for chemical, petrochemical, fertilizer, membrane electrolysis, steel radial tyres and other projects. In addition to importing technology and equipment, CNCCC extended its business scope to cover import and export trade and contracting foreign projects. Last year alone, the total volume of imports and exports and project contracts amounted to 1 billion U.S. dollars.
