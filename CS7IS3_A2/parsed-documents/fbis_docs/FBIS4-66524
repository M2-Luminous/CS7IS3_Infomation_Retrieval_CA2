He was also the personal guard of Kordofan's governor, his younger brother. But he left Sudan recently and declared at a press conference in Switzerland, where he has applied for political asylum, that he does not wish to return to Sudan under the current government. He talked about the tragedies he saw in Kordofan and offered a comprehensive and detailed personal report on the massacres that have taken away the lives of thousands of Nubians. AL-MAJALLAH has contacted lst Lt. Khalid 'Abd-al-Karim Salih and conducted the following interview with him: [Al-Hasan] How did you get out of Sudan? [Salih] I left in the company of my sick mother who went for treatment in Jordan. When she recovered, thank God, I arranged for her to return to Sudan and I headed for Switzerland in search of political asylum. At a press conference there, I said everything to satisfy my conscience, exposing the ethnic extermination and purge campaign launched by the Sudanese regime against Nubia's citizens. [Al-Hasan] Your talk about the regime's actions against Nubians was based on reports with which you familiarized yourself by virtue of your position as security branch chief. Did you personally see mass extermination or villages burned in the Nuba Mountains? [Salih] We made visits to the field with the governor after the operations, and we saw the villages that were burned to the ground and the corpses. [Al-Hasan] How many burned villages and how many corpses did you see? [Salih] Nearly 200 villages in the Tolshi Mountains and the number of corpses ranged from 20 to 150 [per village]. [Al-Hasan] Considering that you are familiar with the reports on the extermination operations, what is your estimate of the number of people claimed as victims of the campaign during your presence in the service? [Salih] The reports aren't interested in those annihilated but in losses suffered by the army and civil defense. Most of the reports call for more military reinforcements to carry out these brutal acts. [Al-Hasan] So, how were you able to estimate the number of Nubians killed at 60-70,000 people when you were in charge of the province security, as you have said in your report to the Sudanese Human Rights Organization? [Salih] We received reports at the rate of two reports a month. Each report indicated that the number of victims ranged from 3-4,000. The reports mentioned no [exact] numbers. So, I estimated that the lives annihilated during the seven months of my control of the security branch amounted to these numbers. [Al-Hasan] Why hasn't the army objected to these operations, keeping in mind that a large number of NCO's are from Nubia? [Salih] As of the first moments of the coup, the Front [National Islamic Front (NIF)] cadres began to liquidate the armed forces officers and to plant their own men in the military intelligence. These cadres started dismissing members of the regular forces on mere suspicion. Thus, trust among officers has, to a large degree, been lost. Most of these operations are carried out by officers chosen from the NIF and from its Popular Defense Forces. [Al-Hasan] Were you a member of al-Turabi's front and were you chosen for the mission on this basis? [Salih] No, I haven't been a member of the NIF organizations. [Al-Hasan] Were you chosen for this task because you are the governor's brother? Is the governor himself from the NIF? [Salih] I don't believe that I was chosen just because I am the governor's brother but because of the security capability I displayed. I was moved from the position of security official in Khartoum North to Port Sudan because the regime feared that forces loyal to Lieutenant General Fathi in Port Sudan would stage a military coup or that a military landing would be staged in that province. I believe that my security activity was excellent, thus qualifying me to be transferred to Kordofan Province. [Al-Hasan] From your security experience, do you believe that your brother, the governor, was one of the Front's military cadres prior to the coup and that he has a role in the schemes that are implemented by the Front in the Nuba Mountains? [Salih] This is an extremely embarrassing question. People can judge my brother by his actions. All I know about my brother prior to the coup is that he was extremely religious. [Al-Hasan] Didn't it occur to you to broach this human tragedy with him? [Salih] I did. He said to me that the orders came down from the top and that he was powerless to confront them. Lieutenant General al-Bashir had visited Kurdufan and proclaimed its governor the province prince of jihad [holy war] and himself, i.e., al-Bashir, the imam of jihad. Al-Bashir also declared 1992-93 the year of jihad in Kordofan. [Al-Hasan] How could jihad be declared against the Nubian tribes when statistics show that 40 percent of them are Muslim and 40 percent animist, and that Christians among them don't exceed 20 percent? [Salih] This is something that perplexes me too. I was surprised when I saw that their harsh treatment made no distinction between Muslim and Christian. I felt tortured when I saw children separated from their families and turned over to the Islamic Call authorities, even though the children were Muslim in the first place. I was pained to see the children's families sent to government production [crop?] collection sites under those oppressive conditions and in that disgraceful manner.
