Now we have the president of the Republic of Crimea engaging in the same conduct -- his preelection promises notwithstanding, he is disregarding the Ukrainian Constitution. Thus, following a rainy Thursday, having set his Komandirskiye wristwatch by the tolling of the Kremlin bells, he issued another of his directives to the Crimean [military] commissariats regarding the next call-up of young Crimeans to military service with the instruction that they should serve only on the Crimean peninsula. Not a foot, booted or bare, is to step beyond the isthmus! "This directive is illegal. There is no foundation for it whatsoever," said Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense, at a press conference held upon his return from Crimea at the end of last week. "The military leadership (I have in mind the military commissar of Crimea, Major-General Volkov, and the commander of the army corps, Major-General Kuzmuk) also know this and will carry out the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's orders to act in accordance with acting legislation. In other words, the conscription of youths will be conducted according to the extraterritorial principle." To be sure, this does not mean that all Crimeans will serve exclusively outside the territory of the Crimean Republic, added Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan. There are a number of preferences [pilhy] under which a certain category of conscripts will be allowed, as before, to undergo their military training not far from home. These preferences are well-known, and they are taken into account by every military commissariat in Ukraine. But the total number of such youths will not exceed 20 percent. If only matters were confined to this attempt by Meshkov to place the Crimean commissariat system under his jurisdiction. But the "campaign" is much broader in scale. Meshkov's cabinet has issued several other "military" directives that clearly exceed this body's authority. For example, the directive to submit full information on the deployment of the units and subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on their structure, military objectives, etc. That is how the authorities in Crimea want to let us know that they would like to form their own armed forces... It is unlikely that the Crimean president and his military advisors expect to receive this information. Nor do they have any need of it at present. In I. Bizhan's view, the main objective is to raise a political outcry and create tension surrounding these issues (and that of conscription, in particular). In all likelihood, Meshkov's team has not yet gotten over its recent presidential election campaign and is confusing it with the realities of the present. And this is no longer funny. It is one thing to make the Crimeans sit down an hour earlier to their dinner tables and quite another to put young conscripts in the dock for failing to carry out the Law on Military Duty and Military Service (and this outcome is not out of the question should the conscripts and their relatives heed the calls to unlawful actions). That is why Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan asked the members of the mass media to report this event accurately and explain to the public the position of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. Certain advisors to the president of the Crimean Republic are very active. We have in mind the specialists on military affairs who until recently wore military uniforms and still cannot reconcile themselves to their new status of reservists. Thus, one of them suddenly decides to "correct the actions" of the military subunits and units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while another decides to conduct "authorized" inspections. One cannot help but be reminded of old circus nags that start to dance out of habit as soon as they hear any kind of music. It should be noted that, as a rule, these reservists' nostalgic charges are seen as poor jokes -- the kind that one is embarrased to laugh at and ashamed to tolerate. But if the supporters of the Crimean president want to question the competence of the military leadership of the army corps, they have absolutely no grounds for this. "I myself head the certification commission," said Col-Gen Ivan Bizhan, "and I have complete confidence in the professional qualifications of the officers and generals serving in the units stationed on the Crimean peninsula." During his visit to Crimea, Maj-Gen Ivan Bizhan also met with Admiral Selivanov, the chief of the Main Staff of the Navy of the Russian Federation. Their talks centered on a number of fundamental issues regarding the Black Sea Fleet. Among them -- the fact that the Russian side exceeds its authority in the command of the Fleet, the Russians' desire to unilaterally dispose of the Fleet's material assets, and their resistance to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's demand for an immediate inventory of the Fleet's property as stipulated by the government agreements reached in Massandra and Yalta. Unfortunately, the Russian side has once again attempted to pass over these questions and has failed to answer why only citizens of the Russian Federation are being recruited to the elite unit of naval infantry contrary to the "50-50" provision called for by the agreement.
