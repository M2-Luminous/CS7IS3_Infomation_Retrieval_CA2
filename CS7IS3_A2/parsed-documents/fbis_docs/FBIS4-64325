The gloves are off. The wonder of it is that the question was not asked earlier. Let us cut ourselves off, voices are saying within the Government, and have done with it. The European Community was founded in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Its core policy, agricultural subsidy, was devised at a time when hunger was not unknown in Europe. The Cold War is over. Free trade is now enshrined in the GATT treaty. Agricultural surpluses tower to heaven. Why not get out? There should be no embarrassment now in questioning the point of the whole European construction. Indeed, British Euro sceptics might have attracted wider sympathy during the Maastricht debate if they had drawn the logical conclusion of their own arguments. The Foreign Office was yesterday active with the sand bucket, fighting the spread of speculation. "Complete rubbish," it said. But it was clear last night that the extraordinary words imputed to John Major -- "I'll pull out of Europe" -- emanate from a clique which has the support of some senior members of the Government and a widening section of the parliamentary party. They are casting their eyes ahead to the 1996 negotiations, which could begin as early as this autumn; and their objective is to bounce Mr Major into an extreme position. They wish him to fight federalism with a threat: that any further incursions upon national sovereignty would cause Britain to uproot the tent pegs in Brussels and depart. As a serious proposition, from serious members of the establishment, it has no precedent since the referendum of 1975. After so many humiliations, the mood in Westminster is lightheaded, nihilistic. Exasperated by detail, befuddled by its defeats, parts of the Government, or at least the Tory party, are prepared to debate the question of Europe from first principles. They are right to do so. The mere threat of withdrawal would change the way the Government is viewed, both abroad and at home. Too often, other countries have been able to drive Britain into a corner because they know, or have hitherto assumed, that Britain would never be so anarchic, so mad, as to deploy the doomsday weapon. The threat could serve the Government well, moreover, in the Euro election campaigns. Both Labour and Liberal Democrats have left themselves badly exposed on the Euro sceptical flank. But if such a threat is to carry weight for long, there must be a serious intention behind it. Could it ever be in Britain's interests to depart? I know of only one reason for staying in the Common Market. It is, however, quite a good one: If Britain extricated herself from the pact she joined in 1973, the balance of probability is that the remaining 11 would not disintegrate. The Eurocrats would reel. The recriminations would be shrill. But the organisation would not explode. The EC Commission would continue to promulgate screeds of legislation. These would cease to be directly applicable to Britain. But the writ of Brussels would run through an ever wider dominion, as first the Scandinavians and then the East Europeans joined. With more than half our exports going to the Community, British firms would have no choice but to conform with the standards, weights, sizes, dimensions determined by the continentals. The only difference would be that, out side, Britain would have no way of influencing those standards to its advantage. Excluded from the corridors of power, Britain would be unable to safeguard her interests. That is a good reason for staying in the EC. But as the debate gathers way, as it seems likely to do, we will hear plenty of bad reasons, not least from the Government. Some will say we are now so intimately bound in that we could not physically excise ourselves, that the union was now beyond surgery. In reality, withdrawal presents few practical difficulties. Parliament would simply have to abrogate the Treaty of Rome, as amended by the Single European Act and Maastricht. British MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] would easily find employment as "consultants" in Strasbourg or Brussels and British ministers would no longer have to fly in for interminable meetings in the Charlemagne building. Britain would not even need to disengage its diplomatic representation to Brussels, the 40 or so diplomats. Most of them would stay, though as observers rather than negotiators. Euro-enthusiasts of an old fashioned cast of mind, such as Sir Edward Heath, might lament the offence caused to our "partners" in Europe. On the other hand they perhaps exaggerate the need to be polite to foreigners. They are not especially polite to us. Some, especially the Labour party, will feel we have to stay on the inside if we wish to share in the defences of a giant trading bloc, able to project its will in the face of Japan and America, and the challenge of cut price labour from the Third World. In fact, the opposite is true. If there is a commercial reason for Britain staying in, it is to prevent such a fortress Europe from being created. Britain's farmers and John Gummer, former Agriculture minister, are likely to say that departure would damage our agricultural interests; and it is true that we have become junkies of the Common Agricultural Policy as much as any other EC country. Pump-primed by Brussels subsidies, British exports of agricultural products rose by 7 percent per year during the early 1980's. But the cost has been absurdly high, in food prices and in the tax burden. Local councils might protest that they would be cut off from all those Brussels hand-outs from the regional and social funds. It is true that the 12-star emblem would vanish from the signs on inner-city developments and bypasses in Scotland. But we could fund our own roads, schools and hospitals ourselves and plough back, moreover, the billions that we contribute to the EC budget. The worst reason of all for remaining inside is the widespread assumption that Brussels, "Europe," would save us from ourselves. It is a common middle-class sentiment that Government, or Mr Major, is so lacking in direction that some kind of Euro-government could scarcely be worse. On the contrary, one could argue that is the EC's very tentacles which undermine confidence in British institutions. My own hunch is that pulling out of Europe might, at least in the first few years, cause an immense feeling of national renewal. It would be intoxicating to cast off the incubus of Brussels. It would end the wearisome arguments about sovereignty, the confusion about who governs Britain. It would be like winning the World Cup, or the wave of national unity at the beginning of the Second World War. But I think it would not last, for the one big reason I have mentioned. British businessmen would face discrimination. Investors in Britain would be deterred. As long as the Community exists, we are better off making trouble from the inside. In any case, the question is unlikely to present itself in those terms. In 1996, the issue will not be in or out. With so many new countries presenting themselves for membership, it will be the end of the old all-or-nothing EC compact. For the first time, Britain will be able to choose from a menu of options. Some may want tighter integration. Others may be able to content themselves with little more than free trade. It is at that point that battle will be joined in earnest between Europhiles and Eurosceptics.
