The UN Trusteeship Council held its 61st conference today. Representatives of the Palau Government and the U.S. Administration, the authority in charge of the trust territory, announced at the conference that the two countries will carry out the Treaty of Free Contacts beginning on 1 October 1994. According to this treaty, Palau will terminate its political status as a trust territory of the United States and will become an independent sovereign state. Palau President Kunivo Nakamular, who is attending the conference, said in his speech that he hopes Palau will take the floor at the next UN General Assembly as a sovereign and independent state and a member of the United Nations. Zhang Yan said the Chinese Government and people always support the people of the trust territories in their demands and aspirations for national self-determination and independence. He said: The Chinese people have always cherished friendly affection toward the people of Palau. We hope that Palau will become an independent member of the international community at an early date, and that it will embark on the road of developing its national economy and building its country. Palau, with a population of approximately 16,000 people, is situated in western Pacific and is one of the gateways leading to Southeast Asia in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently the only territory under UN trusteeship. Palau was occupied by the United States during World War II. The United Nations placed it under U.S. trust in 1947. A referendum on Palau's future political status and prospects held in January 1993 showed that 68.26 percent of the voters were in favor of the Treaty of Free Contacts signed between Palau and the United States in August 1982, and thus adopted the decision to terminate its trustee status by a simple majority.
