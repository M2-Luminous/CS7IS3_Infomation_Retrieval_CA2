More than 300 students in Kwangju in their anti-U.S. protest in front of the "American Centre", charged that the United States was whipping up the atmosphere of war on the Korean peninsula, increasing pressure on the North over the "nuclear issue". They strongly demanded that the United States stop pressuring the North for nuclear inspection and the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. The protesters threw a hundred bottles of paint and rocks at the "American Centre" in the fierce demonstration. On the same day about fifty students rushed to the "American Centre" in Taegu and staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration shouting "we oppose the United States increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula" and pelting scores of paint cans at the building.
