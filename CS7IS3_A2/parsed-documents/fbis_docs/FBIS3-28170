Saudi authorities are now issuing reentry visas to unskilled Thai workers who previously found it difficult to obtain such permission after an absence from the country, he said Skilled workers remained much in demand as goldsmiths, gardens and auto repairs, he said. But the pay was not as good as in the past few years so Thai workers should not expect too much. At the same time, the number of Saudi nationals applying for entry visas to Thalland has increased significantly. A total of 7,000 people, mainly those aged over 30, submitted applications last year, he said. When relations were more strained, Saudi employers took workers from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. They were being paid at lower rates of about 2,800 baht a month he said.
