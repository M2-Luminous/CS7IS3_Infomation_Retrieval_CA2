The African National Congress, admitting some self-defense units are out of control, says it's trying to reestablish its authority over them. Sources close to the ANC say at least three self-defense units are out of control in townships east of Johannesburg, among the most violent in South Africa. The self-defense units are informal armed groups which live in and are responsible for the security of local communities.
