The agreement, which was negotiated all day on 23 March with the active participation of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso [FHC], was officially attacked by Federal Supreme Court [STF] representatives, party leaders in Congress, and Attorney General Aristides Junqueira. The agreement also depended on President Itamar Franco's approval. At the beginning of the evening the president said: "No." For the sixth consecutive day, Brasilia awakes to an impasse. The government would have lost nothing with the agreement negotiated 23 March. It established that the conversion of salaries for Congress and STF employees would be made on the 30th of each month, without the additional 10.94 percent. This was exactly what the government wanted. All the government had to do was reedit the MP [provisional measure], which creates the URV with some changes clearly establishing that the salaries of all public employees should be converted on the 30th of each month. The change meant admitting an executive branch mistake. The STF, which converted its salaries on the 20th, would have to retreat from its position, but it could argue that it proceeded correctly and that the mistake was made in the original MP. Thus, the judicial branch's autonomy would have been preserved and the issue would have been solved without any more problems. Meeting The proposal to reach an agreement was made the morning of 23 March in the home of Attorney General Aristides Junqueira. The meeting held there was attended by Ministers Cardoso (Finance), Mario Cesar Flores (Strategic Affairs), STF Justices Sepulveda Pertence and Paulo Brossard, and Deputies Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Federal District], and Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers Party-Sao Paulo]. The agreement was founded on a basic fact: The crisis could develop into an institutional confrontation, threatening the development of the democratic system. Everyone present at the meeting presented solutions. FHC said he also favored the agreement, but that it depended on a decision by the president of the Republic. The meeting began at 0930 with the arrival of FHC. Soon afterward, Jobim, Flores, and the two justices who had met earlier arrived to discuss the situation. The rest of the participants arrived soon after. At around 1900, when Congress considered an agreement certain, Minister Cardoso announced that President Franco did not accept the solution. According to the minister, the government will wait for a STF decision on the legality of converting salaries on the 20th. Franco did not want to admit that the PM was written incorrectly. Consequences of the crisis are unpredictable. So far, the conversion of judicial branch salaries was based on an STF administrative decision disregarding the executive branch, which imposed a cut in workers' salaries. The administrative decision may become a court ruling based on suits presented 23 March by the judicial branch labor unions and may become a preliminary court ruling. With this new situation, instead of disregarding a mere STF administrative decision, the executive branch would be disregarding a court ruling, thus establishing an open confrontation between the two government branches.
