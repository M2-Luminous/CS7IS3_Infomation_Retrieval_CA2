W. de Klerk has accused the African National Congress [ANC] of deliberately sidelining the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and its leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. Addressing businessmen in Sandton near Johannesburg on Monday, President de Klerk said this was one of the reasons why the violence in the country could not be halted. The violence, he said, had been largely attributed by the Goldstone Commission to hostility between the ANC and the IFP. He castigated both organisations, saying their leaders could do more to end the violence.
