During their meeting today, the first Russian vice-premier said the "world community pins its hopes on Russia, the United States and NATO for the maintenance of world peace." Soskovets pointed out that the participation of Russian peace-keeping forces in Yugoslavia and Georgia shows that "Russia is making considerable efforts for promoting peace." Besides, Russia is responsible for the protection of borders in Tajikistan, prevention of conflicts in the Caucasus and keeping the situation on Moldova under control, Soskovets added. He drew attention to the fact that Russia, in fact, has been carrying out complex and unilateral conversion practically without any assistance by foreign partners. He pointed out that "the policy of conversion would be continued in accordance with Russia's military doctrine." For his part, the NATO commander said that after the sides had signed the partnership for peace programme, possibilities opened for developing closer contacts. Joulwan said that the Partnership for Peace is "a road with two-way traffic." It is not only Russia that can learn something from NATO, but NATO can take over much of Russia's experience, Joulwan said. "The time has come to work out concrete documents determining the degree of Russia's participation in NATO's programmes," the NATO official said.
