FR941207-1-00012 FR941207-1-00006 Wednesday December 7, 1994 Part III Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Mexican Spotted Owl; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 234␣/␣Wednesday, December 7, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AD02 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Determination of Critical Habitat for the Mexican Spotted Owl AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis lucida ), a subspecies federally listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A total of 1,931,264 hectares (ha) (4,770,223 acres) of critical habitat is proposed. This proposed critical habitat designation, if made final, would provide additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that are funded, authorized, or carried out by any Federal agency. As information is received by the Service from the Indian Tribal Governments, the Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Team (Team), Federal and State agencies, and the general public, revisions may be made to this proposal to incorporate that new information. In addition, section 4 of the Act requires the Service to consider economic impact and any other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size and scope of critical habitat. An economic analysis is currently being prepared and notice of its availability will be published in the Federal Register and local newspapers. DATES: Comments will be accepted until March 7, 1995. The Service will hold public hearings on this proposed rule; dates and specific locations for these hearings will be published in the Federal Register and local newspapers at least 15 days prior to the first hearing. ADDRESSES: The complete administrative record for this rule is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, New Mexico Ecological Services State Office, 2105 Osuna NE., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87113. The complete file for this rule will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Fowler-Propst, State Supervisor, at the above address (505/883&hyph;7877). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Summary of Proposed Action This rule proposes to designate critical habitat on certain lands in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, which now provide habitat or may provide habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, and that are managed for timber harvest. The Team has developed a draft Recovery Plan that identifies commercial timber harvest as the main management regime presenting a threat to Mexican spotted owl habitat. On February 14, 1994, certain environmental groups and an individual filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Arizona against the Department of the Interior for failure to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl. Dr. Robin Silver, et al. v. Bruce Babbit, et al., CIV&hyph;94&hyph;0337&hyph;PHX&hyph;CAM. On October 6, 1994, the Court ordered the Service to, ``publish a proposed designation of critical habitat, including economic exclusion pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1533(b)(2), no later than December 1, 1994, *␣*␣* [and] publish its final designation of critical habitat, following the procedure required by statute and Federal regulations for notice and comment, no later than May 27, 1995.'' The Service plans to review the information which has been assembled and analyzed by the Team as it makes final determination about designation of critical habitat. It is anticipated that the draft recovery plan will be available for public review and comment in December 1994.
