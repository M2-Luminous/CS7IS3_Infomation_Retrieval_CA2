What has changed for you since then? [Scharping] Personally? I work harder and have less free time. [Rosenbaum] And what has changed for the SPD? [Scharping] The SPD has bcome more cohesive and much more determined regarding the elections than one expected 12 months ago. [Rosenbaum] The SPD has also become more uniform, At least that is what the people of the Left are saying. [Scharping] The SPD was and remains a reform-minded party that enjoys debate. In an open society, one can only communicate by presenting clear objectives and arguments, not by issuing orders. [Rosenbaum] Have you already taken the next conflict into consideration? [Scharping] The principles of our policy are clear -- we want a change in politics so that life is more free and safe. For example, we want to see the combating of unemployment and more social justice. We have a government program, which will be adopted at the party congress on 22 June. Perhaps a few minor points in this program will be adjusted at the same time. [Rosenbaum] Such as financial and social policy? The Left is not very happy. [Scharping] We are determined not to raise taxation above the levels planned for 1995. We want a restructuring so that an economic improvement occurs for everyone. We want more than just a rise in foreign demand. For the time being, we in Germany are reaping the fruits of better economic policies in foreign countries while at the same time experiencing a weak rate of economic development and a growth in unemployment. This year, unemployment will have risen by 500,000. [Rosenbaum] Even so, the ruling coalition could take advantage of the first signs of the economic improvement. Are you not afraid of that? [Scharping] No. This is not an economic improvement for everyone. The SPD wants an economic improve for everyone. The SPD's situation tends to improve in line with economic improvement. [Rosenbaum] The Forsa research institute said this week that this is the first time in any election year that Kohl is ahead of Scharping. [Scharpoing] Forsa might say that, but the population thinks differently. That is suggested by many other surveys. The population is cleverer and more careful in its assessments than many propaganda-mongers make out. [Rosenbaum] The ruling chancellor has a major advantage. He has been in office for a long time. He can lay down topics and create results. [Scharping] Well, no one is going to forget the results of 12 years of Kohl -- high unemployment, high debts, major injustice, and no future prospects. What else I do not like about the government is its partially dishonorable and unconstitutional use of government resources for the purpose of propaganda. That is a violation of the judgments of the Constitutional Court. [Rosenbaum] Do you want to copy Clinton, together with his slogan: It's time for a change? [Scharping] Not directly. However, it is certainly no disadvantage that Clinton and I belong to the same generation. [Rosenbaum] The presidential elections are the next appointment in election year, even if the people have no voice. Have you taken steps to prevent the SPD and its supporters from falling into a depression if they fail to win a majority for Johannes Rau. [Scharping] Until I am proved wrong, I assume that the members of the Federal Assembly have enough sovereignty to dispense with parochial party tactics. In any case, as far as the Bundestag deputies are concerned, the election will take place on the basis of the majority relations of 1990, and not, unfortunately, on the basis of the fact that the majority of the German population wants Rau to become president. [Rosenbaum] The FDP [Free Democratic Party] is displaying greater cohesiveness than it did a few weeks ago. Do you still have a chance of entering into a red-green coalition? [Scharping] No. Life experience shows that on election day, 16 October, the SPD will have more partners than it needs. I am also sure that at its party congress, the FDP will speak out in favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], but with the proviso that the electorate must itself create the basis of this support. In clear German, this means: The FDP will watch the results of the elections on the evening of 16 October, and then reconsider its offer. [Rosenbaum] One again hears disappointing tones from the Greens. Ludger Volmer says you are authoritarian and do not want to cooperate with the Greens. [Scharping] Obviously, the Greens are not used to being criticized for their illusionary and unrealistic demands, which include calls for the abolition of the Bundeswehr, the dissolution of NATO, and a gasoline price of 5 German marks [DM] per liter. The Greens will find no partners if they suggest such things. I also find it unfair that the Greens adopted at their party congress a resolution in favor of the closure of all nuclear power stations within the space of two years, a resolution, which, by the way, goes against the express wishes of Joschka Fischer. It would take much longer to close the nuclear power stations and will cost about DM200 billion. The Greens make no mention of that. [Rosenbaum] The European elections are ahead of us. Lafontaine has said we have paid too much into the EU's coffers. What do you say to that? [Scharping] He meant we have paid more than necessary. Here we are dealing with the extreme carelessness of Messrs Waigel and Kohl who, in 1993, in full knowledge of the fact that Germany is no longer in second place on the European prosperity table, but in seventh place, decided on a disproportionately high level of payments to the EU. In addition, we are paying over DM1 billion per year for Great Britain's rebate. This must be changed. To compensate, Lafontaine has called for higher influxes of EU funds to Germany. [Rosenbaum] The old parties seem rather helpless in the face of the Democratic Socialist Party's [PDS] success in eastern Germany. Should the SPD not realize that as a left-wing people's party, it obviously cannot prevent this development? [Scharping] We are going to be by far the strongest party in eastern Germany, but I must admit that the government's policies have directly contributed to the PDS's increased strength. But whoever votes for the PDS out of anger for Kohl and his empty promises is indirectly strengthening the CDU, for every vote for the PDS is a vote against the formation of a new government. Therefore we are firmly against the PDS as the direct descendant of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. But we are not against the PDS' voters. We want to have them for ourselves. [Rosenbaum] Is there a clear no at all levels to cooperation with the PDS? [Scharping] Yes. The PDS is a clear political opponent not only in daily matters, but also in political convictions.
