Subpart A_Revenues Crediting Criteria ยง403.110 Direct or front-end credit requirements. Direct or front-end credit will be applied only to those revenues cited in the Second Deficiency Appropriation Act for 1924 (Fact Finder's Act), Subsection I. (a) Contract provisions prior to 1938, or specific project legislation. To be eligible to receive front-end credit, a water user or district must show that an existing contract had invoked valid Subsection I revenue provisions prior to 1938, or legislation specific to the project allowed for the direct crediting of some or all incidental revenues. (b) Reclamation actions regarding direct (front-end) crediting of revenues. Effective January 1, 1994, Reclamation discontinued all unauthorized direct (front-end) crediting of revenues. Provisions in current contracts between water users or districts and Reclamation purporting to allow direct (front-end) crediting unauthorized by law are unenforceable and will not be honored. Reclamation will notify directly all water users or districts affected by this subsection and will provide information concerning rights of appeal.
