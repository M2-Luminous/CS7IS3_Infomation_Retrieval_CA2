FR941110-1-00033 FR941110-1-00007 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;300365; FRL&hyph;4917&hyph;9] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, 2-(2'-Hydroxy-5'-Methylphenyl)Benzotriazole and Octadecyl 3,5-Di-Tert-Butyl-4-Hydroxyhydrocinnamate; Tolerance Exemptions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes that an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established for residues of FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake (CAS Reg. No. 15790-07-5), 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole (CAS Reg. No. 2440-22-4), and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (CAS Reg. No. 2082-79-3) when used as inert ingredients (components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices) in pesticide formulations applied to animals. Y-Tex Corp. requested this proposed regulation. DATES: Comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300365], must be received on or before December 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Kerry B. Leifer, Registration Support Branch, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8323. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big Horn Ave., Cody, WY 82414, submitted a pesticide petition to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 900318-3), FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake (CAS Reg. No. 15790-07-5), 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole (CAS Reg. No. 244022-4), and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as inert ingredients (components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices) in pesticide formulations applied to animals. In the Federal Register of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), EPA proposed such exemptions. One comment was received in response to the proposal. The commenter claimed that among the bases for approval of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer was an erroneous interpretation of the results of a risk assessment conducted on acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Agency agreed with the commenter and, based upon additional information, reproposed the exemption for acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer in the Federal Register of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38151). No comments were received in response to the February 3, 1989 proposal on the tolerance exemptions for residues of the other three substances, FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole, and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate. However, because of the length of time that has elapsed since the original proposal, EPA is reproposing the exemption for FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole, and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate . Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300365]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: October 26, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 180 be amended as follows: Part 180_[Amended] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. Section 180.1001(e) is amended in the table therein by adding and alphabetically inserting the inert ingredients, to read as follows: §180.1001 Exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance. *␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣*␣␣␣␣* (e) *␣*␣* ␣ 1Inert ingredients 1Limits 1Uses ␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ *␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣ * FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake (CAS Reg.
