As DIENA already reported, W. Christopher had pointed out in his statement that, in his opinion, Russia can undertake activities aimed "at stimulating Latvians" in the direction of broadening the circle of citizens and granting voting rights to the Russians residing in Latvia. During today's conversation, G. Andrejevs expressed his incomprehension and anxiety over such utterances from a high-level American official. In his reply, I. Silins explained that they refer entirely to the inhabitants of Latvia who are Russians by nationality. He also said that Mr. Christopher meant for lawful and democratic methods to be used by Latvia's Russians in persuading Latvians to take their interests into account. Summarizing, I. Silins emphasized that the principal policy of the United States toward Latvia has not changed.
