Sergey Lomako, chief of the Tver radio and television broadcasting center, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "Like our colleagues in other Russian towns, we have also gone off the air because we are not fully satisfied with the government decision regarding our demands. To date, the television companies owe us 310 million rubles. Primarily they are Ostankino and the Second Channel. We will be broadcasting Tver television programs because the local company settles payments with us properly. We await a clear decision from the government." The communication workers of Kostroma warned of an imminent strike yesterday. Although the information on talks at the government brought some reassurance, broadcasts were cut. Communication workers refused to give any interviews, saying they were too busy. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the Belgorod radio and television broadcasting center that the relaying of television programs from Moscow had been halted because of arrears for the work of radio and television transmitters. The debt exceeds 200 million rubles.
