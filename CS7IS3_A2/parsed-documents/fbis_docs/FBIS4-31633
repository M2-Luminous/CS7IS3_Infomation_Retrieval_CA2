Here is what he said in a recent interview to the newspaper REPUBLIKA: "President Clinton and his administration will not tolerate conflicts or any Serbian aggression against Kosova." We would like to ask Mr. Rugova: What does he mean by aggression against Kosova, when the virtual aggression against Kosova that was perpetrated long ago in this area still mercilessly continues? Is it not aggression when your schools are closed, your university is closed, you are dismissed from your job, your academy is shut down, and your newspapers, radio and television stations, etc., are closed? Is it not aggression when the Serbian police, armed to the teeth, conduct house-to-house searches, terrorizing the Kosovars, beating them up and torturing them without the slightest mercy? Finally, is it not aggression when Serbian tanks and guns are patrolling the roads of Kosova towns? It is difficult to admit, Mr. Rugova, that the U.S. Administration knows nothing about these things. It is also very difficult to say that this Administration does not know what aggression means. Should we perhaps expect the criminal Arkan to put into practice his plan of ejecting 700,000 Kosovars from their homeland? It seems to us that in his recent interview, Mr. Rugova tried to conceal something. When Mrs. Edlira Bucpapaj asked the honorable Mr. Rugova about Douglas Hogg's visit to Prishtina, he failed to mention that Mr. Hogg called Kosova "Serbian territory." Thus, the U.S. Administration is waiting for the Serbs to carry out aggression against Kosova when the Serbs are already there, and Britain's Mr. Hogg argues that "Kosova must be viewed as Serbian territory." The following question then arises: What should the Kosovars do? Should they plead with the Serbs for mercy?
