He said: The publication and distribution of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is a major event in the political life of all party members and all nationalities of people in the country. This book touches upon all the fields of politics, economy, science, culture, education, military affairs, and foreign affairs, and outlines the basic viewpoints of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. A red thread running through this book is the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. This is precisely the quintessence and soul of our theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At present, grasping ideological line and answering practical questions is a key issue that should be truly grasped by cadres and the masses of all nationalities in the region in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has expounded an important viewpoint in the first place, that is, China must take its own way in developing itself and must build a socialism with its own characteristics. This simple and clear exposition has grasped the essence of the development road of Chinese socialism. This book has an extremely far-reaching significance in theory and practice, has straighten out the tendency of deviating from reality in the road of building and developing socialism, has answered the doubts, misgivings, and censures from both of the "left" and right fields, and has opened up the sole correct road for our socialist modernization drive. Comrade Wang Qun said: When stressing on "taking our own road," we should on no account reject opening up. On the contrary, we should all the more strengthen opening up and use as reference and absorb all excellent scientific and cultural achievements in the world. Without opening up, we cannot achieve success in "taking our own road" and in building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. When stressing on "taking our own road," the only correct method is to "boldly try everything and go ahead" to open up the new road of our own in the places without roads. He stressed: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed the necessity of "upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years." It is the most important "political assignment" given by Comrade Xiaoping to all comrades of the party and will be the most important issue of practice our party and country will face in the next scores of years. Only by constantly and unswervingly upholding this basic line can we firmly grasp the correct course and can we cope with a myriad changes by remaining unchanged. Upholding the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years is not only a correct conclusion discovered by our party from the bitter historical experience but also the summary of the experiences gained by our country from the tremendous achievements in reform and opening up over the past 15 years. It is internally related with our strategic goal of marching forward in three steps and is an important guarantee for the success in all items of our work. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in line with the reality of the region: In the system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the issue of development is a major proposition being on the central position. The key issue of the party's basic line is precisely the issue of economic development and the key issue of the nationalities work is also the issue of development. Therefore, a major issue facing the people of all nationalities in the region is to seize the opportunity and accelerate development. It is not only an economic issue but also a political issue. Over the past 40 years or so since the founding of Inner Mongolia, particularly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, the economy and society have developed very rapidly, achievements have been tremendous, a new situation characterized with developed economy, flourishing culture and harmonious relationship among different nationalities has emerged, and, what is more gratifying, a road of developing the economy and society has been found gradually. It should be noted, however, that we still lag behind some developed coastal areas, and we cannot expect to catch up with developed areas in a short period of time. However, we have the aspirations of exploiting our own advantages through reform and opening up and through the arduous struggle of all people, and have the aspirations of making full use of the advantages and favorable conditions in the fields of natural resources, geology, and policies to accelerate the growth rate and improve the efficiency in order to realize the magnificent goal of "joining the forefront" that was set forth by Comrade Xiaoping. Comrade Wang Qun pointed out at conclusion: Whether a leader can always uphold the party's basic line is the practical criterion to judge his leading ability and political awareness, not only his ideological ability, problem-solving ability but also his party style, work style, and political character. To raise the theoretical level of the vast numbers of cadres through the study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, all leaders are required to embrace the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and the spirit of dealing with concrete matters relating to work, to learn to dialectically analyze and solve problems, to overcome lopsidedness and absolutism, to create a kind of enterprising spirit and risk-taking sense, and to actually give consideration to the interests of the people in order to constantly push the region's socialist modernization drive to a new stage. Comrade Qian Fenyong presided over the semester-opening ceremony. Wang Zhan, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the ceremony. Also attending the ceremony were leading cadres of various major leading bodies, responsible persons of various democratic parties, and responsible comrades of various departments and units directly under the provincial authorities.
