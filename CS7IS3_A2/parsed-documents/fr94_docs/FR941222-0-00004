FR941222-0-00004 FR941222-0-00001 One commenter stated that the anatomical reference point specified for location of the brand on the hip_between the fourth to seventh coccygeal vertebrae_is on the moveable part of the tail and could not accommodate a 2- to 3-inch brand. Although the regulatory text of the proposed rule called for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M x '' mark on the ``right hip, high on the tailhead,'' the anatomical reference point specified for the placement of the mark was, as pointed out by the commenter, incorrect. To remedy that error, we have changed the specific anatomical reference point to ``over the junction of the sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae'' in the regulatory text of this final rule. Another commenter stated that the specified area is concave on thin cattle, which would result in incomplete, unreadable brands on such cattle. We do not believe that the concavity of the area near the tailhead on most cattle would be pronounced enough to result in an appreciable number of unreadable brands. Additionally, if an animal were to be offered for importation with an unreadable ``M'' or ``M x '' mark, that animal would be refused entry. One commenter stated that the placement of the brand on the hip would make it possible for a person to modify the brand by, for example, branding an additional line or symbol close to the ``M'' or ``M x ''; having done that, the person could attempt to portray the modified brand as an ownership brand in order to disguise the animal's Mexican origin. Certainly an ``M'' or ``M x '' mark could be altered, just as any private or regulatory brand could be altered. However, because we are requiring that the ``M'' or ``M x '' mark be placed in a specific location that is not likely to be used for marking by private entities, we do not believe that the commenter's concerns will be a problem. As mentioned above, the ``S'' brands applied to brucellosis-exposed cattle under the regulations in 9 CFR part 78 are placed in the same location near the tailhead as the ``M'' and ``M x '' marks are to be placed, and we are unaware of any attempts to modify those ``S'' brands during the 11 years they have been used. Additionally, we believe that State brand registries and State animal identification regulations will help to discourage persons from taking the actions envisioned by the commenter. We have, therefore, made no changes in this final rule as a result of that comment. One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include intact Mexican cattle because such cattle are often integrated into domestic herds for breeding purposes, thus heightening the potential for the Mexican-origin cattle to expose domestic cattle to disease. As we explained in the proposed rule, we believe that the small number of intact cattle imported into the United States from Mexico each year, plus the fact that the interstate movement of intact cattle is regulated under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78, make it significantly easier for APHIS to trace the movement of Mexican-origin intact cattle following their entry into the United States. Therefore, we do not believe that it is necessary to permanently identify such cattle as being of Mexican origin. One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include cattle imported from Mexico in bond for feeding and return to Mexico under ยง92.427(e) of the regulations because such cattle are not always returned to Mexico since the U.S. Customs Service stopped collecting the bond as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. We are aware of the potential problems with the in-bond program and are currently reconsidering the regulations governing the program. We do not, however, believe that expanding the marking requirements to include in-bond cattle is necessary at this time. If, at some point, we determine that such a change is necessary, the change would be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking. Two commenters pointed out that APHIS currently has two proposed rules that have not yet been finalized that would render most M-branding unnecessary. The first proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 23810&hyph;23817, Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), would establish comprehensive quarantine and surveillance requirements for Mexican cattle offered for importation into the United States. The second proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59959&hyph;59962, Docket No. 93&hyph;084&hyph;1), would require the individual identification on a health certificate of imported Mexican-origin cattle being moved interstate. The commenters noted that the quarantine measures, movement restrictions, and documentation requirements contained in those proposed rules are similar to the restrictions currently placed on cattle imported from Mexico for slaughter in accordance with ยง92.429 of the regulations or in bond for temporary entry in accordance with ยง92.427(e) of the regulations. The commenters argued that if APHIS believes that it is not necessary to brand in-bond and immediate slaughter cattle, then it should not be necessary to brand Mexican cattle affected by the two proposed rules. Both of the proposed rules mentioned by the commenter are still being considered by APHIS and have not been finalized. Because the provisions of those two proposals have not been promulgated in final regulations, they have no regulatory effect; we cannot make any changes in this final rule that are based on the provisions of other proposed regulations. However, a similar comment was received in response to the May 1994 proposed rule mentioned above (Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), so the suggestion of exemptions from the branding requirement for cattle affected by the provisions of that proposed rule will be considered and discussed in any final rulemaking related to that proposed rule. One commenter stated that branding is unnecessary because the official Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) blue eartag required by the regulations in ยง92.427(d) can be used to identify Mexican-origin cattle. We agree that the blue SARH eartag is an important identification tool, but we remain concerned that eartags can be lost or removed. With the an ``M'' or ``M x '' mark present, we could still determine an animal's country of origin if its eartag were lost or removed. Additionally, we believe that it is less likely that someone would remove the SARH tag from an ``M'' or ``M x '' marked animal in an attempt to conceal the animal's Mexican origin, so the SARH tag, with its value as a traceback tool, is more likely to remain on the animal. Some commenters stated that because APHIS has acknowledged that freeze branding can be used to identify cattle imported from Mexico, APHIS should respond to the public opposition to hot-iron branding by prohibiting hot-iron branding and requiring the use of freeze branding. Similarly, another commenter felt that freeze branding should be the standard identification method and hot-iron branding should be allowed only if the exporter has submitted a written justification for using hot-iron branding. Although we acknowledge that freeze branding can work as a means of identifying cattle imported from Mexico, we also recognize that freeze branding has its limitations. First, a freeze brand takes 18 to 21 days to become visible, and there may be some exporters of cattle for whom branding that far in advance of offering their cattle for entry into the United States is not a viable option. Second, freeze brands are not visible on white or light-colored hair, and there will certainly be cattle offered for importation that have white or light-colored hair at the location specified for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M x '' mark. Because APHIS will not allow cattle with unreadable brands into the United States, requiring the use of freeze branding would have the effect of prohibiting the importation of certain cattle based on their coloring. Therefore, we believe that hot-iron branding should remain an option for exporters of cattle from Mexico. Another commenter stated that freeze branding will not be an effective means of identifying Mexican-origin cattle because so many of those cattle have light-colored hair or white spots. As discussed above, we acknowledge that freeze branding is not going to be an option for all cattle in all cases. The regulations require a distinct, permanent, and legible ``M'' or ``M x '' mark on certain cattle offered for entry; we believe that it is reasonable to expect that the exporter of the cattle will keep that requirement, as well as the advantages and limitations of hot-iron branding and freeze branding, in mind when selecting a marking method.
