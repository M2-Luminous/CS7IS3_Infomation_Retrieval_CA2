The bulk of this was surgical equipment and medicine. This was emergency assistance to the two-headed government's raiding forces, who have been engaged in major military operations especially at Anlung Veng and have suffered heavy casualties. Their many wounded are being treated at all the hospitals. The United States must stop interfering in Cambodia and desist from continuing to kindle the communist Vietnamese war of aggression in Cambodia. Which is more beneficial: kindling the flames of war or letting Cambodians achieve national conciliation? The Cambodian people need national conciliation. They are resolutely opposed to all forms of aggressive war, wherever they may come from.
