McMullan told reporters after meeting here with Minister of Trade Satrio Budiarjo Judono that over recent years, Australian investment in Indonesia has sharply increased due to the more conducive investment climate which has rapidly deved. He also said the trade relationship between the two countries has been overwhelmingly harmonious and successful. "Our Prime Minister (Paul Keating) said there is no country whose bilateral relationship is more important to Australia than our relationship with Indonesia," McMullan remarked. He acknowledged, however, that disagreements between the two countries have occurred at times. "But we have a history of a close cooperative trade relationship. We have had a decade of rapidly growing bilateral trade and we see it continuing to grow," said McMullan, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit. Responding to questions on his meeting with Judono, McMullan said talks in the meeting focussed mainly on how to continue to open up economies of both countries, make them more competitive and win more business in each country. "We also discussed how to work together in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and how to take full advantage of the competitiveness the two countries have created," he said. McMullan said he had invited several ministers, including Minister Judono, to visit Australia. After making a courtesy call on President Suharto earlier yesterday, McMullan said he sees good opportunities for Australian finance, insurance, legal and accounting services in Indonesia. Other fields in which he found potential for development by Australian investors are mining and food processing. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, bilateral trade between Australia and Indonesia sharply increased from US$871.7 million in 1988 to $2.15 billion in 1992. Australia enjoyed a trade surplus of $666.8 million from its exports of $1.4 billion to Indonesia in 1992, while its imports from Indonesia reached only $746.1 million. During the first 11 months of last year, the two-way trade reached $1.96 billion. In 1992, Australia was Indonesia's 11th largest export market. Its imports from Indonesia included synthetic fiber, shoes, wood products, rattan, textiles, coffee and rubber products.
