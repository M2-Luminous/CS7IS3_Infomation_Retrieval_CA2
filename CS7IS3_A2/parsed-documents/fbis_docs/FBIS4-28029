Perez] [Text] Davao City -- The Davao City Government, in coordination with the Private Investments and Trade Opportunities-Philippines (PITO-P), has identified the list of preferred investment areas (PIAs) to further lure local and foreign businessmen to the area. BUSINESS WORLD learned PIAs included under the "Invest in Davao" project are classified into five major groupings, namely, agri-business, tourism and recreation, manufacturing and assembly, transshipment infrastructure, and property development. The Invest in Davao project is a short-term (three years) development scheme for the city. It has a fund of P37 million [Philippine pesos] of which P20 million was pledged by the city government and P17 million from PITO-P. The Service Group, a Washington-based consultancy group, was also used to conduct the study or assessment on the investment climate in Davao. Being the biggest producer of agricultural products, a reason Davao was dubbed as the "Fruit Basket of the Philippines," the city plays an important role in enhancing the agri-based industry. Agri-business development in the area focuses on fruit processing using dehydration, vacuum or spray technologies, and canned specialty vegetables. The potential is large for the agriculture and agri-based industries in Davao and in the whole of Mindanao due to the relatively favorable climate throughout the year, available skilled and professional manpower supply, high literacy rate, and low cost of labor. Davao City's role as the regional commercial center will be boosted anew with Mindanao gearing up to become one of Asia's tourist destinations. Records show that within six years, tourist arrivals in Davao jumped to 193,000 last year from 150,000 in 1987, a reason to develop international standard hotels and beach resorts, sports complexes, recreational facilities such as golf courses, and marine/wildlife parks. The manufacturing sector earmarks potential investment areas in garments, footwear, toys, bulky kitchen and house wares, among others. There is also a need to invest in common and bonded warehouses to support agricultural productivity. Roberto Arquiza, Invest in Davao assistant project manager, told BUSINESS WORLD there is a need to develop the manufacturing industry in Davao. "In spite of the rapid progress of the area (Davao), most of the goods are still coming from Manila," he said. Councilor Aristeo Albay, chairman of the city council urban planning and development committee, added, "It's about time that Davao develop its manufacturing industry so that it will be less dependent from Manila." In terms of transshipment infrastructure, there are seven private piers operating in Davao. Four investors (two Filipino shippers, a Greek firm, and a British company) have also shown interest to set up shipping operations in Davao. The Greek shipping company, Hellenic Shipyard of Perama S.A., is also planning to improve the maritime school by upgrading the teaching facilities. With the rise in industries and business activities in Davao City, investments are needed to finance the construction of more commercial office buildings, residential villages, industrial estates, and convention/seminar centers. As a come-on for prospective investors, the city government included in the investment priority plan provisions for fiscal and non-fiscal incentives. These privileges are in addition to incentives granted by law and the Local Government Code. The incentives provide that a new enterprise will be fully exempt from mayor's permit fees, building permit fees, and local business tax imposed by city ordinances. The incentives are good for two years from the start of commercial operation. There will also be tax reductions in the gross sales or receipts taxable base for a given period after a tax holiday. Deductions The following deductions for business sales taxes will be allowed as deductions from gross receipts during the preceding calendar year for three years starting from the date of registration: -- a non-cumulative operating loss equivalent to 25 percent of losses of the preceding year as indicated in the financial statement submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue; -- 20 percent of expenditures from annual wages paid to newly hired employees who are residents of Davao City; -- 25 percent of expenditures on infrastructure and/or facilities built by investors which are accessible to and used by the public; and, -- 25 percent of expenditures on human resource/skills training based on a training program. There are also incentives on real property tax (RPT) such as tax exemption for two years from the start of commercial operation, reduced RPT rates for new investors for two years, and two-year exemption on machinery and equipment used for pollution control.
