[sentence as published] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance]-Soldiers of the Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) raised the issue of continued detention of six soldiers who participated in the series of coups against the Aquino administration. The RAM-SFP-YOU also brought up the continued attrition of soldiers identified with RAM-SFP-YOU. Navy Capt. Danilo Lim, RAM- SFP-YOU spokesperson, said many active soldiers were removed from service on the basis of their involvement with the reform group. Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, head of RAM-SFP-YOU panel, said the preliminary agreement signed by the two panels in December 1992 provided for the release of all detainees who participated in the military rebellion. But to date, six of the soldiers remain behind bars. However, the government panel said the release of six is not for the panel to decide but should be left to "judicial discretion." Of the six soldiers, two were charged with illegal possession of firearms and four were detained on orders by trial court judges where their respective cases are pending. "The matter of continued detention of these soldiers should be left to judicial discretion. The government will not interpose any objection should bail be applied for," Mr. Alfredo Tadiar, head of the government panel, said. On the other issue, Mr. Tadiar said government gave the military rebels last week its policy on attrition for study and evaluation. The RAM-SFP-YOU said the policy on attrition failed to cover all soldiers affected. "Ang attrition policy na pinalabas ng Armed Forces ay hindi na-cover ang iba pa naming kasamahan na apektado ng attrition. Ang hinihiling namin ay i-apply ito equally sa lahat ng aming kasamahan [The attrition policy issued by the Armed Forces does not cover other members affected by attrition. What we demand is that this should be applied equally to all our members]," Mr. Abenina said. The attrition policy was prepared by Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia and studied by National Defense Secretary Renato de Villa before it was signed by President Ramos. "Ang implication nito [The implication of this is that], because it has already been signed by the President, hindi na maiibalik ang mga kasama namin na natanggal sa tungkulin [our members dismissed from duty will not be reinstated]," Mr. Lim said. The RAM-SFP-YOU voiced discontent over the explanations given by the government panel but reiterated earlier statements that they will not pull out from talks. Despite heated arguments on various differences in opinion, the head of the government panel remained optimistic. "We have promised each other that we will not give up the peace process," Mr. Tadiar said.
