FR940429-0-00118 FR940429-0-00012 While the Secretary understands the concerns of some of the commenters that States might develop standards without regard to institutional mission or that enforcement of quantified standards could either force institutions away from serving high-risk students, or allow some institutions that would otherwise be judged to be substandard under other measures to escape State oversight, the Secretary believes that quantitative student outcome standards are an extremely valuable measure of the success of an institution. Quite the contrary to the views of the commenters, the Secretary believes that the imposition of quantifiable standards will have the effect of improving institutional quality and will protect high-risk students from unscrupulous substandard institutions. Further, quantifiable standards will assist prospective students and their parents in making choices about attendance at institutions. The Secretary further notes there is nothing in this part that would preclude a State from taking into account the fact that an institution serves high-risk students. Changes: No changes were made regarding the quantifiable standards in ยง667.21(a)(17). However, the reader is referred to the discussion under the heading ``Relationship between tuition-and-fee charges and remuneration'' for information regarding changes made to the standard described in ยง667.21(a)(9). Different Standards for Different Types of Institutions Comments: Many commenters writing on behalf of proprietary institutions objected strongly to the proposal to allow a State to develop different standards for different types or categories of institutions. These commenters argued that Congress intended that all institutions be judged under the same standards, except as explicitly provided in the statute. Many other commenters agreed strongly with the proposal. A number of these commenters urged the Secretary to require, not simply allow, States to develop different standards for different types of institutions to ensure that all SPREs take into consideration the nature and mission of institutions. Several comments urged the Secretary to allow States to develop different standards only for different categories of institutions to protect institutions from being placed in arbitrary categories by States and to promote nationwide consistency in identifying categories. The commenters recommended that institutions be categorized according to (1) their for- or not-for-profit status, (2) whether they grant degrees, and (3) the levels and types of degrees or educational programs they offer. Discussion: The Secretary believes that State standards should reflect the mission of institutions and that enforcement of such standards will allow SPREs to accomplish most effectively the purpose of the SPRP. The fact that the SPRP is a program designed to strengthen the State role in the program integrity triad means that the program is intended to foster the flexibility that inevitably results from differences among the States. The Secretary reiterates that States are provided flexibility in developing standards. Thus, a State may categorize institutions or educational programs in a manner that the State deems appropriate. Changes: None. Regular Students Comments: Commenters generally agreed that a State's standards should be applied only to regular students at institutions. A few commenters opined that quantified standards would be misleading and irrelevant to institutions that offer open admissions because many students who attend those institutions do not aspire to attain a certificate or a degree, yet have a specific educational goal. Discussion: The Secretary believes that in evaluating student outcomes of an institution, and most particularly with regard to institutions offering open enrollment, the evaluation should be based on regular students because they are the ones who can qualify for title IV, HEA funds, the protection of which is one of the primary purposes of SPRP. Changes: None. Comparable Title IV, HEA Program Standard as an Acceptable State Standard Comments: Several commenters objected to the proposal to require a SPRE to consider the relevance of a title IV, HEA program standard as a requirement in establishing the State's standards. The commenters believed that acceptance of Federal standards, and application of those standards, by a SPRE would have an adverse effect on institutions at which a small percentage of students receive assistance under the title IV, HEA programs. Several other commenters believed the proposal is a reasonable approach because institutions that participate in the title IV, HEA programs already have to comply with these standards. Several other commenters believed that this provisions should be expanded to require a SPRE to adopt comparable State licensure standards if those standards are more rigorous than comparable title IV, HEA program standards. The commenters argued that if a SPRE adopts review standards that are less rigorous than the State licensing standards, institutions might later argue persuasively to the State legislature to reduce the State licensing standards to the level of lower SPRE standards on the grounds that varying standards would be onerous and confusing. At the very least, these commenters suggested that the Secretary require States to establish standards that are at least as rigorous as the comparable title IV, HEA program standards. Discussion: The Secretary is giving SPREs latitude to develop standards and expects States to take into account comparable title IV, HEA program standards as they develop their own standards. The Secretary does not agree that this program will have an adverse impact on institutions at which only a few students receive title IV, HEA program assistance (1) because the SPRP only requires a SPRE to establish standards for referred institutions, and (2) because any standard that a SPRE establishes that is comparable to a title IV, HEA program requirement already applies to those institutions as title IV, HEA program participants. The Secretary agrees, however, with the commenters who noted that it does not make sense for a State to adopt standards under the SPRP that are weaker than its State licensing standards. Nevertheless, this is a matter that must be resolved among the appropriate State authorities. Changes: None Records and Information an Institution Must maintain to Demonstrate to SPRE its Compliance With the State's Standards Comments: Many commenters strongly urged the Secretary to make clear in the final regulations that a SPRE may not require an institution that has not been referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review to maintain these records and information. A number of these commenters suggested if that institution is later referred by the Secretary to the SPRE for review, the SPRE should be required to assist the institution in generating the required information, or that the SPRE should be required to allow the institution a reasonable time to comply with the State's standards and recordkeeping requirements. Discussion: If an institution is referred to a State for review under the SPRP, the institution must satisfy the State's standards. If the institution was not otherwise required to keep records relating to its compliance with State Standards, and it did not keep those records, the Secretary agrees that the State should allow an institution a reasonable period of time to obtain records and information to enable the institution to demonstrate its compliance with the State's standards.
