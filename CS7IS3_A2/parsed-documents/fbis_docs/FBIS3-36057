The assembly suggests that the forum work out a program for joint action under the motto, "For healing the society, against nationalism, interethnic animosity and moral degradation." "The seemingly eradicated fascism is again raising its head, sometimes under the guise of false liberalism, sometimes hiding behind patriotic slogans, and sometimes even quite openly," the assembly said in a statement adopted at its Jan. 29 session. "Not to notice it is dangerous; not to take action, criminal." The assembly calls on all Estonian social and political forces to aim their efforts at stabilizing the society, improving interethnic relations and "guaranteeing human rights in reality."
