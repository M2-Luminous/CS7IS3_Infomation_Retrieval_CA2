Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations Jose Perez Novoa told the UN Human Rights Committee that the U.S. occupation of Guantanamo against the will of Cuba is one more example of the denial of that right. Novoa spoke a second time today to express his position on point nine of the agenda, that is, free determination and its application to nations submitted to colonial domination or foreign occupation.
