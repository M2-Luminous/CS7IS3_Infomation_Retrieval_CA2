Recalling that the indiscreet crackdown upon the peaceful demonstrators by the combat police touched off the anger of peasants and students and led them to counterattack, Chonnong said the puppet government authorities were to blame for the collision in the demonstration of peasants and students against the agricultural market opening. Chonnong warned that if the authorities countered a future demonstration of peasants by force, it would respond with a corresponding stiff struggle.
