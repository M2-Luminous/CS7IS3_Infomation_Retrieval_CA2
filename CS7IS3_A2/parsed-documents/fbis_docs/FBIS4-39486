FBIS4-39486 "drsov110_e_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Joint Stock Company With Russia To Expand Gas Pipeline Joint Stock Company With Russia To Expand Gas Pipeline WS0806070894 Kiev UKRINFORM in English 0529 GMT 7 Jun 94 WS0806070894 Kiev UKRINFORM English BFN [From the "Business News Weekly" feature, May 30-Jun 5 94] [Text] A Russo-Ukrainian joint stock society expected to be set up in late 1994 to expand Ukraine's transit gas pipeline network. A tentative agreement to the above effect was reached as a result of negotiations in Kiev on 1-3 June involving Russia's Gazprom and the Ukrgazprom. The decision is probably in perfect harmony with the Russian Gazprom joint-stock society's strategic program dubbed "Highly Reliable Pipe-Line Transport," which was discussed in Moscow in March with active participation of Ukrainian experts including academician Boris Paton himself, president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the world's top-notch authority in the domain of arc welding. Mr. Paton has been personally supervising the program's major section, which involves anti-corrosion agents and corrosion-resistant equipment (see UBN no. 14/1994). In the meantime, on 27 April 1994, the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas made a decision to set up the Ukrgazprom (Ukrainian Gas Industry) joint-stock society, by way of an experiment, based on the existent Ukrgazpromstroi (Ukrainian Gas Industry Construction) and as the latter's affiliate, through a merger of the industry's construction enterprises in East Ukraine. Obviously enough, Ukraine's jurisdiction over a part of the former USSR's integral gas pipe-line system does not relieve Russia, as the world's major natural gas exporter, from the burden of troubles involved in maintaining the gas piping system's technical standards and its improvement and expansion. Russia's lawmakers continue hearings involving a law on pipe-line transport, which reportedly has triggered considerable controversy among the interested parties. Russia's strategic program was drafted and basically approved by the former USSR's government back in 1991. Its practical implementation started a year later. However, after the USSR's disintegration, it was approved by both the Russian and Ukrainian governments on an governmental basis, though its financing by the Ukrainian party virtually discontinued, despite the fact that Ukraine accounts for the bulk of theoretical, R&D and feasibility studies involved in the program. Nonetheless, Ukraine intends to finalize and implement on its own a national program, which has been dubbed Ukraine's Highly Reliably Pipe-Line Transport, and which is based on recent intergovernmental agreements. The CIS's major pipe-line system is 220,000 km.-long. Its compressor stations' aggregate capacity is estimated at 50 million kW. According to Russia's Gazprom, 138,000 km.-long. pipe-lines are presently operational Russia-wide. Major pipe-lines' wear and tear status poses as a major environmental threat with 25 per cent of pipe-lines having been operational for over two decades, 5 per cent for over the critical 33 year period, and 38 per cent for periods between one and two decades, and thus in bad need of repair and reconstruction. According to the Ukrainian State Committee for oil and gas, Ukraine's 35,800 km.-long pipe-lines are operational. Besides, the Druzhba (Friendship) and Samara petroleum export pipe-line systems are located in Ukraine, plus 70,000 km.-long pipe-lines of Ukraine's domestic distribution system and about 5,000 km.-long petroleum and product pipe-lines (a total of five systems including two exclusively export ones). Ukraine's 14 gas pipe-lines can transport 266 b. cu. m. of natural gas a year. According to experts with the Ukrainian Research Institute for gas piping, Ukraine's national major pipe-line network does not require any sizable expansion. However, its domestic distribution system and major pipe-lines' branches should be developed to stabilize natural gas supplies primarily to Ukraine's three large industrial regions, to wit, the Kharkov, Donetsk and Transdnieprian regions. Besides, the existent network is not an integrated system, which would allow to optimally and efficiently redistribute fuel flows both within Ukraine and intended for exports. Experts with the Ukrainian oil and gas industry are currently drafting feasibility studies and relevant legislative acts for the Ukrainian Pipe-Line Transport project.
