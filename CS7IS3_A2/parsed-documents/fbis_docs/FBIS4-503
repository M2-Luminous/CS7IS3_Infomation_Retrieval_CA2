An announcement expected on Tuesday [12 April] will increase the daily payment to police on active duty from R22.50 [rand] to R61.50 -- equal to the total allowances granted to National Peacekeeping Force members. A police general said a top-level decision to back the SA [South African] Police Union appeal to the TEC for substantial increases in pay between the ranks of constable and colonel was made on Friday. A memo signed by Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe late on Friday supporting the daily allowance increase is expected to be distributed in the force tomorrow.
