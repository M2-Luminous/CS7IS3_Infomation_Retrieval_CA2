FR941206-0-00061 FR941206-0-00010 38 CFR Part 3 RIN 2900&hyph;AG74 Dependents' Educational Assistance; Certification AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) adjudication regulations concerning eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) in cases where it has been established that a veteran has a permanent and total service-connected disability. This action conforms the regulations to a decision of the Court of Veterans Appeals which held that entitlement to DEA may be established in such cases where the disabilities are of paired organs or extremities that are treated as service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160. Section 1160 provides that the combination of service-connected disability of one organ or extremity and nonservice-connected disability of the respective paired organ or extremity is treated as if the combination of disabilities is the result of service-connected disability. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective December 6, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) Program, established under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, authorizes monetary educational benefits to a qualifying spouse or child, or surviving spouse or child, of a veteran whose death or permanent and total disability was due to military service. 38 CFR 3.807 provides that a spouse or child of a veteran has basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits if the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability. The surviving spouse or child of a deceased veteran has basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits if a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death or the veteran died of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. 1160 provides that where a veteran has suffered service-connected loss of use of an eye, kidney, ear, hand, foot, or lung and nonservice-connected loss of use of the paired eye, kidney, ear, hand, foot, or lung, the veteran shall be paid compensation as if the combination of disabilities were the result of service-connected disability. 38 CFR 3.383 is the corresponding regulation. In Precedent Opinion 75&hyph;90 dated July 18, 1990, the VA General Counsel held that Chapter 35 eligibility is not established where a disability of paired organs treated as if service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160 for purposes of disability compensation is evaluated as permanently and totally disabling. The General Counsel reasoned that the threshold criterion for DEA eligibility is total service-connected disability and stated that this criterion is not satisfied where permanent and total disability is based on the ``as if service-connected'' status established under 38 U.S.C. 1160. In a recent decision ( Kimberlin v. Brown, No. 91&hyph;1972), however, the United States Court of Veterans Appeals held that Chapter 35 entitlement was established where the veteran was entitled to compensation for a total disability, permanent in nature, regardless of whether entitlement was based on loss of use of paired organs treated as if service-connected under 38 U.S.C. 1160. The Court's opinion overrules General Counsel Precedent Opinion 75&hyph;90 insofar as it relates to Chapter 35 eligibility. Currently the regulation does not specifically address whether Chapter 35 eligibility may be established based on a combination of disabilities treated as if service-connected under 38 CFR 3.383(a). We are amending 38 CFR 3.807 to reflect the Court's determination that such an evaluation may be the basis for Chapter 35 eligibility.
