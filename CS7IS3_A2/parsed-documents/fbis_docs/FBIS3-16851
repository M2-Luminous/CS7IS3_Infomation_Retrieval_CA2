Hata, speaking to reporters in Moscow, said North Korea's tough attitude led to the breakdown of the eighth round of working-level inter-Korean talks Saturday. "It is regrettable that the (dialogue) broke down because of North Korea's stubborn attitude," he said. The foreign minister, who is on a four-day visit to Russia starting Saturday, urged North Korea to respond to serious concern among the international community about its nuclear development program. He also asked Pyongyang to hold sincere talks with South Korea. On Saturday, delegates of North and South Korea met in the truce village of Panmunjom for 55 minutes to discuss procedures for an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang. But the session produced little progress, failing even to set a date for the next round. The talks collapsed with North Korean negotiators walking away from the dialogue table, south officials said.
