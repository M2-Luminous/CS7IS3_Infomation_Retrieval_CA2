The financial group added that this could lead to considerable devaluations of the peso with regard to the dollar and to interest rates, as well as to disproportionate increases in the Mexican Stock Market and other assets. The financial group said that in the beginning, the influx of cash will not decrease rates (for the withdrawal of bills and coins and sterilization), it will keep the exchange rate low and raise the stock market index. Later on, there will be reactions, first in the exchange rate and then in interest rates, and the situation will change. Supply will become increasingly moderate and demand will once again increase through private financing. In examining Mexico's economic situation in May 1994, Banamex's Department of Economic Studies stated the economy's low rate of growth is temporary because the economy has not lost it's solidity and because the general consensus is that stability is an essential requirement to achieve greater development. Nevertheless, the Department also mentioned that recovery is not yet clearly visible and notes that it could be delayed or limited by certain salient factors. "At present, there are other reasons for uncertainty which, perhaps, may prompt a deferment of investment plans. We are also beginning to note an increase in manufacturing production, but this increase is not echoed by sales." The Department also pointed to the possibility that inventories may accumulate and later weaken production. The Department likewise underscored that conditions do not yet exist for steady progress in private spending. A higher unemployment rate and the fragmentation of the labor sector have limited domestic spending power and made the decision to spend more selective, which can be attributed to individual over indebtedness.
