FR941110-0-00166 FR941110-0-00016 We note that the Act does not require that temporary management be imposed when there is immediate jeopardy. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act give HCFA and the State the option of using temporary management and/or termination to respond to a situation that immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of residents. In certain cases, facility shortcomings may be so severe and the likelihood of a temporary manager being able to successfully remove them so small, that HCFA or the State may decide that resident interests would be better served by terminating the facility and relocating the residents than by continuing to subject the residents to substandard conditions that are unlikely to improve. Because we believe there are situations where termination is more appropriate than temporary management, we do not accept the suggestion that HCFA and the State be required to impose a temporary manager in lieu of termination in cases of immediate jeopardy. Comment: Numerous commenters requested that we restructure the relationship between the facility and the temporary manager. Certain commenters believed that the temporary manager should act in a consultant capacity, and not as a replacement for the facility administrator. Others felt that the temporary manager should work under the control of the facility's governing body, and that we should require the temporary manager to consult with the governing body when developing the plan of correction. Another commenter favored giving the temporary manager legal but not financial control of the facility. Many other limitations on the temporary manager's authority were proposed. A number of commenters believed that the temporary manager should not be able to make employment decisions, and they recommended that we require the temporary manager to obtain approval from HCFA, the State, or the facility's governing body before hiring or firing facility employees. Other commenters proposed that there be limits on the expenditures the temporary manager can make in order to correct deficiencies, and they suggested that the regulation require that the temporary manager obtain the consent of the provider to spend beyond those limits. Another group of commenters requested that we limit the time period for which the temporary manager may legally commit or obligate the facility, and asked that we require the temporary manager to seek facility approval before entering into long term contracts. A few commenters recommended that facility ownership be able to appeal to the State to stay the actions of the temporary manager, and another requested that the facility have the right to object to the temporary manager's business practices. Response: Sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act specifically provide that the temporary manager is to oversee the operation of the facility and assure the health and safety of the facility's residents while improvements are made to bring the facility into compliance. Further, once the facility relinquishes authority to the temporary manager, the Act prohibits the removal of the temporary manager until the Secretary or the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance, assuming that the Secretary or State does not decide to terminate the facility before that time. We believe that implicit in the reason that the Act authorizes temporary management is the assumption that the facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring the facility into compliance. Therefore, the temporary manager needs to have the authority to completely manage the entire facility with enough autonomy to remove any immediate jeopardy and/or correct deficiencies. Imposing the limits proposed by commenters would handicap the ability of the temporary manager to make the necessary corrections, and thus jeopardize the successful completion of the temporary manager's mission. We believe that requiring that the governing body of the facility be allowed to become involved in the decision making process after it has demonstrated that its management skills are deficient would defeat the purpose of the remedy. The temporary manager may find it useful to consult with facility officials, but the extent to which the temporary manager interacts with the facility's management is at his or her discretion. This does not mean that we will deny the facility the opportunity to object to the actions of the temporary manager, or that we will force the facility to submit to the temporary manager's reform agenda against its will. At any time the governing body of the facility is not in agreement with the decisions or actions of the temporary manager, it may advise the owner or corporate official with appropriate authority to refuse to continue with the remedy. Such action would, of course, subject the facility to the possibility of termination instead.
