This announcement was made today by the spokesman for the department's local office, Jesus Velasco. He remarked that, according to a report from the General Directorate for Control of Confiscated Goods, the seized assets range from real properties to luxury cars, and household items. He gave a reminder that they were seized from the drug traffickers Arellano Felix and "Chapo Guzman" after the murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. He noted that, during the first auction, held on 3 May, only one house was sold; hence, this Tuesday, both individuals and corporate bodies may take part in the sale of these properties, located in various parts of Tijuana. He specified that the residences for sale this Tuesday, 17 May, are located in the Monte Bello subdivision, Colonia Reforma, La Gloria, La Mesa, Playas de Tijuana, and Lomas de Aguacaliente. He explained that persons interested in purchasing any of the properties should submit a single bid in a sealed envelope, accompanied by a 10 percent downpayment, to the PGR's account. The first call for bids includes the furnishings of 110 houses, such as furniture in general and office equipment, linens, and both electronic and decorative articles, he remarked. Finally, he announced that, next week the date, time, and place for the auction of 30 confiscated vehicles would be posted. Prominent among them are a pickup truck, a van, dump trucks, two Mercedes-Benz cars, and a Ford LTD convertible.
