FR941213-0-00049 FR941213-0-00010 Comment: One commenter wanted to know how a hospital decides what an appropriate facility is and what information is necessary to send to it. Response: ``Appropriate facilities'' refers to facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis. Our interpretive guidelines for §482.21(b)(2) give as examples of ``necessary'' information: functional capacity of an individual, the nursing and other care requirements of the patient, discharge summary, and referral forms. Comment: One commenter asked who pays the photocopy costs for the information transferred with the patient to post-hospital services. Response: These are typical overhead costs of Medicare hospital operations that are allocated to the appropriate cost center and that are already taken into account as part of the cost base used to develop payment rates under the prospective payment system (PPS). Therefore, the PPS payment rates already reflect these costs and no additional payment by either Medicare or the beneficiary is needed. Comment: One commenter inquired what authority the patient or patient representative has to limit the transmission of medical information required under §482.43(d). Response: If the information is governed by §482.24(b)(3), which concerns medical record services, it is subject to the safeguards of that provision. This provision requires that medical information be released only to authorized individuals and that the hospital ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Otherwise the release of the information is governed by any other Federal law, State law or hospital policy, which may require a patient's written authorization before release of information. Comment: One commenter requested that we define ``appropriate facility'' as one that (a) is able to provide needed care in a manner that complies with Federal and State standards; (b) participates in payment programs that are needed to pay for the beneficiary's care; and (c) is within a reasonable distance of the beneficiary's home so that relatives and friends may visit. Such a definition, the commenter suggested, would establish reasonable guidelines consistent with current HCFA policies and Congressional intent. Response: The term ``appropriate facility'' has been utilized in present 42 CFR 482.21(b)(2) since September 15, 1986 without further definition and has not presented an implementation problem. Therefore, we do not believe we need a more specific definition in this regulation. Our interpretive guidelines for §482.21(b)(2) currently define ``appropriate facilities'' as facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis. We will consider the commenter's suggested factors, and others, when drafting implementing guidelines for §482.43(d). Comment: One commenter suggested that we require at least one post-hospital follow-up by the discharge planning staff.
