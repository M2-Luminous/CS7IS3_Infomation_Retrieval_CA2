FR940922-1-00057 FR940922-1-00008 EPA recognizes, however, that it is possible an alternative program could be promulgated in the future that would achieve equivalent emissions reductions from new motor vehicles. Logically, such an alternative program that achieves the emission reductions the OTC LEV program would achieve, could render the OTC LEV program no longer necessary. States could then decide whether to give auto manufacturers the choice of meeting either OTC LEV standards or the alternative federal program standards. The alternative program would create emissions standards applicable to new motor vehicles that automobile manufacturers could, at their option, opt for EPA to apply to their new motor vehicles. EPA expects that, as long as issues pertaining to the enforceability of such standards can be resolved, such alternative federal standards could result in emissions benefits in the OTR equivalent to those that would result from the OTC LEV program. EPA is currently working with the federally chartered Clean Air Act Advisory Committee (and a subcommittee created to consider this topic) to allow for the possibility of such an alternative program that is in the interest of stakeholders and the public at large. EPA expects to obtain the advice of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee considering issues related to such a program during the fall of 1994. Thereafter, if there is reason to proceed, EPA would undertake a notice-and-comment rulemaking to establish the alternative federal standards program, and to promulgate such standards early in 1995. EPA expects that it will provide a period of time following promulgation for the automakers to decide whether to opt into the alternative federal standards program. Under a scheme EPA might consider, once automobile manufacturers opt into this voluntary program, they would be subject to all provisions of the Act and its implementing regulations (particularly provisions relating to EPA enforcement of standards) that apply to other mandatory standards currently applicable to such vehicles. EPA believes that, in this manner, it can establish an alternative mechanism to achieve emissions reductions from new motor vehicles equivalent to those that the OTC LEV program would achieve in the OTR. The alternative rulemaking would need to address a number of questions, including whether auto companies should be able to opt out of the program once they have opted in, whether states should give up their opportunity to adopt or enforce the California LEV program under section 177, and whether a consent decree addressing certain discrete issues would be useful. EPA's proposed SIP call requiring the OTR states to submit SIP revisions keeps open the option of an alternative federal program while ensuring that necessary emission reductions are not delayed. Under EPA's proposed SIP call, each state would be required to submit the OTC LEV program as a SIP revision, but the program could allow auto manufacturers either to comply with the OTC LEV standards or to opt into and comply with EPA promulgated alternative standards, if such standards are developed. The states' regulations could provide that the LEV program would not apply to auto manufacturers who are subject to an equivalent federal program. The states' SIP revisions would have to limit this exception to automakers subject to an alternative federal program that EPA has promulgated as equivalent to the OTC LEV program. EPA would address the criteria for its determination of equivalence in any alternative federal standards rulemaking. Under this approach, the automakers would not necessarily have to forfeit their ability to opt out when they opt into the alternative standards program. Since the states would all have to adopt and submit an OTC LEV SIP revision, automakers that either do not opt into or later opt out of the alternative standards program would be required to comply with the states' OTC LEV program. If EPA approves the OTC petition within the time specified by the Act, states' SIP revisions would be due in November 1995. If states delayed only slightly in meeting this deadline, it could result in an inability to apply the standards to all vehicles in model year 1999. Another benefit of EPA's proposed approach is that the automakers need not all make the same choice. Rather, automakers could independently choose whether to achieve the necessary emissions reductions by opting into and complying with an equivalent federal program or by complying with the OTC LEV program. Further, if the automakers were to attach any conditions to their opt in to a federal program allowing them to escape its obligations and were to trigger such an escape provision, they would then fall back to mandatory compliance with the states' adopted OTC LEV programs. EPA is taking comment on whether, if all automakers opted into an alternative federal standards program and did not have a right to opt out, the states should have to adopt the OTC LEV program. The only benefit EPA sees to such an approach is that the states' LEV program would then be necessary as a ``back-stop'' mechanism used solely to ensure that the automakers would not opt out of the alternative standards program. EPA is also considering another approach that would eliminate the burden of state adoption of the OTC LEV program if all the automakers opt into an alternative federal program. Under this second option, if the Agency promulgates alternative emissions standards and auto manufacturers opt into that program and commit not to opt out, the OTC states' obligation to submit OTC LEV SIP revisions would automatically terminate as no longer necessary. EPA urges states to respond under either approach to a final approval with immediate action to prepare to submit an OTC LEV SIP revision to EPA by November 1995.
