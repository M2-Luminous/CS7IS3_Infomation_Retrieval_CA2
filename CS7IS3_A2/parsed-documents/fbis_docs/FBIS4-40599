Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the United States had failed to meet its year-old pledge to lift all restrictions on trade with Russia. According to Chernomyrdin, that although the United States suffered as much damage from the Jackson-Vanik amendment as Russia did, it kept stalling with moves to repeal it. [sentence as received] Chernomyrdin said Russia wanted equitable relations with, and no special privileges from, the US. It would not tolerate discrimination, he said. Chernomyrdin hoped to find a solution to that problem during his visit to the United States. His plans to visit the Livermore nuclear center proved, Chernomyrdin said, what progress Russian-US relations had made. Chernomyrdin will be the first Russian leader to visit the top secret center. Chernomyrdin and the US leaders will be expected to focus on formerly "unmentionable" issues on the order of nuclear cooperation.
