FBIS4-374 "drafr069_a_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-069 Daily Report 9 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda French Troops Warned Not To Interfere French Troops Warned Not To Interfere AB0904124294 Paris AFP in English 1222 GMT 9 Apr 94 AB0904124294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Kampala, April 9 (AFP) -- French troops in the Rwandan capital should not "stand in the way" of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops marching on Kigali, an RPF spokeswoman said in the Ugandan capital Saturday [9 April]. Spokeswoman Christine Umutoni Nyinawumwami said the RPF "had taken it upon themselves to move to Kigali, but would not allow French troops to stand in their way during this mission." She said the Rwandan rebels were heading for Kigali to "rescue people from the carnage" triggered by the plane crash death on Wednesday of President Juvenal Habyarimana and his prime minister the following day in a revenge attack. Thousands have died in the inter-ethnic bloodletting that followed the president's death. "We understand that there are some French troops in Kigali, but they are warned that they should not break our way to this mission. If they do it, we are ready to face them, as they have blood and can be killed," Nyinawumwami, who is a member of the RPF political bureau here, told AFP. She was referring to some 300 French troops who took control of the Kigali airport early Saturday. The French troops are to organise the evacuation of the 600 French nationals in Rwanda.
