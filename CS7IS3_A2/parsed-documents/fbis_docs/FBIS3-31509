After the opposition's failure in parliament today to have a law on early elections passed, Weiss said that he gave priority to negotiations by all parliamentary parties on the date of the elections. He also said that the parliament could bind the president to calling a referendum on early elections in November. Weiss expressed the suspicion that Meciar's campaign for a referendum would be led in such a way so that voters agreed with the exit from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of those deputies who had infringed party discipline, and would say no to early elections. Meciar would also try and join in the referendum the question of the date of the elections and that of whether deputies who had left the party to which they were elected should be expelled from parliament, Weiss said. With this scenario, Weiss said, "difficult" politicians could be removed from parliament and the parliamentary support of the present government coalition would be guaranteed until the end of the regular electoral term in 1996. However, this idea would meet with "great resistance" from the public, Weiss said.
