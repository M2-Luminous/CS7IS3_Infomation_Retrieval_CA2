While the grand struggle has been carried out, the blood ties between the great leader [yongdoja] and our people has become all the more cemented as an invincible one which none can break. At a time when the single-hearted unity of the leader [suryong], the party, and the people is being tightened beyond measure and the socialism of our own style is triumphantly marching ahead, we meaningfully mark the birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and our people and the supreme commander of our revolutionary forces. The revolutionary holiday of February is the greatest holiday for our nation in which the glorious chuche lineage has been firmly inherited, and the firm guarantee has been prepared to ensure the endless prosperity for the fatherland and the happiness for all the generations to come. Observing the historic day, all the party members and working people are gripped by boundless reverence for the great leader [yongdoja] and are recalling with great pride the proud history of having marched ahead under the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. The history of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's revolutionary activities is the most glorious history of the great revolutionary and the great leader [yongdoja] who has devoted his all for the noble cause for the fatherland, the people, and the revolution. Embarking on the road of the revolution with the firm will to succeed to and consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause pioneered by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim il-song in the early days, the dear comrade leader has led our people's struggle for the socialist construction and the fatherland reunification into the ever-victorious road, standing at the fore of our party, the people, and the revolutionary forces. Today, the era of the Workers' Party of Korea has met the golden age, and the status and dignity of our party and the fatherland has reached its zenith. Upholding the great leader [yongdoja], who has created the most glorious history of struggle for the revolution and the people, comes as the honor for Korea and the greatest pride of our times. Recalling our party's history of struggle adorned with inflamed events and feats, we feel the greatest pride because the single- hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks uniting around the great leader [yongdoja] has been firmly achieved. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: Our single- hearted unity is the most firm revolutionary unity and invincible unity with limitless power in which we are firmly united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and fidelity based on one center and one ideology. Unity is power and a fundamental source of triumph in the revolution. At a time when the generation of the revolution has been changed and is carrying out its tasks to inherit and complete the socialist cause, the question on how to unite around the leader [yongdoja] is a vital question connected with the destiny of the revolution. The single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks has a long history and tradition. The tradition of our unity rallying around the leader [yongdoja], which was created amid the stern flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, has been brilliantly inherited along with the advancement of the revolutionary cause. Today, in our country, the single-hearted unity of all the party members and all the people centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been firmly achieved. As the result, the problem in inheriting the tradition of unity has been brilliantly solved. Never has there been a time like today in which all the party members, working people, and officers and men of the People's Army, with absolute loyalty for the leader [yongdoja], are firmly united in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and fidelity. The achievement of the great single-hearted unity is the most biggest triumph for our revolution. The might of our single-hearted unity rallied around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been clearly proved in our arduous practical revolution. The single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the most powerful weapon that enables them to brilliantly carry out any difficult and massive task in revolution and construction and vigorously accelerate the general onward march of socialism of our own style. The history of our socialist construction is decorated with proud courses in cultivating roads and creating miracles with the might of unity. Upon inheriting the long tradition of struggle, our people were able to create the speeds of march admired by the people of the world and to run like the wind in the seventies, eighties, and nineties because they waged struggles after strongly uniting around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. Everything that casts its ray on the fatherland -- the strong foundation for a self-reliant national economy, the powerful national defense capability, and the great monumental edifices erected everywhere -- is the brilliant fruition of the might of single-hearted unity. If it had not been for the weapon of single-hearted unity, we would not have been able to endlessly develop our economy during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, when the situation at home and abroad was difficult. And, if it were not for the might of single-hearted unity, all of us would not be able to march to highly display the superiority of socialism of our own style as boldly as we are doing today. Our single-hearted unity is a source of invincible might that enables us to defeat any antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and strongly defend achievements in reunification. For the past few years, imperialists and reactionaries of all sorts have maneuvered more viciously than ever to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] socialism of our own style. However, they were no match for the might of our people single-heartedly united around the dear comrade leader. Because there was single-hearted unity, our party and people could defeat the enemy's reactionary ideological offensives and crush [kyokpa] any maneuver by the enemy to politically and militarily threaten us and bring us under its control [che-ap]. During last year's semi-war period, the entire country, all the people, and the entire Army, cherishing our supreme commander's iron will deep in their hearts, rose up unanimously to launch revolutionary offensives to crush [patan] the enemy's attempt. This is a graphic example of how powerful the might of our single-hearted unity is. Today our party and people are responding to the enemy's threats, blackmail, and vicious appeasement tactics with a strong revolutionary stand and fighting with a bold offensive spirit and indomitable spirit [taedamhan konggyok chongsingwa pulgurui kijiro]. The source of this might is the invincible unity of revolutionary ranks. As long as there are iron-willed revolutionary ranks that rise up unanimously in concert with the great leader [widaehan yongdojawa hanmaum handdussidoeyo], our fatherland will cast its ray as an invincible fortress of socialism. Today the single-hearted unity of our party and revolutionary ranks is unity with the greatest vitality. A fundamental reason for this is the greatness of the leader [yongdoja]. The solidity of unity depends on how firm the center of such unity is. Only when one upholds the people's leader [chidoja] who wins unswerving trust and support from the entire party and all the people, can there be firm unity that is unshakable in any storm. The might of our single-hearted unity comes from the fact that the dear comrade leader's ideas and theories are great and that those ideas and theories are the ideological basis of our unity. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and enriched the great leader's [widaehan suryong] revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, and provided a powerful ideological and theoretical asset for the long and arduous revolutionary course that can defeat the imperialists and complete the socialist cause to the end. Today Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideas and theories are firm guiding principles for our party and revolutionary cause and banners that can achieve complete and unconditional ideological and theoretical unity in the revolutionary ranks. Because we have these great ideas, the political and ideological purity [sungyolsong] of our party and revolutionary ranks is firmly ensured generation after generation. Cherishing our party's ideas and theories, which are associated with the dignified name of the dear comrade leader, in their hearts as their bone, flesh, and belief, our party members and workers live and fight according to the requirements of those ideas and theories today. No alien [isaekjogin] ideological elements whatsoever can set foot in our revolutionary ranks, which are firmly armed with the great leader's [yongdoja] ideology and will. As our party's ideology and theory is infinite, our single-hearted unity which regards it as the water of life will never change. The single-hearted unity of our party and the revolutionary ranks is becoming an ever-victorious and invincible unity. This is because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is great and the authority of his leadership is incomparably high. The dear comrade leader's leadership art is a chuche-oriented leadership art which makes it possible to display the popular masses' infinite strength to the utmost. It is also an ever-victorious leadership art that finds a breakthrough in solving problems in whatever situation and turns an adverse situation into a favorable one. Through his extraordinary leadership capabilities, the dear comrade leader brilliantly fulfilled many difficult and complicated tasks presented in carrying out the socialist cause of our era. He also achieved immortal achievements before the era and revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made countless accomplishments in the revolution and the construction. They include achievements in strengthening the party, the staff of the revolution; enhancing our party's leading role in every way; bringing in fundamental upturn in the construction of the people's armed forces; and filling the superiority of the socialism of our own style in every domains of politics, economy, and culture. For these great achievements, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is being highly praised as a genius of creation and construction and a great strategist, and has come to grip the absolute authority over the people. Our people, through their lifetime experiences shared with the party, came to cherish deep in their hearts the steadfast conviction and will that they can surely conquer any fortress of the socialist construction as long as the dear comrade leader leads them. Our single-hearted unity is so strong as the entire society is overflowing with such unshakable faith and will. The great ethos of single-hearted unity in our society is a brilliant crystal of politics of benevolence and politics of love and trust afforded by the dear comrade leader. The dear comrade leader's warm love for the working people and his unfaltering trust for the revolutionary fighters are his natural gifts and basic characters of politics afforded by him. Our party, with its limitless magnanimity, has taken care of the people from all walks of life, including the working people, the peasants, and the intellectuals, by holding them in its broad bosom and led them to fruitful life and struggle. In addition, it made all the people who follow the party to proudly stand for members of the revolutionary ranks. Our party's politics of great love and trust has given birth to loyalty and filial duty among our party members and working people, and made the beautiful communist traits to bloom fully in our society. Thanks to the dear comrade leader's great noble traits, our society has become a big family under which the great father and the people are connected in blood; a harmonious society where the people help and pull each other along in accordance with the communist principle of one for all and all for one; and a united society in which the great flower garden of the civilian-army unity is being unfolded. Because we uphold the dear comrade leader, who is the center of unity, the great ideological theoretician, the excelled politician, and the father of the people, our single-hearted unity will display full its infinite might and vitality in the future. Before us lie the heavy tasks of brilliantly completing the chuche-oriented socialist cause by further strengthening the single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: All of the working people should inherit the tradition of our revolution's single-hearted unity, and direct big efforts to further strengthen the single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks uniting around Comrade Kim Chong-il. Single-hearted unity is an eternal slogan for our people's struggles and an immortal banner that provides the Korean revolution with bright prospects. In the course of upholding the dear comrade leader, we must more brilliantly inherit the proud tradition of the Korean communist movement in which we have considered unity to be the most precious and defended it at the risk of our lives. If we are to strengthen the might of single-hearted unity by all means, it is more important than anything else to possess absolute admiration of the leader [yongdoja] and uphold the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] with loyalty. The most important among the traits of revolutionaries who boundless treasure unity is to have a firm attitude and position with which they uphold the leader [yongdoja]. Revolutionary warriors must single-heartedly uphold their leader [yongdoja] with loyalty. Warm loyalty with which one follows one's leader [yongdoja] and considers him to be a person to whom one owes one's life and who defends one's destiny is a basic trait that our revolutionaries must possess. All party members and workers must resolutely walk along a single road of loyalty, always cherishing deep in their hearts the notion that it is very fortunate that they have the great leader of the people [widaehan inminui chidoja], who shoulders the destinies of the fatherland and people and who leads the chuche-oriented socialist cause to a single road of invincibility. Our people's eternal spiritual pillar and center of belief [yongwonhan maumui kidung sinnyomui kidung] is the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The more openly the imperialists and reactionaries launch antirevolutionary offensives and the heavier revolutionary tasks face us, the more deeply we must cherish the belief that our socialist cause will win victory without fail as long as the dear comrade leader leads us. For all party members and workers to loudly sing the song of loyalty and song of belief entitled "We Will Win as Long as You Are There" and to meet face to face with difficulties and archenemies [taejok] is a way to fully demonstrate the might of our single- hearted unity. If single-hearted unity is to be strengthened in the party and revolutionary ranks and functionaries, among other people, must take the lead to uphold the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. Functionaries are essential people in the party and revolutionary ranks and the leading officials of the revolution. Our functionaries are those who must become flag bearers as well as hands [sonbal] in upholding the party and the leader [suryong]. All functionaries must thoroughly imbue themselves with the revolutionary doctrine and prepare themselves as genuine loyalists who eternally share the same life and destiny with the party and determined revolutionaries who strongly defend the revolutionary guardposts, to which the party assigned them, and boundlessly glorify our party's revolutionary achievements until they die. Those who always share the same will with the leader [yongdoja], who consider the party's policies to be their belief and devotedly implement them to the end, and who resolutely struggle to defend our single-hearted unity by all means: They are genuine revolutionary warriors. Our functionaries must always compare Comrade Yi In-mo's party spirit with their own and persistently make efforts to learn from his spiritual world. To our functionaries who cannot live even for a moment without the people's trust and love, nothing is more important than possessing the spirit of devotedly serving the people. The functionaries must never forget their role in establishing blood ties between the party and people, go among the popular masses, and make brisk efforts to better extend the dear comrade leader's favors to our people. If our single-hearted unity is to be strengthened by all means, we must substantially and continuously carry out the work to unite the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from all other walks of life around the party. The solidity of our revolutionary unity is guaranteed by the ideological solidity of the popular masses who absolutely support and follow the party and the leader [suryong]. We must further strengthen the indoctrination work to make the party members and workers accept loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] as their faith, conscience, morality, and daily life and, in particular, the work to propagandize the dear comrade leader's greatness. In this way, we must make the entire society the crystallization of loyalty, devotion, and single- heartedness. In particular, our intellectuals must have a revolutionary awareness and communist conscience and defend and uphold the party with knowledge and technology. All intellectuals must cherish deep in their hearts the great honor of being the party's eternal companions, sincere supporters, and excellent advisers, an honor that the dear comrade leader has given them. They must also become forerunners who give the people a belief in sure victory and must become bugles in the socialist march. The young people are the inheritors [kyesungja] of the revolution who must glorify the party's cause, the dear comrade leader's cause, generation after generation. They are also the most vigorous group of people in our society. With a firm resolve to become guns and bombs [chongpoktan] that defend and protect the party and the leader [suryong], all young people must live and struggle in a revolutionary manner and must always rush to difficult guardposts to which the party calls them and create miracles and feats. Giving fuller play to the traditional ethos of army-people harmony is of important significance in solidifying the wholehearted unity of our society as firm as a rock. Today, the soldiers of our People's Army have the revolutionary soldier's spirit of laying down their youth and lives willingly for the comrade supreme commander and are carrying out their honorable mission as revolutionary fighters with guns. Because we have the People's Army which is boundlessly loyal to the iron-willed brilliant commander General Kim Chong-il, our party is strong, and the security of our fatherland is firmly ensured. All party members and working people should always attach importance to military affairs, love the soldiers of our People's Army like their real brothers and sisters and real sons and daughters, and help them wholeheartedly. All the officers and men of the People's Army should love the people and wage a struggle devoting everything they have to it to defend the people's lives and properties. As long as the army and the people uphold the party's cause with loyalty in firm unity between them, the wholehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks will be as strong as a fortress. Upholding the great leader's New Year's address and the decision adopted at the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, our people are vigorously pushing ahead with a new onward movement to fully display the superiority of socialism of our own style. We should fully display the might of single-hearted unity in today's struggle to implement the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the party. All party members and working people should staunchly strive to carry out our party's grand socialist construction plan by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. In doing so, they should adorn this year, the first year of the adjustment period, with brilliant feats and triumphs. Today when some 50 years have passed since the great guiding star rose from the sacred Mt. Paektu, our revolution has a bright future. The great leader [yongdoja] stands at the fore; the invincible party leads us to victory; and single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses is pressing hard on our revolution's march. Victory is on our people's side who are firmly united around the leader [yongdoja] with conviction and fidelity. Everyone should consolidate the single-hearted unity among all party members, working people, and officers and men of the People's Army centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as firm as a rock, and staunchly fight for the ultimate victory of the chuche cause.
