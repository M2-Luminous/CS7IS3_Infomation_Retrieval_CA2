He then said, "Japan has been consulting with the United States about various options." In this way, the top Foreign Ministry official hinted at the possibility of both Japan and the United States imposing their own economic sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council decides to impose them on that country. Both Japan and the United States are believed to have been studying the possibility of imposing their own economic sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council decides to do so in anticipation that China's opposition to the sanctions may block the UN Security Council from voting to impose the economic sanctions, thereby delaying enforcement of the economic sanctions against the DPRK. Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and U.S. Defense Secretary Perry are scheduled to meet on the morning of 22 April and are likely to discuss this possibility during their meeting.
