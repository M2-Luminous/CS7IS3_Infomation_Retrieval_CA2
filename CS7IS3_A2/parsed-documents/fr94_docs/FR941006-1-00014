FR941006-1-00014 FR941006-1-00006 The task force has now submitted its report to the NASD Board of Directors and the Board has proposed for member comment market maker standards that would restrict market makers from trading ahead of certain member-to-member trades, keyed in part on the size of the customer limit order. 13 Under the NASD proposal, market makers would be prohibited from trading at prices equal to or better than the price of a customer limit order they hold if the size of that order was 1,000 shares or less and from trading at prices better than a customer's limit order if the size of that order was greater than 1,000 shares. 13 See Special NASD Notice to Members 94&hyph;79 (September 23, 1994). 11 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34279 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34883 (July 7, 1994). 12 Id. The Commission believes that the NASD's proposal is an instructive step and will provide useful comment from the member firm community. The Commission, however, believes that comment from the broader constituency of the investing public and other non-NASD members will be critical in formulating adequate limit order protection for the NASDAQ market. In addition, the Commission believes that alternatives which provide more extensive limit order protection for public customers also should be the subject of public comment. Therefore, the Commission has determined to propose its own rule. Publication of the proposal will complement the efforts of the NASD and enable the Commission to act on its own initiative if it deems such action appropriate. II. Discussion The Commission proposes to adopt Rule 15c5&hyph;1 pursuant to Section 15(c)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), 14 among other provisions. 15 Section 15(c)(5) grants the Commission authority over dealers acting in the capacity of market makers by permitting the Commission to impose standards with respect to dealing as the Commission, by rule, shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to maintain fair and orderly markets, or to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national market system. 16 14 Section 15(c)(5), 15 U.S.C. 78o. 15 Section 11A, 15 U.S.C. 78k&hyph;1; Section 23, 15 U.S.C. 78w. 16 See Exchange Act Section 15(c)(5), supra note 14. The legislative history of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, under which Section 15(c)(5) was adopted, endorsed priority for customer limit orders in national market system securities and stated that the Commission should have discretion to achieve this protection. Congress noted that for suitable securities, every effort should be made to ensure that public investors in these securities would receive the benefits and protections that would result from the placing of public orders ahead of dealers' orders in determining the sequence in which orders entering the market are executed. 17 17 S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1975) (``Senate Report'').
