FBIS4-4306 "dreas062_c_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 North Korea Church Groups Urge ROK To Oust Kim Yong-sam Church Groups Urge ROK To Oust Kim Yong-sam SK3003233494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1505 GMT 30 Mar 94 SK3003233494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean Religionists Association (KRA) held an enlarged meeting here today calling on the South Korean religious organizations, clergymen and believers to take a resolute action for overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam regime of flunkeyist traitors for the reunification of the country in the 90s. The meeting discussed measures concerning the refusal of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to allow the joint celebration of the centenary of the Kabo (1894) Peasants War by Chondoists in the North and the South. It was attended by members of the KRA and officials of the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoists Association, the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists Federation, the Central Committee of the Korean Christians Federation and the Central Committee of the Korean Roman Catholics Association. A relevant resolution and a letter to the South Korean religious organizations, clergymen and believers were adopted at the meeting. The letter said the Kim Yong-sam regime's anti-national acts in blocking all the contacts and travel between the North and the South and the joint commemoration by the North and the South of the centenary of the peasants war, an anti-feudal, anti-aggression mass struggle of the nation, could never be justified and tolerated. It noted that if such an anti-national group as the Kim Yong-sam clique, which takes no account of the nation and ancestors, were left in the country, neither the peace of the Korean peninsula nor the independent and peaceful reunification of the country could be expected and there would be only a nuclear holocaust. It called on the South Korean religious organizations, clergymen and believers who love the country and the nation and hope for national reunification to decisively break with the Kim Yong-sam regime and join in the struggle for the establishment of a genuine independent, democratic government.
