The President of the Republic, who as supreme commander of the armed forces decides on the early release, taking into consideration the national security conditions and the combat readiness of the armed forces, had not been informed beforehand. Compulsory military service in Slovenia lasts seven months. So far the President has signed the early discharge of recruits from May, October and December 1992, and from April, June, October and November last year. This time the release took place without the knowledge of President Kucan. Defence Minister Jansa pointed to the legal vagueness concerning jurisdiction resulting from the contradictions between the Law on Defence and existing Constitution, as well as the Constitutional Court resolution of December 13, which took the position that the competences of the former state president do not transfer automatically to the current President. It is true that the President decides on early discharge, claims Jansa, but nowhere is it stipulated at whose proposal. To avoid such confusion in the future, the Defence Minister suggests that the government decide on the adoption of a necessary military legislation, after receiving the opinion of the President of the Republic. The President's Office said that the President was in favour of early discharge if the legal conditions existed. Recognising his responsibilities to this generation of soldiers too, he had been expecting the Defence Minister to propose their early discharge. Since the Minister failed to do so and discharged the recruits of his own accord, the Office judges the action of the Defence Minister to be evidently unlawful and arbitrary.
