FR940720-0-00004 FR940720-0-00001 Response. The NRC is working to improve the internal efficiency and effectiveness of its program as a means of controlling operating costs and, therefore, keeping fees billed to licensees as low as practicable. Economies have been achieved through the elimination of the NRC's uranium recovery field office in Denver, Colorado and consolidating the agency's two smallest regional offices_Regions IV and V. The NRC is tightening its financial operations by increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of its program financing. As a result of these efforts, the NRC proposed and Congress approved a $12.7 million recision (reduction) to the original appropriation enacted for FY 1994. Therefore, the total amount to be recovered from fees from all classes of licensees in FY 1994 is about $6 million less than the amount to be recovered in FY 1993. The Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) requires that the NRC conduct a biennial review of fees and other charges imposed by the Agency for its services and revise these charges to reflect the costs incurred in providing those services. The 10 CFR Part 170 licensing and inspection fees were increased significantly for some materials licenses in FY 1993 as a result of the first CFO biennial review. The 10 CFR Part 170 fees for FY 1995 will be revised to reflect the results of the second CFO review. On April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16513), the Small Business Administration (SBA) issued a final rule changing its size standards. This rule increased the receipts-based SBA size standards due to inflation. The NRC is considering proposing amendments to the NRC size standards that would reflect the SBA action. Any amendments to the NRC size standards will be submitted to SBA for approval and published in the Federal Register for public notice and comment as required by the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;366). The NRC will reexamine the annual fees assessed for small entities once the NRC completes its evaluation of the NRC size standards, which is expected to be done in FY 1995. The NRC in this final FY 1994 fee rule is continuing a maximum annual fee of $1,800 and $400 per licensed category, respectively, for those licensees who can qualify as small entities under NRC size standards. The impact of the fees for FY 1994 on small entities has been evaluated in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (see Appendix A of this final rule). The small entity subsidy in this final fee rule has been calculated on that basis. B. Fee Methodology 1. Hourly Rate Comment. Several commenters indicated that the hourly rate of $133 is excessive and cannot be justified. These commenters noted that the rate is considerably higher than the typical industry charge-out rate for direct employees and equals or exceeds the hourly charges for senior consultants at major national consulting organizations. Other commenters supported the proposed removal of costs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste from overhead and their direct assignment to the reactor and materials programs. Commenters stated that this is an improvement in that it better defines the beneficiaries of certain regulatory activities and more equitably allocates the fees for services provided. Response. As indicated in previous final rules, the NRC professional hourly rate is established to recover approximately 100 percent of the agency's Congressionally approved budget, less the appropriation from the NWF, as required by OBRA&hyph;90. Both the method and budgeted costs used by the NRC in the development of the hourly rate of $133 for FY 1994 are discussed in detail in Part III, Section-by-Section Analysis, for ยง170.20 of the proposed rule (59 FR 24069; May 10, 1994) and the same section of this final rule. For example, Table II shows the direct FTEs (full time equivalents) by major program for FY 1994 and Table III shows the budgeted costs (salaries and benefits, administrative support, travel and other G&A contractual support) that must be recovered through fees assessed for the hours expended by the direct FTEs. As indicated in the proposed rule and supported by the commenters, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead but are now directly assigned to the class of licensees they support. This change results in the increase in the hourly rate being less than it would have been otherwise. Given the increase in the costs to be recovered through the hourly rate, including increases in the cost of doing business (e.g., inflation), it is necessary to increase the 1994 hourly rate by less than one percent to recover 100 percent of the budget as required by OBRA&hyph;90. The specific details regarding the budget for FY 1994 are documented in the NRC's publication ``Budget Estimates, Fiscal Year 1994'' (NUREG&hyph;1100, Volume 9). Copies of NUREG&hyph;1100, Vol. 9 may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9328. Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. A copy is also available for inspection and copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001.
