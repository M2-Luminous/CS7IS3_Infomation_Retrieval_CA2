The Chadian Government and the National Awakening Committee for Peace and Democracy [CSNPD] have still not been able to settle their differences. Their talks have stalled on the issue of conditions laid down by Moise Kette's movement. Here is the reaction of Abderhamane Djasnabaille, spokesman of the committee for the defense of the national conference decisions, speaking to Jean-Claude Medome. [Begin Djasnabaille recording] Concerning the ongoing talks between the CSNPD and the Chadian Government, we believe that the very issue they are discussing requires at least a national consensus. This impasse proves us right because the issue of organizing a referendum on the form of government is of interest to everybody, and I am not sure that the government can guarantee its organization since not everyone is involved. We must remember that this government is a transitional one and everything that is discussed must be based on consensus. We have always generally said that a roundtable conference comprising all parties concerned must be held. We say that discussions must not be held with the CNSPD alone. They must include the Movement for Democracy and Development, the SNT [expansion unknown], and all other Chadian political and military organizations. Furthermore, concerning the internal situation, we proposed the establishment of a national reconciliation committee to discuss this issue and to agree on a common stand that would effectively commit the government since it is a transitional one. It is not just a matter of discussing the principle. A program must be drawn up to indicate how long it will take to organize this referendum. Meanwhile, today, nothing has been settled yet and this really shows the precariousness of the agreements that could be reached at these Bangui talks. [end recording]
