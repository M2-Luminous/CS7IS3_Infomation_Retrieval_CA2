FR940303-0-00014 FR940303-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;ANE&hyph;32; Amendment 39&hyph;8843; AD 94&hyph;05&hyph;05] Airworthiness Directives; Teledyne Continental Motors Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O&hyph;200, O&hyph;300, and GO&hyph;300 Series Reciprocating Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O&hyph;200, O&hyph;300, and GO&hyph;300 series reciprocating engines, that requires inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and inspection of the cylinder rocker shaft for looseness and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable part. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked or improperly repaired cylinder rocker shaft bosses. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine power loss and engine failure. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jerry Robinette, Aerospace Engineer, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;3810, fax (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) Models C75, C85, C90, C125, C145, O&hyph;200, and O&hyph;300 series reciprocating engines was published in the Federal Register on June 2, 1993 (58 FR 31348). That action proposed to require fluorescent penetrant or etching inspections of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for cracks, and dimensional inspections of the cylinder rocker shaft bosses for looseness, at the next overhaul, in accordance with TCM Overhaul Manual Form X&hyph;30013, dated June 1982, applicable to TCM Models C125, C145, and O&hyph;300 series engines; and TCM Overhaul Manual Form X&hyph;30010, dated January 1984, applicable to TCM Models C75, C85, C90, and O&hyph;200 series engines. If the cylinder rocker shaft bosses are cracked, the cylinder must be replaced. Modified cylinders must be further inspected for cracks that may have been introduced during the repair process. Cylinders with loose rocker shafts must be replaced with serviceable cylinders, or modified by installing bushings. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter states that the AD should require compliance at the next 100 hour or annual inspection, whichever occurs first. The commenter further states that the AD should require visual inspection for wear, broken bosses, or loose bushings at the earlier compliance time because cylinders with cracked bosses or loose bushing will likely fail before the cylinder requires overhaul. The FAA does not concur. Service Difficulty Reports and engineering analysis do not indicate that the shorter compliance time is necessary, and the comment did not include any data as a basis for the shorter compliance time. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a visual inspection without disassembly could detect cracks or looseness in the cylinder rocker shaft bosses. The commenter further states that the TCM GO&hyph;300 series engines should be included in the AD. Production of new cylinders has been standardized by manufacturing the TCM GO&hyph;300 type cylinder only for use on all C&hyph;75 through C&hyph;145, as well as the O&hyph;200 and O&hyph;300 series engines. The commenter maintains that used GO&hyph;300 cylinder assemblies may find their way onto other engines. The GO&hyph;300 shares nearly identical valve train components with the other engines and is subject to the same type of rocker boss wear and possible failures. The FAA concurs. The GO&hyph;300 cylinders have been added to the applicability paragraph of this AD.
