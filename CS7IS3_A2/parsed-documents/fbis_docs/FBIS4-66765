There is no reason to say that the Marist priest and the Assumptionist nun were killed primarily because they were members of religious orders or because they were French citizens. But the relentless logic of the Islamists--which is the same as that in Sudan or Egypt--invariably calls for attacking minorities, whether civilian or religious. This double murder constitutes a new test for relations between Christians and Muslims. And also for Islam, whose image is distorted by this new violation of the state of "dhimmitude" [Muslim toleration of religious minorities], which obligates the faithful to respect the weaker members of society--women and children--and priests as holy men. There are still 30,000 Catholics in Algeria.[.sup]1[/] Faced with the rise of fundamentalism, the Christian communities of North Africa are having to deal with a moral dilemma, as evidenced by the synod of African bishops that has just been held in Rome (see page 14 [not reproduced]). They must simultaneously avoid exposing themselves and being made "martyrs" by the FIS on the one hand and, on the other, preserve the future and concrete friendships with moderate Muslims who are repelled by that Islamism. "It is necessary to stay because among us, it is a matter of loyalty," said Archbishop Tessier of Algiers before the murders on Sunday. And he added: "We have been with them during colonization and since independence. We remain with them in their anxieties." The Christian churches have often been criticized for their naiveness in wanting to continue a dialogue with Islam at all costs, even when the latter was becoming more aggressive, even toward Christians and the Vatican. But rather than "naiveness," it is opposition that one must speak of today. There is an intransigent line of thinking that is inspired by events in Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan and hostile to the political statements of radical Islam. It is demanding as many rights for Christians in Islamic lands as Muslims enjoy in Christian lands, and its basis is the demand for "reciprocity" that was mentioned by the pope in Casablanca in 1985. But there is also resistance by a moderate group that advocates cooperation between Christians and Muslims in a multifaith and, at the moment, peaceful context, as is the case in Senegal, Mali, and even Libya. If dialogue is still possible with all sincere Muslims who condemn terrorism and violence, and they are by far the most numerous and the most reduced to silence, good will in only one direction is not enough. It no longer seems capable of saving anyone, religious or not, in Algeria today. Footnote 1. Algeria has four Catholic dioceses (Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and Laghouati), 170 priests, 100 monks, and about 350 nuns, most of whom are involved in educational and social work.
