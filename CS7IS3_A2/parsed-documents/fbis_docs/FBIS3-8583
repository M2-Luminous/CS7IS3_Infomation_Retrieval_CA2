However, they are far from being the thousands who were expected and who came when Meciar was last dismissed from the premier's seat in 1991. Since this morning parliament has been debating the motion of no confidence in the government proposed yesterday by the Christian Democratic Party (KDH). Most of the speeches so far have been made by deputies of the governing HZDS-SNS (Slovak National Party) coalition, condemning yesterday's speech by Kovac in which he fiercely criticized Meciar. KDH chairman Jan Carnogursky said in the parliamentary corridors that the opposition was waiting for a speech by Meciar. "Then I shall make my appearance," he said. HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak called for an agreement between HZDS and the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and for a compromise date of July for early elections. (The HZDS wants a June date, the SDL an autumn one). However, he said it was unlikely that the HZDS and SDL would go into an open coalition before parliamentary elections, because the SDL wanted to share in the government only on the basis of new elections.
