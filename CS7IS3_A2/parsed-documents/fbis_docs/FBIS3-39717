European affairs ministers agreed in principle that long-term subsidies for certain troubled agricultural sectors could remain in place in the four candidate countries, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The accord was to be presented later Tuesday to foreign ministers from the four states. The ministers also accepted a proposal from the EC Executive Commission to consider the northern regions of the three Nordic states -- located above the 62nd parallel -- as agricultural mountain zones, a diplomatic source reported. These regions, where summer lasts only several weeks, meet special EC criteria on reduced fertility and productivity. In another move the ministers reached common ground on production quotas covering sugar, milk and milk products for each of the four candidates. They accepted a proposal from Finland that will allow Finnish mink breeders to continue feeding their animals with herring, despite the fact that under EC regulations herring are only to be consumed by humans. In addition Finnish legislation governing holiday residences reserved for Finns can be maintained as can the autonomous status of the Swedish-speaking island of Aaland. But the ministers meeting here made virtually no progress on fishing questions, apart from reaching an agreement in principle on access to EC and Nordic waters. Regional aid, the possible establishment of specific criteria for the four candidates and their budgetary contributions were to be debated further on Tuesday.
