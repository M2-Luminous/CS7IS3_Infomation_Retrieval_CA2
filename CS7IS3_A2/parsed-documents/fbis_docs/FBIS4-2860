Mr. Zhou said that a consensus was reached during the meeting for a heavy crackdown on such illegal practice. Participants lent their support and expressed understanding of three punitive measures submitted by the ministry, the General Administration of Customs and the State Import and Export Inspection Bureau and of the punishment handed down to four enterprises found guilty of violation of the relevant law. They expressed their determination to further fight against the illegal re-export of textiles. All of the participants were clearly aware of the serious harm resulting from such offences which bypassed the quota system administration at home and disrupted the conducting of foreign trade while it also ran counter to a commitment made by China in bilateral and multi-lateral international agreements, resulting in great damage to China's prestige and credit in terms of foreign trade in the international community. Illegal re-exporting carried out by a handful of enterprises caused damage not only to the state, but also to themselves finally. Their offence made other law-abiding enterprises subject to unnecessary inspection and accusations when undertaking foreign-related business. Leading teams have already been set up in Tianjin Municipality and Shandong Province to counter the illegal re-export of textiles and have worked out measures for inspection and handling of the offence. The Shenzhen Import and Export Commodities Inspection Bureau and the Shenzhen Bureau of Economic Development often join forces in inspecting processing plants. The Foreign Trade Ministry, the Administration of Customs and the State Inspection Bureau will continue to send inspection teams to do spot checks on enterprises this year. The implementation of any decision made by this meeting will be examined, while Guangdong, Shantou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Xiamen, Zhejiang and Ningbo have to boost cooperation and coordination in carrying out inspections of production, transactions, examinations, customs declarations and the export of textiles there.
