FR941116-0-00087 FR941116-0-00018 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 59a RIN 0905&hyph;AE55 National Library of Medicine Grants AGENCY: National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, DHHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health is amending the regulations governing certain National Library of Medicine (NLM) grants to conform the maximum award amount set forth in the regulations to the maximum award amount set forth in the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 increased the maximum award amount for an NLM grant for basic resources from $750,000 to $1,000,000. The regulations are being amended to reflect this statutory change. EFFECTIVE DATE: This amendment is effective on November 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jerry Moore, Regulatory Affairs Officer, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 3B11, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892&hyph;0001, telephone (301) 496&hyph;2832 (this is not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Institutes of Health is amending the regulations at 42 CFR part 59a, subpart A, governing NLM grants for establishing, expanding, and improving basic medical library resources, authorized by section 474 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended, by revising the introductory sentence of paragraph (b) of ยง59a.5 to set forth a maximum award amount of $1,000,000. This action is being taken so that the regulations will accurately reflect the new statutory limit of $1,000,000 on these grants. Additionally, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products. Under sections 553(b)(3)(B) and 553 (d) (1) and (3) of title 5, United States Code, notice, public comment, and delayed effective date procedures have been waived for this amendment based on a finding of good cause. These procedures for ensuring public participation in the rulemaking process and time for compliance are unnecessary because the change has already been made by section 1401 of Public Law 103&hyph;43 and it relieves the current restriction in the regulations limiting grant award amounts.
