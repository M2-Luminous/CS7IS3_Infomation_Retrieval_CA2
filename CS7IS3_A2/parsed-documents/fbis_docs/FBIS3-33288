Guido Tarqui, national settlers secretary from the Bolivian Labor Federation, said that in the past few days the narcotics under secretary and a Coca Reduction Directorate (Direco) official threatened Chapare peasants, urging them to voluntarily eradicate their coca crops. He said the two government officials openly threatened the peasants by telling them that "in case they do not follow the coca crops eradication plan, the National Social Defense Secretariat will begin carrying out direct interdiction actions in the area." Tarqui said the two officials announced that more coca eradication employees are being taken to Chapare for the purpose of eradicating coca crops "by fair means or foul." Tarqui said this attitude intimidates the peasants, which may lead to "clashes and the spilling of blood." "The peasants are not willing to allow their crops to be eradicated without any consideration," Tarqui said, adding that "the only means of living for the area's peasants are coca leaves."
