The sources said that Jordan's official request, submitted to the Iranian Foreign Ministry, seeking a reduction in the number of diplomats in Iran's embassy in Amman from 40 to nine by the end of this current month "reflects Jordanian concern about Iranian ambitions." They pointed out that the Jordanian Government had moved two months ago to check the activities of the Iranian diplomatic mission in Amman after an assault on Jordanian Ambassador in Tehran Yasin Istanbuli. They said that some unknown individuals broke into the ambassador's home, tied him up for hours, searched the house, and stole some of its contents. Official sources say that they suspect that those individuals who broke into the ambassador's home and assaulted him belonged to an Iranian intelligence branch or worked for one of the centers of power in Tehran. The Jordanian sources revealed that the government requested an official "apology" from the Iranian Foreign Ministry for that assault incident but the Iranian Government only expressed "regret" about the incident. They said that Jordan also expressed displeasure at the fact that the Iranian authorities did not take sufficient security measures to protect the Jordanian diplomatic mission and discover the identity of the "unknown" individuals who stormed the ambassador's home. [passage omitted] The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has emphasized that it has no reservations regarding the activities of the Iranian Ambassador in Amman Ahmad Dashmaltajian despite press reports claiming that he was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon in cooperation with Syria. The Jordanian reservations regarding the Iranian diplomatic mission concern, among other things, the funding of the Islamic Research Center in Amman and the attempt to have a seat for Shiite studies at the Jordanian University. An official source has stated that Iran "concentrates its efforts on Shiite cultural and academic aspects with the aim of spreading the ideologies of the Iranian revolution" but "pays no attention to economic cooperation between the two countries." He added that Jordan decided that the presence of 40 Iranian diplomats in Amman as compared with just three Jordanian diplomats in Tehran "is unjustifiable...considering the volume of cooperation between the two countries." The source also said that "among the Iranian practices in violation of diplomatic rules and traditions was the attempt by the Amman mission to distribute books and leaflets against regimes in the Gulf, a matter which necessitated decisive intervention by the Jordanian authorities to prevent the distribution of these books and leaflets."
