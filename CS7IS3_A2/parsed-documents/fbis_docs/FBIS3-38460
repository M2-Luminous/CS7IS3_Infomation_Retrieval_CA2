Sextant Avionique and the U.S. group Allied Signal, who had been talking of a potential joint venture in the avionics field since August, have agreed to abandon this project. "Exhaustive studies (...) have confirmed that the two companies are well positioned on their markets, but that it would not be possible to find satisfactory arrangements for an effective integration of Allied Signal's civilian activities and Sextant Avionique's civilian and military operations," says the French firm in a communique. "The confidential nature of our defense activities (45 percent of avionics sales) required too complex a structure," is the rationale given by Sextant Avionique, which is approaching the event philosophically. "Such things happen; however, all the work we did together in the last few months will not be wasted. We shall be able to arrange more flexible partnerships with Allied in the future." An agreement with the U.S. firm would have broadened Sextant's business opportunities in the United States, where the French equipment manufacturer has already made some headway through work done on the Boeing 777. Sextant Avionique, which has been restructuring after going private and after Aerospatiale's partial withdrawal from its capital in favor of Thomson-CSF (which now controls 66.6 percent of the firm's shares) as well as the sale of Crouzet Electromenager [household appliances] to Emerson Electric, is currently locked in an wage dispute. After announcing, in early January, a wage freeze which led to a walkout last Monday, the company offered individual raises, a proposal which, according to the CFDT [French Confederation of Labor], was rejected as "discriminatory" by a majority of unions.
