General Milovanovic said that an agreement was reached to place both Serb and Muslim artillery under UNPROFOR control for the duration of the cease-fire. He explained that UNPROFOR has conveyed to the Muslim side the Serb side's proposal regarding the cease-fire and the setting up of a mixed military commission which will find ways to maintain the cease-fire. He added that the Muslim side has agreed to this. The cease-fire will be guaranteed by UNPROFOR. Commissions will tour the entire front around Sarajevo in order to establish where these sensitive spots are and deploy UNPROFOR observers there to determine who is violating the truce, General Milovanovic stressed. The chief of staff said he was surprised by General Rose's claim that some kind of an agreement was signed at today's meeting. He specified that nothing was signed and that all that was accomplished was a verbal agreement, whose details he cited. He emphasized that this is a truce and that the Muslim artillery is in no way exempt from it. General Milovanovic added that UNPROFOR and the Serb and Muslim sides have assumed responsibility for inspecting all positions through mixed military commissions and devising ways to maintain the truce. These ways will be discussed tomorrow.
