In particular they discussed adopting the rules and determining the agenda of the first sitting. It was recognized that faction members should support the adoption of temporary rules, which would combine everything progressive from the rules of the previous Supreme Council, but would give greater advantages to deputies factions and groups. Leonid Kuchma, cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc, proposed that they take a stand on which candidate to support for the post of speaker by the next MDF-Tsentr session. During the discussion Oleksandr Moroz, Vasyl Durdynets, Ruslan Bodelan, chairman of Odessa oblast council, and Volodymyr Hrynyov were named. Expressing a personal point of view, Leonid Kuchma stressed that he will hardly be able to support Vasyl Durdynets, although he respects his executive skills. As the other cochairman of the Interregional Reform Bloc -- Volodymyr Hrynyov -- has not yet made a final decision on whether to contend for the speaker's seat, the decision to support one or other contender was postponed until the next sitting of the faction, planned for 10 May. Leonid Kuchma told a UNIAN correspondent that he is convinced that at least several dozen deputies from among those who "have been forced to sign documents of other factions because of their official position or who have not yet adopted a final position," will join the MDF-Tsentr faction within a few days of the new parliament beginning work.
