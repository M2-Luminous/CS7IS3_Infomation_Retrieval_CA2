According to the vice president, North Korea's reluctance to join the nonproliferation movement is one such danger.

The congress, which is being attended by delegates from 18 countries of Europe, Asia and Africa, will discuss, during its three days of work, problems of dialogue between different denominations of Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, plans for the expansion of activity of Christian Democrats in African and Commonwealth countries and specify the conceptual framework for the development of the organisation after the disintegration of the socialist camp in Eastern Europe.
