FR940405-1-00108 FR940405-1-00013 Non-recurring first year costs were annualized over 20 years at 10 percent interest rate. As presented in Table VI&hyph;10, the annualized first-year cost is estimated at $1.3 billion. OSHA anticipates total annual costs of $8.0 billion. (c) Training for HVAC Maintenance Workers and Informing Employees About the Indoor Air Quality Standard. The proposed standard requires training for all building maintenance workers involved in building system operation and maintenance. Standards of maintenance vary dramatically in the HVAC industry and sometimes are deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. Training programs for workers must include at least information on: (1) How to maintain adequate ventilation of air contaminants generated during building cleaning and maintenance, and (2) how to minimize adverse effects on indoor air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents. The exact cost of training will vary among establishments depending on whether employees are trained in-house or sent to outside training programs or consultants. OSHA estimated the costs for the trainer who must research, prepare and direct the sessions. For the time involved in the training session, a range of costs for the instructor could be developed. For example, the wage costs for the trainer could represent from 50 percent of the trainee labor costs (if there are only two in the class) to 5 percent if there are 20 trainees in a class. For the preparation time, OSHA judged that the trainer will require a special study seminar, such as that taught by the Building Owners and Managers Association International.
