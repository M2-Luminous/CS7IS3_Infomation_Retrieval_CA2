"Saudi's increased production has glutted the market and caused oil prices to fall from dlrs. [dollars] 18 to dlrs. 12 per barrel in 1993, reducing the purchasing power of the Persian Gulf petroleum producers and making such extravagancies detrimental to their economies." Considering the estimated Saudi production increase, and its refusal to cooperate with other OPEC members to stabilize the overall production level, the article believed it would be unrealistic to expect a fair price for oil any time soon. "In the event that OPEC oil ministers fail to reach an agreement to lower production levels in their scheduled March 25 meeting, crude prices could fall to dlrs. 11 per barrel. Reaching a consensus on production levels is contingent upon the realization, by overproducers, that regional and national interests have the highest priority when it comes to political and economic policies," the editorial concluded.
