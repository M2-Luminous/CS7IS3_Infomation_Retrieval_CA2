Highlighting the fundamental option of the Romanian foreign policy of integration into West-European and Euro-Atlantic structures, of building good-neighborly relations with the states with which Romania has common frontiers and with those in its proximity, the Romanian foreign minister also stressed the importance of the sub-regional cooperation pursuing the curbing, as much as possible, "of the tendency of fragmentation of Central and Eastern Europe, as a characteristic of the evolution of this zone over the last few years." ``That is why the countries participating in sub-regional cooperation ought not to depart from the framework of the principles and norms consecrated by the CSCE and, the least desirable is that they promote principles and norms contrary to the above. ``This is the philosophy underlying the emergence and development of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone, a group participated in by 11 states totalling 322 million inhabitants, within which the cooperation is preponderantly economic,'' the Romanian chief diplomat said, adding: "The natural connection existing between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, as well as the fact that the latter is the shortest way between Europe and Central Asia largely explain the interest shown by more and more numerous states that do not have Black Sea coasts in participating in our group's activities." The Romanian minister recommended to "those concerned -- be they government factors, private enterprises, or representatives of similar groups in Europe or in other continents -- to apply for detailed information on the rules of procedure and functioning of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone and on the projects already under operation or only under consideration, to the standing secretariat with headquarters in Istanbul." He hoped that this year already the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank would open at Salonika and that, in the future, the current Balkan Center for Small and Medium Enterprises, existing in Bucharest, might extend its activity throughout the Black Sea zone. In concluding his address, Teodor Melescanu said: ``By its geographic position and its tremendous potential of raw materials, labor, productive capacities, and outlets, the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone is an attractive space of collaboration. ``On the other hand, it is just as true that the vast Black Sea region includes also areas of deep instability and even of open military conflicts. ``That is why, the fastest and peaceful settlement of the conflicts on the east coast of the Black Sea deserves to be included in the CSCE and UN priorities''
