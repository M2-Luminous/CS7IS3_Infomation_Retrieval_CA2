"We have worked together these past few weeks with Cyrus Vance and Matthew Nemitz on a possible solution for the dispute, but no final agreement has been reached thus far," Crvenkovski stated. "We expect the second phase of the negotiations to start in about 10 days or to reach some kind of an agreement in the meantime." He expressed hope Cyrus Vance's efforts would eventually result in reviving of the talks. In regard to his meetings with various U.S. officials, Crvenkovski said they have shown clear support of the independence and territorial integrity of Macedonia and all that is achieved by this small state in the course of the past two years. He also pointed out the entire media in the United States wrote in favor of Macedonia during his visit, condemning at the same time the Greek embargo and behavior. He said his meeting with the Western European Union President [WEU] van Ekkelen proved very useful. Besides discussing the situation in the region, they have agreed in principle to establish various kinds of cooperation between the WEU and Macedonia.
