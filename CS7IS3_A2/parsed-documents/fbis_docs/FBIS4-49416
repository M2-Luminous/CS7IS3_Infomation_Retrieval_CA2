As a first step, more inspection joint ventures will be set up nationwide this year, said Tian Runzhi, newly-appointed director of the State Administration of Import and Export Commodities Inspection. This will provide valuable experience and teach management methods to Chinese inspectors, he said. The administration also plans to invite foreign experts to open courses and send Chinese abroad for training. In addition, more laboratories are to work closer with Chinese commodity inspection officials to check imported goods. Plans Plans also include signing an agreement with Israel and Russia and a letter-of-intent with UL [Underwriters' Laboratory], the top inspection body in the United States. Contacts will also be strengthened with Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Australia, Japan, Britain, Italy and the European Community. Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are also seeking to strengthen links with the mainland. Tian said at the conference that Chinese inspection organizations must continue to reform their operations. One step will turn several modern labs and research institutes into independent facilities to check goods and the property of foreign-funded enterprises. New inspection sites will also be built in cities and ports where foreign trade has soared, Tian said. Inspectors will particularly focus on high-volume export commodities that cover safety, hygiene and environmental protection. And both central and local administrations will continue to issue licences and hygiene certificates. According to the Measures for Management of Foreign Investment and Property Evaluation that went into effect on May 1, officials are required to make objective and accurate appraisals. According to Tian, Chinese inspection bureaus last year inspected 1.37 million import and export shipments valued at $75.2 billion. About 24,000 were found to be subpar, about half of which were for export. The bureau said raw oil, steel, iron, digital watches, computers and cameras exported by Chinese companies passed inspection. Among imports, all toys, washing-machines, edible oil and vacuum cleaners passed quality checks.
