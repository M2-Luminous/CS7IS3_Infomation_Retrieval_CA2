Pilot cities should take the lead in exploring and in establishing a new socialist market economic system. From 6 to 11 January, Li Tieying inspected Chengdu and Chongqing, heard reports by the relevant departments in Sichuan Province as well as in the two cities, and held discussions with managers and factory directors of medium-sized and large enterprises in Chengdu and Chongqing, and together with responsible persons from various cities, prefectures, and autonomous prefectures in the province who attended the meeting, during which they jointly looked into issues related to reform and development. While in Chongqing, Li Tieying also visited the Qingling Automobile Company, Ltd., the construction industry company (group), the Nanping farm market, and the Chongqing means of production exchange. Li Tieying pointed out: There is no ready-made model for building a socialist market economy. Sichuan has made an early start in reform; both Chongqing and Chengdu are pilot cities for a complete set of reforms. You have attained great achievements in the process of reform and created much experience which should be continuously summed u. Constant efforts should be made to study how to implement comprehensive reforms, and how to tackle new situations and new problems that have cropped up in the course of moving forward as a whole, and efforts should be made to create many more new experiences. Urban economic restructuring must be comprehensive with emphasis on key areas; we should not deal with only a certain aspect in isolation without taking other aspects into account. Currently, we should focus our comprehensive reforms on transforming the operating mechanism of state-run enterprises, establishing a modern enterprise system, and carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control nationwide. He stressed: In the course of reform, the government serves both as a director and a protagonist. We have to count on the government to play a leading role in instituting a modern enterprise system while it is itself also engaged in transforming its own functions. At the same time, we should change the situation in which enterprises have for a long time had to bear the heavy burden of "running society" under the planned system. Social functions should be divorced from business operations, and a social security system should be gradually established and perfected. Only when these problems are solved can enterprises show their vitality in market competition. Touching on cultivating and developing a market system, Li Tieying said: We must promote the development of markets for factors of production, financial markets, and technology markets, and also pay attention to developing intermediate agencies such as accounting, auditing, and law offices. We should handle the relevant affairs through these intermediate organizations in accordance with the law. While hearing reports in Chengdu and Chongqing, Li Tieying stressed the need to quicken the pace of opening to the outside world. He said: Sichuan must further step up its construction of transportation, telecommunications, and energy facilities. At the same time, it should strive to establish a new economic structure and a sound operational mechanism, and constantly improve its investment in elements of the intangible environment. Greater efforts should be made to attract more business and funds, as well as to absorb funds, technology, and qualified personnel from other parts of the country and the world. While hearing reports on the supply and marketing of grains and edible oil products, Li Tieying said: It is necessary to correctly and properly handle the relationships between producers, operators of businesses, and consumers, but most important of all, we must mobilize producers' enthusiasm to achieve an agricultural bumper harvest and ensure growth in the output of grain and edible oil products. We must study how to speed up the reform of the grain structure and establish a reserve system and risk funds. We must proceed from the interests of the masses of the people and pay due attention to stabilizing prices of grains and edible oil products, as well as to maintaining market stability.
