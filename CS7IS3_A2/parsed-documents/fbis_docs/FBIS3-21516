He is charged with publishing an article in coauthorship with another chemist, Lev Fedorov, in the newspaper MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, in which he made public facts concerning a new type of chemical weapon--a binary weapon. In accordance with the new Russian Constitution (Article 15, Paragraph 3), the list of reports containing a state secret is defined by federal law. Up to the present time, such a publication of the federal law does not exist. It is for this reason that on 24 January 1994 Vil Mirzayanov refused to appear in court voluntarily, justifying this refusal by a reluctance to participate in an anticonstitutional trial. On the eve of the resumption of the court examination, a whole number of public and political organizations came out with statements in support of Mirzayanov. Thus, the executive committee of the Russia's Choice electoral association and a faction of the same name in the State Duma of the Russian Federation in a statement expressed the hope that the Moscow city court will in a very short time complete the examination of the Mirzayanov case and pronounce a verdict of not guilty. Nikolay Vorontsov, chairman of the subcommittee for science of the Committee for Education, Culture, and Science of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, believes that the trial of the chemical scientist is an attempt to return to those times when a state of fear and terror reigned in society. In his words, the situation regarding the arrest of Vil Mirzayanov reminds him of 1970, when the geneticist scientist Zhores Medvedev was put into a psychiatric hospital in Kaluga for his book about Lysenko. "Chemical and ecological scientists should play a big role in the current situation," thinks Nikolay Vorontsov. "If necessary, on their part it should come to rather tough sanctions with respect to the authoritative structures." However, Mirzayanov's colleagues at present prefer not to actively advertise their attitude toward the court trial. Although, in the words of Nikolay Vorontsov, the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences Yuriy Osipov expressed his personal point of view and condemned Mirzayanov's prosecution. "If the chemical scientists do not come out in defense of their colleague, I do not know whether they will be invited to international conferences," Mr. Vorontsov emphasized. Interesting in this connection is the statement of Lev Fedorov that the case of his coauthor began to unravel after Doctor of Chemical Sciences Viktor Petrunin wrote a denunciation to State Security addressed to the chief of the Economic Security Administration. But while the chemical scientists are thinking about what position to take in this situation, even more fundamental measures are being proposed. If things are called by their proper names, this is blackmail and threats to divulge state secrets. The example of Vladimir Uglev (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA of 28 January 1994) proved to be infectious, as could be expected. The seed fell on fertile soil. Valeriya Novodvorskaya issued an ultimatum: If Vil Mirzayanov is not released by 10 February, she will pass information to the West concerning three developments that constitute a state secret. It is well known that our country was one of the most closed. So that for more than 70 years quite enough secrets accumulated, and there are enough state secrets for everyone. But there always have been more than enough people in Russia who like to scratch their name in the annals of history with a little nail.
