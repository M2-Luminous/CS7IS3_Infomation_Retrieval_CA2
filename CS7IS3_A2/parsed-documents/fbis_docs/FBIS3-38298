Executives from Japan, Europe and the United States agreed at the World Economic Forum here that Russia has a long way to go before it could hope to attract meaningful amounts of capital from abroad. [passage omitted] Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice president of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish supplier of heavy electrical equipment, said the main problem in Russia is the ever-changing rules of the game. He said investors need stable regulatory and tax regimes, a clear idea of the division of authority between Moscow and Russia's regional governments, and a supportive local banking system. Also discouraging is the pervasive influence of organised crime in Russia, von Koerber said. He cited a government report which said 70-80 percent of private firms and commercial banks in major cities have to fork over 10-20 percent of their turnover to the Mafia. "If this is not attacked in an aggressive, credible manner very quickly, then whatever regulation is established in the country will not be seen as sufficient," said von Koerber, whose firm has investments in Russia. Figures presented at the Forum showed a clear reticence on the part of countries to invest in Russia, even before fears spread that Moscow was drifting back towards central planning. Von Koerber cited the example of German companies, which he said invested a piddling 13 million Deutsche marks [DM] ($7.6 million) in Russia in the first half of last year. This was less even than the DM21 million they put into a small state like Slovenia. Yukinori Ito, senior excutive director of the Export-Import Bank of Japan, said accumulated Japanese investment in Russia totaled $300 million, a scant 0.1 percent of the worldwide total. Ito said Russia's economic instability and rampant inflation were a key discouraging factor, as were changing investment policies, poor roads and communications, and a time-consuming bureaucracy. "These factors together with the macroeconomic and political conditions are making Japanese countries hesitant to invest in Russia," he said. George Vassiliou, chairman of the Cyprus-based MEMRB market research firm, said investing in Russia would also benefit Europe as a whole. He said it has environmental consequences, and expansion of the Russian market is necessary if the continent is to emerge from its current recession and unemployment crisis. Vassiliou was unimpressed with proud claims by Russian officials that they are well on their way towards completing their mass privatisation programme. "Privatisation by itself does not mean much," he said. "It has significance only if it can be coupled with joint ventures and investment."
