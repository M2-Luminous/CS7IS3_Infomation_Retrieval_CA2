FR941021-2-00005 FR941021-2-00002 As a result of these reviews, we determine that the following margins exist for each review period: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/ Exporter 1Time period 1Margin (percent) TOSOH 4/1/91&hyph;3/31/92 77.43 TOSOH 4/1/92&hyph;3/31/93 77.43 The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries for each period of review. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these administrative reviews, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act. A cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties based on margins for the most recent period of April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993, shall be required on all shipments of subject merchandise from Japan, as follows: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of the 1992&hyph;1993 administrative review; (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in the 1992&hyph;1993 review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in the 1992&hyph;1993 review, any previous review conducted by the Department, or the original LTFV investigation, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation of 73.30 percent. See the Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Gray Portland Cement and Clinker from Japan 58 FR 48826, 48833, (September 20, 1993), for a further discussion of the Department's practice in setting the all others rate. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation. These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: October 5, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26203 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M 9
