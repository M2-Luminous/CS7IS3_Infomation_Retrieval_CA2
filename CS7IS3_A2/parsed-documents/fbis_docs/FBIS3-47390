The topics concerned cooperation in establishing national reconciliation in Cambodia and setting up a mechanism to help Thai businessmen participate in Cambodia's economic reconstruction. [Begin Aphisit recording] The Cambodian side thanked the Thai Government for supporting and playing a major role in the success of the peace process in Cambodia. The Thai side reiterated its desire and clear policy of supporting the legitimate Cambodian Government. It will not support any group that opposes this government. The government has a policy of not interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs. On this issue, both sides noted that there have been many claims and reports -- particularly by foreign press agencies -- that have led to uneasy feelings by both parties. They discussed the fact that although their objectives and policies are the same, implementation at the border -- which stretches a long way -- could be inconsistent. Both governments seek direct coordination with each other to achieve a correct understanding and avoid having minor events escalate into situations that might obstruct good overall relations. On economic issues, the Cambodian side welcomed Thai businessmen who have played a role in economic development. It informed the Thai Government that it is in the process of creating mechanisms, organizations, and laws to govern business conduct. This will be the framework for future business functions. Regarding contracts that Thai businessmen have made with Cambodian parties, the Cambodian Government will not revoke them; it will honor its commitments. On those projects that are not supported by contracts, regulations will have to be followed and contracts will have to be negotiated. The Thai prime minister informed the Cambodian side that in addition to existing aid, Thailand will approve imports of 10,000 tons of soybeans from Cambodia in July and will grant 50 scholarships. The prime minister pointed out that Cambodia and Thai businessmen reap mutual benefits from the activities of the businessmen. Those who have violated Cambodian law should be strictly prosecuted, while justice should be ensured for those who appeared to be involved in dishonest activities but were, in fact, innocent. Both sides discussed possible mechanisms to facilitate the conduct of trade and business, including the promotion of trade at border crossings so that duties can be collected and the creation of a mechanism to oversee border problems and ore exploration in overlapping sea territories. Regarding the Mekong committee, both sides are pleased that China and Burma have joined. Both sides want quick implementation on these issues. [end recording]
