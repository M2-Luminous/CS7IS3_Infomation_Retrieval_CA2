Mr. de Beer was reacting to a call by the president of the Azanian People's Organization [Azapo], Professor Itumeleng Mosala, for the removal of white teachers from black towns. Mr. de Beer said that white teachers are appointed to black schools only when suitably qualified black educators could not be recruited. He said that in the light of the distressing matriculation results, Prof. Mosala's statements could further jeopardize efforts to normalize schooling.
