This is how U.S. President Bill Clinton explained the situation in his State of the Union address. What is now required is simply the implementation of the steps that have been initiated. He mentioned numerous successes -- NAFTA, the gun law, or the U.S. economy -- which have had a positive impact on the entire world economy and triggered a recovery. Fortunately, Clinton's overestimation of his abilities did not extend to foreign policy. Russia's reforms must be supported, said the one who had pledged to focus on domestic issues. Thus, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- in fact he had to deal with these crises in one or another unfortunate way -- were hardly worth mentioning. As far as Korea is concerned, keeping silent was the best solution. As a matter of fact, the United States will probably supply 12 Patriot-type antimissile batteries to South Korea because North Korea possesses -- yes, you guessed it -- Scud missiles. Are the two Koreas really on the brink of war? Will the North Koreans storm south through their tunnels, like the Iraqi soldiers when they attacked Kuwait City? There is no danger at all. The reason is the conflict with Pyongyang over control of the nuclear facilities. In a constant quarrel, the North Koreans refuse to show their cards and allow inspectors to check whether they are producing nuclear weapons or not. They are not, the CIA announced recently. Probably not, stated South Korea's president recently, but control is necessary. There is no doubt about that. Clinton even threatened the old man Kim Il-Song with "a military solution" unless he gives in. However, if Patriot missiles -- which South Korea apparently does not want in the middle of negotiations because it fears that the North might feel provoked -- are Clinton's last resort, and there will be another foreign policy masterpiece that should not be mentioned during a State of the Union address.
