Conclusions have been drawn about the alleged existence of serious differences between the defense minister, his deputies, and other members of the Russian Defense Ministry Collegium. From time to time either one general or another will be dubbed an open or secret opposition figure by the press.... Well, official -- much less, personal -- relationships, and at such high level, are a very delicate matter. It has always been considered inappropriate to make certain aspects of them public. But since things are now reaching the point where this problem is being intensively given essentially political overtones, we need nonetheless to make things clear. The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Editorial Office asked a number of Defense Ministry leaders and members of the Defense Ministry Collegium to answer the following questions: 1. How do you assess the current state of official and personal relationships among the leading staff of the Armed Forces, and the atmosphere at Defense Ministry Collegium sessions and in general when highly important decisions on issues of the Armed Forces' life and activity are being made? 2. What is your attitude to articles -- including those about you personally -- which claim that relations within the Armed Forces are now complex and contradictory, and that there is a kind of split and an interpersonal struggle under way? Andrey Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister: 1-2. There is a businesslike, constructive relationship within the Defense Ministry leadership. Not least I can note with satisfaction the equable, comradely relations with Army General P.S. Grachev, defense minister. Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed Forces General Staff and first deputy defense minister: 1. I cannot say what official and personal relationships within the Defense Ministry leading staff were like in years gone by. But I can state with complete authority that the current atmosphere at the Defense Ministry can be expressed in two words -- "working condition." Let me explain what I mean by this. The most important decisions on the issues of Armed Forces reform and their activity and everyday life are not at all reached in secret or behind the scenes -- as is sometimes claimed in the mass media. Also groundless are the claims that all the recent decisions on Armed Forces reform have been unexpected and have come out of the blue for most Defense Ministry leaders. In confirmation of that I would cite a very recent incident. Literally the other day we were reporting our proposals to the defense minister on optimizing the organizational and staffing structure of the Armed Forces' central apparatus. In particular, this report clarified the list of posts taking account of existing realities. The preparatory work was done with the involvement of the commanders in chief of the branches of service, commanders of combat arms, and so forth. There were no behind-the-scenes games or intrigues. A representative of the Russian Federation Presidential Staff also took part in the work. This is important too -- it is yet more evidence of the growing civil control over the Armed Forces' activity. A detailed report was made, analyzing why a certain decision was being made. The defense minister supported our proposals. Incidentally, as part of my job as chief of the General Staff I report to the minister highly important documents prepared by the General Staff. Some 95 percent of these documents -- maybe an even higher percentage -- are adopted on first submission. This too, I think, is typical of the level of working relations within the Defense Ministry. And it is nothing to do with me personally. It is a question of the prestige of the General Staff, which has highly professional officers and generals working for it. It is thanks to their supreme responsibility! For some reason I find it easy talking with my boss, the defense minister. As for Defense Ministry Collegium sessions -- first and foremost, I should mention the openness between Collegium members. There are plenty of examples of issues being worked out at deputy minister or branch of service commander in chief level and then being reported to the Collegium as an initiative. I do not recall a single instance when the minister rejected our proposals. 2. I think that it is clear from my response to the first question that the press reports to the effect that people in the Defense Ministry take no account of the opinion of the chief of the General Staff are without any real foundation. I consider such articles an attempt to split the leading staff of the Armed Forces. What is the objective? It is, I think, to create a climate of distrust between us and, as a result, to get us involved in a political struggle on the side of various forces. Just look at what these articles are about.... They alleged that First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin had "not become part of the military collective." That "Afghan" generals oppose the others and, moreover, that there is fierce confrontation between certain groupings within the Defense Ministry. But what is typical is that nobody knows about such groupings -- they simply do not exist. Now to the rumors which are also being put about in the press claiming that there is a strained relationship between the defense minister and the chief of the General Staff. All lies! Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev and I are not personal friends, but we have a good working relationship. And that is the most important thing when it comes to doing to the job. Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister: 1. There has indeed been some talk of late about serious differences among the Russian Armed Forces leadership. What can I say? To my mind, relations between the defense minister, his deputies, and the commanders in chief -- in other words, the Collegium members -- are now just the way they should be. Businesslike and calm. All our complex problems -- and we have no easy ones -- are being resolved. As a rule, everyone gets to speak at Collegium sessions. As far as I am concerned, I express my opinion to the extent I consider necessary. There are no restrictions here. I think that this will be confirmed by the fact that there is always an atmosphere at the sessions that makes it possible to discuss and resolve any issues calmly and professionally. The defense minister's attitude to all Collegium members is very equable, businesslike, and -- I would particularly like to emphasize this -- respectful. This too, you will understand, makes it possible for everyone to say what they consider needs saying and to discuss important problems without any reservations -- just as their experience and their own assessments of the state of affairs prompt them to. All the more so as I have things to recall. As commander of Kiev Military District, I had to attend the USSR Defense Ministry Collegium. When I was appointed first deputy defense minister, I naturally took part in the work of the Union MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Collegium. The atmosphere at our sessions, if compared with those days, is considerably more democratic. And there are simply no advance instructions or any kind of pressure about how to speak or what to say. It is logical to ask whether this happens outside the auditorium. We have normal relationships which allow us -- both individually and jointly -- to carry out our official duties normally. In short, there is nothing between Collegium members of the kind that has been reported in the mass media -- no hostility and no covert opposition to the minister. 2. There have been lots of articles about me, and, clearly, there will continue to be. I try not to comment on them. I think that anyone with a definite experience of life, a man of dignity and honor, and a man of some humor must ultimately take that attitude to articles about him personally. It is another matter when state interests are affected. I recall that I won a court case when Colonel Vilen Martirosyan, my colleague in the former Union corps of deputies and now a "genuine Ukrainian," called me a possible military dictator in a Kiev newspaper in 1990. If you take other articles, also written, as a rule, on the basis of rumor (I consider that articles about relationships within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry fall into precisely this category), then, of course, you would like to respond, not least in the press. But refuting fabrications and rumors is an ignoble task, and sometimes unnecessary. Nonetheless, the "bearers of the truth" cannot be dissuaded. They will continue their petty intrigues. One thing is reassuring -- there are far fewer of these people than there are of those who understand the position of the person talking or writing. And time will sort everything out. Army General Konstantin Kobets, Russian Federation chief military inspector and deputy defense minister: 1. I would like to note straightaway that there has never been an instance when the Defense Ministry Collegium failed to reach any decision unanimously. Of course, there are disputed points. We receive in advance all the issues which it is planned to examine at the Collegium, and, naturally, we study them carefully. The opinions of the deputy ministers and commanders in chief are always taken into account. I repeat -- always! If we fail to reach a unified decision, a working group of experts from all Armed Forces branches of services has to be set up. All the "pros" and "cons" are taken into account. And only after this is the matter put to the Collegium session. Respecting a different opinion is a typical feature of the defense minister's and one that I would particularly note. And this has become the rule for our relations at Collegium sessions. But if a decision is made, it has to be implemented. There can be no excuses or reservations about it. On the whole, I believe that the Defense Ministry in its work professes the following main principle: We are all in the same boat and we are all working to the "commander's plan" -- that person being the supreme commander in chief or the defense minister, depending on the importance of the issue. But I would also like to say something about personal relationships. Our families often meet up outside of work -- on holidays, for instance. I think that this says a lot too. 2. Articles about allegedly strained relations between Defense Ministry leaders primarily surprise me rather than evoking hostility. Because there is not a grain of truth in them. Where does all this gossip come from? So I would say to journalists -- don't use random, unchecked information. Don't cheat your readers! Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the Ground Forces: 1. It would be wrong to say that each member of the Defense Ministry Collegium cannot have his own opinion. After all, we prepare in advance for the discussion of the matters at issue, and we prepare seriously. It is normal that everyone should have their own opinion. I think that the defense minister is quite right to listen to his deputies and commanders in chief. I do not recall his ever saying "That's enough!" to someone, even if he disagrees with him. Or that he takes the view that he has formed his own opinion and that yours does not interest him.... All proposals are listened to attentively. I am sure that the atmosphere at the Collegium should be like this. It is all the more absurd to claim that if some Collegium member has his own view of a specific problem, he becomes an opponent of the minister or, moreover, moves into opposition.... We have a normal working atmosphere. I personally do not know of any overt or covert opposition. So why are there constantly articles in the press about this? So as to set us Collegium members against each other? To sow distrust among us? A lack of trust in the minister on our part, and in us on his. Incidentally, one thing is absolutely clear. All such articles are aimed one way or the other at creating an unhealthy atmosphere around the Armed Forces. The fact that once the Collegium has adopted a decision, the decree needs to be strictly monitored is another matter. We have been insufficiently demanding in this area [imenno zdes u nas prinizhen spros]. Clearly, that is the fault of the Collegium secretary, who has failed to provide timely information to the minister, and it is our fault -- us Collegium members. Previously adopted decisions can be forgotten about amid our ongoing work. That is something that should be criticized. 2. My opinion is this. Criticism of the Army has entered a new phase, if I can put it that way. In the Gorbachev era attacks were sanctioned from on high so as to ensure that the people had no doubt about the Union leadership's attitude toward the Armed Forces. And the USSR president himself set the tone. The people, as a result, started to lose faith in the Army's prestige. False premises typical of Gorbachev (talking, for instance, about cutting back some divisions, he sometimes tried to add: "I've taken the trough away from a few generals") were picked up on from below. Everyone knows what this led to. Now, in my view, the attacks on the Armed Forces are connected with attempts by various political forces and parties to sow discord among the Defense Ministry leadership and to pressure the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Collegium and assert their own influence in military circles. Everyone knows that in our difficult time the Armed Forces are the only stable organism in the state. The Army can do a very great deal to strengthen Russian statehood. But certain politicians are simply uninterested in this. For them one slogan is acceptable -- the worse, the better. That is where the current criticism comes from. All kinds of rumors and fables get into the press by whatever means. For instance, I was struck by an article in KOMMERSANT-DAILY to the effect that Semenov is in opposition to the defense minister. But what is typical is that nobody, including the writer, could explain where this information came form. "Somebody told me, I heard it somewhere" -- those are not arguments. That is why I have the reaction to these articles that I have.
