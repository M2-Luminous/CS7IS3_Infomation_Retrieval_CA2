The Russian foreign minister is scheduled to arrive in Tunis today within the framework of a mission that will also take him to Israel, with the objective of reactivating the peace process which has been suspended following the heinous Hebron massacre. It seems that the Russian move is based on an initiative that is independent from the U.S. moves in the region. It also seems that this move goes beyond the U.S. stand which in full harmony with the Israeli stand. This Russian move is aimed at reassessing the current situation in the Middle East approximately 28 months after the outset of the current peace process at the Madrid conference. Perhaps the focal point in the declared Russian initiative is based on reconvening the Madrid conference in light of a host of changes that have occurred in the Middle East in these long months, and based on a series of facts which were revealed by the peace negotiations, and which were not assessed objectively prior to the convening of the Madrid conference in October 1991. Since these changes and the series of facts, revealed by the peace talks over the past months, were not fully in harmony with the Israeli stand and with the objectives of the peace process placed by the Americans, the initial Israeli reaction opposed this initiative. Also, the initial U.S. reactions did not welcome this independent Russian initiative, the first since the end of the cold war. In light of all this, we welcome this timely Russian move aimed to launch the deadlocked peace process. We also support a process to reassess the peace process by one of the cosponsors who has been far away from the political arena in this region for a long time. We believe that the Russian foreign minister's mission is evidence that the involved parties have not accepted the unilateral sponsorship of the deadlocked peace process, particularly since the American sponsor has shown a lack of fairness and objectivity, if not complete bias toward the Israeli view.
