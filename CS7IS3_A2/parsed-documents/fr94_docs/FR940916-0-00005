Source: TPAD/ASCS/January 1994. As indicated, relevant peanut production costs increased from calendar year 1992 to 1993. The MY 1994 quota peanut price support level is accordingly established at $678.36 per st, up $3.43 per st from MY 1993. B. Additional Peanut Support Level Section 108B(b)(1) of the 1949 Act provides that price support shall be made available for additional peanuts at such level as the Secretary determines will ensure no losses to CCC from the sale or disposal of such peanuts, taking into consideration the demand for peanut oil and peanut meal, expected prices of other vegetable oils and protein meals, and the demand for peanuts in foreign markets. The MY 1994 price support level for additional peanuts is established at $132 per st to ensure no losses to CCC from the sale or disposal of such peanuts, up $0.91 per st from MY 1992. Peanuts are pledged as collateral for price support loans. The peanuts are then sold out of inventory in order to recoup the loan principal, interest and related costs. The statutory factors have been analyzed as set out below. Based on those factors, it is anticipated that while the current oil market is unusually strong, there is enough uncertainty in the market to suggest caution in setting the floor price for inventory peanuts sold for crushing. For that reason, it has been determined that the support rate should remain essentially unchanged from the level for additional peanuts that was in place for the 1993 crop, that being $131.09 per st. However, it was determined to increase the support level to reflect a similar percentage increase as applied to the quota support level, then rounded to the nearest whole dollar which should continue, it has been determined, to be a level which will reasonably assure no losses on the sale or disposal of additional peanuts for CCC. In making this determination, the following information was considered. 1. The domestic use of peanut oil during MY 1994 is forecast to be 117,500 st, up 6.8 percent from MY 1993 projected domestic use. MY 1994 peanut oil beginning stocks are expected to be 25,000 st, down 50 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average peanut oil price is expected to be $0.35 per pound, down $0.06 per pound from MY 1993. 2. The domestic use of peanut meal during MY 1994 is forecast to be 205,000 st, up 44,000 st from MY 1993 projected domestic use. MY 1994 peanut meal beginning stocks are expected to be 5,000 st, down 1,000 st from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average peanut meal price is expected to be $155 per st, up $45 per st from MY 1993. 3. The domestic disappearance of soybean oil during MY 1994 is forecast to be 6,525,000 st, up 1.2 percent from projected MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 soybean oil beginning stocks are expected to be 462,500 st, down 40.5 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average soybean oil price is expected to be $0.275 per pound, unchanged from MY 1993. 4. The domestic disappearance of cottonseed oil during MY 1994 is forecast to be 530,000 st, unchanged from projected MY 1993 domestic disappearance. MY 1994 cottonseed oil beginning stocks are expected to be 42,500 st, up 4.9 percent from MY 1993. The MY 1994 average cottonseed oil price is expected to be $0.29 per pound, down $0.005 from MY 1993.
