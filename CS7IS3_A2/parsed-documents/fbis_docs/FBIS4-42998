The youth festival in the old university town, in which 6,000 people will participate, should be a "festival of joy" two days after the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the landing of the Allied forces in Normandy, Kohl told DPA. The chancellor again reaffirmed that at no point he expressed the wish to participate in the ceremonies of the allies. "I do not believe that the German chancellor should have been in Normandy that day." However, on the occasion of the anniversary, he and Mitterrand thought about what the French and the Germans could do to make it clear that the French and the German peoples have become friends "50 years afterward." The deliberations led to the idea to organize a "festival of joy and friendship" with young people from both countries in Heidelberg. "We want to make it clear that we do not forget history, but that we want to learn from history," Kohl stated. Without the close partnership and friendship between France and Germany, a peaceful future in Europe is inconceivable.
