The council decided against depriving Rucs of his deputy's immunity. The group motivated the resolution with its Jan. 17 statement on the correctness of Rucs' actions during the Jan. 10 incident between Latvian authorities and Russian generals. During the debate, Riga Mayor Andris Teikmanis claimed that only court could decide on the guilt or innocence of Rucs. Teikmanis also urged the Prosecutor's Office and court to investigate into Rucs' actions. Rucs has said he ordered the detention of the two generals because they threatened to use force to regain the seized buildings. The investigation materials, however, lack corresponding evidence, senior investigator Biruta Ulpe told BNS. Rucs' defense attourney Valdis Strauts denies showings of a crime in the case since it was not preliminary planned and "Rucs did all he could to prevent the conflict." The Vidzeme council of people's deputies is still busy with chairman elections. Among the candidates are Rucs, who was fired under a government resolution, acting Chairwoman Velta Nesaule and Deputy Chairman Karlis Lapins. As reported, Major General Anatoli Vodopyanov and Major General Nikolai Tailokov were arrested Jan. 10 after Rucs' directive. The Prosecutor's Office launched investigation on the same day for excess of service authority and illegal detention.
