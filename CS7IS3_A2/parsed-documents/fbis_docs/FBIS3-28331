Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's proposal to introduce a 7 percent indirect tax, Ozawa said on a television show that he accepts the idea of setting up a new tax as a special purpose levy on condition that the public will approve. In a predawn news conference Thursday, Hosokawa announced the plan to impose the 7 percent "national welfare tax" on almost all goods and services from April 1997. It would replace the current 3 percent consumption tax, whose revenues go into the nation's general account budget. In protest against the new tax, the SDP, the largest force in the seven-party coalition government, has threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet and quit the government, saying the new tax would amount to a de facto doubling of the current consumption tax. The SDP has demanded that any increase in revenue from the new tax be specifically allocated for welfare purposes and that a forum be set up within the coalition to discuss when the tax should be raised and by how much. Leaders of the government and coalition parties will meet again Monday to seek a compromise on the matter. Differences within the coalition parties and the government over the issue have forced the government to delay announcing a much-awaited massive economic stimulus package, including 5.3 trillion yen in income and residential tax cuts.
