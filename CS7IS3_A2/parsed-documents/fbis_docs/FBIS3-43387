[passage omitted] [Begin Habyarimana recording] Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, my sincere thanks for responding to my invitation, for being here. I have invited you to this morning's ceremony. I have especially invited the relevant people. However, just like you, I have noted that the president of the Constitutional Court is not present. I would like to recall Article 7 of the agreement on the various questions and final dispositions. Article 7 says in its penultimate paragraph that the deputies to the transitional assembly shall swear before the president of the Republic in the presence of the president of the Constitutional Court. As the president of the Constitutional Court is not here, the disposition cannot be fulfilled. I also note that no deputy of the RPF is present. Those I asked to check on those present have told me about this, that no deputy of the RPF is present in the hall and that no deputy of the Social Democratic Party is present. This is in addition to the absence of the president of the Constitutional Court. Therefore, it is my duty to postpone the session, but I remain ready to convene it again once the relevant people are present, that is to say the deputies who will be sworn in, and once the authorities mentioned in Article 7 are available to accomplish their duties. Therefore, I am postponing the session. I once again thank you for being here, for troubling yourselves. I would like to make a special call, especially to those not present, and to the international community, especially our friends who accompanied us to Arusha for more than one year to negotiate the peace agreement, for each of us to make a real and obvious effort, so that the international community can assist us. Also I hope that Rwanda sets up the transitional institutions as planned in the Arusha agreement, first of all the transitional national assembly, and then the broad-based transitional government. In addition to my thanks, I wish you a good evening. The session has therefore been postponed for the reasons given and I am ready to reconvene it once the difficulties that we encountered this evening have been resolved. [end recording]
