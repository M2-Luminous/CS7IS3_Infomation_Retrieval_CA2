An EPA official said the north of Taiwan was at greatest risk, but that the pattern exists around the island. According to data collected by the EPA from 12 sites around the island from September [word indistinct] through March 1994, the rain falling at Wanli, a coastal township about 30 minutes drive from Taipei, was the most acidic, with an average pH level of 4.3. pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in water. The range of PH values is from 0 to 14. The pH levels from 0 to 7 indicate acidity, with 0 being the most acidic, and pH levels from 7 to 14 indicate alkalinity. A pH level from 6 to 8 is considered safe. The pH levels in rain at all 12 sites the EPA kept statistics for were all below 6. The EPA statistics show that rain falling at Wanli and Panchiao, a suburb of Taipei, [words indistinct] levels of 3.9 in January, while Yangmingshan and Kuanying -- also in the north -- also had especially acidic rainfall. The lowest levels of acidity in rain were found in Taihsi in western Taiwan and Taitung in the southeast. The pH levels there were 5.6 -- signaling a smaller threat to the environment, but a threat nonetheless.
