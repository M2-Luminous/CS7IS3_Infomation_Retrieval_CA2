After the Geneva conference was put off on Thursday, even those world analysts who are in favour of the federation, now admit that it is only a temporary political alliance with the two sides differing in all interests but one -- to fight the Bosnian Serbs. The Geneva peace conference, scheduled by special U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, was cancelled because it was attended only by the delegations of the Bosnian Serbs, headed by their president Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Croats, headed by the president of the Muslim-Croat Federation Kresimir Zubak. The Bosnian Muslim delegation, headed by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, failed to appear. This has raised the question of who can the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation be represented by if not by its own president. It is apparently being represented, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and abroad, by each of its constituents respectively. This leaves the Bosnian Serbs at a loss of who they should negotiate with in the peace process? -- the Croats, Muslims or the Muslim-Croat federation's delegation. The federation is practically being disregarded by its own constituents, which is evident from the fact that not even after its constituent assembly was held did any of its officials seek its international recognition. The Muslims and Croats are reluctant to do so because this would pave the way for an international recognition of the Bosnian Serb Republic too and bring into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's U.N. membership. They have complied with a sheer formality, deliberately evading to resolve one of the crucial issues -- territorial delineation. Western analysts already portray the federation as nothing but a farce. This has recently been confirmed by Hans Koschick of Germany, the administrator of Mostar, who was appalled at the extent of the hate between Mostar's Muslims and Croats. After a year of bitter war over territories, the Bosnian Muslims and Croats, acting under strong pressure from the United States, agreed in Washington on March 18 to set up a binational federation, which would form confederal ties with neighbouring Croatia. Political analysts assess that the federation was aimed at isolating the Bosnian Serbs and at pressuring them into accepting a peace settlement tailored to the needs of the West.
