Local officials told reporters that the gross domestic product of the autonomous region was expected to reach 37.7 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 10 percent compared with the corresponding figure of 1992, while local revenue grew by 33.1 percent to 3.47 billion yuan. Big increases were also seen in total agricultural and industrial output value, imports and exports, the amount of promised foreign investment, and investment in fixed assets, according to the report. Further reform measures in rural areas have greatly emancipated the productive forces of the autonomous region's countryside and pastoral areas, the officials said. By 1993 Xinjiang had been blessed with bumper harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry for 16 years running. Last year, the output of grain and cotton was expected to reach seven million tons and 700,000 tons, respectively, said the officials, adding that Xinjiang has become China's No. 1 producer of cotton. At the same time, the continuation of the policies for opening border areas has promoted the opening-up drive of the whole autonomous region. Last year, Xinjiang scored an increase of 30.6 percent in its imports and exports, and did 910 million U.S. dollars in foreign trade. The region has approved the establishment of 363 foreign-funded enterprises in the past year, involving an actual use of 55 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, while working hard to promote economic and technological co-operation with inland areas, and setting up its own economic and technological development zones. As an effort to improve conditions for economic construction and to create a better environment for opening, the region has speeded up its building of basic facilities over the past few years. In 1993 alone, Xinjiang invested 22.6 billion yuan in fixed assets and launched 35 major construction projects, including the double-tracking of 475.5 km of the railway from Lanzhou to Urumqi, building or rebuilding nine major highways, and the construction of the plant with a designed capacity of 140,000 tons of ethylene. In the meantime, Xinjiang region scored a series of breakthroughs in prospecting for oil and natural gas, nonferrous metals and other natural resources last year. It produced 10.35 million tons of crude oil in that year and gained a processing capacity of 7.65 million tons of crude oil a year. Local residents benefited from the overall economic development of the region. For instance, the per capita income for farmers and herdsmen of the region amounted to 780 yuan, up 5.4 percent compared with the level of the previous year. This year the local government has decided to continue to concentrate on the development of farming, energy, transportation and telecommunications, as well as on the building of infrastructure, industries serving the development of oil and gas, light and processing industries with farm and sideline products as the raw materials, and the establishment of rural and township businesses in the fields of industry and the service trades, according to the officials.
