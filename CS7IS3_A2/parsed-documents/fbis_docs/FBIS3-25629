The government hereby condemns these blind and undemocratic acts of violence and launches an urgent appeal to all opposition party leaders and all citizens to help create an atmosphere of tolerance that would guarantee freedom of speech for all, and thus prevent our dear motherland from becoming a closed field of sterile political struggle at a time when all states in the subregion are preoccupied by the economic problems caused by the devaluation of the CFA franc. Our country Togo gives the impression of prioritizing the political debate to the detriment of the daily difficulties facing the majority of our people. The government, in its concern to protect our common interest, will take all necessary measures to maintain public order and to assure the security of people and property throughout the national territory. Firm instructions have been given to the security forces to prevent all disturbances and to deal with all troublemakers in our cities and villages. They will be sought after and brought to court.
