He indicated that he plans to urge Japanese trade officials during future negotiations to promptly implement deregulation measures, saying: "The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton gives solid support to deregulation efforts which have been undertaken by the administrations of both former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and incumbent Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We hope that concrete progress can be made in one way or another within the next few months." Regarding the outlook on the resumed framework trade talks, Garten said: "We expect tough negotiations. At the moment, I cannot say whether the United States and Japan can reach a satisfactory agreement." Thus, the U.S. official made reference to the issue of deregulation, while indicating a cautious stance on the prospects of the trade talks. Garten also pointed out the problem of the gap in prices of commodities in Japan and abroad, saying: "Prices in Japan are 80 percent higher than the average prices in other OECD member nations. This is because there is a problem with the distribution system in Japan." Garten then said: "Deregulation is very important. It will enable Japanese consumers to buy foreign products at lower prices. It will also encourage personal spending, thereby helping boost the Japanese economy all the more."
