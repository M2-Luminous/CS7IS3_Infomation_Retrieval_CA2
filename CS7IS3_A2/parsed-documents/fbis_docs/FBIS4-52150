The politically sensitive current account surplus, measuring goods, services and some unilateral transfers like grant aid, hit 130.04 billion dollars before adjustment for seasonal factors in the year ended in March, the ministry said in a preliminary report. In yen terms, the surplus receded for the first time in three years and within the current account, the trade surplus shrank in volume terms, a ministry official said. "It seems to [be] peaking out" in dollar terms as well, he said, although the critical dollar-denominated figure is at the mercy of such variables as exchange rates and oil prices. The surplus grew in dollar terms during the first two quarters of the fiscal year from year-earlier levels, then shrank in the second two quarters, the official said. The fiscal 1993 trade surplus rose 4.9 percent on a balance-of-payments basis to 142.80 billion dollars. Imports, growing 6.9 percent to 213.20 billion dollars, outstripped the growth of exports, which were up 6.1 percent to 356.00 billion dollars. For March alone, the current account surplus fell 16.1 percent from the same month a year before to 15.76 billion dollars, although the official said monthly figures are too volatile to set a trend. The March trade surplus fell 0.7 percent from a year before to 15.22 billion dollars, with imports up 10.3 percent to 20.40 billion dollars and exports up 5.3 percent to 35.61 billion dollars. Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Center, agreed that Japan's towering current account surplus has peaked. "It will fall in this fiscal year," he said. There will be months of swelling amid the contraction but the trend is toward a gradually narrowing imbalance, Takagi said. Export growth continues to slow, the ministry official said, while import growth remains firm. Indeed, the yen-denominated surplus shrank 10.3 percent in fiscal 1993 and the trade surplus slimmed 9.1 percent, with both posting double-digit declines in March, he said. The surpluses, in closely watched dollar terms, continue to be swayed by the yen's historic rise over the past year. The yen value used by the ministry for export prices soared 15.7 percent in fiscal 1993 to an average 108.17 yen to the dollar. A higher yen is expected to curb Japan's surplus over time by making exports pricier in foreign currencies and imports cheaper in yen terms. But in the short run, a high yen inflates the dollar-denominated figures, causing the surplus to look like an inverted letter "J" on a graph. "The J-curve effect is over," Takagi said. He said it is possible that the current account surplus could meet the government's forecast of shrinking to 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product this fiscal year from around 3.1 percent the year before. Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said a "downward trend has emerged" in the current account surplus, noting the volume and yen-based declines. He told a regular press conference, "I think it will continue to decline." Chief economist Jesper Koll at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc. predicted a sharper decline, noting the four-quarter decline in yen terms and the two quarters of shrinkage even in dollar terms. "I think it's going to fall like a rock," he said, reckoning that at the current pace the current account surplus would be less than 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by the end of December. "The dynamics are coming through in all the numbers," Koll said. "Imports are growing at double-digits, and exports are flattish." Among the rising imports were semiconductors and wood products, the ministry official said. Although crude oil imports were nearly flat by volume, the price dropped 13 percent to an average 16.73 dollars a barrel in fiscal 1993, depressing the dollar figure, he said. Automobiles were among the export decliners, the official said, but semiconductors and auto parts surged. Strong U.S. demand has helped those sectors in recent months even as other Japanese exporters have been crippled by the high yen. In addition to the visible trade flows, Japan posted a deficit in services of 5.77 billion dollars in fiscal 1993, expanding 15.0 percent, the ministry said. The March services surplus shrank 58.3 percent to 1.78 billion dollars.
