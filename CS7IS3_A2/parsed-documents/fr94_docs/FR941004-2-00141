FR941004-2-00141 FR941004-2-00081 Employment and Training Administration [NAFTA_00111] Elf Atochem North America, Inc. Industrial Chemicals Division Tacoma, WA; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration On July 25, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance for former workers engaged in employment related to the production of chlor-alkali products at the subject firm. Investigation findings show that the subject plant ceased production on April 20, 1994 resulting in the separation of all the Tacoma workers. On reconsideration, new information was obtained showing that a major customer switched its entire purchases of sodium chlorate from the subject firm to a Canadian supplier. Company officials indicated that they decided to close the Tacoma plant because of additional Canadian chlor-alkali capacity coming on-line. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that Elf Atochem's workers in Tacoma, Washington were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the chlor-alkali products produced at Elf Atochem, Tacoma, Washington. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the Elf Atochem workers in Tacoma, Washington. All workers of Elf Atochem in Tacoma, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 22nd day of September 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
