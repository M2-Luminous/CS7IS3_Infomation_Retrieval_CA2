This was announced in an interview with ITAR-TASS by First Deputy Interior Minister of Tajikistan, Major-General Gennadiy Blinov. He explained that the owners of such plantations are, as a rule, were alarmed and often have tested ties with local authorities. [as received] The wave of drug-trafficking and drug abuse continues to sweep Tajikistan, which has become a major base from which narcotics are delivered to near abroad and Western Europe, Gennadiy Blinov said. He stressed that practically one half of crimes committed in the republic is associated with the narco-business. Since the beginning of this year, Tajikistan's security forces have suppressed 19 attempts at illegal exports of unprocessed opium and hashish and located tens of underground syndicates specialising in manufacturing and storing narcotics, the general said. A total of 200 kilograms of drugs have been seized. However according to General Blinov, the main flow of drugs comes from neighbouring Afghanistan to Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, where several drug barons run mafia-like groups. According to Gennadiy Blinov, the drug flow from Afghanistan can be suppressed by tightening control over the Pamir stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border, which regrettably remains highly transparent. For a number of reasons only between 15 and 20 in each hundred of crimes associated with narcotics are ever exposed, the general said. He called for a comprehensive state programme and concerted efforts of the security agencies of all Commonwealth member-countries, whose ties have weakened considerably since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
