A just and comprehensive peace, as well as security and stability, cannot be established in the region without taking into account Syria's interests and its ever-increasing important regional standing. Abu-Hilal noted that the Syrian-U.S. summit affirmed that the United States needs to enhance and deepen its contacts with Syria and understand Syria's positions in the talks with Israel. The summit showed Syria's weight and its principled stance of adhering to the principle of a comprehensive and just solution in the region on all fronts on the basis of international legitimacy's resolutions, especially Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, as well as to the principle of land for peace as opposed to separate deals and bilateral solutions. Abu-Hilal stressed that Syria's adherence to this stance is being welcomed and supported on the pan-Arab level, particularly by the Palestinians. As for the results expected in the wake of this summit, Abu-Hilal expressed the belief that it will bring swift results. One of the immediate results of the summit is the revival of the peace process and the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the Arab parties in Washington. Abu-Hilal said that the Syrian president spelled out the concept of a just and comprehensive peace and that the ball is now in the Israeli court. Israel's behavior will either increase or reduce the chances of achieving a comprehensive and just peace in return for full withdrawal on all fronts. Abu-Hilal ruled out the possibility of Syria striking out, either now or later, against the Palestinian factions opposed to the Oslo accord, especially following the Syrian leadership's affirmation that this is a Palestinian concern and that it is legitimate for those factions to express their political views in a democratic way. Moreover, striking out against those factions is not in Syria's national and pan-Arab interests.
