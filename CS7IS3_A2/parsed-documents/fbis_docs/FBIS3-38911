In a statement he issued today, FDP leader Ismet Kotak said that his party wants Britain, which is on the side of the wrongdoers in Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina, to get up and leave the bases in Cyprus. Kotak urged the Turkish Cypriot people to take a stand against every British action in Cyprus, stressing that there is no room for a third state in Cyprus. The FDP leader pointed out that the world must condemn the stand before clear massacres of those who are opposed to the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. He urged the world to protest the present British Government.
