FR941216-0-00034 FR941216-0-00011 Service Response : Section 4 of the Act directs the Service to consider only the best scientific and commercial data available when making a decision regarding the appropriateness of listing a species as endangered or threatened; economic impacts are not considered in this evaluation. Economic factors are only to be considered in the designation of critical habitat. Issue 9 : Several commenters contended that listing constitutes taking of private property by the Federal government without compensation to the landowner. Service Response : Listing of the arroyo toad under the Endangered Species Act will trigger the protective measures of section 9 of the Act, prohibiting the take of this species. In addition, the Act requires that Federal agencies insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species, or destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat, if any is designated. Any activity on private land that requires Federal involvement (such as a section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act) that may affect this species would have to be reviewed by the Service to insure that the continued existence of the species would not be jeopardized. Listing under the Act does not imply that private land would be confiscated or taken without just compensation. Recovery planning for the arroyo toad may include recommendations for land acquisition or easements involving private landowners. These efforts only would be undertaken with the cooperation of the landowner. In the majority of cases, private landowners are not precluded from using their land in the manner originally intended. Issue 10 : One commenter requested that the proposed listing of the arroyo toad be delayed until the Service could investigate the possibility of implementing an arroyo toad hatchery and transplanting program. Service Response : Section 2 of the Endangered Species Act states that the purpose of the Act is to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend may be conserved. Captive breeding programs, such as the hatchery proposed by the commenter, may be considered in planning for the recovery of some listed species but are not a substitute for recovery of listed species in the wild. See the Service's response to Issue 5 above. Issue 11 : One commenter asked if the arroyo toad's decline is tied to the worldwide amphibian decline. Service Response : The Endangered Species Act permits the listing of species that have become rare due to both natural and manmade factors. The decline of the arroyo toad may be due in part to the as-yet-unknown factors causing the decline of amphibians throughout the world. As summarized in the proposed rule, however, habitat degradation, predation by introduced species, and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms have played a significant role in the arroyo toad's decline. Issue 12 : One commenter stated that the decision to list the arroyo toad should be withheld until the genetic studies prove that the arroyo toad is a distinct species. Service Response : Section 3(15) of the Act states that ``(T)he term ``species'' includes any subspecies of fish or wildlife or plants .␣.␣. which interbreeds when mature.'' Therefore, for the purposes of the Act, this subspecies is treated as a species. Determination of full species status is not necessary to proceed with listing the arroyo toad. Issue 13 : One commenter questioned the Service's preparation of a proposed rule prior to receipt of a petition. The commenter suggested that this indicated impropriety, and an unacceptably close relationship with the petitioners, on the part of the Service. Service Response : Section 4(b) of the Act establishes two methods by which a species may be considered for listing. Section 4(b)(1)(A) describes the process followed by the Service when the Service initiates a listing proposal. Section 4(b)(3)(A) describes the process of initiating a listing action in response to a petition. In each case, the Service conducts a status review of the species. A status review takes into account the best available scientific and commercial information, including published reports and consultations with experts, regarding the species to determine if it should be provided protection under the Act. In the case of the arroyo toad, as discussed above, the Service had completed a status review of the species and drafted a proposed rule (pursuant to section 4(b)(1)(A)) before the petition was received. Issue 14 : Two commenters contended that adequate regulatory mechanisms are currently in place to protect the arroyo toad, because the species occurs largely on National Forest lands. Therefore, any action that could affect the species would undergo environmental review pursuant to National Environmental Policy Act. Service Response : As stated in the proposed rule and this final rule, the arroyo toad has been extirpated from an estimated 75 percent of its former range. Although a substantial proportion of currently occupied habitat is found on National Forest lands, recovery of arroyo toads on privately owned lands will likely be necessary to restore the species to levels that will permit removal from the endangered species list. The commenters are correct in stating that actions on Federal lands would be subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, the objective of NEPA is to ensure that Federal agencies consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action. The law does not guarantee that actions with significant impacts will not be authorized. Therefore, NEPA will be applied to actions that affect the arroyo toad, but it does not assure protection for the species.
