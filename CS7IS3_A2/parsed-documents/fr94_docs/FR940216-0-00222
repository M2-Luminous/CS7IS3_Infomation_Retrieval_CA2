FR940216-0-00222 FR940216-0-00010 (ii) The actual total using the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER16FE94.008 where V i =the volume of gasoline batch i parm i =the parameter value of gasoline batch i n=the number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the averaging period (2) For each standard, compare the actual total with the compliance total. (3) For the VOC, NO X , and toxics emissions performance and oxygen standards, the actual totals must be equal to or greater than the compliance totals to achieve compliance. (4) For RVP and benzene standards, the actual total must be equal to or less than the compliance totals to achieve compliance. (5) If the actual total for the oxygen standard is less than the compliance total, or if the actual total for the benzene standard is greater than the compliance total, credits for these parameters must be obtained from another refiner, importer or (in the case of oxygen) oxygenate blender in order to achieve compliance: (i) The total number of oxygen credits required to achieve compliance is calculated by subtracting the actual total from the compliance total oxygen; and (ii) The total number of benzene credits required to achieve compliance is calculated by subtracting the compliance total from the actual total benzene. (6) If the actual total for the oxygen standard is greater than the compliance total, or if the actual total for the benzene standard is less than the compliance totals, credits for these parameters are generated: (i) The total number of oxygen credits which may be traded to another refinery, importer, or oxygenate blender is calculated by subtracting the compliance total from the actual total for oxygen; and (ii) The total number of benzene credits which may be traded to another refinery or importer is calculated by subtracting the actual total from the compliance total for benzene. (h) Credit transfers. (1) Compliance with the averaged standards specified in ยง80.41 for oxygen and benzene (but for no other standards or requirements) may be achieved through the transfer of oxygen and benzene credits provided that: (i) The credits were generated in the same averaging period as they are used; (ii) The credit transfer takes place no later than fifteen working days following the end of the averaging period in which the reformulated gasoline credits were generated; (iii) The credits are properly created; (iv) The credits are transferred directly from the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender that creates the credits to the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender that uses the credits to achieve compliance; (v) Oxygen credits are generated, transferred, and used: (A) In the case of gasoline subject to the simple model standards, only in the following categories: (1) VOC-controlled, non-OPRG; (2) Non-VOC-controlled, non-OPRG; (3) Non-VOC-controlled, OPRG; and (4) VOC-controlled, OPRG; and (B) In the case of gasoline subject to the complex model standards, only in the following categories: (1) OPRG; and (2) Non-OPRG; (vi) Oxygen credits generated from gasoline subject to the complex model standards are not used to achieve compliance for gasoline subject to the simple model standards; (vii) Oxygen credits are not used to achieve compliance with the minimum oxygen content standards in ยง80.41; and (viii) Benzene credits are not used to achieve compliance with the maximum benzene content standards in ยง80.41. (2) No party may transfer any credits to the extent such a transfer would result in the transferor having a negative credit balance at the conclusion of the averaging period for which the credits were transferred. Any credits transferred in violation of this paragraph are improperly created credits. (3) In the case of credits that were improperly created, the following provisions apply: (i) Improperly created credits may not be used to achieve compliance, regardless of a credit transferee's good faith belief that it was receiving valid credits; (ii) No refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender may create, report, or transfer improperly created credits; and (iii) Where any credit transferor has in its balance at the conclusion of any averaging period both credits which were properly created and credits which were improperly created, the properly created credits will be applied first to any credit transfers before the transferor may apply any credits to achieve its own compliance.
