As I announce this to the world I would like to stress that the government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has been asking for the necessity of convening an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council so that steps may be taken to put an end to the Sanaa regime's defiance of the resolutions of the Security Council and the appeals of the international community. I also appeal to the fraternal Arab and Muslim countries and the friendly countries, as well as the five permanent members of the Security Council, to take decisive measures with regard to the Sanaa regime which is rejecting everything and insisting on the logic of force, particularly after this has been demonstrated to everyone.
