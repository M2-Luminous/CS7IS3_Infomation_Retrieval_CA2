FR941005-2-00126 FR941005-2-00088 According to the Exchange, a number of member organizations along with the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') informed the Exchange that many of their customers do not want to receive proxy materials, or vote the proxy. These member organizations have indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals represent their interests in receiving and voting proxies because they are better qualified. In addition, the Exchange is amending Rule 575 to conform that Rule to a comparable New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule which allows a member organization, that is designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan, to vote the proxies on the stock in accordance with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. 8 8 This NYSE Rule currently states that no member organization shall give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name, or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted under the provisions of Rule 452, unless such member organization is the beneficial owner of such stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any member organization, designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan that expressly grants discretion to the investment manager to manage, acquire, or dispose of any plan asset and which has not expressly reserved the proxy voting right for the named fiduciary, may vote the proxies in accordance with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. See NYSE Rule 450, Restriction on Giving of Proxies. The Amex believes that it is appropriate to modify these Amex rules to conform to NYSE rules because most Amex member firms doing a public business are dual members of both the NYSE and Amex, and the rules of the two exchanges regarding proxies and voting have historically been substantially the same. Amex Rule 575 (``Giving of Proxies Restricted'') currently provides that no member organization shall give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name, or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted under the provisions of Rule 577, unless the member organization is the beneficial owner of the stock. The Exchange proposes to add two exceptions (paragraphs (1) and (2)) to Rule 575. Paragraph (1) would provide that any member organization designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan that expressly grants discretion to the investment manager to manage, acquire, or dispose of any plan asset and which has not expressly reserved the proxy voting right for the named fiduciary may vote the proxies in accordance with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. Paragraph (2) would provide that any person registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and who has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner (``designated investment adviser'') to vote the proxies for stock which is in the possession or control of the member organization, may vote such proxy. Amex Rule 576 (``Transmission of Proxy Material to Customers'') generally provides that, whenever a person soliciting proxies furnishes a member organization copies of all soliciting material for registered holders, and provides assurance that he will reimburse such member organization for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such solicitation, such member shall transmit to each beneficial owner of stock which is in its possession or control, the material furnished. The Exchange is amending Rule 576, paragraph (a) to add the requirement that the member organization may also transmit the soliciting material to a designated investment adviser to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner. The Exchange also is amending Rules 576(b) (1) and (2), which deal with what soliciting material the member organization receiving proxy information shall transmit and when such transmission shall occur. As amended, Rule 576(b)(1) provides that the member organization shall transmit, with soliciting material, a request for voting instruction and a statement to the effect that, if such instructions are not received by the tenth day before the meeting, the proxy may be given at discretion by the owner of record of the stock, provided that such statement may be made only when the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser at least fifteen days before the meeting. As amended, Rule 576(b)(1) also provides that when the proxy soliciting material is transmitted to the beneficial owner of the stock or to the beneficial owner's designated investment adviser twenty-five days or more before the meeting, the statement accompanying such material shall be to the effect that the proxy may be given fifteen days before the meeting at the discretion of the owner of record of the stock.
