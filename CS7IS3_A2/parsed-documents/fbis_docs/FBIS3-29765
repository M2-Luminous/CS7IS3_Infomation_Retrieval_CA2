On the United States' position that it will not hesitate to impose sanctions against Japan, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, at a news conference the same day, said, "We would like to negotiate so that that may not take place. We still have time," but then added, "This question should be dealt with at the private-sector level; it is difficult to say how much the government can do." Apparently, not even a lead has been found yet on how to resolve the "cellular phone war" between Japan and the United States. Japan IDO Tsushin [Mobile Communication] Company (IDO) has accepted almost all of Motorola Company's demands including those which can be said to be even irrational. What the company can do has reached the limit. Tateo Tsukada, president of the company, poured out his anger, "Motorola in documents on negotiations used the word must. That is no word for a supplier to use in dealing with a client." The confrontation between the two companies has driven them into a state of being emotional. Not much can be hoped for from the private-sector negotiations the government wants to rely on. President Tsukada has many reasons to be angry, and one of them is the final compromise plan offered by Motorola. Motorola in it suggested IDO "buy 225,000 sets of Motorola-made phones." What it means is that since IDO plans to provide service to a maximum of 450,000 subscribers by making investments in the future, Motorola suggests IDO use Motorla phones in half of them. Under the current cellular phone service system, the phones are rented to customers by telecommunications companies like NTT Docomo and IDO, but after April, all phones are set to be sold freely, thus enabling sales agents of these companies, as well as other big stores, to sell them. Consequently, the two companies are now in the process of getting ready for the change -- NTT Docomo abolishing its practice of taking guarantee money of 100,000 yen effective October next year and IDO lowering its price of phones, while both of them trying to get rid of all the phones on hand. For instance, if a set costs 50,000 yen, the total will come to 10 billion yen. Regardless of how competitive Motorola's phones may be, 225,000 sets is a large number. It can be a matter of life or death for IDO to add this number of phones to its stock. At present, IDO is using phones made by NEC Corporation, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Nippondenso Company, while the cellular phone companies affiliated with Danini Denden Company, which use the Motorola system, are using phones made by Motorola, Sony Corporation, Kyocera Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., Toshiba Corporation, and Oki Electric Industry Company. Besides, there are moves by other companies joining the group of manufacturers after April, and according to an electric machinery manufacturer, "it is evident that Japanese electric home appliance manufacturers will eventually win" [in the competition for the cellular phone market]. Apparently, Motorola's demands which can be interpreted as being "aimed at cleaning up Motorola's inventories" are making the resolution of the issue difficult.
