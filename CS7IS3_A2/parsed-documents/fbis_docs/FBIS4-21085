FBIS4-21085 "jptdd015__l94046" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 11 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Narcotics Activity in Bellavista Detailed Narcotics Activity in Bellavista Detailed 94WD0290A Lima SI in Spanish 28 Feb-6 Mar 94 pp 32-39, 73 94WD0290A Lima SI Spanish CSO [Article by Jose Arrieta: "Pretty Sight?"] [Text] No one in Huallaga could doubt that the capture of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, alias "Vaticano," has considerably reduced the drug trafficking activity in the zone. Both travelers and local residents comment on it. However, it would be unrealistic to think that, just because the "chief of all churches"--firms--(hence the name, "Vaticano") is behind bars, they will stop operating. Similarly, the fact that "La Catedral" (Campanilla) is now virtually closed, owing to the suspension of flights at its famous airport, and that the chief and his brothers have been captured, does not mean that the activity has disappeared. It has simply been transferred. And in what direction has this "strategic withdrawal" been aimed? SI confirmed this week that the drug traffic's new church in the jungle is located in Bellavista. A small settlement situated midway between Tarapoto and Juanjui, Bellevista is now the site on which the chiefs of the leading firms are operating. And, as Campanilla was during its best times, it is impregnable. As evidence of this, on Friday, 25 February, a military counternarcotics operation intended to capture the number one man after "Vaticano's" downfall, namely, Waldo Vargas Arias, alias "El Ministro," failed. The latter, just as "Vaticano" did previously, shows up only sporadically in Bellavista. He does not need to be there full-time to supervise the work, for which he has his aides, such as "El Baron" (who was captured in Friday's operation), the son of "Mosca Loca" [Crazy Fly], and other major firm chiefs located there. And they are operating, which is why SI was in the locality this week. People still recall the years when "Vaticano" operated in Campanilla with the protection and complicity of the Armed Forces, and without anyone making a comment. The following is an exclusive account of how the country's leading drug trafficking firms are operating in Bellavista, with the names of those assisting them: All Routes What most attracts the attention of the traveler arriving in (or passing through) Bellavista is the intense movement on its streets. In the square, in the market, in every bar or shop, or on the endless rugged paths to houses, there are people (mostly men) conversing, purchasing, and making deals. That is why this small settlement appears to be housing more inhabitants than it really has: The visitors, who can spend hours in the locality, double the Bellavista population's numbers. The odd part of it is that, despite so many people and so much movement, there are no crowds, nor anything of the sort. The reason is that they all fit and are distributed comfortably on Bellavista's four levels. A hill to the right of the town (coming from the direction of Tarapoto) is what expands its premises with four "levels." And each of them also serves as a link in the chain established for moving drugs in Bellavista. The heart (at least the urban one) of the town is situated on the first level: main square, church, market, and truck stop. It is ostensibly a peaceful jungle town: young people sitting in comfortable rockers at the doors of houses and bars, listening to music while holding small glasses of beer. Suddenly, something in the atmosphere indicates a warning: there are suspicious looks and a slow movement of hands toward the bags under the rockers holding small machine guns. The settlers know than when the henchmen think that they have detected an "infiltrated" person (from the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] or the police), they either chase them shooting, or "stand in the way." At one particular point, a red Toyota crosses the street. It is "El Baron's" car. No one moves; the chief is passing by. Two blocks from the main square, in a direction opposite the hill, lies the river. The dock used for travel on the swift-running Huallaga is located there, waiting for the trucks loaded with drugs. They must carry them to La Union, where there is a clandestine airport. The flights leave from there, bound for Colombia. A boat carries the shipment to the other side of the river, where another truck is waiting to take it to its destination. Most of the drugs leaving Bellavista come from Collpa, Dos de Mayo, Eslabon, Tabalosos, Sacachimonte, Pachiza, Sacachini, Shanan, Huicungo, Saposoa, Tres Unidos, Piscuyacu, and Campanilla itself. They arrive on countless routes. That is why the drivers of the double-cab trucks carrying passengers, which are the ones also transporting drugs, are known as "route men." One of them revealed to SI that the rate for transporting one kg of drugs delivered in Bellavista averages $20. The transportation is achieved with no problems, because all the police inspectors have been properly "taken care of." The informant adds: "The Morales post and the one in Tabalosos are just a minor example of the police corruption. Of course, if you don't pay, you could have problems." "Official Permit" When the "route men" arrive in Bellavista, they contact the "passers," who are youths assigned to contact the firm chiefs, and who seek the best price for their potential clients. They receive a commission from both the client and the purchaser. As one "passer" remarks: "In five minutes we can easily make 200 new soles. As a rule, each of us makes about five passes a day." On the dock, two youths who arrived on a motorcycle approached the team from SI. One of them asked why photos were being taken. After we identified ourselves, displaying our reporters' ID cards, the stranger repeated: "You have taken photos of my chief's car, haven't you?" That was the signal letting us know that SI's activity had been watched at all times. After conversing with each other, the strangers hesitated slightly, remarking that it would be a good idea to cross the river and observe a massacre of 30 persons committed by the DEA a few weeks ago in one of its operations. And, finally, they gave their verdict: "All right, keep taking photos, but we don't want you to take them of persons, much less houses." They climbed onto their motorcycles and took off. Upon boarding, one of them disclosed the grip of a revolver in his belt. Although it may seem untrue, this "official permit" proved more effective than the one granted by the military base chief, an Army captain known as "Peter." The Bellavista military base is located on the second level, and is reached by the main road of the settlement itself, after rounding a curve. From there one may observe and inspect the town's main streets. Permission was requested from Captain "Peter" to take panoramic photos of the town, which he granted. However, when we returned to the first level, a civilian approached to indicate that he had a message from the captain. "I have notified the `patas' (narcos) to make `room' for the reporters, and to get out of town." This person claimed that the officer had said that no one should give us any kind of information on the drug traffic, "because, otherwise, everything would be ruined." On the second level is the old airport, currently the only one that should be operating officially in Bellavista. Up higher, on the fourth level, a new official landing strip is being built by 30 members of an Army engineering company with headquarters in Juanjui. An expanse of 800 meters has been planned for the new runway, which will be under the control of the Peruvian Air Force [FAP]. However, according to some accounts, small planes are landing on the 280 meters already equipped for operations, to take on drugs. And this runway is only a five-minute journey from the military base headed by Captain "Peter." On the Third Level According to information collected by SI, the entire population of Bellavista knows that the chiefs of the "firms" hold constant talks with the officers at the military base. Where? In broad daylight, in restaurants located on the third level (the one after the level where the base is located). There, amid barbecues, cured meat, and tacacho (typical jungle dishes), as well as abundant liquor, all paid for by the "narcos," these talks are taking place. Less than 500 meters from the base, on the third level, are the houses in which the firms are installed. One settler commented indignantly that the base officers "even have the nerve to drive by in cars and on motorcycles owned by the zone's "traqueteros" [handlers] and drug traffickers." The resident went on to say: "All of us here know that drugs are obvious to, and patiently accepted by everyone. The `narcos' weigh the drugs in the middle of public thoroughfares, and both policemen and the military go by here without intervening. They even exchange friendly greetings." This informant also remarked that the military charge an average of $15,000 per flight. The flights are currently leaving the Biabo zone, a 20 minute trip from the center of Bellavista. There is a clandestine airport, called La Union, there. According to a report received in the zone, on 18 February a flight took off loaded with approximately 500 kg of drugs. The shipment had originally departed from Madera. Just as in Campanilla, where the "pato" [duck] system (military helicopters carrying drugs) had operated, there is also an air assistance system run by the military for the drug traffic in Bellavista. So much so that there is now a word for indicating the fact that an Army helicopter is carrying drugs in Bellavista: "rastreo" [tracking] The "tracking" operations are generally conducted in the vicinity of the Biabo valley, especially in Barranca and La Union; as well as in Palmapampa. "Traqueteros" (those loading the drugs) from the locality claimed that, to load a helicopter, there must be shipments from 10 "route men's" trucks to transport approximately 700 kg of washed paste. The flights are usually made between 2100 and 2200. For concealment, the Army forces are using a code for classified military operations: "Oscar May Charlie." Used only for countersubversive and, occasionally, counternarcotics operations, it relieves the pilots of their obligation to submit their flight plan to the FAP. It is now being used in routine operations. Cases are known wherein helicopters take off from Tarapoto on a flight that would require 20 minutes at the most, and reach their destinations five or six hours later. What is the helicopter doing during all that time? When the conditions so permit, there may be up to three flights per month by Army helicopters carrying drugs. The source noted: "If business is down, the `milicos' [soldiers] make only one flight." A concrete example of this incredible coexistence occurred during the early days of February. At the time, an Army helicopter was loaded with drugs on the outskirts of the town, to carry them to Chachapoyas, where they were picked up by a small plane and, finally, taken to Colombia. Between 11 and 12 February, another small plane took off from La Union. Nearly 3,000 kg of drugs departed from there, heading for Colombia. The Largest According to information that has been collected, the most prominent firm chiefs currently operating in Bellavista are the following: Cero Cinco [Zero Five] (the only one known to be a Peruvian) Pelo Blanco [White Hair] (an older person with thick gray hair, of heavy build, Peruvian) Trompa de Buque [Boat Horn] (he is Luis Hernan Pineda Menjura) El Baron [The Baron] (Fernando Saldana Chavez, Peruvian, aide to "El Ministro") They are considered the "capos," and have their drug marketing center on the third level of Bellavista. Their firms are regarded as reliable suppliers of the Colombian cartels. There are also some small firms, disparagingly known as "Pichihuichi." There are only four. The Colombian "capos" do not give them, as they do to "the large ones," drugs on consignment "against payment," to be made after marketing. It was Demetrio Chavez, "Vaticano," who began the "against payment" system years ago in Campanilla. In Bellavista, one kg of washed paste is currently priced at 380 new soles, in cash, and at 480 new soles "against payment." Also on the third level are the "hideouts," or laboratories in which the drugs are processed. There are at least 10 on the third level, and 15 on the fourth. The largest obtain an average of 50 kg of washed paste per day; and the small ones, 15 kg. At least three persons work in the "hideouts": the one in charge of the water, the sifter, and the one engaged in drying the drugs. The process can last four hours, depending on the quantity. Each chief has several henchmen working to ensure his safety. They are his eyes and ears. When they see a stranger, they approach, ask him for documents, and interrogate him: something that not even the police do in Bellavista. Then they follow him, so as to report to their chiefs. For example, they guard "El Baron's" house, with two stories and made of cement. Several youths tour the vicinity, while others do not move from the main door. Each one holds a knapsack in which he is obviously carrying weapons. What do the municipal authorities say about what is happening in Bellavista? The only official with whom we spoke, who refused to identify himself, merely remarked: "You know, I know, everyone here knows about it. After all, a single person can't do anything." Finally, the hotel, which was the last surprise: it was none other than the "Cardenas" Hotel. The founder: Guillermo Cardenas Davila, the notorious "Mosca Loca." Its manager: Luis Molque Cardenas Guzman, son of "Mosca Loca," known as "Mosquito." The clients? The chiefs of Bellavista, the new drug fortress in Huallaga. [Box, p 35] `Narco'-Economy It is well-known that much of Lower Huallaga's population is living, in one way or another, on money from the drug traffic. There is no authority nor institution that "narco"-terrorism has not penetrated. To give an example, the "narco"-trafficker, Waldo Vargas Arias, alias "El Ministro," has, as a personal rule, been donating $100 per month to each of the teachers in Yarina, in Yurimaguas. It is by way of a "subsidy" allowing them to receive a "decent" salary, and thereby enabling them to subsist. Moreover, it was public knowledge that the deputy mayor of Bellavista, Francisco Longa Morales, received money from the "narcos" in the zone for permitting them to "work." This Mr. Longa, who had two motorcycle shops in Tarapoto itself, has now disappeared, and the police are on his trail. Similarly, a local authority who preferred not to be identified claimed that most of the local news reporters have been receiving money in exchange for their silence. The flights continue to take off regularly, and no one reports anything. The local residents comment that the news reports discuss anything other than what they all know is happening. An official who remained anonymous adds: "Don't forget that when there is a flight everyone here can eat." [Box, p 36] Peter the Great "Peter the Great" is the name given to the chief of the Bellavista military base who, leading 30 men, conducted an operation last week on the so-called "first level" of this jungle locality, in which, incidentally, neither the DEA nor the police participated. In one of the houses raided they captured the Colombians, Edgardo Castaneda Diza, William Garzon Calderon, Ali Gonzales Cuellar, and John Landazuri Landana; as well as the Peruvians, Fernando Saldana Chavez, alias "El Baron," Jose Pena Saldana, Goner Garcia Guerra, and Teodoro Camacho. They confiscated from this group 1,800 kg of washed PBC, 1,800 kg of raw PBC, 10 bags of ammoniac gum resin, six bags of charcoal, two 9 mm pistols, a mini-Uzi, a revolver, a pineapple type grenade, three motorcycles, an electric generating set, and a radio set. However, local sources noted that, incidentally, 10 minutes before that operation, the drug trafficker, Waldo Vargas Arias, alias "El Ministro" was seen leaving the same house. The same sources claim that "El Ministro " headed for the port, where he took a "lata" (glider] bound for Huimbayoc, Yurimaguas, where it is currently located.

[Box, p 38] "We Can't Specify Anything" Marcelo Raymundo Perez, the current deputy mayor of Bellavista, claims to have no specific information on anything happening in his locality. He maintains that all the information he has is inaccurate or unconfirmed. [Arrieta] The residents claim that small planes loaded with drugs are constantly taking off. What is your office doing about that? [Perez] We have certain reports about it, and we have made them available to the pertinent authorities. They are not only about the drug traffic, but crime, also. Both are evils afflicting the entire population. [Arrieta] But the flights continue to take off. Also, are there clandestine airports near this zone, or not? [Perez] There has been talk lately about night flights leaving these airports, but I want to make it clear that it is our responsibility to put the information in the hands of the prosecutor's office and the police, so that both may conduct investigations. For example, last year we reported the creation of a clandestine runway in Sedega. [Arrieta] How many cases like that have you reported to the authorities? [Perez] I could not tell you; there are many similar cases. [Arrieta] Have the people submitted any complaints about them. [Perez] There have been complaints, and some charges, and even reports of people being murdered; but we don't know of any details concerning them. [Arrieta] Are there firms in Bellavista? [Perez] I don't know exactly. It is presumed, but we can't claim it; because people come and go, and we don't know whether or not the firms really exist. Bellavista is a strategic zone of Central Huallaga, and people move to both Biabo valley and Sisa valley. All this prevents our obtaining sufficient information. [Arrieta] But are the firms operating here or not? [Perez] They may be operating but, as I told you, we can't specify anything. [Arrieta] You were saying that the flights take off at night. [Perez] That is claimed, but we can't specify the exact site from which they take off. We know that there are some flights, because we hear them at night; but we don't have accurate information. [Arrieta] What do you need to find out about these situations with a minimum of accuracy? [Perez] Well, the fact is that we don't have sufficient personnel to cover all these irregularities.
