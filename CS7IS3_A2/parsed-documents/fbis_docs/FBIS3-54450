Today Rabin will address a plenum of the Council of Europe. Gid'on Kouts reports from Strasbourg: [Begin Kouts recording] The Syrians gave an affirmative reply to a question posed by an Israeli representative in the Washington talks as to whether an agreement with Syria will stand on its own two feet -- namely, be unlinked to arrangements with other countries or parties. The Syrians said that for them, such an agreement is part of a comprehensive arrangement. This was announced by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at a dinner with European Jewish leaders in Strasbourg. Israeli sources said that the Syrian statement, made yesterday, means the Syrians are prepared to sign a separate agreement with Israel, a departure from the Syrian stand in President al-Asad's Geneva talks with Bill Clinton. After that meeting, the U.S. peace team reported that al-Asad made any agreement and normal relations with Israel contingent on the settlement of issues such as the right of return and Jerusalem. In Rabin's opinion, this is an encouraging reply reflecting a Syrian readiness to achieve a peace agreement with Israel. [passage omitted] [end recording] Our correspondent adds that Yitzhaq Rabin further noted there is no room for saying that an agreement with the PLO is imminent. A source in his entourage was pessimistic about prospects for attaining such an agreement by the end of this week. Rabin also said he did not think Jordan would be the first or second country to sign a peace agreement with Israel.
