The removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from the post of the Belarussian parliament chairman was an unpleasant surprise for Moscow and quite unexpected by Russian diplomats, according to ITOGI host Yevgeniy Kiselev. He said the removal of Shushkevich "means nothing good for Russian-Belarussian relations". "Yeltsin has lost reliable ally who unconditionally took his side last October," Kiselev said. "The Belarussian leader was one of the few commonwealth leaders on whose loyalty Yeltsin could always count. Shushkevich's reputation was very high also on the international arena where he was viewed as a reformer and a staunch advocate of the market economy. A report from Minsk about the events preceding Shushkevich's resignation and reaction to the fact in Russia and other countries cited different views on what happened in Belarus. Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich disagreed with the allegation that the toppling of Shushkevich was tantamount to a "communist coup". "It was nothing of the kind. All the forces in the pariament remained there and the policy pursued by the parliament will continue to be pursued, Kebich said. Itogi paid much attention to the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus and the creation of a single rouble zone of these two countries. According to a survey conducted by the public opinion fund, 32 per cent of Russian citizens last week believed that Russia should unify its monetary system with that of Belarus, even if the Russian economy suffers from the move. Fifty per cent of those polled were opposed to the move, and 18 per cent had not yet made up their minds. As concerns changes in the Russian Government, most Russian voters were "sceptical in their attitude", according to Yevgeniy Kiselev. He proceeded from the results of another poll conducted by the public opinion fund which revealed that 27 per cent of those polled believed the reshuffle would affect negatively the lives of the Russian people. Only 17 per cent believed that the resignations and reshuffles in the government would yield a positive result. Thirty per cent of those polled said the government changes would not affect the life of the population in any way. Twenty-six per cent were uncertain. "The results of the past two years enable us to say that many tasks in reforming our economy and switching to a market economy have failed to be accomplished," economist Stanislav Shatalin said in an interview with the Ostankino television Sunday programme Voskresenye. "An analysis of the past two years shows that we must re-define guidelines for our social and economic policy," Shatalin said. "While the past week was critical and most unpleasant in the political career of one of the initiators of the commonwealth, Stanislav Shushkevich who resigned under the insupportable burden of the problems -- political and economic -- which arose in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the coming week threatens much unexpected in connection with the same problems to another consignee of the first commonwealth agreement, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk", Kiselev said. Much will depend on the outcome of the second round of the presidential elections in the Crimea, he said. A report from Simferopol made it clear that the pro-Russia Yuriy Meshkov was running well ahead of his rival in the first presidential elections in the peninsula republic contested by Ukraine and Russia. Itogi recalled that a criminal cases was opened last week against parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who heads the parliamentary faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia. Zhirinovskiy is charged with war propaganda under Article 71 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. First Deputy Chief of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Lieutenant-General Sergey Stepashin spoke in an interview with Itogi about the aims and tasks of this organisation established on the basis of the former Security Ministry. He said that although the number of the personnel has been cut almost by half, the number of operational, counter-intellligence units remained the same. Asked if the names of KGB informers would be made public, Stepashin said, "We will do everything to prevent it". He explained that all similar services across the world maintained "undercover personnels", "regardless of whether the state is democratic, anti- democratic, communist or any other". Moreover he said it was wrong not to keep the promise of confidence given to former KGB informers, because "it was destroy their lives". The general expressed anxiety about the considerable leaks of nuclear, military and other technologies, as well as about attempts at recruiting Russian researchers and specialists by foreign special services. Itogi reported on the latest developments in the Vil Mirzayanov's affair -- this Russian chemist is now in custody on charges of revealing state secrets relating to the production of new chemical weapons in Russia. The programme reported that Mirzayanov's colleague Vladimir Uglev announced his intention to make public on February 4 the formula of the secret chemical substance unless Vil Mirzayanov was released by that time.
