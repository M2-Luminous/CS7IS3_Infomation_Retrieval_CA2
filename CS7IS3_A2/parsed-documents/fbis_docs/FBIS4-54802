Protest rallies were held at more than half the enterprises in the country. Members of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation, the Association of Democratic Trade Unions, and the National Trade Union, as well as private drivers, also took part in the protests. In Plovdiv the city authorities banned the planned rally, as a result of which health workers took part in a silent march along several of the city's central streets. Over 30 organizations in the road transportation sector took part in the strike, stopping work for periods varying from 15 to 60 minutes. The following main roads were blocked for one hour: the Sofia-Svilengrad road near Khaskovo; the Burgas-Sofia road at Aytos; the Sofia-Kulata route at Dupnitsa; the Ruse-Silistra road near Slivo Pole. The Varna-Burgas road was blocked for 20 minutes near the village of Kosharitsa. In Svishtov dockers blocked the river port for one hour, while the Danube Bridge was closed in both directions for one hour. According to the KNSB National Strike Committee, the police arrested four trade union leaders today when they attempted to block the Burgas-Varna main road. Those detained included KNSB Executive Secretary Doncho Donchev. Three trade union leaders from Dupnitsa were also arrested. The National Strike Committee delivered a sharp protest against these police actions and stated in an official announcement that this step might lead to a new escalation of the strike conflict. The KNSB will immediately inform the European Trade Union Confederation, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the Council of Europe of these violations of the Social Charter and European conventions. The same institutions will also receive reports on the action taken to prevent workers from two commercial enterprises holding a rally in front of the Council of Ministers building in Sofia. In connection with these statements issued by the KNSB National Strike Committee, the Interior Ministry Press Center disseminated an announcement that rejects these claims outright. According to the Interior Ministry announcement, the attempts to block the road in the region of Slunchev Bryag and the main road near Dupnitsa represented offenses against the Road Traffic Act, as a result of which the police filed charges against the drivers involved. The statement notes that no force or special equipment was used. Regarding the rally outside the Council of Ministers building, the announcement states that the participants were informed by law- enforcement agences that no permit for the rally had been issued, following which they quietly dispersed without any incident. After teachers and kindergarten assistants in boarding schools and children's and orphans homes had stopped work for one hour, at 1600 today the National Strike Committee of the Bulgarian Teachers Union signed a strike agreement with the Ministry of Education and Science that partially satisfies the teachers' demands.
