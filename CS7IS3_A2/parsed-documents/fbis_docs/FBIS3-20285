Following the example of the U.S. "National Research Council" or the Japanese "Japan Research Council," this consultative and advisory body is to assist the Commission in designing and implementing the Community's research and development policy in the field of technology. Professor Ruberti underlined that "the Community can only be successful in the science and technology sector if it fully takes the versatility of European research into account for designing and assessing its actions. This new tool will make it possible." The "European Science and Technology Assembly" will include approximately 100 high-level officials appointed on the basis of proposals from the various organizations involved in science and technology on the European level. The creation of the Assembly had been announced by the Commission in the "White Book on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." Indeed, by establishing a direct, close, and permanent contact between the Commission on the one hand and the European scientific community and industrial world on the other hand, the Assembly will ensure that the Community's research and development activities have the expected positive impact on the European economy and society. Technological research and development call for a growing part of the Community's financial resources. The activities carried out in the sector have considerable effects on the economic activity and the life of citizens. With the very high level of expertise of its members, the Assembly will be able to guarantee: - the relevance of the choices made in the field of science and technology; - the quality of research; - that the most recent developments in the field of technology as well as the needs of the economy and the society are taken into account. The Commission will systematically request the opinion of the Assembly on a certain number of issues: the scientific and technological contents of the Community's research programs, the criteria and the methods for assessing proposals, etc. On its own initiative, the assembly can also prepare reports and give opinions on the various aspects of the Community's research policy or the development of science and technology in Europe and elsewhere.
