The utility of space ranges from the commitment of armed forces to the achievement of general political objectives (such as observation of the environment, exploration of natural resources, surveillance of borders, and inaccessible regions). On 13 May, the agenda of the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union [WEU] includes consideration of the decision to pursue the development of an independent European system of observation satellites. A report on implementation possibilities has already been completed; everybody is waiting for Bonn. The Federal Republic has to decide before the May session whether it wants to commit considerable capital to such an "Eyes in Space" system. One argument frequently heard in Germany is: Why spend so much money on European satellite-supported reconnaissance, when we can rely on our American partners. The United States own the most efficient systems and German government offices have received information from U.S. sources on specific occasions. However, the whole truth includes the fact that this is based on reciprocity. The United States expect something in return. However, such a policy is not permanently compatible with the interests of European countries since the United States is currently redefining its foreign and defense policy priorities while Europe wants to play a partnership role in the Euro-Atlantic structure on the basis of independence. Europe needs an independent capability to receive unfiltered information and to assess developments outside its borders. Meanwhile Defense Minister Ruehe in a white book released this week by the Cabinet has also accepted this view. This document contains the following clause: "For the early recognition of regional crises,...and to defend its interests in developing joint plans within alliances and the United Nations, the Federal Government requires an accurate, up-to-date view of the situation." This calls for various types of information, including information gained from satellites: Reconnaissance to assist in the formulation of policy, not in lieu of policy decisions. Here is an example from 1986: For several days uncertainty prevailed whether a second nuclear power plant in Chernobyl was threatened with meltdown. If European countries had possessed satellites with multispectral sensors, there would have been no uncertainty and the European countries could have taken precautionary measures based on information thus gained. However, the Federal Republic is still undecided which department should become "responsible" for such an observation system since there is, so to speak, no "natural and primary user" for this type of information. Independent experts, therefore, have suggested appointing an intergovernmental commission, which reports to the office of the chancellor, to prepare for the decision in May and to develop guidelines for reorganization within the government. Time is passing rapidly. The two specific issues are 20-percent participation in the Helios 2 Project (daylight observations) developed by France and, second, majority participation (50 percent or more) for a high-resolution radar reconnaissance satellite. Because of its technological capabilities as well as its political status in Europe's center, no other power is as suited as Germany for an SAR system (active microwave radar). The cost? It has not been accurately determined. Experts say: In the initial phase "several hundred million a year."
