After the unloading of the hardware the detachment of Russian paratroops will go to the site of their deployment -- the "Klisa" airfield near Osijek. In the next few days the 900 soldiers and officers of the "Rusbat," which is guarding a 100-km stretch of the line separating the Serbs and Croats, will be reinforced by more than 300 extra Russian "blue berets." In addition to this reinforcement of personnel the battalion will have at its disposal several new armored carriers, anti-tank weapons and grenade launchers. The command calculates that this reinforcement will make it possible to lower the excessive load on the personnel who are manning 32 check- points around the clock. Meanwhile, the additional combat hardware will help to enhance the security of the Russian paratroops and forestall possible provocations and attacks. Incidentally, the Belgian battalion deployed in the same sector has already been equipped with the same types of weapons, while some national contingents of the UN forces even have tanks. The situation in the zone for which the Russian battalion is responsible has become substantially more stable in recent months. This is explained not only by a certain easing of Serb-Croat relations but also by the skillful execution of their duties by the Russian soldiers and officers, constant contacts with the opposing sides, and efforts to prevent incidents.
