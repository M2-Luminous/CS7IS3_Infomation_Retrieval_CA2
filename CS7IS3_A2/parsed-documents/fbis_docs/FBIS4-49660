This was the first time since the crime that SEF officials and crime experts were allowed to visit the mainland to probe the investigation into the incident, which has frozen Taiwan-mainland ties. Hsu said his delegation, comprised of victims' relatives, lawyers and forensic scientists, hopes mainland authorities will reveal all the facts pertaining to the crime. "Only by doing so can the fragile Taiwan-mainland ties return to normal," Hsu said. Mainland authorities Monday turned down the Taiwan mission's request to see autopsy reports and instead showed them slides and taped records about the condition of the bodies. The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), SEF's mainland counterpart, also rejected the mission's demand to interview the four men arrested for their alleged involvement in the crime. SEF and ARATS are non-official conduits for mainland-Taiwan relations. ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li Yafei, who was among the mainland officials meeting with the Taiwan delegation, said people in the mainland feel as sad as the people in Taiwan do about the accident and the mainland authorities have tried their utmost to crack the case. According to a report by the Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO, Wu Liming, a suspect who was charged for complicity in the crime, works for the Hangzhou armed police. All 32 passengers and crew aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang were found burnt to death in a small room in the boat on April 1. Luggage and other belongings were missing. Although mainland authorities arrested the four suspects and said they have tried their best to investigate the accident, Hsu said many suspicions surrounding the incident remain. News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters, especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene. Relatives of the victims, who were furious over the autopsies carried out without their consent, were confined in their hotels, and SEF officials were three times refused permission to visit the mainland to probe the case. Taiwan has since suspended cultural and educational exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's inappropriate handling of the incident.
