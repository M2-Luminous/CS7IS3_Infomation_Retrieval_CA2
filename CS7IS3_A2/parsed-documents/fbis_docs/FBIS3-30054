Though it started in high spirits, declaring it will "tear up the collusion among politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen," it is now coming under growing criticism for being "led by bureaucrats" in making decisions on economic policy matters like economic stimulus measures and taxation system reform. Even U.S. President Bill Clinton assailed the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Ministry of Finance [MOF] as master culprits for rupturing the Japan-U.S. economic consultations. But, meanwhile, there have been delicate changes in the relationships of power between economic-related government offices of Kasumigaseki in Tokyo under the coalition government. We have looked into the rise and fall of the major government offices. The office which has shown its might under the Hosokawa government is the MOF. In addition to Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Jiro Saito, administrative vice minister of the MOF, was denounced as a "behind-the-scenes schemer" in the hassle over the national welfare tax concept, but he still caught the attention of the nation as he proved capable of moving even the prime minister. Of course, even in earlier days the ministry was called the "government office within the government offices," and there is no doubt that the power of the ministry in charge of state finance, including the budget and taxes, stands out among the central government's offices. But the weakening of the power of the members of the Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] Research Commission on the Tax System as well as the LDP zoku-giin [Dietmen lobbying for interests of certain industries or government offices] who built up their power under the 38-year rule of the LDP has helped the ministry solidify its strength too. One policy-related staff member of a coalition member party admitted, "We cannot do without the help of the MOF in specialty areas like the taxation system." While there is a view that as a result of the failure of the national welfare tax concept the prime minister's "trust" in the ministry has been shaken, within the ministry there is an unshakable belief in itself as evidenced in a remark by a ranking ministry official who asserted, "We have succeeded in ensuring that the matter of the consumption tax raise will be settled before the end of the year; many people tell us we have done well." In contrast, the office which is losing power is MITI. With the LDP's commerce-and industry-related zoku-giin having lost their power, the ministry has lost supporters for its policies, and that has contributed to its weakening as well. On the matter of economic stimulus measures and reform of the taxation system, there was a time when administrative Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano, together with MOF Vice Minister Saito, ran around, trying to push for "raising taxes [primarily consumption taxes] and reducing taxes [primarily income taxes] in a package deal." For a while, the ministry was chided as a "second Ministry of Finance" on account of that. The intraministry controversy over the dismissal of Masahisa Taito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau, at the end of last year and the reports that the ministry carried out "publicity campaigns" on economic organizations in an attempt to sway public opinion on the general economic stimulus measures have also facilitated the sinking of the ministry's power base. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is a ministry which brought down its own rating by failing to bring about a successful conclusion to the framework talks -- the most important area of diplomacy in relations with the United States. The fact that shortly before the Japan-U.S. summit, the prime minister sent Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France and one of his advisers, as his special envoy to Washington to act on his own, separate from MOFA, came as a shock as it showed that the prime minister did not trust the ministry's diplomatic capabilities. Even within the government there is criticism that "the MOFA's connections with Washington are too shabby." The ministry has to find a breakthrough in relations with the United States to regain lost ground. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] is one of those whose power is rising, helped by its accomplishments in taking the lead in resolving the issue of the partial opening of the rice market. It has actively campaigned within the government on the need to take measures to help farmers deal with the partial opening of the rice market -- by setting up the Headquarters for Emergency Measures on Agriculture and Farming Community headed by the prime minister, and holding a meeting of the Agricultural Administration Council in the prime minister's office for the first time in 14 years. But its long-time ally, the Agricultural Cooperatives, rebelled against the ministry when the latter engaged in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the United States over the partial opening of the rice market. The cooperatives for a while refused to cooperate with the ministry on the policy of reducing rice farm acreage. Now the two parties are moving toward reconciliation, but there is a big scar remaining. The Economic Planning Agency [EPA], which is led by a cabinet member from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], cannot be said to have performed its adjustment functions well in formulating overall economic stimulus measures, and its value is not appreciated. But the work of legislating the Product Liability Law, the first mammoth-scale law to be formulated by the agency in about 20 years, is being helped by the change of government since the prime minister is in favor of protecting consumers, and the SDPJ and Komeito are enthusiastic about legislating such a law. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] no longer has the LDP's zoku-giin to support it. A senior ministry official lamented, "When we had to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance regarding new articles of postal savings, we used to have support of the zoku-giin. Now we cannot expect such support, and we have a very difficult time." The ministry is said to be still groping for a way to establish relations with member parties of the coalition. The Ministry of Transportation, on the strength of its slogan for giving "priority to consumers," succeeded in getting a budget allocation for construction of new city railway and semi-bullet train systems. Senior ministry officials' visits to Shinseito General Secretary Ozawa have also become conspicuous. Apparently, they believe, "the coalition is flying toward forming a new axis [of policies]." Remarking on this change in the power of government offices, a bureaucrat insisted, "It does not mean that the MOF has gained more power. It only means that the power of politics has weakened. We still need the power of politics -- going over the framework of government offices -- if we want to have big policies." Political columnist Taro Yayama commented on the rising power of the bureaucrats, and said: "This is a temporary phenomenon that happens in the early stage of a new government. Prime Minister Hosokawa wants to break up the collusion between the politicians and the bureaucrats which has continued since the days of the LDP government. I don't think he will let the bureaucrats do as they please in the future."
