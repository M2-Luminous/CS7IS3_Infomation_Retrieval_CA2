At the top of the list, no move has been made from December 1993 to January 1994: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) chairman], [Republic Party (KP) Chairman] Janos Palotas, and Zoltan Kiraly [Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP) chairman] continue to be in the first three places. However, it cannot be ignored that these politicians are not in the same position: In the case of the Socialists, the party and its first man are equally popular, but the very popular Palotas and Kiraly lead parties whose support does not even reach the minimum required to get into parliament. People link Horn to his party with rather big certainty, while the party links to the other two popular politicians are unknown to many people. By the beginning of 1994, almost all significant political parties named their leading person on the election list. From now on, it is of outstanding importance on the basis of what information the citizens will make their decision on 8 May, whether they know who the main actors of political life are, what they represent, and how popular they are. Since the beginning of December, Peter Boross who was elected prime minister in the meantime, has become known virtually to the whole adult population. Although he had previously also been among the known politicians, in the first month as prime minister, this increased by almost 10 percent and reached the virtual maximum. The level of how well known the other list leaders are has not changed in the past month apart from accidental variations, and Gabor Kuncze's [list leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] popularity and how well he is known, which had formerly increased fast, has also stagnated. On the basis of how well they know the politicians, the citizens can be put into three groups: The first group consists of people who know the politician, have an opinion about him, and are aware of which party he belongs to; the second group consists of those who know the politician's name, can express their opinion on him, but do not know, or incorrectly know, his party affiliation; and people in the third group have heard of the politician's name but will not form a view on him and do not know where he belongs. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Knowledge About the Parties' List Leaders (as percentage of the questioned | |people) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name |Knows His Party |Has a View on Him |Knows His Name | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozsef Torgyan |80 |92 |97 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Viktor Orban |77 |89 |94 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peter Boross |71 |92 |97 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gyula Horn |68 |92 |95 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Laszlo Surjan |50 |88 |92 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gabor Kuncze |36 |64 |65 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Istvan Csurka |34 |88 |93 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Janos Palotas |33 |90 |93 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zoltan Kiraly |20 |82 |83 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tamas Nagy |17 |44 |45 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Out of the 10 list leaders, people know the party affiliation of five on the average (12 percent could not name the party of any of the politicians and no one was able to name them all). Four-fifths of the people who were surveyed know about the best-known Jozsef Torgyan and that he belongs to the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]. Viktor Orban's party [Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz)] membership is also well known. A quarter of the questioned people were unable to link Gyula Horn and Peter Boross to a party, but the number of people who gave the wrong party name is negligible in the case of these two. The party link of Laszlo Surjan [Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) chairman] is only known correctly by 53 percent of those who know him, 37 percent cannot link him to any party, and 8 percent gave the wrong party name (out of this, 5 percent said he was an MDF member). Only a little more than half of the people who know Gabor Kuncze are also aware that he is the prime minister candidate of the SZDSZ, and the proportion of the wrong answers is similar in his case, 7 percent, but there is not a typical wrong answer. Few people know which parties the otherwise popular leaders of the smaller parties represent. Half of the people who know Istvan Csurka [chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] do not know to which party he belongs, and 12 percent gave incorrect answers (9 percent of these still think he is an MDF member). More than one-third of the questioned people cannot place Janos Palotas on the party palette, and one-quarter link him to the wrong party (19 percent of these said he is a member of the Entrepreneurs' Party). Zoltan Kiraly's party position is the least known for the public, almost two-thirds of the people did not even attempt to place him anywhere, and 19 percent gave the wrong party name. The popularity of politicians is shown on the following table. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Popularity of Party List Leaders Among Those Who Know the Politician | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Name |Percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gyula Horn |65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Janos Palotas |64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zoltan Kiraly |60 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Laszlo Surjan |57 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Viktor Orban |56 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gabor Kuncze |52 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peter Boross |51 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tamas Nagy |46 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozsef Torgyan |29 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Istvan Csurka |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On this question, people were allowed to give their views on all politicians, and as can be seen, the popularity of most of the list leaders was said to be average or a little better than average. However, when people said whom they would welcome at the head of the government after the next elections -- that is, when they were only able to select one person for this important political role -- most named Horn. Although there is little difference in the general views on most leading politicians, these differ as regards their suitability for the prime ministerial position. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Who Should Be the Next Prime Minister? (percent) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gyula Horn |22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peter Boross |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Janos Palotas |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Viktor Orban |8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Gabor Kuncze |7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Laszlo Surjan |6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Zoltan Kiraly |4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Jozsef Torgyan |3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Istvan Csurka |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tamas Nagy |1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |None of them |10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Does not know |11 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nine percent more people would welcome the current prime minister back in his position than the number of people who would vote for his party. Horn would also be welcome as prime minister by 4 percent more people than who would vote for the MSZP. However, 3-4 percent fewer people can see the leaders of the liberal parties as prime minister than the number of people who would vote for their parties. Although Palotas continues to be popular and, for many people, appears to be a politician suitable to be leader, his party has not yet been able to utilize this popularity. The situation is similar in the case of the MSZDP where the party chairman is considered to be popular by many people but this sympathy does not come across to his party -- although it is true that not many people would like him to be prime minister either.
