FR940713-1-00059 FR940713-1-00013 Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.'' A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the jaguar ( Panthera onca ) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range Within the United States, jaguars have been recorded most commonly from Arizona, but there are also records from California, New Mexico, and Texas, and reports from Louisiana. Currently there is no known resident population of jaguars in the United States, though they still occur in northern Mexico. Arizona Goldman (1932) believed that the jaguar was a regular, but not abundant, resident in southeastern Arizona. Hoffmeister (1986) considered the jaguar an uncommon resident species in Arizona. He concluded that the reports of jaguars between 1885 and 1965 indicated that a small but resident population once occurred in southeastern Arizona. Brown (1983) suggested that the jaguar in Arizona ranged widely throughout a variety of habitats from Sonoran desertscrub upward through subalpine conifer forest. Most of the records were from Madrean evergreen-woodland, shrub-invaded semidesert grassland, and along rivers. The most recent records of jaguars in the United States are from Arizona. In 1971, a jaguar was taken east of Nogales and, in 1986, one was taken from the Dos Cabezas Mountains. The latter individual reportedly had been in the area for about a year before it was killed (Ronald M. Nowak, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1992). The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) (1988) cited two recent reports of jaguars in Arizona. The individuals were considered to be transients from Mexico. One of the reports was from 1987 from an undisclosed location. The other report was from 1988, when tracks were observed for several days prior to the treeing of a jaguar by hounds in the Altar Valley, Pima County. An unconfirmed report of a jaguar at the Coronado National Monument was made in 1991 (Ed Lopez, Coronado National Monument, pers. comm., 1992). Finally, there is a report of a jaguar sighted in December, 1993, on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in the Baboquivari Mountains of southern Arizona. Refuge personnel believe that the chances are ``very good'' that this was a reliable sighting. California Merriam (1919) summarized several accounts of jaguars, from various locations in California, which were obtained from documents published between 1814 and 1860. Strong (1926) provided evidence that the Cahuilla Indians of the Coachella Valley and San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains of southern California were familiar with the jaguar. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars in the Tehachapi Mountains from 1855, and the last known individual from California was killed near Palm Springs in 1860 (Strong 1926). Nowak speculated that the animal may have been a breeding individual. Louisiana Nowak (1973) speculated on the occurrence of jaguars east of Texas. Several early accounts mentioned jaguars and tigers. He cited Baird (1859) who believed that specimens had been taken from Louisiana. Nowak also discussed the killing of what was probably a jaguar near New River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana in 1886. Lowery (1974) mentioned this killing and included the jaguar in the fauna of Louisiana on a provisional basis. New Mexico Barber (1902) speculated that jaguars made their way into the Mogollon Mountains of New Mexico by ascending the Gila River. Bailey (1931) suggested that jaguars seemed to be native in southern New Mexico, but were regarded as wanderers from across the United States-Mexico border. He listed nine reports of jaguars in New Mexico from 1855 to 1905. Brown (1983) stated that the last record from New Mexico was from 1905. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars along the Rio Grande from as late as 1922. Halloran (1946) reported that dogs ``jumped'' a jaguar in the San Andres Mountains in 1937. Findley et al . (1975) stated that jaguars once occurred as far north as northern New Mexico. Texas
