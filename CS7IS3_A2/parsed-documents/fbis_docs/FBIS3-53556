The meeting opened in the Yemeni capital late Monday. Originally scheduled for December 20, it was delayed after Yemen said its delegation chief, Ja'far Ba Salih, had health problems. The Saudi team was led by Mutlab al-Nafissah. In the previous six rounds, the two sides have made no progress, sticking to issues of procedure. The border dispute centres on the provinces of Najran, Jizan and Assir, which came under Saudi control under an agreement signed in 1934. Yemen wants a return of the territories, saying the agreement expired in 1992. It has refused to renew the accord.
