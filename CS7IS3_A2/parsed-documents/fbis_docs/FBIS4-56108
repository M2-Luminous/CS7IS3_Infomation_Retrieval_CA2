I do so not only in view of our common Austrian past, but also in appreciation of just how substantially the 160,000 Sudeten Germans who found a new home in Austria after 1945, and their descendants, have contributed to our country's recovery. The Sudeten Germans' view of history still continues to be clouded by memories of the iniquities suffered. In my opinion, we must -- in this very issue -- take seriously the obligation that we should come to terms honorably with the past, because respect for the tens of thousands of innocent victims of the expulsions enjoins us to do so. In this connection, I am reminded of the great words of the first Austrian federal chancellor after 1945, Leopold Figl, who in his time suffered in Nazi concentration camps, but, despite this, said: "Let us not forget, but let us forgive!" I know that this point of view is also shared by the Sudeten Germans. The "Charter of German Expellees" from 1950 contains the following poignant sentences: "We expelled Germans renounce revenge and retaliation. This binding decision is sacred to us given the memory of the infinite suffering that the last decade in particular (that is, the period from 1940 to 1950) has brought to mankind." During the period when the aforementioned charter was formulated, we could still hope that Europe was finally beginning another chapter in its history. Today we are witnesses to how our continent is again afflicted with the crime of mass resettlement. Few people have expressed the association between the fate of the Sudeten Germans and some current events so clearly and pointedly as Czech President Vaclav Havel, who, as we know, feels that everyone who approves of the resettlement of the German ethnic minority also in fact approves of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In any case, I am convinced that it would be disastrous if Europe were again to make the same mistakes as it did in 1945. In short, we must not let brute force gain ground unlawfully in Europe again. We must not let someone -- for the second time in less than 50 years in Europe -- in the services of the cynical policy of "ethnic cleansing" commit acts that cannot be prevented without, at the same time, leading to new acts of injustice. Moreover, we must -- with a thought for the fate of the Sudeten Germans and the current events in southeastern Europe -- strive unconditionally to define functioning European national and minority rights. Austrian foreign policy -- like the expellees' unions -- has long been striving for this. Therefore, we ascribe extraordinary importance to the decision made at the Vienna meeting involving the presidents and prime ministers of the Council of Europe member countries, a decision whereby the protection of minorities is to become the subject of an appropriate general convention and of a supplementary protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. After 1945, the Sudeten Germans had to establish a completely new existence. They have done so in a remarkable manner. In the majority of cases, however, they had probably already given up hope of renewing contacts with their old homeland. Thanks to the Iron Curtain and communist dictatorship, the past seemed to be irrevocable. It is absolutely understandable that today, when the Czech Republic and Slovakia are again embarking on a road toward democracy, a law-governed state, and respect for human rights, the Sudeten Germans are asking whether the moment has also not come when a new chapter in the history of relations with their former homeland could be opened. I -- at least -- have resolved that I will use every suitable opportunity to bring the demands of the Sudeten Germans to the attention of our Czech and Slovak partners and that I will emphasize our interest in ensuring that this issue is resolved with a view to the future and in the spirit of good neighborly relations. In particular, I feel that it could be possible for the Sudeten Germans to become involved to a greater extent in the endeavors to develop the Czech Republic and Slovakia economically. As the first precedential cases have indicated, the Sudeten Germans are well prepared for economic activity in their former homeland. From a general point of view, these people -- thanks to their intensely close ties to the country -- would probably often be more willing to mobilize local resources than other foreign investors (oriented, exclusively, toward profit). The time is probably not yet ripe for more comprehensive plans of this nature. Despite that, I will continue to orient my efforts in that direction. I will do so because I consider Austria's relations with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and our other Danubian neighbors to be -- especially under the new conditions -- an important point of our foreign policy. With respect to those countries, we now have the opportunity to implement extensive practical cooperation. Not only between governments, parliaments, local representative offices, professional organizations, special-interest groups, and political parties, but also internationally, on foreign and defense policy as well as the economy, culture, and environmental protection. I am convinced that the Sudeten Germans can help to implement such a policy. I am also expressing this desire because I know what genuinely unequivocal Europeans the expellees have become thanks to their tragic fate. The expellees' charter contained the following in August 1950: "We will support every effort oriented toward creating a united Europe in which all peoples can live freely and without fear." Austria is now standing on the threshold of a united Europe. If on 12 June the Austrian people decide in favor of our country's membership of the European Union, Austria will be able to take an active role in creating this the most significant practical peaceful achievement in European history. We will be able to take part in building a peaceful Europe, a Europe full of increasing mutuality. We will do this, because a united Europe represents the best guarantee that the terrible fate visited on the Sudeten Germans in 1945 will never be repeated under its roof. Statement Made by President Vaclav Havel Following his Return From a State Visit to Austria on 29 March 1993 We are building a new democratic and law-governed state; we are building a civic society. This state cannot be founded on heresies, lies, or prejudices; this could regress tragically upon us. The issue for me involves the cleanliness of our political maturity. The ability to look our own past in the face is also part of this. The forced evacuation of millions of people, based on a purely national principle -- that is, on the principle of collective guilt -- is a morally defective act. Approving of it means indirectly approving of the forced evacuation of Jews, Tatars, Lithuanians, and other peoples from their homes; it also means approving of the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. It is impossible to build a civic society on the endorsement of such dangerous national acts. Just as national self-awareness cannot be founded on forged manuscripts, it cannot be founded on any other national prejudice. It is even necessary to say far more unpleasant things about ourselves: For example, that, during the First Republic, we did not manage to resolve the issue of the minorities satisfactorily; that Slovakia was not always treated well; that our resistance fighters did not enjoy too much support among the public either during the war or under communism, and people preferred to steer clear of them; that the major part of the public voted for the communists; that we allowed the suffering of the Jews to be kept quiet; that many Czechs did not stand up for them during the war; and that, after the Munich diktat, many Czechs and Czech organizations descended into the most shameful anti-Semitism. We are no worse than others; but we are no better. In my opinion, it is the duty of a president to point out these unpopular things. We are obliged to tell the truth about ourselves, first and foremost, for our own sakes and that of our descendants. It is surely possible to discuss, at the appropriate level, the evacuation of the Sudeten Germans, but it is even more important for us to discuss it without prejudice among ourselves. I have spoken about this many times and always here, at home. I remember the visit of President Weizsaecker and his speech in the Vladislav Hall. However, if I am asked abroad for my opinion, I give the same answer there as at home, for I am not schizophrenic, saying one thing abroad and another here. Of course, I did not go to Austria so that I could discuss this issue there, but, at the same time, I did not go there to avoid unpleasant questions. Incidentally, in my statements, the moral condemnation of the evacuation was completely in the shade of my interpretation of why the legal aspect of this issue is closed and unchangeable for us and why no legal consequences can arise from a moral judgment. I think that I explained this more thoroughly than many of my critics here. The fact that my critics condemned my statements without knowing them testifies to the very weak political culture in our country. Understandably, the Office of the President has -- from the first moment -- kept a precise record of everything that I have said; however, no one has called and asked for a copy of what I said. This affirms that my critics are not interested in the facts, but only in muddying the waters and in fawning to those who, after a taboo lasting decades, find it difficult to come to terms with certain things. No government representative or representative of the ruling coalition has made it clear to me in our numerous meetings that he does not share my view on this matter. Therefore, I perceive the statements of some opposition officials as an attempt to drive a wedge between myself and the ruling coalition. However, they will not succeed in this. And something else: It does not surprise me that it is the left that is defending the evacuation so robustly. Collectivism is close to it and, since communist collectivism has collapsed, it obviously needs national collectivism as a replacement, dividing nations into the guilty and the innocent. However, in the elections, our citizens cast their votes for the ideal of a civic society in which each individual is responsible for his own acts and they cast their votes for parties that defend the inviolability of private ownership and all civil rights. Of course, following this path also means knowing how to admit that we did not always manage to govern ourselves by these principles. The evacuation is a bygone act of a democratic government, an act confirmed by the victorious powers, an act legally valid and unchangeable. We are trying with difficulty to correct some of the wrongs of communism, but we cannot and will not rectify past history and thus commit new wrongs. That would be absurd. This absolutely unequivocal stance, however, does not relieve us of the obligation to tell -- in our own interest -- the complete truth about our history, albeit unpleasant and unpopular, and to admit that even a democratic government was capable of succumbing to the Stalinist way of thinking and thus of preparing for the rise of Stalinism. This is a matter for our spiritual and moral wellbeing. The strength of our republic will not lie in avoiding the truth, but in the will to recognize it. Invitation to Vaclav Klaus (as Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party) To Take Part in the Sudeten German Days in Nuremberg This Weekend Esteemed Mr. Chairman, The proposal for a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, which is also supported by many important German politicians of all persuasions, is indeed intended to overcome the barriers of the past and to seek a solution to the problems and a path toward a positive future. As a sign of our desire to meet each other half way and seek a new beginning in relations between Czechs and Germans from Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, we would like cordially to invite you and other representatives from your party to this year's principal meeting of the Sudeten Germans at the Sudeten German Days 1994 in Nuremberg on the Whitsuntide weekend. We would be pleased to welcome you among us. The enclosed honorary passes contain information on the most important events and points on the agenda of these Sudeten German Days, whose course and "Aussagen" [message] should promote a peaceful and conciliatory future. I repeat my invitation and remain, with friendly greetings, Yours, Franz Neubauer. The Letter From Representatives of the Sudeten German Council to the Chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party; the Chairmen of the Other Political Parties Also Received a Similar Letter Esteemed Mr. Chairman, The Sudeten German issue is constantly being aired and discussed in the Czech media. Such discussions -- associated with assumptions and fear -- are also being conducted among the people themselves. This indicates that Sudeten German issues are indeed a problem that has still not been resolved so that it is possible to guarantee the further calm and successful development of the Czech Republic and of its relations with Germany. The Sudeten Germans have long and repeatedly proposed and offered a Sudeten German-Czech dialogue, because only a dialogue begun without bias and accusation will overcome the prejudices, eradicate the misunderstandings, and bring the problems closer to a solution. On account of many misunderstandings, we point out once again that the Sudeten German Council explained a long time ago that, for it, the issue of the borders has never come up. This means that all the models for a solution under discussion must be considered within the Czech Republic. While this dialogue was begun some time ago on a lower platform and among people, it is still being rejected, as previously, in the political sphere. This does not only meet with incomprehension among us Sudeten Germans, but also among the faraway German and Austrian political circles. Therefore, we invite you to participate in an extensive Czech- Sudeten German dialogue without bias! At the same time, we are convinced that you also see the need for such a dialogue to improve German-Czech relations. It would please us very much if you would accept our invitation to the talks. It would certainly be meaningful if this dialogue could begin soon. We suggest that the dialogue be preceded first by lower-level talks between representatives from the democratic parties in the Czech National Council and representatives from the Sudeten German Council aimed at reaching agreement on the participants, subjects, and dates for the dialogue. We look forward to your timely point of view and remain, with cordial greetings, Franz Neubauer, Volkmar Gabert, Herbert Werner, and Heinz Kraus.
