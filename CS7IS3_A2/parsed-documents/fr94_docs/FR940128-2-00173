Responses to the complaint and the notice of investigation must be submitted by the named respondents in accordance with section 210.21 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.21. Pursuant to sections 201.16(d) and 210.21(a) of the Commission's Rules, 19 CFR 201.16(d) and 210.21(a), such responses will be considered by the Commission if received not later than 20 days after the date of service of the complaint. Extensions of time for submitting responses to the complaint will not be granted unless good cause therefor is shown. Failure of a respondent to file a timely response to each allegation in the complaint and in this notice may be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to appear and contest the allegations of the complaint and this notice, and to authorize the administrative law judge and the Commission, without further notice to the respondents, to find the facts to be as alleged in the complaint and this notice and to enter both an initial determination and a final determination containing such findings, and may result in the issuance of a limited exclusion order or a cease and desist order or both directed against such respondent. Issued: January 24, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1910 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
