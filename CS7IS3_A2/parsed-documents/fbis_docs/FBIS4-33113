Based on existing agreements, those countries are paying their debts using Brazilian foreign debt titles purchased on the secondary market. They thus obtain a large discount by passing old debt papers to the Central Bank with a previously negotiated discount, which is normally below market prices. But the foreign debt agreement reached between Brazil and the international creditor banks states that restructured debt bonds cannot be negotiated on the secondary market for at least two years, this being the "phase-in" [preceding word given in English] period for making an additional guarantee contributions. Renato Naegle, Seplan [Secretariat of Planning and Coordination of the Presidency of the Republic] financial affairs general coordinator, has said Brazil will have to renegotiate "swap" agreements with the three debtor countries. Negotiations with Bolivia, which owes Brazil $70 million, have developed to the point that it will be able to use the U.S. "zero coupon bonds" to repay its debt. Mozambique's debt is larger. The original agreement was reached in June 1992, involving the repayment of nearly $325 million over 12 years. Another $300 million debt depends on defining a new "swap." The case with Guyana is more simple because its last repayment installment falls due in September. Before the new foreign debt agreement, Brazil reduced its debt by $1.3 billion through "swap" operations. The first country to use this kind of operation was Paraguay which paid off its debt. The International Affairs Secretariat [Secretaria de Assuntos Internacionais, Seain] has stated that on 31 March, Brazil had credits with the governments of 39 Third World countries. They amounted to $5.588 billion, plus $864.3 million with private debtors from several countries. To these figures we must add $1.490 billion in Bank of Brazil credits that are being renegotiated with debtors through the Foreign Credits Evaluation Committee [Comite de Avaliacao de Creditos ao Exterior] (Comace). Most of these credits involve foreign trade operations contracted through the former Finex [Financing and Export Fund] or the present Proex [Export Financing Program]. The situation of the six main debtor governments is as follows: Poland -- Payments are being made on schedule. Its debt was rescheduled within the Paris Club framework. As of last March it owes $3.7 billion, of which nearly $1.2 billion is contracted with the Bank of Brazil. Angola -- The second largest debtor; owes Brazil nearly $800 million. It did not comply with the additional agreement it reached with Brazil in 1991 because of the internal political problems and the 1992-1993 civil war. A Brazilian mission is currently visiting Luanda, holding talks to reach a new agreement. Peru -- This country reached a bilateral agreement with Brazil in 1987 and it is paying on schedule. Peru owes Brazil nearly $390 million. Mozambique -- This is the fourth largest debtor and its $300 million debt will be renegotiated between the two governments during the first half of June, to include "swap" operations. Ecuador -- This country owes Brazil nearly $280 million and is paying on schedule. Argentina -- The Argentine Government debt with Brazil totals about $220 million and payments are being made on schedule without any problem. Nigeria -- This country owes nearly $40 million to Brazil. Its debt was rescheduled within the Paris Club framework, but the Nigerian Government has not been able to pay because it does not allow payments by private creditors in Nigerian currency. Cuba -- The Cuban Government's debt with Brazil is small: $5 million. This debt is being negotiated within the terms of a trade deal that foresees the purchase by the Brazilian Government of Cuban medicines for an initial amount of $30 million. The agreement foresees that the Cuban debt will be deducted from the Brazilian payment for Cuban products. Seain Secretary Mauro Marcondes Rodrigues recalls that in January 1991 the overdue debt by Third World countries with Brazil amounted to 75 percent of the total debt; this has dropped to 12.9 percent. The overdue debt from the private sector of those countries is still high: 73 percent. Marcondes Rodrigues has said Comace must now concentrate on recovering the credits Brazil granted to the private sector of those countries.
