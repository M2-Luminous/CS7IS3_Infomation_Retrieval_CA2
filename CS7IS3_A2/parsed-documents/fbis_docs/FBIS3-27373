Yang Shouyue, director of the transportation department of Guizhou Province, said that it will have established a full transport network connecting other parts of the country by the end of this century. The length of highways in service in the province had reached 32,100 kilometers by the end of 1993, and railways had risen to 1,481 kilometers. The province is top of the league in China in terms of railway electrification, in part thanks to the completion of electrification of railroads in the province coming from Sichuan, Yunnan and Hunan Provinces. Local air companies have opened 30 domestic services and a direct charter flight from Guiyang to Hong Kong. The development of transport has spurred the booming of other industries. The gross product of Guizhou Province increased at an average annual rate of nine percent between 1980 and 1993. Rich in natural and tourist resources, Guizhou has verified reserves of 74 different minerals, 29 of which rank in the top five in China. Located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with complex geographic conditions, Guizhou's economic and social progress had been hindered by its poor transportation facilities. A survey shows that the province had only 1,950 kilometers of roads and highways when New China was founded in 1949, and even sparser railway, water-borne and air transport facilities. The government has made great efforts to improve transport facilities since 1949, especially since 1978 when China began its national reform and opening-up policy. Investment in road-building during the past 15 years topped 1.5 billion yuan, 7.5 times the total in the previous 30 years. In addition to the 8,000 kilometers of highways built during the past few years, construction of an international airport, three highways and four rail lines are under way in the province.
