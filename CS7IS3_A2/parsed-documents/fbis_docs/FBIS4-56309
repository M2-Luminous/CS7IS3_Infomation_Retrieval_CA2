To me, this has not been simply a three-month-long campaign but, rather, a campaign of many years that included frequent journeys throughout the country. It began by sharing the country's problems; later, by examining its most pressing needs; and now, by presenting government proposals that originate from an unwavering, firm, and sincere premise that there will be no hatred, no settling of scores, no retaliation, and no persecution. I am committed to conducting an all-out and unwavering war against unemployment, because, to me, economic growth means nothing if, at the same time, the population is not able to satisfy its most basic needs. What use is there in honoring international commitments if there are thousands of Panamanians who at one time enjoyed potable water but today are deprived of it, or only have access to it during the early morning hours? It is impossible for me to agree that everything has improved in Panama simply because a number of skyscrapers have been built, especially if at the same time there is an increase in the number of homeless children begging for money at every streetlight, dropping out of schools, or getting involved in crime. I am unmoved by figures that only reflect the opulence of the few, when the majority of people are blocked from any advancement. We have prepared an integrated, coherent, and ambitious program. Moreover, not one sector of the population has been left out. The program includes a respectable retirement for those who have already fulfilled their share of sacrifice and service. It also includes hope for members of the younger generation who are about to enter the workforce, for those who live in turbulent and chaotic urban centers, and for those who prefer to live in the countryside. This program is intended to once again return the nation to all of us, without exclusion, retaliation, and discrimination, allowing the best and brightest find a place in government service without first having to pass through the appalling bureaucratic quota screening and political party distribution system. I feel very sad when a youngster has to drop out of school to help his mother support his younger brothers. I would prefer that this did not happen. Also, I do not want to see parents sacrificing everything -- recreation, enjoyment, and, in many instances, food itself -- just to be able to send their children to school, knowing beforehand that when they graduate they will not find a job. I feel very sad when I read that Panama has become a country with ever-increasing violent crime, or that, as a nation, we are being linked to corruption. This situation cannot be resolved by merely strengthening the police, because the problem does not lie there. Panamanians turn to crime because they have lost all hope of finding a good job, or because corruption pays better than honest work. I am a firm believer in punishing criminals, but I am also a believer in their rehabilitation. Nevertheless, I believe in combating crime by combating the roots of crime. Therefore, we must treat those youngsters on drugs, while drug traffickers and money launderers must be punished without flinching. At the same time, we must prevent Panamanian households from disintegrating and prevent others from following the same course. I am also seeking to have all Panamanians once again feel proud of having the country represented in a dignified manner in all international forums. We have been the object of ridicule for too many years, as if in Panama we fall short of being reputable. My wife and I would like to lift the Presidency of the Republic to a place of responsibility and reliability -- a place the country demands and deserves. We would like to see all Panamanians measured by the maturity of our society and not by our politicians' whims. My fellow countrymen, in countering my proposals my adversaries have spared no slander or insults. As part of that mudslinging campaign, they have not even left my wife, daughters, or my elderly parents unscathed. Nevertheless, I said it at the beginning of the campaign, and I can again say it proudly at the end: Not one single insult against any candidate will be heard from me. Consistent with this conduct, you can be sure that my family and I have forgiven our detractors. We have turned away from that black cloud of politics, and we are preparing to build a better future for all Panamanians. The past -- the distant as well as the recent past -- must stay behind us forever. There is no possibility whatsoever of returning to militarism. On this, I have given my word, and all of those who accompanied me during the campaign are committed to this. Most of all, those who will accompany me as part of the government are committed to this. The Panama of the future, the Panama of hope, cannot be built on the swamps of recrimination and hatred. We seek to build it on the solid ground of harmony and respect for the opinions of others. We are seeking to build it with a team completely divorced from political affiliation or party quotas -- a team comprising men and women committed only to the country and of whom we demand just two things: honesty and efficiency. That is why all -- I repeat -- all Panamanians know who represents their final hope.
