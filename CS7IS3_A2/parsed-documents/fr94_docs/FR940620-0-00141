FR940620-0-00141 FR940620-0-00029 Comment. The NPRM proposed that public sidewalks, or a continuous passage within them, connect to accessible routes on adjacent properties. A number of commenters were concerned with the technical difficulties of such connections along steeply sloping public sidewalks. This is especially problematic along undeveloped sites where the location of the accessible route or entrance has not yet been established. Response. Where entrance elevations can be fixed before public sidewalk construction, a level platform can be provided by careful engineering design. Where connections cannot be anticipated, a level walkway diverging from the public sidewalk running slope can serve a number of potential entrances. An appendix note further describes this approach. Recessed entrances and building setbacks will provide the necessary distance to achieve a smooth blending of the connection from the public sidewalk to the building entrance. Where walks containing an accessible route on an adjacent site must connect to sloping public sidewalks, some warping and blending may be necessary. This must be accommodated on the site if the public sidewalk has already been constructed. However, when the developer of a property is also responsible for new public sidewalk design and construction, as is often the case in urban construction, the coordination of such connections can be accomplished through careful site engineering. These public/private interfaces are somewhat analogous to the landlord/tenant responsibilities for accessibility under title III of the ADA; each must comply where he has the authority to operate. The appendix discussion has been expanded to clarify these issues. In many cases, a developer will provide both public sidewalks and private walks as part of the same project. Jurisdictions may require, through the permitting process, that adjacent property owners blend accessible routes at the continuous passage when sites are developed. 14.2.1(1)‚ê£Width Paragraph (1) requires that the continuous passage within a new public sidewalk be a minimum of 36 inches in width or as shown in Figures 7(a) and (b) when a turn must be made around an obstruction. It further requires that passing spaces be provided at intervals that do not exceed 200 feet when public sidewalk width is less than 60 inches continuously. Comment. The NPRM proposed that a public sidewalk, or a continuous passage within its width, be a minimum of 36 inches in width. Most commenters recommended that public sidewalks be a minimum of 48 inches wide (and even wider in commercial areas). One county public works agency submitted a copy of standard public works details and specifications that illustrated a minimum sidewalk width of 48 inches throughout. Other jurisdictions indicated similar or greater width requirements for new construction. Most commenters also supported the proposed requirement for passing spaces, although several questioned the need for them in suburban and rural areas. Response. The interim final rule requires a 36 inch minimum continuous passage to ensure an unobstructed route, clear of street furnishings, equipment, and other items commonly associated with public sidewalks, along the pedestrian walkway. Although common street and public sidewalk engineering practice support a 48 inch minimum width, these guidelines represent minimum requirements. A requirement that the width of the continuous passage be as shown in Figures 7(a) and (b) has been added for consistency with ADAAG 4.3.3 (Width). A 60 inch wide public sidewalk incorporating passing space will generally be provided in commercial areas. Greater widths are recommended in current FHWA guidelines and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards for new construction in such areas (AASHTO, ``A Policy on the Geometric Design of Highways and Streets'', 1990). Residential neighborhoods, where pedestrian volume may be light, and other low-pedestrian-volume zones such as rural and suburban areas, office parks and similar developments, will commonly be served by 48 inch wide walkways, along which passing spaces must be provided. Passing space may be available at intersecting walks, at building entrances, at driveways, or even at bus stops and street crossings. Additional public sidewalk width is commonly provided at regular intervals to provide a structural surface for storm drainage inlets, utility vaults, and similar below-grade construction. This common practice can provide the required passing space, as well. Because these guidelines apply to areas where pedestrian volumes may change radically over time, public sidewalks must be designed to accommodate potential as well as actual levels of use. Narrow public sidewalks and rights-of-way without parkways will generally require parallel public sidewalk curb ramps rather than perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps at street crossings because of the lack of width for the landing required at the top of a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp. Although the requirements for width have been reorganized, no substantive changes have been made. In new construction, where public sidewalks must have a consistent cross slope across their full width, the 36 inch continuous passage (or the additional maneuvering space described in Figures 7(a) and (b)) serve only to ensure that passage is not blocked by fixed or movable items. In alterations, the continuous passage may be the only portion of a wider public sidewalk in which cross slope can be maintained within usable limits, as further discussed in ADAAG 14.3 (Alterations). The continuous passage will also be a factor where public sidewalks cross driveways, as only 36 inches must be provided at the 1:50 cross slope. A driveway apron cannot be part of the continuous passage if its slope to the street exceeds 1:50. Furthermore, where gratings are installed in public sidewalks, a continuous passage must be provided to bypass them. Where large areas of gratings may be required to ventilate subsurface transformer vaults or similar construction, designers should provide the necessary surface area by increasing the length of a run of gratings so as to minimize its width relative to the public sidewalk width. Comment. Several comments misconstrued the requirement for a continuous passage, believing that it could assist persons with vision impairments in way finding through parking lots and other large undifferentiated areas. Response. The concept of a continuous passage applies only to public sidewalks in the public right-of-way. The parking lot of a shopping center, arena, or other facility is part of a site subject to the requirements of ADAAG 4.3 for an accessible route.
