I cannot see any security guarantees from Russia and America. This simply is intended to deceive Ukraine with Kravchuk's help. As for the $155 million allocated to Ukraine by Bill Clinton, this is the money that has been paid to American specialists who were on assignment in Ukraine." Mykola Shulha, chairman of the Supreme Council Committee for Issues of State Sovereignty and Inter-Republican and Inter-ethnic Relations: "If after signing the documents Russia does not comply with the obligations assumed, this could undermine the global authority of such an influential state as America, and would have negative consequences for the whole world. As for the trilateral agreement, I shall endeavour to convince the Supreme Council to ratify this document. I believe that a compromise solution can also be found in settling the issues of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. Policy should be made through understanding and respect for the interests of our states." Volodymyr Filenko, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "I expressed my opinion even before the documents were signed and can confirm that my assessment is positive. First, Ukraine today is economically unable to maintain this nuclear potential. Second, as a result of signing the agreement it will be provided with fuel for its nuclear electric stations, which will partly resolve the energy problem. Third, it will become possible to set up a certain stabilization fund to introduce the hryvnya. However, this is Ukraine's last reserve, and political and economic reforms are now badly needed." Volodmyr Klymchuk, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine: "I assess the signing of the Moscow agreement to be a Ukrainian diplomatic success, implementing the Declaration on the Independence of Ukraine. At last its primary provision on non-nuclear status is being realized and Ukraine will receive certain benefits which are badly needed. As for comments to the effect that nuclear weapons will be handed to Zhirinovskiy, I would like to stress that this figure is no doubt dangerous. However, hidden national communists and national fascists are an even greater danger." Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, chairman of the secretariat of the People's Movement of Ukraine: "What happened in Moscow is a total betrayal of the Ukrainian people, and is bad enough to stand trial for." Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Republic of the Crimea: "My assessment of the Moscow agreement between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons is positive. In general, President Leonid Kravchuk's assets are the international recognition of Ukraine. His liabilities are what has happened to the Ukrainian economy."
