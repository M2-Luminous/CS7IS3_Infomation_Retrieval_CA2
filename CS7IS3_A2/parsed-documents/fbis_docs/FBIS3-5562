President Kim Yong-sam and his Romanian counterpart Ion Iliescu recognized the necessity of the two countries working together to maintain and expedite the current worldwide trends of peace and cooperation. "They expressed their support for the international community's efforts to reduce weapons of mass destruction including the nuclear arsenal, and to prevent their proliferation," the statement said. Iliescu, Romania's first popularly elected president, arrived in Seoul Wednesday for a three-day visit. He is the first Romanian president to visit Seoul since the two countries formed diplomatic relations in 1990. President Iliescu backed Seoul's efforts to achieve peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula, while President Kim reasserted South Korea's support for political and economic reforms in Romania as it heads toward creating a democratic society and market-oriented economy. President Kim asked Iliescu to back up South Korea's efforts to become a member of the United Nations Security Council, and the Romanian president expressed his support for the idea. The two presidents agreed to encourage investment and industrial cooperation in conformity with their domestic laws, and to forge bilateral agreements in such important economic areas as energy production, including peaceful use of nuclear energy, electro-technics and electronics, and the automobile and shipbuilding industries. They also agreed to expand cooperation in science and technology and to encourage joint research projects and exchanges of scientists and researchers, and of information and experience in the promotion of economic reform, as well as cooperating in professional education and specialization of economic experts and managers. "In this regard," the statement said, "both presidents agreed to establish the joint committee in conformity with the agreement on economic, scientific and technical cooperation signed on Aug. 7, 1990." The committee's first meeting will be held at an early date deemed agreeable to both sides, according to the statement. At the summit meeting, the two presidents exchanged views on international affairs including the situation in Northeast Asia, the Korean peninsula and the Balkans, and on ways to expand bilateral relations. Iliescu will be the main guest at a state dinner on Wednesday night. He is scheduled to meet with leaders from both the ruling and opposition camps on Thursday. Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his visit as another sign of the Cold War's collapse.
