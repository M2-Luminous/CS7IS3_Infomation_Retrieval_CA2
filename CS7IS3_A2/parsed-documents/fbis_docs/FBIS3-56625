As many as 132 people were killed during those January days and more than 700 were wounded. The president voiced his remark during the report of Azerbaijan's attorney general Ali Omarov. Omarov, in particular, pointed out that the purpose for forces being introduced into Baku at that time was primarily to rescue the leadership of Azerbaijan's communist party. As the attorney general believes, Azerbaijan's former leaders Abdurakhman Vezirov, Ayaz Mutalibov, Viktor Polyanichko, Elmira Gafarova, and former leader of the republic's KGB Vagif Gusaynov should be made answerable for the January 1990 events along with the former Soviet leadership at that time and its power ministers (Gorbachev, Yazov, Kryuchkov, Bakatin, Primakov). Omarov reported that he had ordered the National Security Ministry to institute proceedings against Vagif Gusaynov due to the January 20, 1990, events in Baku. Observers do not rule out that criminal charges against Vezirov and Mutalibov can be brought as well. The discussion is being continued.
