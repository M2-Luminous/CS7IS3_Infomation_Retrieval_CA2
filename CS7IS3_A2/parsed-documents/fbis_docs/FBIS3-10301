The project was promoted by Guatemalan Deputy Juan Ayerdi Aguilar and is part of the recommendations emanating from the August 1993 First Human Rights Seminar organized by the respective Parlacen commission in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Human rights ombudsmen representing each of the Parlacen member countries participated in the seminar. The new ombudsman will be a Parlacen commissioner who will have to observe the political constitutions of each member state, the universal declaration of human rights, as well as treaties and agreements signed between the regions' governments. The ombudsman will also have his own legal status and will be independent from any human rights organization, institution, or official but will respect the jurisdiction of the other countries human rights ombudsmen. Ayerdi Aguilar explained that any candidate who seeks to occupy the position must be a lawyer with at least five years professional experience as well as a citizen of one of the Parlacen member countries. The ombudsman will enjoy the same prerogatives and immunities as Parlacen deputies. The position is not open to public sector workers, national congress or Parlacen deputies, or leaders of political parties, workers unions, or business associations. Neither will the position be open to persons who are ministers of any religious denomination. In addition, the person selected will be barred from participating in his profession during his term as ombudsman. The candidate will be selected by the full Parlacen Assembly with a favorable vote of at least two-thirds of the total number of deputies. In addition, the candidate's nationality will be determined in accordance with the order in which the presidents were elected to the regional forum. For that reason, the first ombudsman will be a Guatemalan national since Roberto Nicolle Carpio, who first presided over the Parlacen, originates from Guatemala. The human rights ombudsman will hold the position for three years and will not be eligible for reelection. Ayerdi explained that there will also be a deputy ombudsman who will substitute for the official ombudsman in case of temporary absence. The selection of an assistant ombudsman will follow the same procedure as those established to select the regular ombudsman.
