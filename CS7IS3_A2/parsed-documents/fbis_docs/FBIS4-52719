FBIS4-52719 "dreas093_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 North Korea Kim Yong-sam's `Separatist' Remarks Denounced Kim Yong-sam's `Separatist' Remarks Denounced SK1305102394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1008 GMT 13 May 94 SK1305102394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam recently at a party in "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] contended that the reunification of the country is "fantasy" and "unification concept must be discarded." Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today brands this as an unpardonable separatist remark against reunification. The news analyst says: To reunify the divided country is the supreme desire and the most urgent task of the nation. The traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks denying reunification itself are an intolerable insult and challenge to the 70 million Koreans who crave for national reunification and fight for its realisation. He not only utters words against reunification but also works hard to block the peaceful reunification of the country. It is none other than the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique that categorically opposed the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, a common reunification charter of the nation, turned down the North-proposed convocation of a national conference for national reconciliation, unity and reunification, frustrated the exchange of special envoys between North and South, totally blocked North-South dialogue and drove the North-South relations to confrontation and the brink of war. The traitor Kim Yong-sam must clearly see the trend of the times, refrain from separatist acts against reunification and step down as demanded by the people.
