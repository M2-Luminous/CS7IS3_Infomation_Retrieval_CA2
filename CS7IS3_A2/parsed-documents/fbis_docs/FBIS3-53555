At the beginning of the meeting, the House of Representatives speaker welcomed the first deputy prime minister and the cabinet members and delivered a valuable speech in which he said: I would like to express my happiness and that of people's deputies to welcome you at the beginning of this meeting in the new year, which we hope will bring prosperity and stability for our people who have suffered much as a result of certain whims and desires and the placement of personal interests over public ones. Brothers: We in this House hoped that we would be able to go ahead with our legislative and control duties within the framework of the Constitution and the law, backed by everybody's belief in the need to save the country from its difficulties and problems. The problems have accumulated since the hateful eras of division and the ensuing unnatural transitional period that our people decided to end on 27 April 1993. They did this by holding general elections that reflected the honesty of the people and registered a wonderful achievement of cohesion among the individuals of the society who took part in the elections. It also silenced many tongues and refuted many speculations. House of Representatives speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar added: The general elections experience in our country produced a new political fact, which everybody had to respect because the results of these elections represented the will of the whole people for the first time in the history of unified Yemen. But regrettably, some people have changed their intentions, and their words now contradict their actions. This forced the House to face some difficulties in carrying out its constitutional duties. Yet, the House has played its national role in preserving the people's interests and gains, represented by unity, democracy, and political pluralism, and also exerted its utmost effort to support the coalition government to carry out its executive duties since it won the House of Representatives' confidence in accordance with the statement it submitted and in light of the House's comment on it. It was natural for the coalition government to immediately carry out the contents of its statement. As part of its special duties, the House commented on the statement and drew up timetables for it to be carried out. If we want to review the government's commitments from the day it won confidence on 2 August 1993 through the rest of the year, we will not be able to explain them all. However, we refer to the main duties: 1. Merging the Armed Forces and the Security Forces on national bases. 2. Unifying all legislation and submitting draft laws to the House. 3. Submitting a program for the financial, monetary, and supply policy, in addition to a report on the economic and financial situation of the state. 4. Presenting the draft general state budget for 1994 two months before the beginning of the financial year. 5. Providing the required foreign currency to import basic commodities. All this was frozen and its execution delayed, whether with goodwill or not, until the political crisis emerged to double the tragedies and paralyze the various state departments. Instead of containing the negative repercussions of the crisis and limiting them by doubling its activity and encouraging more efforts by all the state departments, the government pushed matters in the opposite direction. This prompted the House of Representatives in its meeting on 10 January 1994 to obligate the government to return employees to their offices, including the prime minister and the ministers; to continue the dialogue within the coalition; and to take its time to carry out its duties. Concluding, House speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar said that the House of Representatives, the guiding authority of the government, deeply regrets the deteriorating situation and the negligence the political crisis has produced in various areas, especially the economic area in which prices went up and in which the national currency deteriorated seriously. This prompted the House to summon the government to quickly discuss its statement and the House's comment on it. We decided to hold discussions on the following areas: 1. The economic and financial area. 2. The security and military area. 3. The services area. 4. the administrative and legal area. Afterward, brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad Makki, first deputy prime minister, delivered the following speech: Brother House of Representatives speaker, brother deputies: May God's peace and blessings be upon you. It gives me and the brother ministers pleasure to be with you in response to an invitation which your esteemed House extended on 13 January 1994 and which set Monday, 17 January 1994, as a date for the government's attendance to hold a general debate on the government's policy statement and the House's reply to it in order to learn about the extent and level of implementing this statement. To begin with I would like to express my deep appreciation for your esteemed House for the effective and constructive role it has played since the crisis began, and also for its full eagerness to contain and stop the repercussions of the crisis in order to safeguard the country's unity and stability. This is so especially since your House is the first parliamentary council to be elected through direct, free, and honest elections, which were held in all Yemeni governorates on 27 April 1993. This House also came as an additional gain for our people who achieved their unity on 22 May 1990 when the Republic of Yemen was declared on a democratic basis. This basis is established on political pluralism. Through this basis, our people and homeland realized this historic achievement. Brother House Speaker, brother deputies, we, as a coalition government, highly appreciate the important role your esteemed House has played in various legislative, constitutional, and political aspects by devoting most of your recent sessions to discussing the strangling political crisis the country is passing through, and also by trying to heal the rift between the parties to the coalition. Your invitation to the government truly expresses the House's care, under these regrettable circumstances, for the homeland's causes and concerns. We regret the fact that not all ministers attended this session, and that only two parties in the coalition attended it. We were eager to respond to your invitation to attend this session after the brother House speaker entrusted us with doing so on 16 [as heard] January 1994 despite the absence of a coalition party, including the brother prime minister, who is preoccupied with political action and who left behind a host of major tasks as head of government. This has completely crippled the work of the government and all its departments and facilities. Moreover, difficulties were created that prevented the government from carrying out its role and fulfilling its commitments regarding the implementation of its policy statement, which was submitted to your esteemed House, and your comment on this statement, according to which the government won confidence. In addition, these difficulties impeded the constitutional tasks assigned to the government. The continued absence of a party to the coalition government has prevented the government from accomplishing its plans and programs. Perhaps the most important matter was the government's inability to submit the 1994 state's general budget draft law on the constitutional date. During the 1993 fiscal year, the government had to work according to the 1992 budget and decided not to work out (?any) development or services projects. Moreover, we could not submit annual reports on the government's achievements. Brother Speaker, brother Deputies: We in the government wished to submit to your esteemed House the replies to the overall questions and queries that the deputies addressed to the government. However, the absence of the brother prime minister and several ministers has prevented this. Realizing this, some urgent measures and arrangements were taken to handle the economic situation in a way that would stop the continued deterioration in the exchange rate and provide the basic commodities, which would stabilize the homeland through an expanded meeting comprising officials of the finance and supply and trade ministries, the central bank, the commercial banks operating in the country, and the federation of the chambers of commerce and industry. Concluding his speech, Makki said: We affirm our full readiness to reply to the queries submitted to us. We hope that we will be given another opportunity to prepare thorough reports on the government's various activities and replies to your queries. Afterward, the deputies unanimously agreed to postpone the general debate on the government's policy statement and the House's comment on it to a coming session, which would be attended by Prime Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and all ministers. After the brother first deputy prime minister and ministers left the House's hall, the deputies discussed the issue of voting on Presidential Decree No. 23 of 1992 on the salaries and retirement allowances for the Armed Forces and security forces. The House decided to make a final vote in the coming session. It also decided to hold a special session to discuss its internal affairs and situation. The House will resume work tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God willing.
