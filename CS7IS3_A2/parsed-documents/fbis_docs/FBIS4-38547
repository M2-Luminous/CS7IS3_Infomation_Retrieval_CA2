For the first ever, such a statement was released by a parliament that was elected by the people. I think this is a very timely statement. Second, I think that the executive power should work properly for the benefit of the people. Third, the executive power and our legislative power should go along one common road and find one common language. I think we should be able to work together in the future. In this respect, the statement is absolutely correct. I think we need the impetus to embark on a new road. Fourth, being a new, professional parliament, we should show the people that we are able to carry out our own policy. We should not comply with circumstances and, by doing so, bring more economic hardship and weaker social protection to our people. We should aim at future changes for the better for the people. All our 177 deputies thought like this. The country will never benefit if we do not unite. Our primary aim is to work for the nation. Our primary aim is to change people's life for the better. We should help to firm up our national currency. Prices are increasing. We should curb this growth. We should stop irreversible changes in the economy. This is our main concern and nothing else. We are not against the president or against the government. We have no such aims. We believe our motives will be correctly understood.
