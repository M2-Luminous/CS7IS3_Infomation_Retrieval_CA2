The 63-minute speech revealed the thorny issues currently facing the United States while demonstrating the U.S. ambition to lead the world. Basically, the address focuses on U.S. domestic issues. Clinton placed cracking down on crime and reforming the health insurance and social welfare system on the top of U.S. domestic issues. His placing cracking down on crime above economic issues is quite a noteworthy signal. The high crime rate has become a problem the American people are most concerned about. Because the entire American society has been eroded and is being paralyzed, Clinton, in addition to urging the U.S. Congress to pass the bill on cracking down on crime, called on all American people to abide by law and order, to work hand-in-hand to rebuild American society, and to regain the forces that had bound the society to enable the American people to overcome their frustration, defeat the evils, and create a good future. Health insurance for everyone is another issue that Clinton has insisted on. He hopes to revamp the current health insurance system so that the 37 million Americans who currently are not insured will also be taken care of. If the bill is passed, it will be the most significant U.S. social reform since the life-time social security welfare system was established in the later days of the Great Depression. While delivering the state of the union address, Clinton even threatened that he would immediately veto the Congress' version of the comprehensive health insurance plan if it could not provide health care to all Americans. Obviously, Clinton's state of the union address was designed to create a favorable climate for the Democratic Party's mid-term election campaign at the end of this year. Whether the Congress will pass the health insurance bill is something that remains to be seen. But, it is indisputable that Clinton was able to tightly grip the pulse of the times and to precisely point out the issues the American people are most concerned about. The state of the union address indeed gives us a quite clear indicator for gaining an idea of what course the United States will take in the future. As a matter of fact, many of the problems Clinton raised in the state of the union address are not unique problems of the United States. Such problems as the rise in crime rate, change in people's perception of values, and the crumbling of society's binding force are common problems that obsess many societies during their transformation periods. Therefore, Clinton's urge for rebuilding society also provides other countries with a soul-searching opportunity. What kind of foreign policy the United States will pursue at a time when the country is facing domestic difficulties is also a problem the world is concerned about. In the state of the union address, Clinton said the United States will maintain a strong national defense and will not leave the rest of the world alone -- this for the time being should give relief to those who had been worried that the United States might return to isolationism. However, this does not mean the United States is capable of establishing a single-polar power setup with the United States as the sole dominant force -- it still needs the cooperation of other countries concerned. For this reason, although Clinton said Mainland China must make noticeable improvement in its human rights record, he did not use the most-favored-nation issue as a means to force Peking [Beijing] to comply. It is quite clear that Washington is doing everything it can to improve its relations with Peking -- this is a fact that we must know clearly in observing U.S. policy toward China. Northeast Asia (Communist China, Russia, and the Korean peninsula) constitutes a significant portion of the part of the state of the union address that deals with U.S. foreign policy. Northeast Asia is a potential flash point that not only has always been a potential security problem for the United States, but also is closely related to building a new international order. Such being the case, Clinton, in addition to his efforts to improve relations with Communist China, declared that the United States will support the promotion of democracy in former Soviet Union countries -- including Russia -- and will continue to push for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. But, these goals cannot be achieved overnight. Russia's economic reform has slowed down, and Moscow's relations with its neighbors are becoming increasingly tense. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev recently complained that the West simply does not understand Russia's "special role" in the former Soviet Union bloc -- this shows how tense relations are. All these problems may result in the resurgence of radical Russian nationalism. Ukraine's situation is more or less the same. According to Western intelligence, if Ukraine's economic situation does not improve, racial conflicts will very likely be stirred up, which will result in a splitting of the country. If this happens, the agreement between Ukraine and the United States signed recently at the Moscow summit meeting on destroying Ukraine's nuclear weapons may be torn up. Such an outcome very likely will directly jeopardize the already fragile Russian-Ukrainian relations. Facing these situations, the West does not seem to have a set of effective countermeasures. Therefore, maintaining good relations with Communist China to check Russia's possible expansion from the southern flank has become a natural response of the United States in the present stage. Tensions on the Korean peninsula are also on the rise. North Korea has threatened to tear up the armistice agreement of the Korean war if the United States imposes economic santions on it. In response, the United States is considering deploying Patriot missiles in Korea. From this development, we can see that there is still a long way to go to make the Korean peninsula nuclear-free. In view of Communist China's close relations with North Korea, Washington must rely on Peking as a lever for dealing with Pyongyang. Relations between Russia, Communist China, and North Korea are intricate and entangled with each other. If Russia's economic and political reforms succeed, then, given that Peking's military spending has continued to increase, Moscow certainly can serve as a kind of checking force. But at a time when Russia itself is full of crises, the United States can only try to improve its relations with Communist China and invite it to make common efforts to ensure world peace. Then, will Communist China exercise self-restraint on weapons exportation and on other issues, and how will the United States, while pursuing its security benefits, continue to apply pressure on Communist China's human rights record? -- these are the developments we should keep a close eye on while analyzing Clinton's state of the union address.
