The researchers, led by Yutaka Kondo, professor at the university's solar-terrestrial environmental laboratory, used data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) survey of chemical substances in the atmosphere. The pollutants are carried from the Asian mainland to the Pacific by prevailing westerly winds, the researchers said. Low-altitude ozone results from a chemical change in atmospheric oxygen, with nitrogen oxides from automobile exhausts and coal-fired power stations serving as catalysts. Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low-altitude ozone can damage the respiratory system when in high densities. The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB. But at altitudes of 2,000 to 3000 meters off the coasts near Taiwan and Hong Kong, ozone densities were more than 100 PPB, and off Japan, nitrogen oxide densities were 1 PPB. A member of the research team, Hideaki Nakajima, said the pollutants detected are responsible for acid rain and could eventually cause forests near the Pacific to die off unless countries in the region quickly produce a preventive strategy. China and Russia, with their relatively low environmental standards, have previously been identified as responsible for much of the pollution in the region, but this is the first empirical evidence to back up the claims.
