FR940711-0-00025 FR940711-0-00003 Cal-Almond also objected to the appeal process for determining whether a handler should receive Credit-Back for a particular promotional activity. The commenter claimed that competitors of some handlers will determine the outcome of their appeals. As previously discussed, handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before the Board. In addition, the process allows for further appeal to the Department. The Department also has the right to review all decisions at any point during the appeal process. During the second comment period, Cal-Almond, as well as another independent almond handler, Rotteveel Orchards, commented that under the new Credit-Back program there are many types of promotional and advertising activities which handlers use to promote their products which will be ineligible for Credit-Back. John Rotteveel, on behalf of Rotteveel Orchards, stated the best forms of advertising for his company_``word-of-mouth'' advertising and personal contact with potential buyers_are not creditable activities under the new Credit-Back program. In addition, Rotteveel indicated that he did not believe that the 50% return for creditable activities was enough to warrant any investment in the program. As has already been pointed out, the range of promotional activities eligible for reimbursement under the new Credit-Back program have been significantly expanded. The Department has also modified the new Credit-Back program in this final rule by increasing the amount of credit allowed for approved promotional activities from 50 percent to 662/3 percent. Cal-Almond also objected to the Board's television advertisements because it believes that they have a religious connotation which should not be used to promote almonds. The advertising campaign referred to is not intended to be offensive toward any religion, nor does it contain any negative connotations. Cal-Almond also objected to the portion of the provision which requires individual handlers to determine and declare, within 15 days after the start of the season, the extent to which they intend to use the advertising program. According to the commenter, a handler should not be required to report a year in advance how he/she intends to advertise over an entire year's period. The intent of this provision, in part, was to help the Board plan its finances for the upcoming crop year. With this information available, the Board could determine who was participating and who was not participating in the new program for that year. They would know at that time that all handlers who did not declare their intent would be paying the entire assessment to the Board and that amount could be earmarked for the generic advertising and promotion program. The provision did not require handlers to give a dollar amount or an advertising plan to the Board, but merely an anticipated percentage of their entire advertising assessment they believed would be used under the new program. The deadline was not intended to limit a handler's use of the program. Handlers were not restricted to any types of advertising or any specific amounts. However, the total Credit-Back amount could not exceed the original percentage reported to the Board. Although Cal-Almond's interpretation of this provision is not accurate, the Department considered all aspects of this provision to determine if there were other ways that the Board could obtain this information without requiring handlers to declare their intent to utilize the program. The new Credit-Back program is intended to provide handlers with more flexibility to conduct their own advertising and promotional activities. The Department believes that the Board has other alternatives to accomplish the objectives discussed above, such as reviewing handler participation during past years to obtain an estimate of participation in the new Credit-Back program for the new crop year. The Department has determined that in order to allow handlers more flexibility to participate in the new Credit-Back program, this provision should be eliminated from the regulations. Accordingly, this final rule will be revised to reflect that change. During the second comment period, another independent handler, Wiggin Farms, stated that a referendum should be conducted every three years to offer growers an opportunity to vote on increasing or decreasing advertising expenditures and for voting on continuation of the Order. The Department notes that the Board currently has the authority to recommend annual changes in program expenditures. Determining the merits of holding periodic continuance referenda is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The referenda issue was addressed last year when the Board and other industry groups recommended, during a formal rulemaking hearing in Modesto, California, that periodic referenda be held. The Department is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the record of the formal rulemaking proceeding.
