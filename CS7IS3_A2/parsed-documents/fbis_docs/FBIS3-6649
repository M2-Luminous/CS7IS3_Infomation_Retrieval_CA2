President Ramos directed yesterday the Civil Aeronautics Board to formulate its recommendations to open up the aviation industry, removing policies protecting the monopoly held by Philippine Airlines [PAL] for domestic airline services. Two of the airlines are expected to compete with PAL, servicing the Cebu-Davao route, while a third is working for a congressional franchise to operate an international and domestic passenger and cargo services. One of the new domestic service airlines, the Araneta-led Silangan Airways Inc., is planning to lease at least six 120-seat passenger jets to service the Cebu-Davao routes. Its owners are reportedly looking at Russian-made aircraft to serve as its fleet. The other airline, Star Asia Airways Corp. will field at least two Boeing 737-200s to service other Visayas and Mindanao routes from Manila. The third airline, the All-Asia Airlines Corp., led by businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, has still to obtain its franchise from Congress to operate an international and domestic service airline. The move to open the local aviation industry to more airlines is consistent with the Ramos administration's policy of providing equal opportunity to other Filipino-operated airlines to cater to increasing demands in domestic flight services.
