The policy comes on heels of the recent government decision to handle the question of North Korean loggers in Russia from the approach of humanitarianism, that is, to explore ways to help them. "The government is studying ways to grasp the comprehensive picture of North Koreans' human rights conditions including those of North Korean loggers in Russia," the official said. Based on a finding, he said, the government will raise the issue at relevant United Nations agencies and world human rights organizations like the Amnesty International. The official said the government may also in due course take steps to seek the repatriation of those South Korean fishermen and airplane crew persons being held in North Korea following their seizure by the North Koreans. He further said he understands that a protest rally is being prepared in Osaka, Japan in connection with the recent missing of two Japanese women who, along with their Korean husbands, had moved to North Korea.
