In his words, the last four Tu-95 MS of the 79th heavy bomber division, stationed near Semipalatinsk, had been withdrawn from Kazakhstan to Russia on his orders on February 19. He said that a total of 40 Tu-95 MS's had once been stationed in Kazakhstan. They have been moved into Russia which is the successor of the Soviet Union as far as nuclear forces are concerned. "The withdrawal of heavy bombers, as they are referred to in the treaty even though they are strategic rocket carrying aircraft, from Kazakhstan into Russia was consistent with START I because this was done within the former Soviet Union," Deinekin said. Several obsolete Tu-95 bombers that still stay in Semipalatinsk airfield were manufactured in 1955 and pose no threat because Kazakhstan does not possess rockets of nuclear warheads for this type of bombers, he said. He mad it clear that Kazakhstan lacked the capability to assure safe storage of nuclear warheads or to keep strategic aircraft operational. "As a professional I am confident that outside Russia none of the CIS member nations can keep the air force component of the strategic nuclear forces operational because this requires large spending, very high skills and aid from design boards and manufacturing industries," he explained. Of all these countries only Ukraine possesses strategically important aircraft. In particular, there are 20 Tu-95 bombers in Uzin, 50 km away from Kiev, and 20 Tu-160 aircraft in Priluki, Chernigov Region, Deinekin said. He added that only a few of them were capable of taking off. Deinekin said that talks were underway with the Ukrainian armed forces on withdrawal of these aircraft into Russia "but we have not come to a full understanding."
