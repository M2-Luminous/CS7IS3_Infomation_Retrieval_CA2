The delegates agreed to re-submit a draft statement of principles to their respective governments before returning to more talks, the date and venue of which have still to be fixed, according US representative Robert Einhorn. The draft plan comprises both military and political chapters, the latter rejected by Saudi Arabia. "We categorically reject the political section of the project, which is aimed at normalizing relations between Arab states and Israel," Prince Turki bin-Muhammad al-Sa'ud, head of the Saudi delegation, told AFP. "Most Arab participants also rejected this part of the text," Prince Turki said. David Irvi, leader of the Israeli negotiating team, stressed his government's commitment to the entire plan, including the political chapter. "The political section (of the accord) is necessary because it offers a working framework for future meetings," he argued. The draft statement drawn up at a meeting in Cairo in January proposed a number of confidence-bulding measures and the creation of a zone where weapons of mass destruction would be banned. Prince Turki said the statement should cover "only military questions, including the elimination of weapons of mass destruction." Ivri said he did not understand Saudi Arabia's objections. The kingdom had rejected a US proposal to hold another meeting in June in Vienna, judging that date too close, he added. Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jabbir Al Thani sounded an optimistic note. "We hope to achieve better results in the future, making progress in line with the continuation in the peace process in the Middle East," he said. The delegates approved in principle the creation of a crisis prevention centre in Qatar, as well as a telecommunications centre and a databank. Switzerland and Finland offered to welcome delegates from the region for visits to arms control sites and military training in the two countries. Israel also offered a similar visit to one of its military sites, but the suggestion was turned down by Saudi Arabia. "We will not take part in any activities in Israel and we will not host any of the multilateral negotiations," declared Prince Turki. The meeting here -- marking the first time Israeli officials had travelled to Qatar -- was part of a multilateral negotiating process on Middle Eastern regional issues that parallels bilateral Arab-Israeli talks on purely political disputes. The talks were launched an international Middle East peace conference arranged in Madrid in October 1991 by the United States and the former Soviet Union. Other multinational committees are focusing on economic issues, water sharing, the environment and refugees.
