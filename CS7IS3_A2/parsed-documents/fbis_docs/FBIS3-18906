Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Mr Papoulias said the European Union [EU] had wanted a presence by Moscow and Washington and said their efforts to resolve the Bosnian conflict had been positive. "But we cannot just sit back and give up on our action plan. The EU cannot accept being put on a lower rung than the United States and Russia," he said. Mr Papoulias said EU foreign ministers, who discussed former Yugoslavia over dinner, all agreed on the need to reinforce the United Nations Protection Force - but he gave no indication who might send more soldiers. Mr Papoulias said "there was no objection" at the dinner to a suggestion by French Minister Alain Juppe that there should be a meeting between the United States, Russia and the EU to prepare discussions with all sides in the Bosnian conflict. Heading an EU delegation, Mr Papoulias will fly to Belgrade and then on to Moscow this coming Friday [11 March] for talks in support of EU peace efforts in Bosnia. He is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Saturday to discuss Bosnia. The focus of peace efforts has shifted to Russia, in an attempt to use Moscow's influence with the Serbs to back settlement initiatives. The Croatian Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, and Bosnia's Haris Silajdzic are both due in Moscow this week. Among the proposals they will be discussing is a United States-backed plan to roughly divide the former Yugoslavia between Serb-held areas and a Muslim-Croat coalition. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to discuss the plan when he visits the Russian Town of Vladivostok on March 14.
