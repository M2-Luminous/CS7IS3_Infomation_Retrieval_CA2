Are you prepared to confirm or deny the report? [Gur] All those reports are rubbish. No deliberations have yet been held on that, therefore anybody who quotes us is just making things up. [Dan] Do you also call rubbish a report we aired this morning that Israel is demanding military superiority and not parity with Syria? [Gur] Everything reported on Israel's detailed position on the security arrangements in an agreement with the Syrians is complete and utter nonsense. [Engel] Can you then tell us what instructions the Israeli delegation is receiving on the security aspects? [Gur] I cannot tell you what instructions they are receiving, but I will tell you that we have not reached the stage of discussing the details of security arrangements, therefore I do not understand how people believe those rumors. The main problem is that the Syrian president has refused to specify how he views the peace, therefore we are not prepared to enter into any negotiations or go into any details on our position until we know what peace we are talking about. That, of course, includes everything that comes under the heading of security arrangements, and I reiterate: everything reported in our name on security arrangements is a figment of the imagination. [Dan] But what can Israel theoretically demand on security arrangements for the Syrians to return to the Golan? [Gur] Since I am deputy defense minister, I will not answer theoretical questions, commentators can do that. I can answer questions on policy, which is not dealing with any details of arrangements before we know what type of peace we are discussing. [Engel] Can you then tell us that there is a political assumption in Jerusalem that without progress along the Israeli-Syrian track there will be no movement with either the Lebanese or the Jordanians? [Gur] I think that if we take what the king has to say at face value, then to my regret, even if the Jordanians are ready to deal with the small print of the problems facing us -- and it has been said more than once that they can be overcome -- the king will apparently not want to sign a peace agreement before there is a comprehensive accord, which includes Syria. That, of course, makes progress in relations between the two states more difficult, and does not help our negotiations with the Syrians because what is needed there is a move by the Syrian president, and as much as I try, I find it hard to understand why he cannot say what peace he is talking about with us. [Dan] A question about the compromise worked out between Peres and 'Arafat in Oslo so that only technological means would be used at the crossing points. Can we really make do with only mechanical, technological means without human intervention as security measures at border crossings? [Gur] We have to differentiate between two things at the border crossings. One is the bridge crossing. In other words, Israel's overall security is our exclusive responsibility because it was agreed in the first Oslo paper that we are responsible for external security and overall security, therefore everything to do with defending the border against any danger is exclusively Israeli responsibility. The other aspect is to what extent we participate in the searches on people who have passed customs and have entry papers, to assure they have nothing dangerous on them. Technological measures could be used at that stage. I did not attend the latest talks between the foreign minister and 'Arafat. I can only say that no solution was found at the end of last week. If we are drawing closer to a solution, I welcome it.
