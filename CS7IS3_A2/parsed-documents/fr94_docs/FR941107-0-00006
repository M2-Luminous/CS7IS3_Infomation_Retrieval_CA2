FR941107-0-00006 FR941107-0-00003 An interim final rule was issued on August 8, 1994, and published in the Federal Register [59 FR 41378, August 12, 1994]. A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. No comments were received. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs would be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action without change as a final rule.
