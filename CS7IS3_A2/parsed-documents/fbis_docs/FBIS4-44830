The MEDIA DUEMILA readers, who have followed the difficult battles that have taken place over the last few years to attain a single telecommunications operator, know this well. It has been a rocky path full of snares that the Tangentopoli [Kickback scandal] events have enabled us to understand better. Today we are on the verge of forming Telecom Italia. The boards of directors of the five companies that are involved in the merger approved the balance sheets at the end of March, and the unification of the installations should be concluded on 30 September. It is an epoch-making event, and an indispensable requisite for presenting oneself with the right cards at Community meetings focusing on the complete liberalization of the telephone services market. MEDIA DUEMILA dedicated an entire edition (Issue 114, published December 1993-January 1994) to a description of the history, technology, and policy of the reorganization. This complete documentation also made those outside the telecommunications world understand that Italy is staking a large part of its industrial future at this table. In an atmosphere that is characterized by continual sudden dramatic events, hasty marriages, and equally hasty divorces, it is opportune to open a window on the youngest of the five Italian operators. We are talking about Iritel, a company that was set up on 1 January 1993 to inherit the functions of the ASST [State Telephone Services Agency]. It was a weighty inheritance. The tangles of the unsuccessful reorganization were mixed up with questionable real estate policies that in some cases have come under the scrutiny of the "Kickback" judges. An excessive number of personnel (almost 13,000 employees), who had become unmotivated because of the prospect of a future that was rich in uncertainties, must be added to this. There were all the conditions for giving up, or for moving toward reorganization into the most ordinary administration. All this obviously reflected on the quality of the service and consequently on us, the citizens who are its clients. Let us not forget that the ASST network was (and is with Iritel) the backbone of long distance traffic. However it was not like that. In 15 months there has been "a silent revolution" that has changed the appearance, habits, and rhythms of a company that was closer to collapse than to relaunching. It is a story that deserves being told, in an Italy where the "little bosses" of the public sector seem to be the order of the day, and where only bankruptcy and crime make the news. It is a story about men, about a group of managers who are professionals and have known how to interpret the desire for change without fear. It is not flattery to say that when uncontested managers look out over the deck, the outraged public is also able to get away from the adverse daily routine. This is how it has been for Iritel. To understand what has changed it is sufficient to spend a few hours wandering around the building in via Europa, in EUR [Rome], that houses the head office of the central administration. One breathes a different air, it is a place where bureaucracy has finished up in the attic. The therapy has certainly not been painless. The company has been drastically slimmed down. The number of employees has been reduced to a little over 8,000 and the final goal is 6,500. There was a close confrontation with the trade union, that was also favored by the seniority of the personnel in service. Training and requalification courses are being started to adapt to the requirements of computerization and new technologies. Moments of friction have not been lacking, but the final results show that there was no other way to regain competitiveness. The gamble was to invest in the quality of the network and services, and at the same time align the tariffs with those existing in the European market. A course that has made Iritel the first case of "administrative privatization." The inserts accompanying this article [not provided] describe the missions and goals of Iritel and constitute a plan leading to its merger into a single administration. It is more interesting to analyze certain strategic choices that were made at the beginning of 1993, and that are becoming concrete realities today. Winning New Markets Iritel's submarine cable network is the most extensive in the Mediterranean, and it is a real bridge between Africa and Europe, and between the countries of the East and the Mediterranean basin. Agreements are being worked out with various partners. One particular goal is to turn the international network into one of the most important windows through which the Russians and their economy can look out on the western world. This is a strategic goal, even if today 80 percent of the traffic takes place between the countries of western Europe. A series of initiatives in the field of submarine cables are to be remembered: The ITUR (Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia) cable, that is destined to connect Palermo to Moscow; the TLB (Italy-Albania-Macedonia-Bulgaria-Turkey), that will join Istanbul to Bari; the cable from Italy to Tunisia, and others. In less than two years the 3,000 kilometers of submarine cables (mainly analog) will be increased to over 7,000 kilometers of cables that are almost exclusively digital. The network of submarine cables in Italy will be extended by a further 1,500 kilometers when the Civitavecchia-Olbia, Palermo-Cagliari, and Savona-Sassari lines are laid. Investments A total investment of 3.4 trillion lire is planned for 1993-1994. The primary goal is to continue with the modernization and technological innovation processes to digitize almost the entire network (90 percent by the end of the year). Special Services and Networks International competition can only be faced by offering special networks. In 1994, the goal will be the diffusion of private international virtual networks. A service to the United Kingdom has been offered since last October, and one with France since December. Services with Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, and Germany will be started during the first six months of this year. The "Global European Networking," which Iritel joined in September 1992, has made a flexible network connecting the principal European countries available to the Italian communications system. At the same time, in agreement with the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company], a major effort is being made to diffuse the ISDN [integrated services digital network] network that is particularly useful for business users. This will enable Italy to align itself with the diffusion trend of the French, German, and British operators by 1996. The START Project This is the feather in the cap of Iritel's investment plan. A total of 715 billion lire will be invested over 1993-1994 to extend the optical fiber network that is available to business users. A total of 6,299 kilometers of optical fiber cable will be laid for the ground network, to create about 206,000 kilometers, and 400 systems of 565 Mbit/s [second] will be installed. The submarine network (as we have already mentioned) will be further upgraded by a total increase of 1,337 kilometers of cable and 10,710 kilometers of optical fiber, with 18 line systems at 565 Mbit/s. Tariffs There have been two tariff reductions in the past year (the first by 30 percent) and these have brought our tariffs into line with those in Europe. Looking ahead this will particularly favor the business user. The Moral Issue The new administration, with its clear and transparent rules, has marked a turning point with respect to the management of the ASST that was violently shaken by the Kickback cyclone. As General Manager Tommasi stressed, they have turned a leaf "by revolutionizing the regulations and procedures on bidding for tenders in a European context, and by establishing a new procurement office management, whose task will be to work in a transparent way and to avoid overlapping and waste with the other operators." A Model for the Future Business culture and competitiveness have been the two key words around which work has focused for only 15 months. These are two decisive words for the future of the sole operator, which Iritel certainly will not become a part of by entering through the back door, and will introduce concrete results and a group of managers who are able to meet the new challenges. In an Italy that is suffering from patronage and back-handers, it is important to discover that there are humane professionals in critical fields if we want to remain among the leading group of industrialized countries and avoid sliding into the second division.
