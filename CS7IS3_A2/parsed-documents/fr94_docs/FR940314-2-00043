FR940314-2-00043 FR940314-2-00020 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Office of the Secretary Advisory Board on the Investigative Capabilities of the Department of Defense; Change in Status of Meeting AGENCY: Advisory Board on the Investigative Capabilities of the Department of Defense, DOD. ACTION: Notice of Advisory Board Meeting; change in status of meeting. SUMMARY: On March 4, 1994, the Department of Defense published a notice announcing the meeting of the Advisory Board on the Investigative Capabilities of the Department of Defense (59 FR 10378). This notice is published to announce a change in the status of the meeting. All sessions on March 17, 1994 will be open. Portions of the meeting on March 18, 1994 will be closed. This determination is based upon the consideration that it is expected that the discussions will involve classified matters of national security. Such classified material is so intertwined with the unclassified material that it cannot reasonably be segregated into separate discussions without defeating the effectiveness and meaning of the closed portion of the meeting. To permit all of this Advisory Board meeting to be open to the public would prevent discussion of such matters and would greatly diminish the Board's findings or recommendations to the Secretary of Defense. DATES AND TIMES: March 17, 1994 from 8:30 a.m.&hyph;5:30 p.m. and March 18, 1994 from 9 a.m.&hyph;12:15 p.m. ADDRESSES: 1700 N. Moore Street, Suite 1425, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: E. Vaughn Dunnigan, Deputy Staff Director, Advisory Board on the Investigative Capabilities of the Department of Defense, 1700 N. Moore Street, suite 1420, Arlington, VA 22209; telephone (703) 696&hyph;6055. Dated: March 8, 1994. Patricia L. Toppings, Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.
