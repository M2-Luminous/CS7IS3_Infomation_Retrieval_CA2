Members of the diplomatic corps and international organizations who are with me; Messrs. Cabinet Members; residents of Nueva Guinea and of other municipalities who are here with me; Dear Nicaraguan people: Thank you, friends of Nueva Guinea, for inviting me to share this important national celebration with you. We are gathered here today, 25 February 1994, happy and optimistic, to celebrate another year of my electoral victory, the victory of the Nicaraguan people who sought democracy, peace, progress, and the reconciliation of all Nicaraguans. On 23 December 1989, during the electoral campaign, I visited Nueva Guinea and found that war, repression, and political persecution were assailing the region. I remember telling you that national sovereignty only exists where the people are sovereign, as reflected through free and honest elections. On that occasion, I also promised you that I would end the economic crisis and promote production in a country that was bankrupt both morally and economically. You are aware that it has been difficult to face the historic challenge of rebuilding our economy from the ground up and rescuing our sacred democratic and moral values. I want to tell you that I will not rest until I turn over to the next Nicaraguan who succeeds me in the Presidency a country better than the one I received, a country where there is clear socioeconomic growth. Today we speak with pride in Nicaragua, from north to south and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, because we are people who are working to consolidate democracy, peace, and progress. I want to commend our brothers on the Atlantic coast, who will hold elections for regional councilmen of the northern and southern Atlantic coastal regions on 27 February. Our Atlantic coast, full of ethnic and cultural values and natural resources, deserves to forge a promising future. All the coastal people who have the right to vote must now seize the opportunity to cast their votes and freely elect their representatives. This is a historic opportunity, because it is the first time elections will really be held in freedom and democracy on the Atlantic coast. From their public posts, the elected men and women must strive to manage rationally the autonomy of the Atlantic coast to benefit all coastal residents. I want to tell you that you will receive support from my administration, even with our current limitations. This year we are going to begin repairing the Muy Muy-Puerto Cabezas road and the Puerto Cabezas-Waspam road. We are also going to rebuild the San Benito-Rama road. We will carry out the dredging projects and the intercostal canal projects in Bluefields, as well as the dredging of the international marine route. We will repair the Puerto Cabezas and Corn Island docks, as well as the Rama passenger dock and the Bluefields coastal traffic dock. Nicaraguans; I have had to exercise patience, hold dialogues, and maintain maximum tolerance to carry out my national reconciliation policies. We gave armed groups opportunities to join our efforts to protect life and promote productive tasks in Nicaraguan society. The consequences of war, the destruction of the means of production, and the shortage of resources to deal with the demands of production and the creation of jobs caused some Nicaraguans to devote themselves to committing crimes and provoking uprisings. This must become a closed chapter in our fatherland's history. That type of behavior does not lead to anything good. Instead, it makes us poorer and impedes national and international investment, which is so very needed for our country's social and economic recovery. My government will continue working to strengthen democracy and to consolidate economic and social progress. In this second stage of my administration, of my presidential mandate, we are reorganizing the nation with programs that are largely socially oriented and that will offer opportunities for work and production. Never before in our history have the people, both directly and through intermediate organizations, been so [word indistinct] and participated as much in government decisions as they are doing now. The people's organization has been essential to my government program because it is the people, in constant communication with my government, who make this time of peace, reconciliation, and opportunities for all possible. We are drawing up new programs which we will call Peace and Development for Nueva Segovia, Madrid, Esteli, Guaco, Jinotega, Matagalpa, and the central Zelaya departments. That is why I am sending able officials, as well as material and financial resources, to the areas of the country that deserve special attention. I am sending not only our own resources but also those of friendly countries and nongovernmental and international organizations which have not forsaken us. We will continue supporting the state's reforms through the decentralization of health services, education, [word indistinct], tax collection, protection of natural resources, as well as the development of each one of our communities through the citizens' participation. This year, with our own resources and with help from friendly nations, we will develop more than 1,600 projects throughout the country from Guascala to San Juan del Norte and from Somotillo to Cardenas. With these project we will respond to the demands of citizens made through the municipalities. In 1994, the international year of the family, with UNICEF's support and in consultation with all the municipal governments, my administration's top priority will be to develop the Mayors' Friends and Defenders of Children program. The goal of this program is to reduce infant mortality, school dropouts, and malnutrition and to provide care for children in difficult circumstances. This Peace and Development program will focus on priorities of activating the productive capabilities in those regions to stimulate greater production and achieve better economic growth. We will support production and the producers who meet their commitments with the banks with more credits in all the regions of Guaco, Chontales and Nueva Guinea. The National Bank will reserve 70 percent more credits for the upcoming agricultural season. My government will continue to support cattle raising as well as the production of ginger, green beans, and other products that you have harvested with so much success here. That is why the National Bank has earmarked more than 200 billion cordobas for producers who meet their commitments in this region. Friends of Nueva Guinea, this territory was inhabited many years ago by men and women from different parts of our nation who with a great deal of effort formed an iron-clad union between man and the land. Thanks to their devotion, farmers and their plots have become the true symbols of Nueva Guinea. Nueva Guinea is a national example of determination, patriotism, organization, and progress. You have capably forged for yourselves a very secure future, and you have overcome obstacles to seeking rapprochement among yourselves by practicing reconciliation without giving in to partisan or ideological differences. During my electoral campaign I promised to achieve peace and eliminate obligatory military service so that tranquility would be restored in each and every home, and I have fulfilled my promise. [applause] Today we are living in peace. Our fellow Nicaraguans have resumed work on their land and are sources of joy and support for their homes. The demobilized resistance fighters and retired Army troops are the best example of reconciliation. The armed movements that existed in Nueva Guinea at the beginning of my term have been defeated thanks to the resolve of my government and the peace commissions in Nueva Guinea. This firm resolve has made my pledge and the hopes of the men and women of this lovely municipality come true. In Nueva Guinea my government has invested in economic rehabilitation projects for the people affected by the war, the basic grain program, potable water service, 230 homes, a new telephone system, anti-cholera treatment, the construction of 600 latrines, and 4,750 desks for a total during my term in office of approximately 11 million cordobas. In Muelle de los Bueyes we built a health center, rebuilt city hall, and built the small market for a total investment of 11,778 cordobas. In El Rama we built sidewalks, a dock at the port, and rebuilt the market for an investment of 70,000 cordobas. In El Almendro we built a bridge and a community center at a cost of 72,000 cordobas. Over the past three years your municipalities have progressed significantly. I made an effort to fulfill my pledges to you, my dear friends, and I have accomplished that. I am grateful to the international organizations represented in Nueva Guinea for the valuable support they have given this municipality. I am especially grateful for the cooperation provided by Spain; our friends from Worldwide Aid [Auxilio Mundial]; the Governments of Italy, The Netherlands, and Sweden; and all the organizations that have worked in these four municipalities. El Rama, Muelle de los Bueyes, El Almendro, and Nueva Guinea are sources of constant concern for me. I would like to do more for these municipalities and make their administration more effective and efficient so that the budget allotments assigned to them by my government will reach them on schedule. To this end I have decided to send a draft bill to the National Assembly whereby we can fulfill your request and your dream of creating a new department [applause] with these four municipalities, which will organize and execute programs for this rich area. I will await your suggestions to make a reality of this geopolitical division which, unquestionably, will help us strengthen the path toward progress in what will be Nicaragua's newest department. [applause] For this reason, ever since political polarization occurred at the National Assembly, I spared no effort in attaining a minimum consensus among the deputies of the various parties so we could fulfill another of the pledges made during our campaign, to amend the Constitution. During the installation of the National Assembly's 10th session on 10 January, I said I endorsed the idea of partially amending the Constitution, that I followed carefully the debates of these amendments, and that, with due respect for the government branches' autonomy, my government will effectively contribute to enrich the nature of these reforms. I expect the Constitution amendments to benefit Nicaragua. Consequently, the Nicaraguan people should take advantage of this historic opportunity to attain unity around a constitution that can help us face big challenges and national problems in this decade and the next. The Nicaraguan people must rebuild the country and attain steady economic development, which will make it possible for us to make significant progress in the creation of jobs and reduction of extreme poverty. Fellow Nicaraguans, we are facing big challenges which we will have to overcome realistically and patriotically, without populism or demagoguery. These problems include the war sequel, huge foreign debt, extremely low per capita income, high unemployment rate, conflicts and tasks related to property ownership, a marked deterioration of the infrastructure, ecology, and rapid population growth. Meeting these challenges requires a small yet strong and agile state, a state that can regulate, lead, and pave the way, a state that can offset, in favor of the poorest sector, the effects of any imbalances. We can only resolve these problems on a medium- term basis with the support of all social forces coalesced around shared national objectives. We need a reformed constitution which can make it possible for us to advance in an orderly fashion toward a solution for the country's social and economic problems. Such a constitution can also reinforce the democratic process. For this reason, I have followed the situation very closely and talked with the political forces that have been debating several positions and proposals to reform our Constitution. To stimulate a national consensus on these reforms, I will send to the National Assembly in March a government proposal on the Constitution's reforms. This will not preclude a continued effort to reach an agreement among all political forces of the country. We must attain this consensus to enforce the reforms and their beneficial effect on the state's institutions. Because the proposed reforms could harm the state's organization, I am convinced that the proposal must of necessity rely on the approval of all state branches and be widely discussed with the country's other sectors. The constitutional principle of harmonious coordination of the Nicaraguan state's branches should find their highest expression in this constitutional reform process. I am also making a great effort to fulfill another election promise. I promised that the Armed Forces would be of a professional nature and would not belong to any one political party. Despite the many difficulties that my government and the Army have experienced in the search for a consensus on the new military organization law over the past few years, I can say that disparagement, mistrust, and misunderstanding have been left behind. The determination and devotion which we have all invested in this difficult task has led to this law, which renders it possible to establish a professional, party-free, small, and friendly Army which will work in harmony with civilian power. It will be the Army of all Nicaraguans that the great heroes of our fatherland dreamed of. [applause] I hope that once we complete the necessary procedures for passage of the law this promise will promptly become a reality for the benefit of the entire Nicaraguan nation. The Nicaraguan people trust in God. We believe in peace, democracy, reconciliation, and progress. I believe in my people; I believe in you and I believe in Nicaragua. Therefore, I want you to know that Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who is a friend to all of you and president of all Nicaraguans, will continue working during the rest of her presidential term to improve the living conditions of all her people. As I also told you on 23 December 1989, instead of tiring we must have faith and enthusiasm to build a better Nicaragua, a peaceful Nicaragua, a land that will be very close to God, with a noble people who from day to day make an effort to establish the reign of social justice, peace, and progress in the land where they were born. Thank you to all of you, my dear friends. In a little while I will have a few more words for you. [applause] I would like to inform all of you, my dear friends of Nueva Guinea and people of all the municipalities and throughout Nicaraguan who perhaps have not heard or have not been informed, of the good news: Yesterday the Armed Forces and the 3-80 Front signed an agreement with members of my government that ends our differences. [applause] This agreement marks the end of the war and ensures that we will finally be able to achieve the peace for which we have all yearned. This is particularly important for all Nicaraguans on this day, 25 February. I congratulate all of the boys for their patriotic gesture, and I would like to ask all the people who are with me on this morning, my dear friends, and all the Nicaraguan people for a round of applause to acknowledge their patriotic decision to lay down their weapons, (?proving) once and for all that the peace we have so yearned for is possible in our blue and white [colors of the Nicaraguan flag] land. May God bless you all; may God bless all the Nicaraguan people. We will not falter; together we will continue working for the well-being of all Nicaraguans. Thank you, and may God bless you all, my dear friends. [applause]
