Confirming that a second air attack today destroyed at least a Serb tank and two armored personnel carriers, Christopher said the two U.S. FA-18 fighters that conducted the strikes were responding to U.N. commander Sir Rose's request. He again took pains to downplay differences with Russia over the attacks, he said the two countries share the goal of seeking an end to the hostilities. In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first. Christopher urged the Bosnian Serbs to end the attacks on the Bosnian town of Gorazde, a Muslim-dominated enclave, and return to the negotiating table. He said he had been in almost hourly contact with U.S. special envoy on Bosnia Charles Redman and Washington's ambassador to Bosnia. Christopher disputed suggestions that the attacks would lessen the possibility of a solution and said NATO and the U.S. still favor a comprehensive settlement to the war.
