A little over half a century after it was born as the Brahminical response to the challenges of colonial India, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has a `Sarsangchalak' from the non-Brahmin castes within the Varna-system. The 79-year-old faltering head of the RSS, Balasaheb Deoras (Dada to his close circle), has stepped down; in line with RSS heads nominating their successors, Deoras has hand-picked Prof. Rajendra Singh, as his heir. Brushing aside the close coterie of South India Brahmins who have risen fast within the gargantuan body that will carry on the mandate of `Hindutva', Deoras has broken with the past. Prof. Rajendra Singh, Rajju-Bhayya to the Sevaks, the first non-Brahmin to head the RSS, comes from the backward Kshatriya castes of the cowbelt. The battle with both the forces of Mandal and Kanshi Ram has now been truly joined. For the last 10 years, it was Rajju-Bhayya's mandate to expand the incredible social net of the RSS into backward areas like slums and Dalit bustis. This appointment is, therefore, a clear indication to Brahmins that the RSS is serious about its mission to broadbase its cadre. It is also a snub to the Pune-Nagpur Chitpavan-Deshasth-Kokanasth Brahmin elite of Maharashtra; they have been effectively sidelined by the old man himself. As the saying in the Konkan goes, the Mother Banana Plant kills herself to let her daughter grow. In a similar fashion, the RSS is now sidelining the Brahmins to accommodate the great big push from below. However, unlike the chaotic political electoral process the RSS is doing it systematically, opening up its powerlines to let the backward caste muscle rise to the top. Rajju-Bhayya, like Deoras, started as a common foot soldier in the formative years of the Sangh. Both remain bachelors and have worked together right from the beginning. Prof. Rajendra Singh has cut his teeth as the General-Secretary and has maintained close contacts with Marxists in Allahabad University where another illustrated RSS-ite worked in the faculty--Dr Murli Manohar Joshi. Hence, he is eminently suited to bridge the widening gap between the RSS and Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming future over the RSS' new Swadeshi policy. Prof. Rajendra Singh, against great odds, first pushed the RSS to a positive discrimination towards backwards and Dalits. It was said to be his idea to get the ground broken at Ayodhya for the Shilanyas by a Dalit. This has empowered numerous Dalit castes like the Valmikis, leather workers like Chamars and even agricultural tribals like the Dangs and Mangs to join the RSS in 1989. It was also during his tenure as General Secretary that the RSS started analysing the Mutiny and the national movement in material terms. The ORGANISER had a series of articles on a proto-Marxist analysis of the rising bourgeoise who were crushed by the British during the Mutiny in 1857 which is at variance with the Marxist analysis that it was a purely feudal revolt. Prof. Rajendra Singh will now have to coordinate the RSS' new focus on Ayodhya and face up [to] the Mulayam-Kanshi Ram Axis which will seek to pit the backward-Dalit castes against the upper castes. He knows full well that whereas the backwards have both the muscle and monetary power, the Dalits have the mass base. The alliance between the two is basically unstable: if the Mulayam-Kanshir Ram regime goes in for serious land reforms, it loses the backward-kulak social base of the Samajwadi Party and if it doesn't, it loses its landless Dalit constituency. Either way, the RSS stands to gain.
