Those representatives of the scientific and artistic elite who have enough courage to admit this, to repent in the error of their ways and to openly speak out against the regime whose establishment they at one time significantly facilitated, find the most fervent and grateful support among the people and are perceived by them on par with the leaders of the patriotic resistance. In recent times, we have also seen the well-known film producer, actor and writer, State Duma Deputy Stanislav Govorukhin, within these ranks. It is enough to recall his sharply critical televised speeches during last year's pre-electoral campaign (after one of which V. Shumayko even proposed excluding the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] from participation in the elections), his break with the Union of Cinematographers immediately after the October events, and now--his delineation from N. Travkin, who signed the treaty on accord. Among the actions which required civic courage we may cite also S. Govorukhin's last film, "The Great Criminal Revolution." The film is perceived as a condemnation of the current regime, as documental proof of what the "democratic transformations" have brought Russia to. Recently, at the invitation of the coordinating committee of the Kuban patriotic movement "Homeland" and the editors of the kray newspaper, KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI, Stanislav Govorukhin visited Krasnodar. We must note that our city and kray receive their share of attention by guests from the capital. In the last year, many prominent persons have visited here, beginning with the country's president and ending with Masha Rasputina. However, we cannot recall anything analogous to the meetings with Govorukhin. The large hall of the former House of Political Enlightenment was packed to overflowing. People were standing shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and sitting on the stage steps. Govorukhin showed clips from his film which in essence has been banned, and answered questions posed by the audience--questions which expressed all the confusion, all the tension and all the dissatisfaction of the present-day public consciousness and spirit. He began by making an admission which not everyone would dare make: "I am carrying around a great sin. On 12 June 1991, I went to vote for Yeltsin, and what's more--I also misled my wife and relatives into doing so. Standing before you is an utter fool, and it is even remarkable that so many people have come to see him!" No, the people did not come to see "an utter fool." Especially since this sin may be ascribed more than just to Govorukhin alone. Many people were confused at that time. The main thing that attracted the people was the opportunity to hear the truth. The truth today is the commodity of which there is the greatest shortage, and for which there is a huge demand. Govorukhin is well known as a person, a politician who, regardless of anything, speaks the truth. He brought with him a book with a title of the same name, which was a sort of literary recording of the film. Since the television management will not allow the film to be screened, the author decided to write a book, which was published by the "Andreyevskiy Flag" publishing house in Moscow in a circulation of 100,000 copies. Moreover, tens of regional newspapers (including KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI and KUBANSKIY KURYER) have reprinted it on their pages. We must note that the editors of local papers have also exhibited a certain courage in this. The first to publish the book as a separate supplement, back in November of last year, was the editor of a Samara newspaper. After that, he began to be persecuted--commissions, taxes, courts, and finally he ended his life with suicide... Thanks to the newspapers, millions of readers have now become acquainted with the materials gathered by Govorukhin on his trip through Russia--from the western borders to the Pacific Ocean. The materials are frightening. There is an unprecedented ongoing brazen pilferage of the country through commercial structures, through state organizations, and through opportunists from abroad. "I get the impression that there is a criminal revolution in progress," writes the author. "More accurately, it is being completed. The victory will be the final construction of a criminal-mafioso state... I call this revolution great, since it is not some Panama which has fallen into the grips of the criminals, but the sixth largest country on the planet." The film clips show the Russian-Chinese border. Everything you can think of is being driven from here to there--non-ferrous and precious metals, building Materials, KamAZes, all kinds of equipment... They are sending, as if it were scrap metal, torpedo engines, silver-zinc storage batteries from submarines, the submarines themselves, and military ships. The author of the film even found along the way... an army mobile headquarters, which was also moving for sale abroad. On the return trip, our trucks are bringing nothing, thin air. On our side of the border is poverty, on the other--a new Chinese city is being built and getting rich. There were pictures taken in Zabaykalsk, where everything--shoes, tape recorders, food products--was being pilfered off of railroad cars left on side tracks. Moreover, it is primarily children who are doing the stealing, looking so much like the homeless waifs from the times of the civil war. It is as if this is the image of Russia itself--forced into a dead end and given over for total pilferage. And these children, who do not go to school, with pockets full of money--are they its future? The reaction in the auditorium to these pictures: People grabbing their heads, sighing heavily, almost groaning. It was frightening... Stanislav Sergeyevich was asked: "Have you shown this film in the Duma?" His response: "I see no sense in showing the film to the deputies. The Duma, like society, is divided in two. One half knows all this as well as I do, and to show it to the other half is useless. I see my only task today in telling the truth to the common people, to fulfill, if you will, the legacy of Pushkin: 'To burn the hearts of people with the word...' From my travels throughout the country, I have understood: The people have stood up shoulder to shoulder in their opposition to the regime." From the book, "The Great Criminal Revolution" (chapter entitled "Choice of Russia"): "All of us have lost her (Russia--S. Sh.) in shouting and empty prattle. The blame lies with all of us. And with the author of these lines--especially." "It is enough to say that my film, 'We Cannot Live This Way,' helped Yeltsin to become chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. The following episode took place in the Spring of 1990. Two times the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia did not ratify Yeltsin as chairman of the Supreme Soviet. A third vote was to be held in the morning. The evening before the voting, we drove buses up to the building where the congress was being held (the buses were given to us by the Moscow Soviet, with which Yeltsin later dealt so easily!). We put all the congress deputies on the buses and took them to "Mosfilm." There, in the large Standards Hall, we showed them the still unedited version of our film, "We Cannot Live This Way." And what happened then! About 150 orthodox communists marched out of the hall in close ranks--as a sign of protest. The rest gave a standing ovation. I remember the voices from the auditorium: "Tomorrow those who voted against Yeltsin will come to their senses." In the morning the third vote was held. The congress (that very same congress which Yeltsin later fired upon from cannons) elected Yeltsin chairman of the Supreme Soviet by a majority of four votes. From chairman to president it was a short road. That means I too had a hand in the destruction of Russia." "As painful as it is to admit, my honest and sincere work (not devoid, of course of delusion) had a destructive effect. The viewers turned out to be unprepared for such a waterfall of truth which rained down upon their heads. They understood only one thing from the film--they would prosecute the communists." "...Aleksandr Zinovyev said it most accurately: `We were aiming at communism, but we hit Russia.' And that is what happened to me, too: I was aiming at communism, not even at communism, but at camp communism of the Leninist-Stalinist type, but I hit--Russia..." ...In order to understand things as Govorukhin understands them today, one does not necessarily have to be a commuist (he never was one). It is enough simply to be an honest, decent person. We might add that the heroes of Govorukhin's previous artistic films were far removed from politics, but all of them were distinguished by real nobleness, some even romantic. These were honest, strong and brave people. And a preference specifically for these types of heroes, and not the others, says something about an artist. I often think: If Vysotskiy were alive today, whom would he be with? Could it be those who are singing the praises of the new czar?... No, I do not believe that. He could not!... "If a friend suddenly turns out to be..." --you will recall from the "Vertical," his first permitted song? Govorukhin was friendly with Vysotskiy and, it seems, Vysotskiy would not have betrayed that friendship. Excerpt from the diary of S. Govorukhin: "Today I read about myself in the newspaper. By the way, I found myself in good company--Aleksandr Zinovyev, Tatyana Koryagina, Yuriy Vlasov... It turns out that all of us 'have fallen out of the coach at some turn in history.' The author of the article does not specify which turn this was. I will tell him. It was at that very turn when suddenly it became clear that swindlers had decided to make use of the fruits of our efforts in destroying the totalitarian system, the results of the efforts of all society. I can even name the date of that historic turn--21 August 1991. And we have no one to blame but ourselves. We ourselves placed the banner of democracy in the hands of the swindlers." The diary appeared in October of 1993, when work on the film and the book was already being completed. The events of 3-4 October burst into them in unforeseen chapters. They were written following hot on the heels of these events, but turned out to be surprisingly limited. In making a film on the large-scale criminalization of the country, Govorukhin became an eyewitness to the gravest crime of our day--the execution of parliament. In his book, he called it the "the apotheosis of the criminal revolution." Responding to the questions of meeting participants in Krasnodar regarding his evaluation of the October events, (no, they are not being and will not be forgotten--over half the questions were on this topic), S. Govorukhin said: "On 3-4 October, real fascism was wandering throughout the streets of Moscow. In the courtyards around the White House they were killing and torturing people. There was, for example, a deputy, a worker from Kazan. He was a sick man, with a pacemaker sewn under his heart. The OMON [Special Purpose Militia Detachment] troopers danced on him and broke eight ribs. At that same moment, his mother was viewing a broadcast of the shooting on television, and she had a severe attack of insulitis." (We might add, one of the most appalling chapters of the book and the film is the "Testimony of Oleg Germanovich Rumyantsev," who was subjected on that black Monday to ferocious beatings, insults and fear of death). "But the greatest shock for me," continues Govorukhin, "was to stand on the bridge on the morning of 4 October and to see how, at every shot from the tanks, the crowd which had gathered there applauded and shouted: 'That's the way, that's the way!' These were the young people who had chosen "Pepsi," and whom, evidently, we had already lost..." Listening to Govorukhin, I, like perhaps many others in the hall, thought about those of his colleagues in art who had taken an entirely different position during those days. It seems to me, disenchantment with politicians is not as painfully experienced by the people as disenchantement with their favorite artists, writers and producers. Politicians arrive on the scene, do their deeds, and leave. And others come to take their place--that is the way it is. Yet the artists became idols long before the present-day tragedies. They were always known and loved, and none of them can be replaced--a empty space remains. Many we simply do not know about, where they are, with whom. They are quiet, they have faded into the shadows. The people take betrayal by their idols more acutely to heart because it is specifically the "people's" idols, the ones who are most loved, those who created the standards of Heroes, Generals, and Honest People that are now the betrayers. At the meeting with Govorukhin, people asked: But why Ulyanov, and why Ryazanov... why? "This is a question not for me, but for them," he avoided giving a direct answer. "Just keep in mind that there are many, very many people in art who think differently. But it is another matter that they are not receiving such a tribune in the press and on television as those who support this power. Take Rasputin, Bondarchuk and Rozov, for example... When, immediately after the October events, I made a public announcement about my departure from the Union of Cinematographers, the first to call me with words of support were Tatyana Lioznova, Leonid Filatov, Sergey Shakurov, and Stanislav Lyubshin... And then I thought: How many honest and decent people there still are, who think like you and me, who love Russia and its people!" Later, talking with Stanislav Sergeyevich, I returned to this question, whose answer did not entirely suit me: Why? Why, nevertheless? We do not want to think about primitive greed, about cowardice, about a conscious absence of love for all that is dear. You begin thinking up excuses for writers and actors who were once your favorites: Maybe they are sincerely confused, maybe they are ashamed to admit that they once made a mistake? I cannot, for example, agree with the fact that such a prominent writer as Viktor Astafyev does not see, does not understand, what is really going in Russia. Perhaps he and many others have simply locked themselves into their cycle of opposition to the past, and it will still not let go of them and continues to dim their view? Govorukhin does not accept such mitigating explanations. He is merciless: "No, no, that is not it! Understand that our intelligentsia faithfully serves any power, especially when it is strong. They did not really serve Yeltsin before, but as soon as it became clear (in October) that he held the power... This is common cowardice." "And nothing more?" "No, of course not. They all do not serve for free. One is invited to lecture, another is given money for a film, a third one has his book sent to the West for publication... After all, look what is happening: When we had power of the workers and peasants, the heroes of our films were also workers and peasants. Recently, I conductedd a special analysis of up to 100 films. The heroes were all thieves, prostitutes, `outcasts,' etc. Because now what we have is power of the criminals, and our art already serves this power. Then others will come, and they will make films about them. Just stop and think: A satirist, who is destined to be out of sorts with the authorities, gets a medal!..." "That means there is a rebirth?" "I do not know. I only know that the Russian intelligentsia--under the czar, and under Stalin, and under Brezhnev--was in opposition to power. Perhaps in the kitchen opposition, but in the opposition nevertheless. And suddenly--the most petty, the most thieving power, and--not only are they not in opposition, but it is real love! Meanwhile, Russian culture is perishing and being substituted for Western culture. Movie theatres are closing. There are no libraries. Where is cinema? There is none. And there will not be, because one cannot create art based on lies and bribery. The only person who can create a great work in cinematography today is Nikita Mikhalkov. And literature? It is also absent. The most 'outstanding' book in recent times has been the 'Notes of the President.' The intelligentsia is in ecstasy! Although the name of the journalist who wrote it is known to all." With these words, I recalled the theme of the television program, "Novosti": Mark Zakharov, speaking at the presentation of the book, said: "I am astounded by the simplicity of this book!". "Yet at one time," continues Govorukhin, "they would not even shake Ye. Matveyev's hand because he played Brezhnev, or V. Tikhonov's, who read "Small Land" on television. No, Stanislav Sergeyevich does not feel sorry for his brothers in the artistic shop... Perhaps there are cowards and greedy men among them. But an important role, it seems to me, has been played by the following. At the beginning of perstroyka, Gorbachev, as we recall, flirted strongly with the intelligentsia. Prominent leaders in science and culture began to be included in the president's council, elected to the party leadership and the Supreme Soviet, and even appointed as ministers. Far from the most outstanding of Soviet scientists--G. Popov and A. Sobchak--suddenly became mayors of two Russian capitals. Among the intelligentsia, which had not been spoiled with high state positions, this gave rise to certain illusions, including the one that the power was now in their hands. If before the opinion of the intelligentsia in state affairs was not overly sought after, under Gorbachev this opinion began to be given overly great attention. For example, an article by A. Nuykin or N. Shmelev was enough to undertake another review of the country's economic policy. Gorbachev was very prone to the influence of the radical intelligentsia, and cared most about his image specifically with that part of society which, in turn, was becoming ever more self-assured and demanding, pushing first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin toward ever more radical actions. First to the repeal of certain articles of the constitution, then to agree to the separation of Lithuania, then to the break-up of the Union, then to the disbanding of parliament... And that is how we got to October of '93. From the diary of S. Govorukhin: "Who called us to `decisive actions'? It was not only the `reds' who called us to arms. The artistic intelligentsia also called for bloody reprisals. Only because of its inborn cowardice did it call for volunteers not from its own ranks--it called for the army and the militia to accomplish these feats." "...One after another on the screen we see popular artists and artistic leaders. They have come out of the trenches. Risking their lives, they have come to Shabolovka. The artistic leaders, interrupting each other, swore their allegiance to power. Almost every other speaker demanded harsh punishment for the apostates. `Shoot them, guillotine them... Put them on display at the zoo!' Yet all the while I recalled Solzhenitzin's `Calf.' Everything--not quite like that, but everything was very similar." "...Yet the communists were a bit softer. And a bit more honest. Those three days in August I spent in the White House, defending `democracy.' No one turned off our telephone or our lights. We lived quite comfortably. I remember the last night with Rastropovich. The champagne flowed like a river. No one attacked us or surrounded us. On the contrary, we bristled up with the barrels of tank cannons." Upon meeting any artist or well-known leader, people thirst to hear from him not only words of truth, to quench themselves with unknown information which had been concealed from them, to get a confirmation of their own thoughts and judgements. They also want to hear an intelligible answer to the question: What to do? What is the way out of the situation? This is the expression of eternal hope of the people toward their leaders, the eternal hope of the province toward their mother-capital. And so it was this time. The people questioned Govorukhin: What next? And he answered honestly: I do not know. He had a positive appraisal of Rutskoy: "He is not a friend to me, but I like him for his directness. He is an interesting person, multi-faceted, talented in different areas." Although Govorukhin does not believe in his chances to become president. About Zhirinovskiy he expressed alarm: "There are two of him. One speaks, and the other acts. In words he is a fierce enemy of the regime, but in his actions--he is a man of the president... He is precise, calculating and smart... He has mastered the art of 'dirty politics.' He will bring many more misfortunes. I would not say that he has no chance to become president. So consider the history of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], just in case." About Travkin he noted that he had signed the treaty on accord in spite of the opinion of the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] faction in the State Duma. Govorukhin himself is not a member of the DPR, and only went in a block with this party to the elections. After 28 April he made the announcement in the newspaper PRAVDA that he will not make any agreement with this power (he calls them the "thimble men"). About Solzhenitsyn, whom he respects as being the greatest Russian writer of those living today, he said that the recent events in Russia seem to have separated them. "I wrote to him honestly in a letter about what happened here. After that our relations were disrupted. In May he is coming to Russia. We will see what he says." And finally, not without some interest--about Gorbachev: "I met him a few times. He has gotten much smarter. As I was speaking to him, I was thinking: What a smart man, he is the one who should be president! But he was, alas, he was! And he could have made the people happy, but instead he made them unhappy." "Well, who then, who finally will make Russia and the people happy? And whom do you yourself support? For whom are you?", the Krasnodar residents asked. "For the present, I do not see any great state leader such as Peter I, which Russia needs so desperately today. Power today is very strong. And in order to oppose it, the opposition must unite. That is why I went to the `Agreement in the Name of Russia' movement. But as yet the opposition cannot present a single leader. He does not exist. Although I do not believe that such a great spiritual country as ours will not give birth to such an individual, perhaps he is somewhere on the way." Some of the most active patriots, who were literally rushing into battle, left the meeting a bit disillusioned: He had stirred up their souls, but he never did tell them what to do. He did not instill any optimism. I too was at first disappointed by this pessimism of his. Even his book ends on this same note: "These days, an optimist can only be either a fool or a scoundrel." But then I thought that this is not pessimism, but realism. That ultimately he is an artist. His business is to see and tell people the truth. "To burn with the word..." To stir up, to awaken. And only the people themselves can change their life for the better, when they stop enduring and keeping silent. When they finally understand that we cannot live this way.
