We will be able to work on this together: these are not simple problems, but from the moment that we approach them openly together, I believe that we will be able to solve them in the best possible manner. [Johnson] Has a date been set to open Orly Airport to British companies? [Bosson] Before 30 June. [Johnson] Have the British committed themselves to giving up their attempt to force a landing at Orly this evening or tomorrow? [Bosson] Absolutely. There remains the problem that British airlines are much more independent of the government than are French airline companies, but the British minister is doing everything that has to be done in this direction, and the problem is completely solved. No plane will land either this evening or tomorrow, and as soon as Monday [16 May], we will be working together to examine our reciprocal difficulties. Concerning Orly, they are clear, and they will be solved quickly, and concerning the London airports and Heathrow, the difficulties are known, and they are finally being taken into account. I am therefore very satisfied at the understanding shown by my British counterpart, and by the work we have done, which reflects the our good relations, in that it has been open, and has taken due account of our reciprocal concerns. [Johnson] Would you describe the agreement as a victory for France, for Britain, for Europe? [Bosson] It is a victory for the Franco-British friendship, which has enabled us to solve this problem together, with reciprocal understanding. It is a perfectly balanced accord.
