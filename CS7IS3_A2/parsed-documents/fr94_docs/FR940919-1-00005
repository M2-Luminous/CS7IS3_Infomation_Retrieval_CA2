FR940919-1-00005 FR940919-1-00002 The replacement compliance time is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). Operators in commuter service can put up to 200 hours TIS in one calendar month while a general aviation operator may not utilize the airplane 200 hours TIS in one calendar year. The calendar time compliance will allow commuter operators the option of accomplishing the actions to coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance. The FAA estimates that 1,641 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 22 workhours (15 workhours for replacement and 7 workhours for installation) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $3,144 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,144,914. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed valve installation. Cessna has informed the FAA that enough improved fuel valves have been sold to equip approximately 1,040 of the affected airplanes. Assuming that these valves are installed on Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes, the proposed cost impact upon U.S. operators would be reduced from $7,144,914 to $2,616,754. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [AMENDED] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8508 (58 FR 13406, March 11, 1993), and by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: The Cessna Aircraft Company: Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD; Supersedes AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8508. Applicability: The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category: ␣ 1Model 1Serial Nos. T303 T30300001 through T30300315. 402C 402C0001 through 402C1020. 404 404&hyph;0001 through 404&hyph;0859. 414A 414A0001 through 414A1212. 421C 421C0001 through 421C1807. Compliance: Required as indicated in the body of this AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes equipped with fuel inlet float valve part numbers (P/N) 9910242&hyph;1, 9910242&hyph;4, 9910242&hyph;5, 9910242&hyph;6, 9910242&hyph;7, 9910242&hyph;8, 9910242&hyph;205, 9910242&hyph;206, 9910242&hyph;207, and 9910242&hyph;208, accomplish the following: (1) Within the next 200 hours time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished (compliance with AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03), perform the appropriate valve test in accordance with paragraph 2. Functional Test Procedure or paragraph 3. Installation Test Procedure in the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna Service Bulletin (SB) MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993. Accomplish these tests thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS until the fuel inlet float valves are replaced with a P/N 9910242&hyph;11 or P/N 9910242&hyph;12 valve, and then accomplish the appropriate valve test at intervals not to exceed 600 hours TIS. (2) Within 12 calendar months after accumulating 1,800 hours TIS on a fuel inlet float valve or within the next 12 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, replace the valve with a P/N 9910242&hyph;11 or P/N 9910242&hyph;12 fuel inlet float valve in accordance with paragraph 4. Valve Replacement in the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna SB MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993. Thereafter, accomplish either the functional or installation test required by paragraph (a)(1) of this AD at intervals not to exceed 600 hours. Note 1: If the number of hours TIS accumulated on a fuel inlet float valve is unknown, airplane hours TIS may be used. (b) For airplanes equipped with fuel inlet float valve P/N 9910242&hyph;9 or P/N 9910242&hyph;10, accomplish the following: (1) Within the next 200 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished (compliance with AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03), perform the appropriate valve test in accordance with paragraph 2. Functional Test Procedure or paragraph 3. Installation Test Procedure in the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna SB MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993. Accomplish the appropriate valve test thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 hours TIS until the fuel inlet float valves are modified as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this AD, and then accomplish the appropriate valve test at intervals not to exceed 600 hours TIS.
