It also means a change in the Israeli language in general -- a change that is not encountering a Syrian rejection, but, rather, reservations about applying the return [al-i'adah] principle to all the land, not just part of it. High-level Syrian sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli proposals conveyed to Damascus "did not respond to the basic principle in the peace process, that is, the complete withdrawal from the Golan." The proposals contained Israel's willingness to withdraw from three Syrian villages -- namely Majdal Shams, Buq'ata, and Sa'dah -- under a three-phase withdrawal plan over eight years, with "minor changes to the border" between the two sides, in order to "guarantee Israeli security." This is in addition to addressing the question of "joint management" of water in the Golan, which concentrates in the southern part of the Golan, feeding Lake Tiberias, the source of the River Jordan. Water in that area is estimated at 320 cubic meters. The sources told AL-HAYAH that the Israeli proposals include the proposal for Syria to begin to take confidence-building measures during the first withdrawal phase under the "Majdal Shams First" plan, on the basis of which the depth of the withdrawal and arrangements for the remaining two phases -- which include "dismantling settlements in the Golan," especially northern settlements, which already have no settlers in them -- would be determined. The sources did not rule out that the Israelis may have asked to open a tourist office in Damascus in the first phase to transport tourists between the two sides. All this -- so the Israelis believe -- would "test Syrian intentions." But the Syrian sources stress that the ones whose intentions should be tested are those occupying others' land, "not the owners of the rights and land. They (the Israelis) are requested to prove their good intentions by complying with the complete withdrawal from the occupied Golan, that is, within the framework of a comprehensive solution." The sources add that Syria's view of a comprehensive solution does not mean that all tracks advance "at the same speed. One track may advance more than another in terms of time, but the solution must be comprehensive in the end." The sources point out that Christopher did not take to Syria an Israeli "plan or note," but Israeli ideas about "the Israeli view of peace on the Syrian track." And the Syrian side submitted "queries and questions" about these proposals, in addition to "precise ideas about Syria's view of the peaceful solution." The sources say that the Syrian questions focus on two basic points: withdrawal and the timetable, saying that the Israelis must agree to withdraw completely from the Golan in the framework of a comprehensive settlement, provided the withdrawal is completed in "a short period," not eight years as announced in Tel Aviv. It should be conducted in accordance with the "logistic requirements" for this withdrawal, that is in addition to the complete dismantling of the settlements. The sources point out that the Syrian demand regarding the priority of withdrawal centers on the peace process' essence, namely the "land for peace" principle and implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338 stipulating "withdrawal" from the occupied territory. "Besides, the U.S. initiative did not say part of the land in return for peace." The sources add that when the Israelis utter the "magic word" (full withdrawal), the door would be opened to both sides to discuss "the security arrangements." The sources stress that these arrangements must be equal on both sides of the border, including the establishment of a demilitarized zone and another thinly armed [mukhaffafat al-taslih] zone, in addition to electronic early warning systems, not just on the Syrian side of the border as the Israelis are trying to dictate. The sources point out that the Israeli side is trying to "drown the negotiations in a discussion of detailed questions like normalization, opening of the border, trade relations, and security arrangements, without even beginning to agree to full withdrawal" -- which is unacceptable to Syria. This is in the knowledge that Syria has emphasized its willingness to address these matters, "but after complete withdrawal." As for the "Majdal Shams First" plan, the sources say that Syria "is not (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat, and Majdal Shams is not Gaza and Jericho." Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' described this plan as "absurd," as Syria rejects any phased solution.
