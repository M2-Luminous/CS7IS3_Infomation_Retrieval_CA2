Correspondent Saulius [name indistinct] reports: [Correspondent] The Lithuanian president stopped in Oslo yesterday evening on his way to the Lillehammer Olympic Games. In the Norwegian capital, Algirdas Brazauskas met Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, and members of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee. In his conversation with the Norwegian prime minister, Brazauskas expressed gratitude to the Nordic states for their constant concern and support for Lithuania and for ever closer contacts linking the Nordic Council and the Baltic states. It was noted that it is useful for Lithuania--which wishes to sign a free trade treaty with the European Union, is preparing to join the European Union, and is negotiating with the European Community--to get acquainted with Norway's experience. Lithuania has expressed its wish to become a NATO member and has signed the Partnership for Peace document. Norway, which has already joined that organization, could help Lithuania to become full member. Satisfaction was expressed at the developing cooperation in economics, science, and culture. During the meeting with the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee members, relations between the Seimas and the Storting were discussed. A great deal of attention was devoted to Lithuania's relations with Russia and their prospects. The Norwegians were interested in our relations with our closest neighbors, Belarus and Ukraine. It was noted that the relations of great states and their diktat to the smaller states are not correct and [passage indistinct]. A similar discussion took place at the Norwegian Foreign Ministry with Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, who was interested in the results of the negotiations with Ukraine and how relations with Belarus will develop. Brazauskas arrived in Lillehammer late at night. The Lithuanian president will meet Norwegian King Harald V today and will attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
