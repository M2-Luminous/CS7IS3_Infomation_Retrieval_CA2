The NATO summit sighs with relief at the message that the Atlantic Alliance is still vital to the security of the US. The Czechs and their neighbours are invited to come right in and join the new Partnership for Peace. The comforting word for the Russians (those of them who want to hear) is that they are wanted inside, not outside, Europe: there will be no new lines on the map to exclude them. None of this is startling news, but it is just what European leaders, rattled by Washington's intermittent attention, need to be told. Never mind the passionless monotone in which Mr Clinton delivered his new European manifesto under the tapestries in Brussels's City Hall. At least he actually said it. Behind the flourishes of verbal intent the reality is rather harder to detect, though that is nothing new in the diplomatic business where symbolism weighs more than substance. The truth is that, in Europe's uncertain state of transition, the organisation can hardly pretend to offer any greater certainty. The US forces in Europe can no longer have the clear role assigned to them by its previous division. Mr Clinton, unlike his predecessors, is only too happy to endorse military co-operation, such as the proposed NATO joint task forces, between the European allies. It is a sign of changed times that Chancellor Kohl should express his gratitude for an attitude which really highlights the US's growing strategic detachment from Europe. Strengthening the European pillar of the alliance through the Western European Union, as promised in yesterday's communique, is now less rhetoric than the best way forward to a new autonomous identity. The suggestion of an expanded NATO peacekeeping role under the UN is positive too, although it will have to play a more convincing role than it has so far in Bosnia. The last-minute threat of air strikes to reopen Tuzla and ensure the rotation of troops to Srebrenica bears all the mark of diplomatic improvisation--and Britain's conversion to an idea it has steadfastly opposed is distinctly odd. The show moves to Moscow where Mr Clinton's difficulties are considerably greater than they were in Brussels. His encounter with Mr Yeltsin can hardly be termed a "summit"--and not just because of the loss or erosion of superpower status. Such meetings are no longer a vantage point from which to survey the world, but just another mundane encounter. The only tangible achievement to tie up is the agreement on removing Ukraine's nuclear weapons, yet that is still subject to the parliament in Kiev. No longer adversaries, neither leader would however be wise to embrace the other too warmly. The US cannot remake Russia in its own image as West Germany has done -- at a high price -- with the East. A reasonable understanding between the two countries will no doubt help reassure the rest of Europe; but it is best secured on the basis of modest expectations.
