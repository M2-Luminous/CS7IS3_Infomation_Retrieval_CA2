A record was set by Privolzhskiy district No. 27: A total of 11 candidates plan to run for parliament there. A curious situation came about in Moskovskiy district No. 24, where the coveted seat will be contested by columnist Fedor Burlatskiy (it is yet unknown what relation to Tatarstan he has -- SEGODNYA) and Yuriy Voronin, former deputy Russian Federation Supreme Soviet chairman, who had earlier been chairman of the Tatarstan State Planning Committee and had been nominated there for the Russian parliament. Aside from these, there are another five candidates registered in the district. At least five candidates have been registered in three other State Duma districts also. Virtually all lists feature Tatarstan Communist Party nominees and candidates from "Equality and Rule-and- Law," Tatarstan's democratic bloc. Political observers have noted that there are few Tatar names in the lists of candidates who have already submitted documents. As in all of Russia in the latest elections, journalists and charismatic local leaders account for a significant share of the candidates. As for the Federation Council, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev and Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid Mukhametshin will apparently honor its meetings with their presence in the not so distant future. At least they have already submitted the requisite number of signatures. People in Kazan think that they both have virtually 100 percent chances of success, because their sole opponent is Aleksandr Lozovoy, a deputy chairman of the local parliament. It has been pointed out, however, that he may "draw" a certain share of votes of the Russian-speaking population thanks to his Slavic name. On 18 February all electoral commissions are required to compete the authentication of electoral lists and other documents, after which registered candidates will be given appropriate certificates. The new round of the Federal Assembly elections, which were deemed to have been invalid in December, is scheduled for 13 March.
