On the Islamic calendar, Ramadan -- the month of fasting -- ran from February 12 to March 14 this year. The traditional Bairam Festival, the ending of the fast, is celebrated every year by ten of China's Islamic minority nationalities -- the Hui, Uygur, Kazak, Uzbek, Kirgiz, Tajik, Tatar, Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar. The Chinese Government provides that all Muslims can have a day off today. In Beijing, more than 10,000 Muslims went to 65 mosques in the city to pray and celebrate the festival. About 210,000 Muslims are living in Beijing. This morning, some 1,600 Muslims gathered at the Niujie Mosque, the biggest one in Beijing, for prayers. Reciters from Iran recited with consent of the mosque's imam. More than 300 representatives of minority nationalities attended a party this afternoon sponsored by the Beijing Fellowship of Ethnic Nationalities, together with some 50 deputies attending the on-going National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing. Also at the party were leaders from the National People's Congress, the State Nationalities Affairs Committee, the Islamic Association of China, and Beijing Municipal Government. Muslims in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is called China's "Islamic Region," under the arrangement of local governments, also hold various events today to celebrate the festival. There are some 1.6 million Muslims in the region.
