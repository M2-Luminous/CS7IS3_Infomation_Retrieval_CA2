S. Koltunov, K. M. Frolov, and M. Yu. Sinev; UDC 546.799.3] [Abstract] Quantitative data on the rates of oxidation-reduction reactions of U, Np, and Pu in organic solutions of tributyl phosphate (TBF) are needed for mathematic modeling of redox processes in the extraction technology of spent nuclear fuel, as well as having independent scientific interest. Tetravalent uranium as a reducing agent for Pu and Np ions is used widely and has many advantages, one being the possibility of conducting the reaction in both aqueous and organic phases, but at the same time the capability of U(VI) of being extracted with TBF is a main cause of the non-productive consumption of U(IV) owing to its oxidation with nitric acid in the TBF phase. Various attempts have been made to study the kinetics of U(IV) oxidation with nitric acid in TBF, and it has been established that this reaction is autocatalytic. After an induction period the reaction becomes first order and its rate is little affected by the concentration of nitric acid in TBF. In the present work a differential equation was developed for this reaction. Activation energy for the first stage was determined to be 65.3 kJ/mole. The reaction mechanism includes parallel flowing slow stages of interaction of UOH[.sup]+3[/] ions with HNO[.sub]2[/] molecules and U[.sup]+4[/] ions with nitronium perchlorate.
