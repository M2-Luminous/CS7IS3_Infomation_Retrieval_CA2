FR940124-1-00091 FR940124-1-00009 Section 667.14␣Allowable Costs and Activities As required by sections 494A(c) and 494B of the HEA, a State is not required to expend any funds under the SPRP to carry out allowable activities unless the Secretary reimburses the State for the costs it incurs in carrying out those activities. To the extent appropriations are available the Secretary proposes to reimburse a State for the direct and indirect costs of carrying out allowable SPRE activities if those activities are included in a plan that is approved by the Secretary. The terms ``direct costs'' and ``indirect costs'' are defined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;87. In addition, the Secretary proposes to rely on the cost principles described in OMB Circular A&hyph;87 for determining allowable costs under the State Postsecondary Review Program. The Secretary proposes to consider as allowable activities those activities that are directly related to_ (1) Establishing State review standards in consultation with institutions in the State; (2) Publicizing and providing initial and continuing training to State and other personnel in the State, including personnel at the institution subject to review; (3) Establishing and implementing procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty, and others regarding institutions in the State; (4) Reviewing referred institutions; and (5) Developing and maintaining an information system for SPRE review activities. In §667.14(d), the Secretary identifies a nonexhaustive list of direct costs associated with carrying out the proposed allowable activities. Section 667.15␣Fiscal Procedures and Records In §667.15, the Secretary proposes requirements regarding a State's use and accounting of the Federal funds it receives under this part. To minimize burden on States, the Secretary proposes that a State account for funds it receives under this part in accordance with the procedures it uses to account for its own funds. In addition, the Secretary proposes that a State keep fiscal and accounting records that support, on audit, its expenditure of funds under this part and maintain those records for five years. Finally, the Secretary proposes that a State must have an audit performed of the SPRE's activities under this part at least once every two years. An audit conducted under the Single Agency Audit Act satisfies this audit requirement. Section 667.16␣Supplement, Not Supplant, Requirement Section 494(B) of the HEA provides that the Secretary may reimburse a State for the costs of necessary SPRE activities ``which supplement, but do not supplant, existing licensing or review functions conducted by the State.'' This statutory provision is repeated in §667.16. The Secretary requests comments on what standards and measures would most accurately determine whether a State has satisfied the supplement but not supplant requirement. Subpart C_State Review Standards, SPRE Reviews, and Termination of Institutional Participation Section 667.21␣State Review Standards Section 494C(d) of the HEA requires a State to develop review standards, in consultation with the institutions in the State, that are consistent with the laws and constitution of the State. A State's authority to develop review standards is further clarified in section 494C(g) of the HEA. That section prohibits the Secretary from requiring a State to establish review standards that are unrelated to ensuring institutional or program integrity or that violate the provisions of the State's constitution or laws. The SPRE reviews referred institutions under the State-developed standards set forth in section 494C(d) of the HEA. In conducting its review, the SPRE must determine whether a referred institution has complied with standards that address the following areas_ (1) The availability to students and prospective students of catalogs, admissions requirements, course outlines, schedules of tuition and fees, policies regarding course cancellations, and the rules and regulations of the institution relating to students and the accuracy of such catalogs and course outlines in reflecting the courses and programs offered by the institution; (2) Assurance that the institution has a method to assess a student's ability to successfully complete the course of study for which he or she has applied; (3) Assurance that the institution maintains and enforces standards relating to academic progress and maintains adequate student and other records; (4) Compliance by the institution with relevant safety and health standards, such as fire, building, and sanitation codes; (5) The financial and administrative capacity of the institution as appropriate to a specified scale of operations and the maintenance of adequate financial and other information necessary to determine the financial and administrative capacity of the institution; (6) For institutions financially at risk, the adequacy of provisions to provide for the instruction of students and to provide for the retention and accessibility of academic and financial aid records of students in the event the institution closes; (7) If the stated objectives of the courses or programs of the institution are to prepare students for employment, the relationship of the tuition and fees to the remuneration that can be reasonably expected by students who complete the course or program and the relationship of the courses or programs (including the appropriateness of the length of such courses) to providing the student with quality training and useful employment in recognized occupations in the State; (8) Availability to students of relevant information by institutions of higher education, including_
