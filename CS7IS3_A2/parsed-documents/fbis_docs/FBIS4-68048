FBIS4-68048 "jptot019__l94013" JPRS-TOT-94-019-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 5 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Army Patrols Lima, Callao To Prevent Shining Path Actions Army Patrols Lima, Callao To Prevent Shining Path Actions PY0605011694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1541 GMT 5 May 94 PY0605011694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army and Police will today start patrolling Lima and the port of Callao to prevent possible terrorist attacks, as the 14th anniversary of the day the Shining Path began its activities, on 17 May 1980, approaches. There were four attacks with explosives last night against the offices of the state company Electrolima [Lima Electric Power Enterprise] and three other attacks against the Credit Bank in Lima, which caused only material damage. According to a military communique, a similar attack took place on 3 May in the Military Village of Chorrillos District in Lima, with no casualties resulting. On 17 May 1980, one day before the general elections in which Fernando Belaunde Terry was elected president for the second time, a Shining Path group entered the small town of Chuschi, Ayacucho Department, and destroyed electoral material. This was the first action of the terrorist organization. According to sources from the Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) cited today by LA REPUBLICA, there is fear that the Shining Path may unleash a campaign of violence in Lima on orders from its current chief, Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano." There is also the fear that the Shining Path will increase its activities in memory of the events of 6, 7, 8, and 9 May 1992, when the security forces occupied the Canto Grande penitentiary in Lima after the terrorists took over the prison. Meanwhile, hundreds of kilometers north of Lima in the jungle region of Huanuco Department, where a military operation against three Shining Path columns is being carried out, a captured terrorist, Ely Puertas, alias "Juan," revealed to EXPRESO the painful conditions of his colleagues. Puertas says that the "Mar Rojo Batallion" he belonged to has 300 men, many of them civilians who were recruited under the threat of death. He added that the Shining Path members are hungry and thirsty, as they have only tubers and fruit to eat, and that they want to take refuge under the repentance law, but the chiefs prevent them from doing so. The Peruvian Government today extended the state of emergency for 60 days in four provinces of the southern Andean Apurimac Department "to facilitate the operations against terrorism." There are no civil liberties in the emergency zones, which are under military control.
