The goals that the U.S. Administration has set for itself are slowly emerging. Above all, the longer a war lasts, the more it attracts more foreign forces -- Russians and possibly a growing number of Islamic radicals from Asia and Africa -- but this should dry out quickly. The order after the war should ensure that the major part of the eastern Adriatic coast remains in reliable hands, and that Russian influence remain as small as possible in the western Balkans. The United States wants to be able to rely on the states in the region that share the same vital interests. The United States is confronted with other powers in the region -- above all, the Serbs who have captured territory in Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia is the state with the greatest concentration of weapons in Europe west of Russia. Still, this is not a factor that might disturb U.S. circles in the long run. However, because the United States and its Western allies are determined not to use military force against the Serbs, Serbia is the one power in southeastern Europe that the United States is treating very cautiously and with great consideration. A soft Western -- and U.S. -- attitude, even encouragement, has made President Milosevic important in Belgrade. Serbia is being endorsed by Russia, which found a supporter in Belgrade after its return to world politics. An old affinity strengthens relations, which is in line with the political pan-Slavism that is again spreading in Moscow. Russia has been striving for predominance in the Balkans since the last century. First, the Turkish, then the Hapsburg empires were in its way, then it removed itself with the introduction of Bolshevism. After his World War II victory, only Tito, who wanted to be a Stalin himself, prevented the Moscow empire from taking possession of the whole Balkans. For the first time after the changes in Europe in 1990, there is a renewed opportunity for Russia to gain a political foothold in southeastern Europe. The Russian objective is diametrically opposed to that of the United States: Moscow wants to establish a sphere of influence that extends as far as possible from Serbia to the west and north, as far as the Adriatic Sea, and toward Central Europe. In the former Yugoslavia, West European powers have relinquished the field to the two major world powers. If their influence increases again, Great Britain and France in particular will not only pursue common Western but also their own interests -- which might collide with U.S. interests. This, and not only the Russians, may be one reason for Washington's hurry. The United States would prefer a Bosnian state within its old boundaries. Yet Washington knows of Belgrade's plans for a greater Serbia, which are being encouraged by Russia. There are also doubts that the Serbs in Bosnia will form a common state together with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. Some things -- including Washington's lack of interest in the Serbian offensives in eastern and northern Bosnia -- suggest that the United States has accepted Bosnia's partition. Then the United States would be left only with the task of ensuring a sufficiently large and coherent territory for the Muslim-Croatian canton state proclaimed, under its leadership, after negotiations with the Serbs and Russia. The United States would certainly welcome a return of the Croatian territories occupied by the Serbs. Yet what efforts will it attempt to ensure that Serbia gives up the most valuable result, strategically and economically, of its war of conquest? The "normalization" being negotiated between the Zagreb government and the Serbian leaders in the occupied territories might finally consist of Croatia being granted sovereignty over these territories that exists only on paper, and in Croatia having to content itself with the reopening of the traffic routes. Then the Serbian war of aggression would have been worthwhile in Croatia -- just as in Bosnia. The United States would then be the protector of a reduced Bosnia and an amputated Croatia. However, it also appears to view Macedonia and Albania as countries belonging to its sphere of influence. Yet there are obstacles and uncertainties. The Greek ethnic lobby group in the United States prevents the administration from efficiently supporting Macedonia against the Greek blockade. Albania is anxiously looking at neighboring Kosovo. If Serbian authorities increase the mistreatment of the Albanian population there, there might be a mass exodus to Albania one day. How would the protector, the United States, react? As early as today, Washington may be considering a partition of Kosovo, with the "ethnically cleansed" portion remaining part of Serbia. The other half with the double Albanian population would fall to Albania. Yet such a cut would leave behind deep wounds. The United States would have to guard another trouble spot.
