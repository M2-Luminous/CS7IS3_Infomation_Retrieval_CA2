He will be accompanied by a group of businessmen from the private sector. [passage omitted] There is a political element to this visit. It concerns Thai-Cambodian relations as they relate to the Khmer Rouge issue. There are trade and political issues that the prime ministers of both countries will have to thrash out and settle on good terms, in the spirit of compromise, and based on the principle of mutual interests. If each party merely tries to preserve its interests to the fullest, without thinking about good relations, problems between the two countries could blow up into a major conflict. Naturally, the Thai Government will try to protect the interests of businessmen investing in Cambodia, while the Cambodian Government has a duty to protect the interests of its people against exploitation by foreigners investing in Cambodia. This is why there will be a review of old contracts signed by the Cambodian Government. [passage omitted] The Thai Government must make clear its sincere intention to help Cambodia in national development, especially economic and agricultural development. Thailand has enough potential to help Cambodia. We have people with expertise in agriculture, fishing, banking, investment, and industry. The Thai Government must make clear its sincerity in helping the Cambodian people develop their country. It must seek the Thai private sector's cooperation in not exploiting or taking advantage of the Cambodian people, as was the case with the chit fund that cheated the Cambodian people. Anyway, a big problem between Thailand and Cambodia is the political issue of the Khmer Rouge. Although it is an internal Cambodian affair, the problem affects Thailand. On this issue, the prime minister should confirm to the Cambodian Government that Thailand no longer supports or recognizes the Khmer Rouge, because Cambodia now has an elected government that is recognized internationally. The situation has changed completely; the previous status of the four Cambodian factions has expired. Ever since the elections and the registration of political parties in Cambodia, the Thai Government has only recognized those parties that are registered under the Cambodian electoral system. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is an illegal group.
