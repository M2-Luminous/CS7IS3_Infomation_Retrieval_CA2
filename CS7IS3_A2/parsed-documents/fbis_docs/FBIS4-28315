One of the questions arising from this is to make further and better achievements in the electrification of railway lines. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "It is necessary to complete electrifying the still-unelectrified sections of railway lines and to quickly introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines by producing many eight-axle electric locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars." To make further and better gains in the achievement of electrification of the railway lines is one of the important tasks for solidifying the material and technological foundation of the railway lines. An important factor indicating the material and technological foundation of the railway lines is railway transport capacity. Railway transport capacity largely depends on the kind of power used. Electricity and internal combustion are examples of power sources used for railway transport. Generally speaking, the efficiency of steam power and internal combustion power is much lower than that of electricity. Therefore, to help further increase the proportion of usage of electric power by making further and better achievements gained in the electrification of the railway lines serves as an essential demand for solidifying the material and technological foundation of the railway lines. This can increase railway transport capacity. To make further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines makes it possible to actively introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, thereby helping solidify the material and technological foundation of the railway lines. To accelerate the introduction of heavy-duty cars into the railway lines is one of the ways to increase the transport capacity by solidifying the material and technological foundation of the railway lines. When we introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, we can quickly increase the transport capacity even without laying many new railway lines. The introduction of heavy-duty cars into the railway lines will increase the capacity of railway transport, and an important condition for this is the electrification of the railway lines. If the haulage capacity of locomotives is low, they cannot properly haul heavy-duty cars. To increase the haulage capacity of locomotives, it is necessary to use electric power. From an early day on, our party has actively pushed for the electrification of the railway lines by putting forth a chuche- oriented policy to suit the actual conditions of our country, which has abundant electric power resources. Under our party's leadership, our country has already achieved great success in the electrification of the railway lines. In recent years alone, a total of 800 km of railway lines has been electrified. Therefore, the main railways lines have basically been electrified. The feeder lines have also been electrified to a considerable extent. When we electrify some still-unelectrified feeder lines and industrial lines by making further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines, we can transport more cargo more quickly with the existing transport means, thereby smoothly guaranteeing the demands for transport in the people's economy. To increase the production of electric locomotives is a high- priority demand for making further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines. Importantly, the extent railway lines have been electrified is indicated by the amount of cargo hauled by electric power, and electric locomotives are the basic means of hauling cargo in the electrified sections. Thus, when we increase the number of the electric locomotives, we can haul more cargo with electric power. Under the party's wise leadership, when more railway lines have been electrified quickly, we can haul an enormous amount of cargo with electric power if we are equipped with more electric locomotives. It is important to produce a proper mixture of various kinds of locomotives, including electric locomotives used for the railway lines that have not yet been electrified and the electric locomotives used for switching cars; as well as to give priority to producing more eight-axle electric locomotives used for hauling heavy-duty cars. When this is realized, we can further increase the scope and proportion of cargo hauled by electric power without suffering from various kinds of restrictions. What plays a vital role in electric locomotives is the electric motor for power. Electric locomotives largely depend upon the electric motor for power. Therefore, in order to quickly increase the production of electric locomotives, it is necessary to give firm priority to the production of highly efficient electric motors. One of the important factors to make further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines is to increase the supply of electricity to the electrified railway line sections in conformity with the practical demands. At the moment, heavy-duty cars, such as the eight-axle electric locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars, are being widely introduced into railway transport in accordance with the policy of introducing heavy-duty cars into the railway lines; and a struggle to have each car haul more cargo than the haulage draft is being vigorously staged under the flame of "the 5.18 no-accident, on-time, traction- standard-surpassing movement." This reality demands eagerly that the supply of electricity be further increased. To this end, it is necessary to actively push ahead with the construction of new intermediary electric power substations between the operating sections of the heavy-duty cars, while mapping out a series of technological countermeasures to increase the capacity of the existing electricity supply facilities. The work of electrifying some still-unelectrified lines should be accelerated. What is important here is to map out a detailed, concrete plan to implement a correct priority order, and to implement the plan in a useful fashion through the finish-one-by-one method. The success of completing the electrification of some still- unelectrified lines largely depends upon how to lay more tracks and set up electric poles. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the technological guidance in a substantive way so as to help work out a wonderful design for this and carry out the work in accordance with the demands of the technical regulations and the standard manufacturing procedure. In particular, it is necessary to work out a measure to secure railway tracks and electric poles in a foresighted way and pay special attention to preventing corrosion of structures caused by the electric field. The work to make further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines can successfully be carried out only with the vigorous support from various sectors of the people's economy. The metal industry is the sector that takes the biggest share in this support. When this sector provides, in a timely fashion, sufficient supply of various metal materials, including copper wiring, aluminum wire, silicon steel sheet, and rolled steel, according to the kind, quality, and gauges of those materials, we can increase the production of electric locomotives, increase the capability of electricity supply, and quickly push ahead with the laying of new electric railway tracks. To make further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines is one of the important tasks which should be carried out in smoothly solving problems in transport to suit the practical demands for thoroughly carrying through the party's revolutionary economic strategy. The railway transport sector should achieve innovations in making further and better achievements in the electrification of the railway lines with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, thereby more smoothly guaranteeing the growing demands for transport and making active contributions to the implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy.
