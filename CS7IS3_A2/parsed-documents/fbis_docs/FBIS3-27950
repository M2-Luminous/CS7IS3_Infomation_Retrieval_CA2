However, the crack in the party caused by a confrontation between those who are eager to change the electoral system and those taking a cautious attitude cannot be repaired. At an LDP General Council meeting and at meetings of each faction within the party held on 29 January, members taking a cautious stance increasingly criticized LDP executives and advocates of political reform for the agreement reached between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono at their summit meeting. It is expected that LDP executives led by President Kono -- who attach more importance to the views of those eager for political reform and made the decision "to enact the political reform bills" -- will be forced to face difficulties managing the party because there is still the possibility of a split. Meanwhile, they will also be required to make efforts to promote "harmony within the party." Although the agreement reached at the summit meeting was eventually approved by the LDP General Council, members who are cautious about political reform voiced their dissatisfaction with the agreement, saying: "Party executives should have listened to the opinions of other party members before reaching the agreement" and "if it respects the results of a House of Councillors vote, the party should have made the decision to kill the bills without fearing the people's criticism." At the respective meeting of the Obuchi and Miyazawa factions, harsh criticism was leveled at the fact that some political reform advocates conducted a signature-collecting campaign in an attempt to have the government-proposed bills adopted at the Diet and to then leave the party. Hiromu Nonaka said: "The major factor that has led to confusion within the party is the fact that some advocates of political reform -- who were thinking about leaving the party -- hold important positions." Meanwhile, Katsuhiko Shirakawa said: "Some members said they might leave the party, thus creating a stir within it. I am tired of the decisionmaking process managed by those members." In this way, voices calling for a personnel reshuffle were heard at the meetings. Among groups which called for giving priority to enacting a bill designed to prevent political corruption, a move surfaced aimed at pressing President Kono to step down following legislation of the political reform bills, and calling for party renovation. Ishihara Shintaro and other members who opposed passage of the bills intentionally failed to attend the plenary session of the House of Representatives wherein a vote on the political reform bills was taken. As a future move, they intend to strengthen their stand of criticizing the LDP leadership led by President Kono. For that reason, therefore, indications are that after passage of the political reform bills, such internal confrontation will have a negative impact on intra-party debates over how to deal with the new electoral system, and the possible formation of an alliance with other parties in order to regain power.
