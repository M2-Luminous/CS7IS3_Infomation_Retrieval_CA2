A caller purporting to be a member of the Azanian National Liberation Army [Azanla], armed wing of the Black Consciousness Movement of Azania, told SAPA in a telephone call on Friday that his movement had been responsible for the attack on the pub in which four people died. Earlier, a man claiming to be a member of Azanian Peoples' Liberation Army [APLA] telephoned SAPA and said the Pan Africanist Congress' armed wing was responsible for the attack. "They (APLA) must not claim responsibility for things they did not do," the purported Azanla caller said from a payphone. The man said he was calling from the southern Cape town of George. He identified himself as "Mobutu", the same name given by a caller who on Thursday telephoned various news organisations to claim responsibility for an explosion which damaged a block of flats in Port Elizabeth's Swartkops industrial area shortly after midnight on Tuesday. There were no injuries in that incident. Shortly after the Tuesday blast, police found large amounts of explosives in several places at a block of flats in Algoa Park, about 15km from Swartkops. Officers said at the time police were investigating a possible link between the blast and the explosives seized. The "Mobutu" caller told SAPA on Thursday the sabotage was part of Azanla's campaign for the complete liberation of all Azanians. "The struggle will continue until we are all free." There was no way on Friday of independently confirming the caller was from Azanla.
